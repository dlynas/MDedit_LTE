	You're probably not looking for classic literature like "Reform or Revolution" that he brings up, so often. More contemporary works I know he's brought up are like Chomsky's "Manufacturing Consent." I think he recently mentioned "Bullshit Jobs" by David Graeber, but I might be misremembering.

		Thanks, what are some of the classical literature he brings up?

			Everyone should read Capital at some point. It can be a difficult read though, so you could use a reading guide. David Harvey has an [excellent series on youtube. ](https://youtube.com/@readingcapital?si=5m6D1gNnrhPYkVY0)
			
			Also read The State and Revolution.

				David Harvey is an interesting guy because he’s done a lot of ground work in making Capital accessible but in doing so he also denies some of Marx’s core foundational theories.

					How so? First time even hearing about this guy

						I think for me to explain where he exactly disagrees and how I would have to write a thesis lol, but in short he fundamentally disagrees with Marx's Theory of Value and rejects Marx's Law of the Tendency of the Rate of Profit to Fall (some people also refer to the latter as Marx's Theory of Crisis, because it was how he explained economic crises occurring under Capitalism). He does this by basically reinterpreting Marx into saying something different to what he actually wrote down in order to support his own position (which is an unfortunately common thing that Marxists do with dead Marxists in general).
						
						For example, he effectively views Marx and David Ricardo (a neoclassical economist) having a Labour Theory of Value which is broadly interchangeable, with the exception of Marx's extremely major innovation of the theory of Abstract Labour, which Harvey mentions but never really considers, and then he basically argues that neoclassical Labour Theories of Value as put forward by Adam Smith, Benjamin Franklin, Ricardo etc. are all discredited, therefore Marx's theory lacks credibility regardless of how different Marx said his theory was from the neoclassical theories, and therefore Marx must be reinterpreted.
						
						The Theory of Value and the Law of the Tendency of the Rate of Profit to Fall are basically central aspects of the Capital book series. In particular, Marx considered it impossible to have any meaningful understanding of what he lays out in the books unless someone first understood his theory of abstract labour, which is why he starts with explaining it in Chapter 1 of Vol. I - which is where most people fail because it is horrendously boring in part due to its repetition. As a side point, Capital was written for illiterate workers to understand - so he has a lot of repetition of points in his writing in order for them to be periodically reminded during a reading session where someone literate is reading to them - it just makes for awful reading if you're not in that category lol. This is also why Harvey's lectures on Capital are so useful - it provides some external drive and stimuli separate to your own intrinsic drive to push through it.
						
						In any case, if your mission is to set out to challenge the dominant interpretations of it that have prevailed amongst Marxists since the books were first written, as it is with David Harvey, then it's just something to keep in mind when using him as a means to introduce someone to Marxist economics, in particular his Capital series that he is most known for. That doesn't make him wrong, mind you, but if someone's goal is to broaden and deepen their understanding then they should be aware that Harvey's perspective isn't prevailing understanding of Marx. He is quite literally a revisionist. And just as a note, just because Harvey is challenging the dominant interpretation of Marx's theories, it doesn't meant that other Marxist economists (like Rosa Luxemburg) haven't challenged Marx's theories in of themselves. I'm not saying any of my points above as means to discourage or discredit people from learning more about anything.
						
						There are more orthodox Marxist Economists like Michael Roberts who I would highly recommend, and he often takes up David Harvey's theories directly. But his writing is also a lot harder to get into than the David Harvey lectures, so he's not someone I recommend to a person who already isn't really interested in economics to a point where they're looking into economic theory and empirical research, and honestly I think the Harvey lectures don't lead people so dramatically "astray" that I wouldn't recommend him to someone trying to get an introduction.

			Sorry, the only one I have on the top of my head is "Reform or Revolution" by Luxembourg .

				Kropotkin is worthwhile, though i doubt Hasan fucks with him now. He's an OG Anarchist which is generally an ideology Hasan seems less inclined towards. But i don't know to be honest.
				
				Bakunin was another controversial but interesting thinker.

	Idk any other Hasan recs, but check out

	- Blackshirts and Reds by Michael Parenti

	- Shock Doctrine by Naomi Klein

	* 🟨 **[zxlkho](https://www.reddit.com/user/zxlkho)** ⬆️ 6 _(2024-02-15 08:15:54)_

		The Shock Doctrine is one of the most important books in the last 25 years. Everyone should read it.
		
		I would also recommend The Reactionary Mind by Corey Robin

	* 🟨 **[belikeche1965](https://www.reddit.com/user/belikeche1965)** ⬆️ 4 _(2024-02-15 18:05:47)_

		He has recommended both of these btw.
		Also plays parts of yellow Parenti from time to time

* 🟩 **[RitoChicken](https://www.reddit.com/user/RitoChicken)** ⬆️ 13 _(2024-02-15 07:15:28)_

	Some years ago (maybe in 2020/2021) when a chatter asked Hasan where to start in regards to reading, he reccomended "Manufacturing Consent" by Herman and Chomsky as good place to start. I 100% agree. Reading Manufacturing Consent changed the way I view media in its entirety. It was eye-opening.

	* 🟨 **[Rychord_](https://www.reddit.com/user/Rychord_)** ⬆️ 7 _(2024-02-15 08:46:31)_

		Couldn’t agree more! I read this at the end of high school (20+ years ago now damn I’m old) and it has informed the way I digest information ever since.

	* 🟨 **[kamuran1998](https://www.reddit.com/user/kamuran1998)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-02-15 10:01:22)_

		I couldn’t get through it lol, it made me so angry

* 🟩 **[BurnOut214](https://www.reddit.com/user/BurnOut214)** ⬆️ 9 _(2024-02-15 14:11:00)_

	He put me on *Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism* by Lenin

	Edit: He used to have *Capital in the 21st Century* by Thomas Piketty on his desk in old streams

* 🟩 **[Dark_Day________](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dark_Day________)** ⬆️ 5 _(2024-02-15 10:44:58)_

	It kicked my ass, but Orientalism by Edward Said is next-level. But yeah, sometimes it makes me full dumb. He has other books that are less dense.

	Robert Fisk - The Great War for Civilization.. i think he has critics on the left but this tomb opened my eyes to so much about North Africa, the Middle East, and Western imperialism.

	Don't know if Hasan has mentioned these tbh

* 🟩 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 10 _(2024-02-15 09:34:01)_

	Not sure about Hasan’s personal recommendations, but for some general leftist reading I’ve been using the Michael Brooks (rest in power) list on Goodreads. They also have a majority report group with a few different lists you could look through.

* 🟩 **[Dexter011001](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dexter011001)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-02-15 10:39:40)_

	[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/sw/index.htm](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/sw/index.htm) 

	My personal recommendations:

	\- Communist Manifesto for a general introduction to Marxist ideas

	\- German Ideology to have an understanding of how to analyse history in a dialectical materialist lens as well as a general critique of capitalism

	\- Critique of the Gotha Program for a vision of what abolishing capitalism might look like

	\- Capital Volume 1 , Chapter 1 : Contains the essential and more in-depth critique of the capitalist system

	&amp;#x200B;

	Remember, reading and understanding leftist theory is hard, because leftists are trying to understand the reality that we live and reality is very complicated.

* 🟩 **[DarkUmbra90](https://www.reddit.com/user/DarkUmbra90)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-02-15 11:57:33)_

	I'm starting my leftist reading journey so Ima check out these books but a good one is also: Freedom Is A Constant Struggle - Angela Davis

	Ilan Pappe, Marc Lamont Hill are also great.

* 🟩 **[MABfan11](https://www.reddit.com/user/MABfan11)** ⬆️ 7 _(2024-02-15 09:47:20)_

	One Piece

* 🟩 **[splash489](https://www.reddit.com/user/splash489)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-02-15 09:27:28)_

	Adding from other comments here to my reading list.

	The majority report has had some great contemporary authors on this week and I’ve peaked into their stuff. If you sub to them on YouTube you can speed through interviews to see if the subjects interest you.

	From this past week:

	- The ends of freedom by Mark Paul

	- Rust Belt Union Blues by Lainey Newman

* 🟩 **[belikeche1965](https://www.reddit.com/user/belikeche1965)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-02-15 18:10:30)_

	If you have any trouble with Kapital, reading capital with comrades on Spotify did a great job making it easier to digest.

* 🟩 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-02-15 19:07:14)_

	Wretched of the Earth

	Eurocentrism in the Communist Movement

	Red skin white masks

* 🟩 **[On3_Up](https://www.reddit.com/user/On3_Up) (OP)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-02-15 20:27:57)_

	Thanks everyone for the recommendations! I have so many books to go through now. If you have any more please keep them coming, I really appreciate the community for helping me out here.

* 🟩 **[MadMarx__](https://www.reddit.com/user/MadMarx__)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-02-15 09:06:00)_

	If you’re looking for old easy reads then I recommend  Value, Price, and Profit by Marx and Socialism Made Easy by Connolly, and Kautsky’s Road to Power (which is a good companion to Luxemburg’s Reform and Revolution), just off the top of my head. There are some reasonably accessible modern theoretical publications like [Rupture](https://rupture.ie), which I think are a good all around read.

* 🟩 **[DrSillyBitchez](https://www.reddit.com/user/DrSillyBitchez)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-02-15 10:08:10)_

	If you’re looking for analysis on how our country became so right wing the books by Rick Perlstein starting with Before The Storm about Barry Goldwater and Nixonland, Invisible Bridge, and Reaganland are a great series about our history and the right wing from a left focused lense. I heard Matt from Majority Report recommend them and they were all fantastic. You could also check out Ryan Grimm’s books and David Dayen
