## I'm looking for games with great simulated economies

> By economies, I mean -- I want the quality feeling of really starting a business and dominating a market.  Your suggestion can be as abstract as you want it to be.  
>

> I know mmos are probably going to be the top suggestion, and that's perfectly fine -- know that I'm just not \*really\* looking for that.  PvP economic stuff is fun, and I appreciate those recommendations -- but I mostly want a single player simulated economic experience.

	check out Capitalism Lab (it isn't on steam) the best economy sim out there if you're looking for a single player game, used by universities and schools to teach how to run a company, and GDP and inflation works, and more.  

	Also mandatory EVE Online suggestion because it's the closest you can find to a real economy in a game.

		Capitalism Lab is a fun game but I don't know how good of a simulation it is. I don't know what it's like today, but I bought Capitalism 2 when it first came out and played it to death for several years. Then in 2014 or so I downloaded played Capitalism Lab (which is based on Capitalism 2) and in the forums learned that it has some hard coded predictions that were still there in 2014.
		
		For example, if you try to sell cigars and cigarettes in your stores, within a year, your stores start tanking. This is because the developer was sure nobody would be smoking by 2005. But there's nothing in-game to hint at this, so it just looks like a bug and it makes the player wonder what other hard coded hidden predictions are in there. It also looks a little silly when you can dump millions into R&amp;D for things like CRT televisions and turn a profit. 
		
		Also, the best way to make money is R&amp;Ding cough syrup. The customers that live in Capitalism Lab really love good cough syrup. Or the developer was predicting that people in the future would really, really need cough syrup.
		
		Also, if you wanted your stores to become hugely popular fast, all you had to do was have a penny sale for the first month or two where you sell everything for a penny. Which may or may not work in the real world.
		
		So, it's not a natural simulation since the developer made predictions in 1999 on what will and what won't sell in the future and this is hidden and hard coded in game and you have to guess these predictions to avoid pit falls.

			Longtime CapLab player here. Notwithstanding the tobacco sales, much has been added to the game. There is now banking and insurance companies, service companies got added very recently, internet and software companies, political simulation and a very good modding community. 
			
			Nowhere near exhaustive but looking back to 2014 the game has REALLY expanded since then. That said if you didn’t like the original then you probably won’t enjoy it despite its additions.

				I loved the original. It was a lot of fun to play. One of my favorite things was setting up the logistics of producing and warehousing products and getting them to stores. It was fun buying and selling properties and becoming the richest person in the world.  It's just a shame that the core simulation is so meh. It's more SimCity 2000 than Cities: Skylines.

			Please be informed that the game data that drives the product demand simulation are now fully viewable in the Capitalism Lab mod kit and you can customize them if you want. So the issues you mentioned no longer happen in Capitalism Lab. 
  
			
			
			For more details, please see:
  
			[https://www.capitalismlab.com/mod/advanced-modding/advanced-modding-products/](https://www.capitalismlab.com/mod/advanced-modding/advanced-modding-products/)
  
			
			
			You can view the OBSOLETE field which determines whether a product's demand will decrease over time. So there are no secrets or whatsoever behind the simulation. 
  
			
			
			If you have any other questions, please feel free to let us know.

				Yeah that's not how many people see it. It's an ugly habit that is unattractive, and the areas where smokers hang out are always the nastiest places on the grounds.

		a quick look at Capitalism Lab looks like it's a bit like Sim City but with less city building and more business simulation.  That might be EXACTLY what I'm looking for.

	Some good recommendations already, i'll add [X4 foundations](https://store.steampowered.com/app/392160/X4_Foundations/) to the list. From the steam page:

	>One of the key selling points of X games has always been the realistic, simulated economy. Wares produced by hundreds of stations and transported by thousands of ships are actually traded by NPCs and prices develop based on this simulated economy. This is the foundation of our living and breathing universe. Now with X4, we have taken another, massive step. For the first time in any X game, all parts of the NPC economy are manufactured from resources. Ships, weapons, upgrades, ammo and even stations. You name it. Everything comes out of the simulated economy.

	This in combination with you being able to build your own goods producing stations allows you to exploit gaps in production to massively profit.

		+1 for x4. Brilliant game for a ton of reasons, but the economy is a really big part of it. Highly recommended for sure. Bit of a learning curve though (of course)

	Late to the party but Merchant of the Six Kingdoms is a first person traveling merchant game that involves bartering and haggling. I made the game myself actually, because as far as I could see no other game actually had bartering, and I wanted to something where any item could be traded for anything and no items have set values but instead it depends on a dozen factors like who, where, what, when, etc. I hope you'll find it unique in the econ game genre.

	Victoria 3. Dominating markets is pretty much what it's all about, albeit on a larger scale than what you would have expected.

	Basically you lead any country of your choice through the industrialization era. You build factories, farms, mines, try to keep prices for goods low and demand high. While you research new techonogies, your neighbors of course are interested in your resources too and may try to take them from you. And... there may always be turmoil within. The 19th and early 20th century was the time of warring ideologies after all.

	So shape your society, build up the industry intelligently and you'll amass quite the wealth. But, as with every paradox game, the learning curve can be steep. If you take wrong decisions, you may well end up in a downwards spiral. Luckily, banruptcy can be recovered from, but be prepared that your finances go like [this](https://imgur.com/a/EJbzif3) when you mess up.

		The reviews seem mediocre and the price is high, is it worth it?

		* 🟧 **[PzKpfwIIIAusfL](https://www.reddit.com/user/PzKpfwIIIAusfL)** ⬆️ 8 _(2023-01-23 13:11:00)_

			From my point of view and experience, yes. The initial price is quite high and there *will* be DLCs in the future, but you'll get hundreds, if not thousands of hours of gameplay out of paradox strategy games.
			
			I myself have only played about 50 hours yet, but I definitely see this as one of the more enjoyable paradox 4X titles for several reasons.
			
			My probably most controversial take:
			
			War used to be micromanagement hell, especially in the Europa Universalis and Crusader Kings series. Victoria II used a similar army and troop system, but the current title managed to get rid of this mess and made a system which has often been criticized because you as the player have less influence on the battles themselves. Historically speaking (and for gameplay reasons) I definitely like this change as a Tsar Nicholas definitely didn't command individual regiments and battalions. He assigned the troops and commanders and told them roughly what to do.
			He had to focus on the actual governing (which in his case didn't go too smoothly either).
			
			To come back to the question:
			In the end, you can always wait a bit until the price goes down in a sale. I definitely understand how hard it is to spend so much money on a game and I definitely don't do it often. This might well be the first time I ever bought an AAA title on release.
			
			If you're unsure if you enjoy the game, it's always a good idea to check up on r/victoria3 and maybe pick up some YouTube reviews from games magazines. This type of game definitely isn't for everyone and blindly dumping over 50$ into it can definitely lead to frustration and regrets.

	Starsector. You can become a smuggler/trader, and the price if various trade goods across the galaxy is simulated live. Sell a bunch of X goods to Y planet, demand will go down and the price they're willing to buy those goods at will drop. Etc. You can genuinely build an interstellar trade network.

	EVE Online is definitely known for the complex economy.  It's less of what you are looking for since it's MMO.  I always thought the description of "spreadsheet in space" was pretty accurate.

	Lesser known and maybe not "great", there was a game called War Inc (1997, [Moby](https://www.mobygames.com/game/war-inc)) that was fun.  I recall it being RTS, but with a stock market component.  May be fun to switch it up.

		Not really -- there a lot of great suggestions worth trying in this thread on a whole.  I'm not sure the game I'm looking for exists.   
		
		
		The only one I ended up trying was Offworld Trading Company -- but it was not what I thought it was going to be.   It's good for what it is, but it's more of an multiplayer RTS without troops, and using "economic" style warfare.   It's more of a fancy board game than anything else.  Fun, for sure, but not what I was looking for.  
		
		
		My life has been busy and I haven't had time to play much, so I've just been playing Crusader Kings 3 when I have the time.

	Found this thread as I was looking for some economy-focused games myself, and was surprised that no one mentioned the Patrician and Port Royale series. They are both pretty economy-centered.

	In the beginning its more about trading, but later on you start producing your own goods, you can buy out competitors, create shortages, etc.

	Also, an oldie but goodie - Trade Empires.

	maybe dwarf fortress? you can theme your entire fort around exporting whatever you want, including but not limited to, high quality furnature with gems or metal to decorate it, high quality weapons/armor, soaps and medical equipment, high quality food dishes, exotic animals, bee products, silk clothing, and MUCH more. most of the fun (at least in this sector of the game) comes from the usually in depth creation of these goods, for example mining the ore and gems for the furnature, smelting the ores down and cutting the gems, creating the furnature, then decorating it with gems or metals, and finally getting it to the traders and selling it. that may be what you're looking for or maybe not but I think its very enjoyable

	There are no better suggestions than EVE and Albion. They are the two best player driven economy MMOs.

		Yeah. I really loved EVE back in the day, but I don't have the time to play to justify the monthly cost, and unless something's changed the free alpha program just felt too limiting for the kind of things that I found to be fun.
		
		Maybe I should just to back and screw around with a free account and see what's changed, I dunno.
		
		I've found a few "single-player EVE" type games but for the most part they don't scratch that itch of knowing that the thing I'm selling is being bought and used by an actual player and the market forces influencing prices are an actual thing.

			Alpha is very intentionally limiting, and that's a good thing. You should check it out again for sure though. Lots of cool shit. If the cost is the true roadblock, there are definitely ways to subscribe numerous accounts via in game play, though that shifts EVE very much into second or even first job territory. 
			
			There are a handful of single player things that are cool, but I agree, the real impact of winning and losing is most felt when you know you're winning or losing against other players

				>If the cost is the true roadblock, there are definitely ways to subscribe numerous accounts via in game play, though that shifts EVE very much into second or even first job territory.
				
				Yeah that's exactly the thing. I only have between 4 to 8 hours a week to play a game, and that makes a monthly subscription very expensive on a cost-per-hour basis compared to a game I pay for once and then just nibble away at over time.
				
				Making EVE a second job so I can pay for it from within is right out of the question. :P
				
				But yeah I'm at a bit of a loss for what to play these days so I may dust off my old account and give the Alpha account thing another try. It's been a while.

	I am creating a society sim that has economy within it.  Here is my pitch for it if you are interested.

	>Imagine a city builder where you don't construct buildings but construct society itself. In this innovative government simulation game, players act as omnipotent rulers, setting the laws and policies that guide a civilization's development from the Stone Age to the modern era and beyond. Your decisions shape the evolution of your society as it autonomously builds, progresses, and reacts to the challenges you set, from natural disasters to economic crises. Analyze the impact of your governance through detailed reports and watch your civilization advance through the ages based on the rules you dictate. This game offers a unique blend of strategy, simulation, and deep historical exploration, appealing to fans of complex management and societal development games.

	To expand on that a bit, it has a rewind system that creates checkpoints that you can rewind to any time you make a major decision, you can view your web of decisions and the detailed reports within each node.  You can also save out your decision tree to use as a template for future plays if you find a good mix.  Your ultimate goal is to shape the perfect society.  I want to have both large and small scale multiplayer at some point but that would require quite a bit of external funding as it would essentially become a massive version of those tile based mobile games but of much higher quality levels.  For small scale multiplayer that would be simpler as each player would be a tile on the global map that contains their society, and the host sets the time scale, other players can request increases or decreases to the time scale.  This multiplayer update would add PVP wars as well so your two societies can fight over resources on other tiles or direct assaults on your core society tile.  I have loads of other plans and small details but I don't want to give it all away.

	I know you said mostly want a single player simulated experience, but for others who are interested, Diablo 2 resurrected and then doing online trading in game or through a discord server or something is a pretty fun experience if you’re into that kind of thing. Especially if you wait until the start of a new ladder so it resets and you can ride the economy as it develops, first trading leveling gear, then p gems, then low runes, then mid-high uniques, then keys, then high uniques and torches / annihilus charms, then high runes.

	It’s fun stuff

* 🟩 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 0 _(2023-01-23 21:28:19)_

	it's not building a business but real time strategy war game Age of Empires 2 Definitive Edition has the best economy gameplay.

	All resources Food, Wood, Gold and stone are limited and will run out eventually. You will need to expand and fight to control resources. theres trade through marketplace you can gift pay tribute to other players/ai setup trade routes. there are relics you can capture to gain passive gold income. everything is about resources to build enough army to protect yourself getting more resources and expanding further on the map. it's also about investing as little as you can get away with into militairy so you can research more techology to increase resource output and increasy army strength.

	You have to make choices like am I gonna invest into research to get more resources later or use what i have now to invest in army to protect self or attack to enemy.

				However, the dialogue in Like a Dragon is so terrible, and so utterly cringy that I had to stop playing.  I just couldn't do it.

	It's not as active as it use to be. But I always enjoyed puzzle Pirates. 

	I wish they had a game just like that but with out the puzzles. They could do the whole game with bots, but it's a MMO so it would effect the play style. 

	You form a a crew then you do different type of ship activities. You get itno ship battles then get loot. The loot you can sell at different islands for money. Then the people who buy the supplies can make items with them. You can make ships with different buildings material. You can make cannon balls to shoot the ships. Then you need to make rum to feed your crew. You can also make weapons for the ship fights to make you a better fighter. You can also take over island and increase or decrease taxes from the shops. The tax money is basically used to pay others to help defend your island.

		Woah this is crazy, I didn't think I'd see this game mentioned in such an old post. I JUST came off of the steam page of this game and was googling best economy games after seeing it. Are you still playing it and if so how is it? It's exactly what I love. Economy and space. But I heard you need a subscription to really do anything and the fact that it's real time for everything really killed my hype

		* 🟧 **[vollspasst21](https://www.reddit.com/user/vollspasst21)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-02-23 06:58:05)_

			When you start off it's more of a check in every couple hours type of game but once you progress to mid/lategame there is practically no downtime if you don't want it.
			
			Until midgame you also don't really need the subscription but it's definetly relevant later on.  
			Can definetly recommend giving it a fair shot
