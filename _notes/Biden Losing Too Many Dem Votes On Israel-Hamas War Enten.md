President **Joe Biden** is decidedly running behind former President **Donald Trump** in the latest _Wall Street Journal_ poll, which was released Tuesday night.

“As you can see here, a lot of red Donald Trump leading President Biden in six of seven swing states. Only in Wisconsin, does President Biden hold a very small lead,” began CNN anchor **John Berman**, before bringing in CNN senior data reporter **Harry Enten** to break down the numbers.

“What are you seeing underneath the numbers that might contribute to these leads for Donald Trump, particularly when it comes to support for President Biden among Democrats?” Berman asked.

“Yeah. You know, let’s take a look here. So this is his [approval](https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/trump-biden-poll-swing-states-ad594acb) among Democrats. And by Biden’s handling of a lot of different issues here: the economy, Russia, Ukraine — pretty good, right? 81 percent,” began [Enten](https://www.mediaite.com/tag/harry-enten/) with the good news.

“Jump down to foreign policy. You see this drop to 65%, gun violence 60%, US-Mexico border 58%. These are not good numbers for a Democrat amongst his own party. But look here, the Israel-Hamas War. Look at that approval rating. Less than 50% of Democrats are approving on Joe Biden on the Israel-Hamas War,” he continued, adding:

> And more than that, John, these numbers have gotten significantly worse. So this is Democrats’ views of Biden on the Israel-Hamas War. Look back in October of 2023. It was 67%. Look where we are today. 48% that disapprove.
> 
> Look at that number, jumped up from 28% in October of 2023 to 46% now. This is within the margin of error. Democrats are split on Joe Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas War. John, you know, I look at poll numbers a lot for a president to be doing this poorly amongst his own party on any issue. It’s quite something to say.

“Very unusual. The question is, will this translate to actual votes?” Berman pressed.

“Yeah. Will this translate to actual votes? All right. So let’s take a look here. This is Democrats’ choice for president. All right. If you like Biden’s handling of the Israel-hamas war, look here Joe Biden 94%, Donald Trump 2%. That’s about what you would expect to see, right? A very large lead for the Democratic candidate, maybe just a few Democratic voters going the other direction. But take a look here. If you dislike Biden on the Israel-Hamas War, look, Joe Biden still getting the lion’s share of these voters at 81%. But this is a significant chunk of Democratic voters who are going in the other direction, 15%. So what essentially we’re looking at here is a 66-point margin versus look here, a 92-point margin,” replied Enten.

“You can’t be losing 15% of Democrats if you’re Donald, if you’re Joe Biden,” noted Berman.

“You cannot be doing that!” replied an emphatic Enten, adding:

> This type of base going in the other direction is something you can’t have, especially if you have independents who are also turning against you.

“What else are you seeing in terms of enthusiasm?” Berman asked.

“You know what else are we seeing? So vote choice is one thing, what about enthusiasm, right? Because you actually have to go out there and vote. Let’s take a look here,” began Entan before going through the numbers:

> So this is Democrats who are extremely motivated to turn out and vote in November if they like Biden on the Israel-Hamas War. 63% of those Democrats say that they are extremely motivated to turn out and vote in November. That’s equal, in fact, to the percentage of Republicans overall who say they’re extremely motivated to turnout in November. But if they dislike Biden on the Israel-Hamas War, look here just 53% of Democrats, of these Democrats are extremely motivated to vote in 2024.

> So it’s two things that are going on here, right? First off, the Democrats who don’t like Joe Biden pn the Israel-Hamas War, they’re more likely to favor Donald Trump. The second thing that’s going on here is they’re less likely to turnout. This is something, again, you point out, correlation is not always causation. But in this particular case, what we’re seeing is clear correlation. If Democrats don’t like Joe Biden’s handling on the issue of war, they’re less likely to turnout and they’re less likely to vote for Joe Biden if they do.
