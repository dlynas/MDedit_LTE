The **Peoples Temple Agricultural Project**, better known by its informal name "**Jonestown**", was a remote settlement in [Guyana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyana "Guyana") established by the [Peoples Temple](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peoples_Temple "Peoples Temple"), an American [cult](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult "Cult") under the leadership of [Jim Jones](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Jones "Jim Jones"). Jonestown became internationally infamous when, on November 18, 1978, a total of 918<sup id="cite_ref-auto_1-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-auto-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> people died at the settlement, at the nearby [airstrip](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Kaituma_Airport "Port Kaituma Airport") in [Port Kaituma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Kaituma "Port Kaituma"), and at a Temple-run building in [Georgetown](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown,_Guyana "Georgetown, Guyana"), Guyana's capital city. The name of the settlement became synonymous with the incidents at those locations.<sup id="cite_ref-off_3-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-off-3">[3]</a></sup>

The Peoples Temple Agricultural Project's places of interest in Guyana

In total 909 individuals died in Jonestown itself,<sup id="cite_ref-auto_1-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-auto-1">[1]</a></sup> all but two from apparent [cyanide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanide "Cyanide") poisoning, a significant number of whom were injected against their will, in an event termed "revolutionary suicide" by Jones and some Peoples Temple members on an audio tape of the event, and in prior recorded discussions. The poisonings in Jonestown followed the murder of five others by Temple members at Port Kaituma, including [U.S. Congressman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Congress#United_States "Member of Congress") [Leo Ryan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Ryan "Leo Ryan"), an act that Jones ordered. Four other Temple members committed [murder-suicide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder%E2%80%93suicide "Murder–suicide") in Georgetown at Jones' command.

Terms used to describe the deaths in Jonestown and Georgetown have evolved over time. Many contemporary media accounts after the events called the deaths a [mass suicide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_suicide "Mass suicide").<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> In contrast, later sources refer to the deaths with terms such as mass murder-suicide,<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> a [massacre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre "Massacre"),<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:1_8-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-:1-8">[8]</a></sup> or simply [mass murder](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_murder "Mass murder").<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> Seventy or more individuals at Jonestown were injected with poison, and a third of the victims were minors.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> Guards armed with firearms and crossbows had been ordered to shoot anyone who attempted to flee the settlement as Jones lobbied for suicide.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_8-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-:1-8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>

## Origins [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jonestown&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Origins")

The Peoples Temple was formed by Jim Jones in [Indianapolis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis,_Indiana "Indianapolis, Indiana"), [Indiana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana "Indiana"), in 1955.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> Although its roots and teachings shared more with [Christian revival](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_revival "Christian revival") movements than with [Marxism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism "Marxism"), it purported to practice what it called "[apostolic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Marks_of_the_Church#%22Apostolic%22_as_a_mark_of_the_Church "Four Marks of the Church") [socialism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism "Socialism")".<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> In doing so, the Temple preached that "those who remained drugged with the opiate of religion had to be brought to enlightenment – socialism."<sup id="cite_ref-Layton_1998_53_17-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-Layton_1998_53-17">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-q1053_18-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-q1053-18">[18]</a></sup> Jones had an interest in [Joseph Stalin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin "Joseph Stalin"), [Mao Zedong](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong "Mao Zedong"), and [Adolf Hitler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler "Adolf Hitler") from a young age, and would later frequently praise Stalin and [Vladimir Lenin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin "Vladimir Lenin") as heroes.<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> He was also upset with persecution against the [Communist Party USA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_USA "Communist Party USA") and was fascinated with the influence of religion.<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> In the early 1960s, Jones visited Guyana – then a [British colony](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Guiana "British Guiana") – while on his way to establishing a short-lived Temple mission in [Brazil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_military_dictatorship "Brazilian military dictatorship").<sup id="cite_ref-raven78_21-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-raven78-21">[21]</a></sup>

[Jim Jones](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Jones "Jim Jones"), founder of [The Peoples Temple](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peoples_Temple "Peoples Temple").

After Jones received considerable criticism in Indiana for his [integrationist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrationist "Integrationist") views, the Temple moved to [Redwood Valley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redwood_Valley,_California "Redwood Valley, California"), [California](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/California "California"), in 1965.<sup id="cite_ref-lib_vir_22-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-lib_vir-22">[22]</a></sup> In the early 1970s, the Temple opened other branches in [Los Angeles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles "Los Angeles") and [San Francisco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco "San Francisco"), and would eventually move its headquarters to San Francisco.<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup>

With the move to San Francisco came increasing political involvement by the Temple and the high levels of approval they received from the local government.<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> After the group's participation proved instrumental in the mayoral election victory of [George Moscone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Moscone "George Moscone") in 1975, Moscone appointed Jones as the Chairman of the [San Francisco Housing Authority](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Housing_Authority "San Francisco Housing Authority") Commission.<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> Increasing public support in California gave Jones access to several high-ranking political figures, including vice presidential candidate [Walter Mondale](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Mondale "Walter Mondale") and [First Lady](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States "First Lady of the United States") [Rosalynn Carter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalynn_Carter "Rosalynn Carter"). Guests at a large 1976 testimonial dinner for Jones included [Governor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California "Governor of California") [Jerry Brown](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Brown "Jerry Brown"), [Lieutenant Governor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_California "Lieutenant Governor of California") [Mervyn Dymally](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mervyn_Dymally "Mervyn Dymally"), and California Assemblyman [Willie Brown](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Brown_(politician) "Willie Brown (politician)"), among others.<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup>

## Jonestown established [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jonestown&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Jonestown established")

### Selection and establishment of Guyanese land [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jonestown&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Selection and establishment of Guyanese land")

In the fall of 1973, after critical newspaper articles by [Lester Kinsolving](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_Kinsolving "Lester Kinsolving") and the defection of eight Temple members, Jones and Temple attorney [Tim Stoen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Stoen "Tim Stoen") prepared an "immediate action" contingency plan for responding to a police or media crackdown.<sup id="cite_ref-reiterman237_27-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-reiterman237-27">[27]</a></sup> The plan listed various options, including fleeing to Canada or to a "Caribbean missionary post" such as Barbados or Trinidad.<sup id="cite_ref-reiterman237_27-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-reiterman237-27">[27]</a></sup> For its Caribbean missionary post, the Temple quickly chose Guyana, conducting research on its economy and [extradition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradition "Extradition") treaties with the US.<sup id="cite_ref-reiterman237_27-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-reiterman237-27">[27]</a></sup> In October 1973, the directors of the Temple passed a resolution to establish an agricultural mission there.<sup id="cite_ref-reiterman237_27-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-reiterman237-27">[27]</a></sup>

The Temple chose Guyana, in part, because of the group's own socialist politics, which were moving further to the [left](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_left "Political left") during the selection process.<sup id="cite_ref-reiterman237_27-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-reiterman237-27">[27]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-paranoia_28-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-paranoia-28">[28]</a></sup> Former Temple member Tim Carter stated that the reasons for choosing Guyana were the Temple's view of a perceived dominance of racism and multinational corporations in the US government.<sup id="cite_ref-carter_29-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-carter-29">[29]</a></sup> According to Carter, the Temple concluded that Guyana, an English-speaking, socialist country with a government including prominent black leaders, would afford black Temple members a peaceful place to live.<sup id="cite_ref-carter_29-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-carter-29">[29]</a></sup>

Later, [Guyanese Prime Minister](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Guyana "Prime Minister of Guyana") [Forbes Burnham](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes_Burnham "Forbes Burnham") stated that Jones may have "wanted to use cooperatives as the basis for the establishment of socialism, and maybe his idea of setting up a [commune](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commune_(intentional_community) "Commune (intentional community)") meshed with that".<sup id="cite_ref-paranoia_28-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-paranoia-28">[28]</a></sup> Jones also thought that Guyana was small, poor, and independent enough for him to easily obtain influence and official protection.<sup id="cite_ref-reiterman237_27-5"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-reiterman237-27">[27]</a></sup> He was skillful in presenting the Guyanese government the benefits of allowing the Peoples Temple to establish a settlement in the country. One of the main tactics was to speak of the advantages of their American presence near Guyana's [disputed border](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyana%E2%80%93Venezuela_territorial_dispute "Guyana–Venezuela territorial dispute") with [Venezuela](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela "Venezuela"). This idea seemed promising to the Burnham government, who feared a military incursion by Venezuela.<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup>

In 1974, after traveling to an area of northwestern Guyana with Guyanese officials, Jones and the Temple negotiated a lease of over 3,800 acres (1,500 ha) of land in the jungle located 150 miles (240 km) west of the Guyanese capital of [Georgetown](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown,_Guyana "Georgetown, Guyana").<sup id="cite_ref-pbs_33-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-pbs-33">[33]</a></sup> The site, located near the disputed border with Venezuela, was isolated and had soil of low fertility.<sup id="cite_ref-raven340_34-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-raven340-34">[34]</a></sup> The nearest body of water was seven miles (eleven kilometres) away by muddy roads.<sup id="cite_ref-raven340_34-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-raven340-34">[34]</a></sup>

Houses in Jonestown

As 500 members began the construction of Jonestown, the Temple encouraged more to relocate to the settlement.<sup id="cite_ref-walliss_35-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-walliss-35">[35]</a></sup> Jones saw Jonestown as both a "socialist paradise" and a "sanctuary" from media scrutiny.<sup id="cite_ref-hall293_36-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-hall293-36">[36]</a></sup> In 1976, Guyana finally approved the lease it had negotiated (retroactive to April 1974) with the Temple for the over 3,000 acres (1,200 ha) of land in northwest Guyana on which Jonestown was located.<sup id="cite_ref-raven340_34-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-raven340-34">[34]</a></sup>

In 1974, Guyanese officials granted the Temple permission to import certain items "duty free".<sup id="cite_ref-raven340_34-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-raven340-34">[34]</a></sup> Later payoffs helped safeguard shipments of firearms and drugs through Guyanese customs.<sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup>

Jones reached an agreement to guarantee that Guyana would permit Temple members' mass migration. To do so, he stated that they were "skilled and progressive", showed off an envelope he claimed contained $500,000, and stated that he would invest most of the group's assets in Guyana.<sup id="cite_ref-raven337_38-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-raven337-38">[38]</a></sup> The relatively large number of immigrants to Guyana overwhelmed the government's small but stringent immigration infrastructure in a country where immigrants had outweighed locals.<sup id="cite_ref-raven337_38-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-raven337-38">[38]</a></sup> Guyanese immigration procedures were compromised to inhibit the departure of Temple defectors and curtail the visas of Temple opponents.<sup id="cite_ref-housereport_39-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-housereport-39">[39]</a></sup>

Jonestown was held up as a benevolent [communist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism "Communism") community, with Jones stating: "I believe we're the purest communists there are."<sup id="cite_ref-q050_40-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-q050-40">[40]</a></sup> Jones' wife, Marceline, described Jonestown as "dedicated to live for socialism, total economic and racial and social equality. We are here living communally."<sup id="cite_ref-q050_40-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-q050-40">[40]</a></sup> Jones wanted to construct a model community and claimed that Burnham "couldn't rave enough about us, the wonderful things we do, the project, the model of socialism".<sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup> Jones did not permit members to leave Jonestown without his express prior permission.<sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup>

The Temple established offices in Georgetown and conducted numerous meetings with Burnham and other Guyanese officials.<sup id="cite_ref-43"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup> In 1976, Temple member Michael Prokes requested that Burnham receive Jones as a foreign dignitary along with other "high ranking US officials".<sup id="cite_ref-raven285_44-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-raven285-44">[44]</a></sup> Jones traveled to Guyana with Dymally to meet with Burnham and Foreign Affairs Minister Fred Willis.<sup id="cite_ref-raven285_44-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-raven285-44">[44]</a></sup> In that meeting, Dymally agreed to pass on the message to the [State Department](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State "United States Department of State") that socialist Guyana wanted to keep an open door to cooperation with the US.<sup id="cite_ref-raven285_44-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-raven285-44">[44]</a></sup> Dymally followed up that meeting with a letter to Burnham stating that Jones was "one of the finest human beings" and that Dymally was "tremendously impressed" by his visit to Jonestown.<sup id="cite_ref-raven285_44-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-raven285-44">[44]</a></sup>

Temple members took pains to stress their loyalty to Burnham's [People's National Congress Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_National_Congress_Reform "People's National Congress Reform").<sup id="cite_ref-45"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup> One Temple member, Paula Adams, was involved in a romantic relationship with Guyana's ambassador to the US, Laurence "Bonny" Mann.

Later, Burnham stated that Guyana allowed the Temple to operate in the manner it did on the references of Moscone, Mondale, and Rosalynn Carter.<sup id="cite_ref-moore173_48-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-moore173-48">[48]</a></sup> Burnham also said that, when Deputy Minister [Ptolemy Reid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_Reid "Ptolemy Reid") traveled to [Washington, D.C.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C. "Washington, D.C.") in September 1977 to sign the [Panama Canal Treaties](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrijos-Carter_Treaties "Torrijos-Carter Treaties"), Mondale asked him, "How's Jim?", which indicated to Reid that Mondale had a personal interest in Jones' well-being.<sup id="cite_ref-moore173_48-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-moore173-48">[48]</a></sup>

Migration to Jonestown ([Migration figures after June 1978 are not known](http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=35655), Jonestown Report)

In the summer of 1977, Jones and several hundred Temple members moved to Jonestown to escape building pressure from San Francisco media investigations.<sup id="cite_ref-layton113_49-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-layton113-49">[49]</a></sup> Jones left the same night that an editor at _New West_ magazine read him an article to be published by [Marshall Kilduff](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Kilduff "Marshall Kilduff") detailing allegations of abuse by former Temple members.<sup id="cite_ref-layton113_49-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-layton113-49">[49]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-50"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup> After the mass migration, Jonestown became overcrowded.<sup id="cite_ref-raven390_51-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-raven390-51">[51]</a></sup> Jonestown's population was slightly under 900 at its peak in 1978.

### Jonestown life after mass migration [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jonestown&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Jonestown life after mass migration")

Many members of the Temple believed that Guyana would be, as Jones promised, a paradise or [utopia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia "Utopia").<sup id="cite_ref-52"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup> After Jones arrived, however, Jonestown life significantly changed.<sup id="cite_ref-raven390_51-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-raven390-51">[51]</a></sup> Entertaining movies from Georgetown that the settlers had watched were mostly canceled in favor of [Soviet propaganda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_propaganda "Soviet propaganda") shorts and documentaries on American social problems.<sup id="cite_ref-raven390_51-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-raven390-51">[51]</a></sup>

For the first several months, Temple members worked six days a week, from approximately 6:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., with an hour for lunch.<sup id="cite_ref-53"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup> In mid-1978, after Jones' health deteriorated and his wife began managing more of Jonestown's operations, the work week was reduced to eight hours a day for five days a week.<sup id="cite_ref-carter_29-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-carter-29">[29]</a></sup> After the day's work ended, Temple members would attend several hours of activities in a pavilion, including classes on socialism.<sup id="cite_ref-Layton_1998_53_17-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-Layton_1998_53-17">[17]</a></sup>

Jones compared this schedule to the North Korean system of eight hours of daily work followed by eight hours of study.<sup id="cite_ref-54"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-55"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup> This also comported with the Temple's practice of gradually subjecting its followers to sophisticated [mind control](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_control "Mind control") and [behavior modification](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_modification "Behavior modification") techniques borrowed from [Kim Il-sung's Korea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea "North Korea") and [Mao Zedong's China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China_(1949%E2%80%9376) "History of the People's Republic of China (1949–76)").<sup id="cite_ref-raven280_56-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-raven280-56">[56]</a></sup> Jones would often read news and commentary, including items from [Radio Moscow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Moscow "Radio Moscow") and [Radio Havana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Havana "Radio Havana"),<sup id="cite_ref-manytapes_57-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-manytapes-57">[57]</a></sup> and was known to side with the Soviets over the Chinese during the [Sino-Soviet split](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Soviet_split "Sino-Soviet split").<sup id="cite_ref-58"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup>

"Discussion" about current events often took the form of Jones interrogating individual followers about the implications and subtexts of a given news item, or delivering lengthy and often confused monologues on how to "read" certain events. In addition to Soviet documentaries, political thrillers such as _[The Parallax View](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Parallax_View "The Parallax View")_, _[The Day of the Jackal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_of_the_Jackal_(film) "The Day of the Jackal (film)")_, _[State of Siege](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Siege "State of Siege")_, and _[Z](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_(1969_film) "Z (1969 film)")_ were repeatedly screened and minutely analyzed by Jones. Recordings of commune meetings show how livid and frustrated Jones would get when anyone did not find the films interesting or did not understand the message Jones was placing upon them.<sup id="cite_ref-manytapes_57-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-manytapes-57">[57]</a></sup>

The commune had a [Closed-circuit TV](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_TV "Closed-circuit TV") system, but no one could view anything in the way of film or recorded TV, no matter how innocuous or seemingly politically neutral, without a Temple staffer present to "interpret" the material for the viewers. This invariably meant damning criticisms of perceived [capitalist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism "Capitalism") propaganda in Western material, and glowing praise for and highlighting of [Marxist–Leninist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist%E2%80%93Leninist "Marxist–Leninist") messages in material from communist nations.<sup id="cite_ref-manytapes_57-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-manytapes-57">[57]</a></sup>

Jones' recorded readings of the news were part of the constant broadcasts over Jonestown's tower speakers, such that all members could hear them throughout the day and night.<sup id="cite_ref-59"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup> Jones' news readings usually portrayed the US as a "capitalist" and "imperialist" villain, while casting "socialist" leaders, such as [Kim Il Sung](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Il_Sung "Kim Il Sung"),<sup id="cite_ref-q216_60-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-q216-60">[60]</a></sup> [Robert Mugabe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe "Robert Mugabe"),<sup id="cite_ref-q322_61-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-q322-61">[61]</a></sup> and [Joseph Stalin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin "Joseph Stalin")<sup id="cite_ref-q161_62-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-q161-62">[62]</a></sup> in a positive light.

Jonestown's primary means of communication with the outside world was a [shortwave radio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortwave_radio "Shortwave radio").<sup id="cite_ref-moore292_63-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-moore292-63">[63]</a></sup> All voice communications with San Francisco and Georgetown were transmitted using this radio, from mundane supply orders to confidential Temple business.<sup id="cite_ref-moore292_63-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-moore292-63">[63]</a></sup> The [FCC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission "Federal Communications Commission") cited the Temple for technical violations and for using amateur frequencies for commercial purposes.<sup id="cite_ref-moore292_63-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-moore292-63">[63]</a></sup> Because shortwave radio was Jonestown's only effective means of non-postal communication, the Temple felt that the FCC's threats to revoke its operators' licenses threatened Jonestown's existence.<sup id="cite_ref-moore293_64-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-moore293-64">[64]</a></sup>

Because it stood on poor soil, Jonestown was not self-sufficient and had to import large quantities of commodities such as wheat.<sup id="cite_ref-hall236_65-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-hall236-65">[65]</a></sup> Temple members lived in small communal houses, some with walls woven from [Troolie palm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manicaria_saccifera "Manicaria saccifera"), and ate meals that reportedly consisted of nothing more on some days than rice, beans, greens, and occasionally meat, sauce, and eggs.<sup id="cite_ref-hall236_65-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-hall236-65">[65]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-layton_66-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-layton-66">[66]</a></sup> Despite having access to an estimated $26 million by late 1978,<sup id="cite_ref-67"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup> Jones also lived in a tiny communal house, though fewer people lived there than in other communal houses.<sup id="cite_ref-layton_66-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-layton-66">[66]</a></sup> His house reportedly held a small refrigerator containing, at times, eggs, meat, fruit, salads, and soft drinks.<sup id="cite_ref-layton_66-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-layton-66">[66]</a></sup> Medical problems, such as severe [diarrhea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea "Diarrhea") and high fevers, struck half the community in February 1978.

Although Jonestown contained no dedicated prison and no form of [capital punishment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment "Capital punishment"), various forms of punishment were used against members considered to have serious disciplinary problems. Methods included imprisonment in a 6-by-4-by-3-foot (1.8 m × 1.2 m × 0.9 m) plywood box and forcing children to spend a night at the bottom of a [well](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_well "Water well"), sometimes upside-down.<sup id="cite_ref-cnn_jones_68-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-cnn_jones-68">[68]</a></sup> This "torture hole", along with beatings, became the subject of rumor among local Guyanese.<sup id="cite_ref-69"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-69">[69]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-70"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-70">[70]</a></sup> For some members who attempted to escape, drugs such as [Thorazine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorazine "Thorazine"), [sodium pentathol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_pentathol "Sodium pentathol"), [chloral hydrate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloral_hydrate "Chloral hydrate"), [Demerol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demerol "Demerol"), and [Valium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valium "Valium") were administered in an "extended care unit".<sup id="cite_ref-71"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-72"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-72">[72]</a></sup> Armed guards patrolled the area day and night to enforce Jonestown's rules.

Children were generally surrendered to communal care, and at times were only allowed to see their biological parents briefly at night. Jones was called "Father" or "Dad" by both adults and children.<sup id="cite_ref-73"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-73">[73]</a></sup> The community had a nursery at which 33 infants were born.<sup id="cite_ref-reitermantimes_74-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-reitermantimes-74">[74]</a></sup>

For a year, it appears the commune was run primarily through [Social Security](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_(United_States) "Social Security (United States)") checks received by members.<sup id="cite_ref-75"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-75">[75]</a></sup> Up to $65,000 in monthly welfare payments from US government agencies to Jonestown residents were signed over to the Temple.<sup id="cite_ref-76"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-76">[76]</a></sup> In 1978, [officials from the US embassy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_diplomatic_missions_of_the_United_States "List of diplomatic missions of the United States") in Georgetown interviewed Social Security recipients on multiple occasions to make sure they were not being held against their will.<sup id="cite_ref-pear_77-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-pear-77">[77]</a></sup> None of the 75 people interviewed by the embassy stated that they were being held captive, were forced to sign over welfare checks, or wanted to leave Jonestown.<sup id="cite_ref-pear_77-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-pear-77">[77]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-78"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-78">[78]</a></sup>

### White Night and the Six Day Siege [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jonestown&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: White Night and the Six Day Siege")

Jones made frequent addresses to Temple members regarding Jonestown's safety, including statements that the [CIA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency "Central Intelligence Agency") and other intelligence agencies were conspiring with "capitalist pigs" to destroy the settlement and harm its inhabitants.<sup id="cite_ref-q322_61-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-q322-61">[61]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-83"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-83">[83]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-84"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-84">[84]</a></sup> After work, when purported emergencies arose, the Temple sometimes conducted what Jones referred to as "White Nights".<sup id="cite_ref-85"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-85">[85]</a></sup> During such events, Jones would sometimes give the Jonestown members four options: attempt to flee to the Soviet Union, commit "revolutionary suicide", stay in Jonestown and fight the purported attackers, or flee into the jungle.<sup id="cite_ref-86"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-86">[86]</a></sup>

Jones was known to regularly study [Adolf Hitler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler "Adolf Hitler") and [Father Divine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father_Divine "Father Divine") to learn how to manipulate members of the cult. Divine told Jones personally to "find an enemy" and "to make sure they know who the enemy is" as it will unify those in the group and make them subservient to him.<sup id="cite_ref-87"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-87">[87]</a></sup>

On at least two occasions during White Nights, after a "revolutionary suicide" vote was reached, a simulated [mass suicide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_suicide "Mass suicide") was rehearsed. Temple defector Deborah Layton described the event in an [affidavit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit "Affidavit"):

> Everyone, including the children, was told to line up. As we passed through the line, we were given a small glass of red liquid to drink. We were told that the liquid contained poison and that we would die within 45 minutes. We all did as we were told. When the time came when we should have dropped dead, Rev. Jones explained that the poison was not real and that we had just been through a loyalty test. He warned us that the time was not far off when it would become necessary for us to die by our own hands.<sup id="cite_ref-laytonaff_88-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-laytonaff-88">[88]</a></sup>

The Temple had received monthly half-pound shipments of [cyanide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanide "Cyanide") since 1976 after Jones obtained a jeweler's license to buy the chemical, purportedly to clean gold.<sup id="cite_ref-89"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-89">[89]</a></sup> In May 1978, a Temple doctor wrote a memo to Jones asking permission to test cyanide on Jonestown's pigs, as their [metabolism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism "Metabolism") was close to that of human beings.<sup id="cite_ref-90"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-90">[90]</a></sup>

Jones' paranoia and drug usage increased in Jonestown as he became fearful of a government raid on the commune, citing concerns that the community would not be able to resist an attack.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEReitermanJacobs1982390_91-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-FOOTNOTEReitermanJacobs1982390-91">[91]</a></sup> Jones would call "Alert, Alert, Alert" over the community loudspeaker to call the community together in the central pavilion. Armed guards with guns and crossbows surrounded the pavilion.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEReitermanJacobs1982390_91-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-FOOTNOTEReitermanJacobs1982390-91">[91]</a></sup> One drill lasted for six days. Known as 'the Six Day Siege', this ordeal was used thereafter by Jones as a symbol of the community's indomitable spirit. For days on end, frightened townsfolk ringed the commune, armed with machetes and whatever crude tools would serve as weapons. Surrounding them, Jones claimed, were mercenaries bent on murder, as well as the abduction of Jones' son John Victor Stoen and others. Jones' wife and others outside of the commune engaged in interminable shortwave radio conversations with Jones, seeking to dissuade him from ordering a mass suicide. The panic reached such a point that an ad hoc evacuation was ordered by Jones, with dozens of townsfolk hastily loaded onto boats on the George River. The destination of this exodus was Cuba. Several people fell into the river, suffering injuries. At last, Jones bowed to pressure, and the drill ended. Veterans of the 'Siege' were held in high regard in Jonestown, and in numerous addresses Jones tearfully recalled their stoic courage on the 'front line.'<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEReitermanJacobs1982390_91-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-FOOTNOTEReitermanJacobs1982390-91">[91]</a></sup>

### Stoen custody dispute [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jonestown&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Stoen custody dispute")

In September 1977, former Temple members Tim and Grace Stoen battled in a Georgetown court to produce an order for the Temple to show cause why a final order should not be issued returning their five-year-old son, John.<sup id="cite_ref-92"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-92">[92]</a></sup> A few days later, a second order was issued for John to be taken into protective custody by authorities.<sup id="cite_ref-93"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-93">[93]</a></sup> The fear of being held in [contempt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_court "Contempt of court") of the orders caused Jones to set up a false sniper attack upon himself and begin his first series of White Nights, called the "Six Day Siege". During the Siege, Jones spoke to Temple members about attacks from outsiders and had them surround Jonestown with guns and machetes.<sup id="cite_ref-94"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-94">[94]</a></sup>

The rallies took an almost surreal tone as black activists [Angela Davis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Davis "Angela Davis") and [Huey Newton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huey_Newton "Huey Newton") communicated via radio-telephone to the Jonestown crowd, urging them to hold strong against the "conspiracy".<sup id="cite_ref-95"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-95">[95]</a></sup> Jones made radio broadcasts stating "we will die unless we are granted freedom from harassment and [asylum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum "Right of asylum")."<sup id="cite_ref-96"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-96">[96]</a></sup> Deputy Minister Reid finally assured Marceline Jones that the [Guyana Defence Force](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyana_Defence_Force "Guyana Defence Force") would not invade Jonestown.<sup id="cite_ref-97"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-97">[97]</a></sup>

### Exploring another potential exodus [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jonestown&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Exploring another potential exodus")

After the Six Day Siege, Jones no longer believed the Guyanese could be trusted.<sup id="cite_ref-raven371_98-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-raven371-98">[98]</a></sup> He directed Temple members to write to over a dozen foreign governments inquiring about immigration policies relevant to another exodus by the Temple.<sup id="cite_ref-raven371_98-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-raven371-98">[98]</a></sup> He also wrote to the State Department, inquiring about North Korea and [Albania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_People%27s_Republic_of_Albania "Socialist People's Republic of Albania"), then enduring the [Sino-Albanian split](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Albanian_split "Sino-Albanian split").<sup id="cite_ref-raven371_98-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-raven371-98">[98]</a></sup>

In Georgetown, the Peoples Temple conducted frequent meetings with the embassies of the Soviet Union, North Korea, [Yugoslavia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia "Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia"), and [Cuba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba "Cuba").<sup id="cite_ref-moore165_99-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-moore165-99">[99]</a></sup> Negotiations with the Soviet embassy included extensive discussions of possible resettlement there.

Sharon Amos, Michael Prokes, Matthew Blunt, Timothy Regan,<sup id="cite_ref-100"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-100">[100]</a></sup> and other Temple members took active roles in the "Guyana-Korea Friendship Society", which sponsored two seminars on the revolutionary concepts of Kim Il Sung.<sup id="cite_ref-101"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-101">[101]</a></sup> In April 1978, a high-ranking correspondent of Soviet news agency [TASS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TASS "TASS") and his wife visited Jim Jones.<sup id="cite_ref-102"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-102">[102]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-103"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-103">[103]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-104"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-104">[104]</a></sup>

Although Jones, his executive partners, and congregation voiced their thoughts about moving their operation to the Soviet Union, Jones had a change of heart.

On 2 October 1978, Feodor Timofeyev, [consul](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consul_(representative) "Consul (representative)") for the Soviet Union in Georgetown, visited Jonestown for two days and gave a speech.<sup id="cite_ref-q352_106-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-q352-106">[106]</a></sup> Jones stated before the speech, "For many years, we have let our sympathies be quite publicly known, that the United States government was not our mother, but that the Soviet Union was our spiritual motherland."<sup id="cite_ref-q352_106-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-q352-106">[106]</a></sup> Timofeyev opened the speech stating that the Soviet Union would like to send "our deepest and the most sincere greetings to the people of this first socialist and communist community of the United States of America, in Guyana and in the world".<sup id="cite_ref-q352_106-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-q352-106">[106]</a></sup> Both speeches were met by cheers and applause from the crowd in Jonestown.<sup id="cite_ref-q352_106-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-q352-106">[106]</a></sup> Following the visit, Temple members met almost weekly with Timofeyev to discuss a potential Soviet exodus.<sup id="cite_ref-moore165_99-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-moore165-99">[99]</a></sup>

### Concerned relatives [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jonestown&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Concerned relatives")

Meanwhile, in late 1977 and early 1978, Tim and Grace Stoen participated in meetings with other relatives of Jonestown residents at the home of [Jeannie Mills](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeannie_Mills "Jeannie Mills"), another Temple defector. Together, they called themselves the "Concerned Relatives".<sup id="cite_ref-raven408_107-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-raven408-107">[107]</a></sup> Tim Stoen engaged in letter-writing campaigns to the [US Secretary of State](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Secretary_of_State "US Secretary of State") and the Guyanese government, and traveled to Washington, D.C. to attempt to begin an investigation.<sup id="cite_ref-sims_108-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-sims-108">[108]</a></sup> In January 1978, Stoen wrote a [white paper](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_paper "White paper") to [Congress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress "United States Congress") detailing his grievances and requesting that [congressmen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Congress "Member of Congress") write to Prime Minister Burnham; 91 congressmen wrote such letters, including Congressman [Leo Ryan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Ryan "Leo Ryan").<sup id="cite_ref-raven458_109-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-raven458-109">[109]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-hall227_110-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-hall227-110">[110]</a></sup>

On 17 February 1978, Jones submitted to an interview with _[San Francisco Examiner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_San_Francisco_Examiner "The San Francisco Examiner")_ reporter [Tim Reiterman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Reiterman "Tim Reiterman").<sup id="cite_ref-111"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-111">[111]</a></sup> Reiterman's subsequent story about the Stoen custody battle prompted the immediate threat of a lawsuit by the Temple.<sup id="cite_ref-raven383_112-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-raven383-112">[112]</a></sup> The repercussions were devastating for the Temple's reputation, and made most former supporters more suspicious of the Temple's claims that it was the victim of a "rightist vendetta".<sup id="cite_ref-raven383_112-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-raven383-112">[112]</a></sup>

Still, others remained loyal. On the day after Reiterman's article was published, [Harvey Milk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Milk "Harvey Milk") – a member of the [San Francisco Board of Supervisors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Board_of_Supervisors "San Francisco Board of Supervisors") who was supported by the Temple – wrote a letter to [President](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States "President of the United States") [Jimmy Carter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter "Jimmy Carter") defending Jones "as a man of the highest character," and stating that Temple defectors were trying to "damage Rev. Jones' reputation" with "apparent bold-faced lies".<sup id="cite_ref-milk_let_113-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-milk_let-113">[113]</a></sup>

On 11 April 1978, the Concerned Relatives distributed a packet of documents, including letters and affidavits, that they titled an "Accusation of Human Rights Violations by Rev. James Warren Jones" to the Peoples Temple, members of the press, and members of Congress.<sup id="cite_ref-114"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-114">[114]</a></sup> In June 1978, Layton provided the group with a further affidavit detailing alleged crimes by the Temple and substandard living conditions in Jonestown.<sup id="cite_ref-laytonaff_88-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-laytonaff-88">[88]</a></sup>

Tim Stoen represented three members of the Concerned Relatives in lawsuits filed in May and June 1978 against Jones and other Temple members, seeking in excess of $56 million in damages.<sup id="cite_ref-moore259_115-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-moore259-115">[115]</a></sup> The Temple, represented by [Charles Garry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Garry "Charles Garry"), filed a suit against Stoen on 10 July 1978, seeking $150 million in damages.<sup id="cite_ref-moore268_116-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-moore268-116">[116]</a></sup>

### Conspiracism [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jonestown&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Conspiracism")

During July-August 1978, Jones sought the legal services of [Mark Lane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lane_(author) "Mark Lane (author)") and [Donald Freed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Freed "Donald Freed"), both [Kennedy assassination conspiracy theorists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_assassination_conspiracy_theories "John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories"), to help make the case of a "[grand conspiracy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory "Conspiracy theory")" by US intelligence agencies against the Temple.<sup id="cite_ref-reiterman440_117-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-reiterman440-117">[117]</a></sup> Jones told Lane he wanted to "pull an [Eldridge Cleaver](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldridge_Cleaver "Eldridge Cleaver")" and return to the US after repairing his reputation.<sup id="cite_ref-reiterman440_117-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-reiterman440-117">[117]</a></sup> In September 1978, Lane spoke to the residents of Jonestown, providing support for Jones' theories and comparing him to famed [civil rights movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement "Civil rights movement") leader [Martin Luther King Jr.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr. "Martin Luther King Jr.")<sup id="cite_ref-reiterman440_117-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-reiterman440-117">[117]</a></sup>

Lane then held press conferences stating that "none of the charges" against the Temple "are accurate or true" and that there was a "massive conspiracy" against the Temple by "intelligence organizations," naming the CIA, the [FBI](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation "Federal Bureau of Investigation"), and even the [US Postal Service](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Postal_Service "US Postal Service").<sup id="cite_ref-reiterman440_117-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-reiterman440-117">[117]</a></sup> Though Lane presented himself as a disinterested party, Jones was actually paying him $6,000 per month to generate such theories.<sup id="cite_ref-118"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-118">[118]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-119"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-119">[119]</a></sup>

### Jones' declining physical and mental health [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jonestown&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Jones' declining physical and mental health")

Jones' health significantly declined in Jonestown. In 1978, Jones was informed of a possible lung infection, upon which he announced to his followers that he in fact had [lung cancer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer "Lung cancer") – a ploy to foster sympathy and strengthen support within the community.<sup id="cite_ref-120"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-120">[120]</a></sup> Jones was said to be abusing injectable [Valium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valium "Valium"), [Quaaludes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaalude "Quaalude"), [stimulants](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant "Stimulant"), and [barbiturates](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbiturate "Barbiturate").<sup id="cite_ref-reiterman446_121-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-reiterman446-121">[121]</a></sup>

Audio tapes of 1978 meetings within Jonestown attest to Jones' declining physical condition, with the commune leader complaining of [high blood pressure](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_blood_pressure "High blood pressure") which he had since the early 1950s, small [strokes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke "Stroke"), and [weight loss](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss "Weight loss") of 30 to 40 pounds in the last two weeks of Jonestown, temporary [blindness](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness "Blindness"), [convulsions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convulsions "Convulsions"), and, in late October to early November 1978 while he was ill in his cabin, grotesque swelling of the [extremities](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_(anatomy) "Limb (anatomy)").<sup id="cite_ref-reiterman446_121-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-reiterman446-121">[121]</a></sup>

Jones often mentioned chronic [insomnia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomnia "Insomnia"); he would often say he went for three or four days without any rest. During meetings and public addresses, his once-sharp speaking voice often sounded slurred; words ran together or were tripped over. Jones would occasionally not finish sentences even when reading typed reports over the commune's PA system.<sup id="cite_ref-reiterman446_121-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-reiterman446-121">[121]</a></sup>

Reiterman was surprised by the severe deterioration of Jones' health when he saw him in Jonestown on November 17, 1978.<sup id="cite_ref-reitermantimes_74-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-reitermantimes-74">[74]</a></sup> After covering Jones for eighteen months for the _Examiner_, Reiterman thought it was "shocking to see his glazed eyes and festering paranoia face to face, to realize that nearly a thousand lives, ours included, were in his hands".<sup id="cite_ref-reitermantimes_74-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-reitermantimes-74">[74]</a></sup>

Congressman [Leo Ryan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Ryan "Leo Ryan")

Leo Ryan, who represented [California's 11th congressional district](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/California%27s_11th_congressional_district "California's 11th congressional district"), announced that he would visit Jonestown.<sup id="cite_ref-122"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-122">[122]</a></sup> Ryan was friends with the father of Bob Houston, a Temple member in California whose mutilated body was found near train tracks on October 5, 1976, three days after a taped telephone conversation with Houston's ex-wife in which leaving the Temple was discussed.<sup id="cite_ref-reiterman299457_123-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-reiterman299457-123">[123]</a></sup> Over the following months, Ryan's interest was further aroused by the allegations put forth by Stoen, Layton, and the Concerned Relatives.<sup id="cite_ref-reiterman299457_123-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-reiterman299457-123">[123]</a></sup>

On November 14, 1978, Ryan flew to Georgetown, along with a delegation<sup id="cite_ref-124"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-124">[124]</a></sup> that included:

### Visits to Jonestown [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jonestown&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Visits to Jonestown")

When the Ryan delegation arrived in Guyana, Lane and Garry initially refused to allow them access to Jonestown.<sup id="cite_ref-125"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-125">[125]</a></sup> However, by the morning of November 17, they informed Jones that Ryan would likely leave for Jonestown that afternoon regardless of his willingness.<sup id="cite_ref-126"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-126">[126]</a></sup> Ryan's party, accompanied by Lane and Garry, came to an airstrip at [Port Kaituma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Kaituma "Port Kaituma"), six miles (10 km) from Jonestown, some hours later.<sup id="cite_ref-127"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-127">[127]</a></sup> Because of lack of room on the plane, only four of the Concerned Relatives – Anthony Katsaris, Beverly Oliver, Jim Cobb and Carol Boyd – accompanied Ryan, Speier and the journalists to Port Kaituma and ultimately to Jonestown. It was felt that the presence of the Stoens would unnecessarily antagonize Jones, and Harris wanted to remain in Georgetown because he hoped to spend time with his daughter Liane, who was staying at the Temple's Lamaha Gardens headquarters there.<sup id="cite_ref-128"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-128">[128]</a></sup>

Only Ryan, Speier, Lane and Garry were initially accepted into Jonestown, while the rest of Ryan's group was allowed in after sunset.<sup id="cite_ref-129"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-129">[129]</a></sup> That night, they attended a musical reception in the settlement's main pavilion.<sup id="cite_ref-130"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-130">[130]</a></sup> While the party was received warmly, Jones said he felt like a dying man and ranted about government conspiracies and [martyrdom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyrdom "Martyrdom") as he decried attacks by the press and his enemies.<sup id="cite_ref-reitermantimes_74-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-reitermantimes-74">[74]</a></sup> It was later reported – and verified by audio tapes recovered by investigators – that Jones had run rehearsals on how to convince Ryan's delegation that everyone was happy and in good spirits.<sup id="cite_ref-131"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-131">[131]</a></sup>

Two Temple members, Vernon Gosney (1953–2021) and Monica Bagby (1960–2009), made the first move for defection that night. In the pavilion, Gosney mistook NBC reporter Don Harris for Ryan and passed him a note, reading, "Dear Congressman, Vernon Gosney and Monica Bagby. Please help us get out of Jonestown."<sup id="cite_ref-132"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-132">[132]</a></sup> A child nearby witnessed Gosney's act and verbally alerted other Temple members.<sup id="cite_ref-133"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-133">[133]</a></sup> Harris brought two notes, one of them Gosney's, to Ryan and Speier. According to Speier in 2006, reading the notes caused her and the congressman to realize that "something was very, very wrong."<sup id="cite_ref-134"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-134">[134]</a></sup>

Ryan, Speier, Dwyer, and Annibourne stayed the night in Jonestown while other members of the delegation, including the press corps and members of Concerned Relatives, were told that they had to find other accommodations. They went to Port Kaituma and stayed at a small café.<sup id="cite_ref-raven498_135-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-raven498-135">[135]</a></sup>

In the early morning of November 18, eleven Temple members sensed danger enough to walk out of Jonestown and all the way to the town of [Matthew's Ridge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew%27s_Ridge "Matthew's Ridge"), in the opposite direction from the Port Kaituma airstrip.<sup id="cite_ref-cnnsurvivor_136-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-cnnsurvivor-136">[136]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-cnnslavery_137-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-cnnslavery-137">[137]</a></sup> Those defectors included the wife and son of Jonestown's head of security, Joe Wilson.<sup id="cite_ref-cnnsurvivor_136-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-cnnsurvivor-136">[136]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-138"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-138">[138]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-139"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-139">[139]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-140"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-140">[140]</a></sup> When journalists and members of the Concerned Relatives arrived in Jonestown later that day, Marceline Jones gave them a tour of the settlement.<sup id="cite_ref-141"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-141">[141]</a></sup>

While most of the Ryan delegation began to depart on a large dump truck to the Port Kaituma airstrip, Ryan and Dwyer stayed behind in Jonestown to process any additional defectors. Shortly before the dump truck left, Temple loyalist Larry Layton, the brother of Deborah Layton, demanded to join the group. Several defectors voiced their suspicions about Larry Layton's motives.<sup id="cite_ref-raven518_149-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-raven518-149">[149]</a></sup>

Shortly after the dump truck initially departed, Temple member Don "Ujara" Sly grabbed Ryan while wielding a knife.<sup id="cite_ref-150"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-150">[150]</a></sup> While Ryan was unhurt after others wrestled Sly to the ground, Dwyer strongly suggested that the congressman leave Jonestown while he filed a criminal complaint against Sly.<sup id="cite_ref-151"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-151">[151]</a></sup> Ryan did so, promising to return later to address the dispute.<sup id="cite_ref-housereport_39-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-housereport-39">[39]</a></sup> The truck departing to the airstrip had stopped after the passengers heard of the attack on Ryan, and took him as a passenger before continuing its journey towards the airstrip.<sup id="cite_ref-raven524_152-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-raven524-152">[152]</a></sup>

The entourage had originally scheduled a 19-passenger [Twin Otter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Otter "Twin Otter") from [Guyana Airways](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyana_Airways "Guyana Airways") to fly them back to Georgetown. Because of the defectors departing Jonestown, the group grew in number and now an additional aircraft was required. Accordingly, the US embassy arranged for a second plane, a six-passenger [Cessna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna "Cessna").<sup id="cite_ref-housereport_39-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-housereport-39">[39]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-153"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-153">[153]</a></sup> When the entourage reached the airstrip between 4:30 p.m. and 4:45 p.m., the planes had not appeared as scheduled. The group had to wait until the aircraft landed at approximately 5:10 p.m.<sup id="cite_ref-housereport_39-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-housereport-39">[39]</a></sup> Then the boarding process began.

Larry Layton was a passenger on the Cessna, the first aircraft to set up for takeoff.<sup id="cite_ref-154"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-154">[154]</a></sup> After the Cessna had taxied to the far end of the airstrip, he produced a handgun and started shooting at the passengers. He wounded Bagby and Gosney, and tried to kill Dale Parks, who disarmed him after the gun misfired.<sup id="cite_ref-raven533_155-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-raven533-155">[155]</a></sup>

Meanwhile, some passengers had boarded the larger Twin Otter. A tractor with a trailer attached, driven by members of the Temple's Red Brigade security squad, arrived at the airstrip and approached the Twin Otter.<sup id="cite_ref-raven527_156-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-raven527-156">[156]</a></sup> When the tractor neared within approximately 30 feet (9 m) of the aircraft, at a time roughly concurrent with the shootings on the Cessna, the Red Brigade opened fire with shotguns, handguns and rifles while at least two shooters circled the plane on foot.<sup id="cite_ref-housereport_39-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-housereport-39">[39]</a></sup> There were perhaps nine shooters whose identities are not all certainly known, but most sources agree that Joe Wilson, Stanley Gieg, Thomas Kice Sr, and Ronnie Dennis were among them.<sup id="cite_ref-157"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-157">[157]</a></sup>

An aerial view of the dead in Jonestown

Before leaving Jonestown for the airstrip, Ryan had told Garry that he would issue a report that would describe Jonestown "in basically good terms". Ryan stated that none of the 60 relatives he had targeted for interviews wanted to leave, the 14 defectors constituted a very small portion of Jonestown's residents, that any sense of imprisonment the defectors had was likely because of [peer pressure](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_pressure "Peer pressure") and a lack of physical transportation, and even if 200 of the 900+ wanted to leave, "I'd still say you have a beautiful place here."<sup id="cite_ref-hall275_159-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-hall275-159">[159]</a></sup> Despite Garry's report, Jones told him, "I have failed." Garry reiterated that Ryan would be making a positive report, but Jones maintained that "all is lost."<sup id="cite_ref-hall273_160-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-hall273-160">[160]</a></sup>

After Ryan's departure from Jonestown towards Port Kaituma, Marceline Jones made a broadcast on the public address system, stating that everything was all right, and asking residents to return to their homes.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_161-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-:3-161">[161]</a></sup> During this time, aides prepared a large metal tub with grape [Flavor Aid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavor_Aid "Flavor Aid"), poisoned with [diphenhydramine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphenhydramine "Diphenhydramine"), [promethazine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promethazine "Promethazine"), [chlorpromazine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorpromazine "Chlorpromazine"), [chloroquine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroquine "Chloroquine"), [chloral hydrate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloral_hydrate "Chloral hydrate"), [diazepam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazepam "Diazepam"),<sup id="cite_ref-162"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-162">[162]</a></sup> and [cyanide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanide "Cyanide").<sup id="cite_ref-163"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-163">[163]</a></sup>

The concoction was prepared with the help of Jonestown’s in-house doctor, Larry Schacht, a Texan native and former methamphetamine addict who got sober with the help of Jones, who subsequently paid for his college education to become a doctor. Schacht had been researching the best ways for a person to die in advance of the foreseen mass suicide.<sup id="cite_ref-HouPress_164-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-HouPress-164">[164]</a></sup> About 30 minutes after Marceline Jones' announcement, Jim Jones made his own, calling all members immediately to the pavilion.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_161-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-:3-161">[161]</a></sup>

[](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Peoples_Temple_Cult_Death_Tape_Q042.ogg "Play audio")Duration: 44 minutes and 30 seconds.

A 44-minute cassette tape, known as the "death tape",<sup id="cite_ref-tape_165-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-tape-165">[165]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-166"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-166">[166]</a></sup> records part of the meeting Jones called inside the pavilion in the early evening of 18 November 1978. When the assembly gathered, referring to the Ryan delegation's air travel back to Georgetown, Jones told the gathering:

> One of those people on that plane is gonna shoot the pilot, I know that. I didn't plan it but I know it's gonna happen. They're gonna shoot that pilot and down comes the plane into the jungle and we had better not have any of our children left when it's over, because they'll parachute in here on us.

Parroting Jones' prior statements that hostile forces would convert captured children to [fascism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism "Fascism"), one Temple member stated: "The ones that they take captured, they're gonna just let them grow up and be dummies."<sup id="cite_ref-tape_165-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-tape-165">[165]</a></sup>

On the tape, Jones urged Temple members to commit "revolutionary suicide".<sup id="cite_ref-tape_165-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-tape-165">[165]</a></sup> Such an act had been planned by the Temple before and, according to Jonestown defectors, its theory was "you can go down in history, saying you chose your own way to go, and it is your commitment to refuse capitalism and in support of socialism."<sup id="cite_ref-167"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-167">[167]</a></sup>

Temple member [Christine Miller](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Miller "Christine Miller") argued that the Temple should alternatively attempt an airlift to the Soviet Union. Jim McElvane, a former therapist who had arrived in Jonestown only two days earlier, assisted Jones by arguing against Miller's resistance to suicide, stating "Let's make it a beautiful day" and later citing possible [reincarnation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation "Reincarnation"). After several exchanges in which Jones argued that a Soviet exodus would not be possible, along with reactions by other Temple members hostile to Miller, she backed down. However, Miller may have ceased dissenting when Jones confirmed at one point that "the Congressman has been murdered" after the airstrip shooters returned.<sup id="cite_ref-tape_165-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-tape-165">[165]</a></sup>

When the Red Brigade members came back to Jonestown after Ryan's murder, Tim Carter, a [Vietnam War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War "Vietnam War") veteran, recalled them having the "[thousand-yard stare](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousand-yard_stare "Thousand-yard stare")" of weary soldiers.<sup id="cite_ref-168"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-168">[168]</a></sup> After Jones confirmed that "the Congressman's dead", no dissent is heard on the death tape. By this point, armed guards had taken up positions surrounding the pavilion area. Directly after this, Jones stated that "the Red Brigade's the only one that made any sense anyway", and, "the Red Brigade showed them justice". In addition to McElvane, several other Temple members gave speeches praising Jones and his decision for the community to commit suicide, even after Jones stopped appreciating this praise and begged for the process to go faster.<sup id="cite_ref-tape_165-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-tape-165">[165]</a></sup>

According to escaped Temple member Odell Rhodes, the first to take the poison were Ruletta Paul and her one-year-old infant. A syringe without a needle fitted was used to squirt poison into the infant's mouth, after which Paul squirted another syringe into her own mouth.<sup id="cite_ref-odellinquest_169-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-odellinquest-169">[169]</a></sup> Stanley Clayton also witnessed mothers with their babies first approach the tub containing the poison. Clayton said that Jones approached people to encourage them to drink the poison and that, after adults saw the poison begin to take effect, "they showed a reluctance to die".<sup id="cite_ref-claytoninquest_170-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-claytoninquest-170">[170]</a></sup>

The poison caused death within five minutes for children,<sup id="cite_ref-171"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-171">[171]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:3_161-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-:3-161">[161]</a></sup> less for babies, and an estimated 20–30 minutes for adults.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_161-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-:3-161">[161]</a></sup> After consuming the poison, according to Rhodes, people were then escorted away down a wooden walkway leading outside the pavilion. It is not clear if some initially thought the exercise was another White Night rehearsal. Rhodes reported being in close contact with dying children.<sup id="cite_ref-odellinquest_169-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-odellinquest-169">[169]</a></sup>

In response to reactions of seeing the poison take effect on others, Jones counseled, "Die with a degree of dignity. Lay down your life with dignity; don't lay down with tears and agony." He also said,

> I tell you, I don't care how many screams you hear, I don't care how many anguished cries ... death is a million times preferable to 10 more days of this life. If you knew what was ahead of you – if you knew what was ahead of you, you'd be glad to be stepping over tonight.

Rhodes described a scene of both hysteria and confusion as parents watched their children die from the poison. He also stated that most present "quietly waited their own turn to die", and that many of the assembled Temple members "walked around like they were in a trance". Survivor Tim Carter has suggested that, like a previous practice, that day's lunch of grilled cheese sandwiches may have been tainted with sedatives. This crowd was surrounded by armed guards, offering members the basic [dilemma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilemma "Dilemma") of death by poison or death by a guard's hand.<sup id="cite_ref-172"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-172">[172]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:2_173-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-:2-173">[173]</a></sup> Cries and screams of children and adults were easily heard on the tape recording made.<sup id="cite_ref-tape_165-5"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-tape-165">[165]</a></sup> As more Temple members died, eventually the guards themselves were called in to die by poison.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_173-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-:2-173">[173]</a></sup>

Jones was found dead lying next to his chair in the pavilion between two other bodies, his head cushioned by a pillow.<sup id="cite_ref-raven33_174-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-raven33-174">[174]</a></sup> His death was caused by a gunshot wound to his left temple that Guyanese Chief [Medical Examiner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Examiner "Medical Examiner") Leslie Mootoo stated was consistent with being self-inflicted.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_161-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-:3-161">[161]</a></sup>

The events at Jonestown constituted the greatest single loss of American civilian life in a deliberate act until the incidents of [11 September 2001](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks "September 11 attacks").<sup id="cite_ref-175"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-175">[175]</a></sup>

### Survivors and eyewitnesses [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jonestown&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Survivors and eyewitnesses")

Three high-ranking Temple survivors claimed they were given an assignment and thereby escaped death. Tim Carter and his brother Mike, aged 30 and 20, and Mike Prokes, 31, were given luggage containing $550,000 in US currency, $130,000 in Guyanese currency, and an envelope, which they were told to deliver to the Soviet embassy in Georgetown.<sup id="cite_ref-reit580_176-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-reit580-176">[176]</a></sup> The envelope contained two [passports](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport "Passport") and three instructional letters, the first of which was to Timofeyev, stating:

> Dear Comrade Timofeyev, The following is a letter of instructions regarding all of our assets that we want to leave to the Communist Party of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Enclosed in this letter are letters which instruct the banks to send the cashiers checks to you. I am doing this on behalf of Peoples Temple because we, as communists, want our money to be of benefit for help to oppressed peoples all over the world, or in any way that your decision-making body sees fit.<sup id="cite_ref-reit580_176-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-reit580-176">[176]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-timofeyev_177-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-timofeyev-177">[177]</a></sup>

The letters included listed accounts with balances totaling in excess of $7.3 million to be transferred to the [Communist Party of the Soviet Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union "Communist Party of the Soviet Union").<sup id="cite_ref-timofeyev_177-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-timofeyev-177">[177]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-178"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-178">[178]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-179"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-179">[179]</a></sup> Prokes and the Carter brothers soon ditched most of the money and were apprehended heading for a Temple boat at Port Kaituma. It is unknown how they reached Georgetown, 150 miles (240 km) away, since the boat had been sent away earlier that day.<sup id="cite_ref-reit580_176-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-reit580-176">[176]</a></sup> The brothers were given the task before the suicides began, and soon abandoned it when they realized what was about to happen; Tim Carter desperately tried to search for his wife and son, discovering his son in time to witness him being poisoned, and his wife killing herself in despair. At this point, Carter had a [nervous breakdown](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_breakdown "Nervous breakdown"), and was pulled away from the village by his equally distraught brother.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (November 2022)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

Jones' sons, Stephan, Jim Jones Jr., and Tim were in Georgetown with the Jonestown Basketball Team to play in a tournament with the Guyanese National Team.<sup id="cite_ref-jonestown.sdsu.edu_180-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-jonestown.sdsu.edu-180">[180]</a></sup> In the moments before the suicide, Jim Jones contacted Stephan with orders to "get revenge" on enemies of the Peoples Temple in Georgetown before committing suicide themselves. Stephan not only refused to do so but then contacted the Peoples Temple in San Francisco and told them not to do anything unless he said so.<sup id="cite_ref-181"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-181">[181]</a></sup>

Just before the start of the final meeting in the pavilion, Garry and Lane were told that the people were angry with them. The lawyers were escorted to a house used to accommodate visitors. According to them, they talked their way past two armed guards and made it to the jungle, before eventually arriving in Port Kaituma. While in the jungle near the settlement, they heard gunshots.<sup id="cite_ref-reit541_182-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-reit541-182">[182]</a></sup> This observation concurs with the testimony of Clayton, who, having previously fled into the jungle, heard the same sounds as he was sneaking back into Jonestown to retrieve his passport.<sup id="cite_ref-claytoninquest_170-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-claytoninquest-170">[170]</a></sup> Rhodes volunteered to fetch a [stethoscope](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stethoscope "Stethoscope") and hid under a building.<sup id="cite_ref-odellinquest_169-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-odellinquest-169">[169]</a></sup>

Two more people who were intended to be poisoned managed to survive.<sup id="cite_ref-reit580_176-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-reit580-176">[176]</a></sup> Grover Davis, 79, who was hard-of-hearing, missed the announcement to assemble on the loudspeaker, laid down in a ditch and pretended to be dead.<sup id="cite_ref-hall293_36-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-hall293-36">[36]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-reit578_183-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-reit578-183">[183]</a></sup> Hyacinth Thrash, 76, realized what was happening and crawled under her bed, only to walk out after the poisonings were completed.<sup id="cite_ref-hall293_36-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-hall293-36">[36]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-reit578_183-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-reit578-183">[183]</a></sup>

### Medical examinations [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jonestown&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Medical examinations")

The only medical doctor to initially examine the scene at Jonestown was Mootoo, who visually examined over 200 bodies and later told a Guyanese coroner's jury of having seen needle marks on at least 70. However, no determination was made as to whether those injections initiated the introduction of poison or whether they were so-called "relief" injections to quicken death and reduce suffering from convulsions from those who had previously taken poison orally. Mootoo and American pathologist Lynn Crook determined that cyanide was present in some bodies, while analysis of the contents of the vat revealed several tranquilizers as well as [potassium cyanide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_cyanide "Potassium cyanide") and [potassium chloride](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_chloride "Potassium chloride").<sup id="cite_ref-rites_184-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-rites-184">[184]</a></sup>

Plastic cups, Flavor Aid packets, and syringes, some with needles and some without, littered the area where the bodies were found. Mootoo concluded that a gunshot wound to Annie Moore could not have been self-inflicted, though Moore had also ingested a lethal dose of cyanide.<sup id="cite_ref-guyanainquest_185-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-guyanainquest-185">[185]</a></sup>

Guyanese authorities waived their requirement for [autopsies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy "Autopsy") in the case of unnatural death. Doctors in the US performed autopsies on only seven bodies, including those of Jones, Moore, Lawrence Schacht, and Carolyn Layton. Moore and Layton were selected among those autopsied, in part, because of the urging of the Moore family, including Rebecca Moore, the sister of the two victims, who was not a Temple member herself.<sup id="cite_ref-rites_184-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-rites-184">[184]</a></sup>

### Notes from deceased residents [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jonestown&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Notes from deceased residents")

Found near Marceline Jones' body was a typewritten note, dated 18 November 1978, signed by Marceline and witnessed by Moore and [Maria Katsaris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Katsaris "Maria Katsaris"), stating:

> I, Marceline Jones, leave all bank assets in my name to the Communist Party of the USSR. The above bank accounts are located in the [Bank of Nova Scotia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Nova_Scotia "Bank of Nova Scotia") in [Nassau, Bahamas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassau,_Bahamas "Nassau, Bahamas").
> 
> Please be sure that these assets do get to the USSR. I especially request that none of these are allowed to get into the hands of my adopted daughter, Suzanne Jones Cartmell.
> 
> For anyone who finds this letter, please honor this request as it is most important to myself and my husband James W. Jones.<sup id="cite_ref-186"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-186">[186]</a></sup>

Moore also left a note, which in part stated: "I am at a point right now so embittered against the world that I don't know why I am writing this. Someone who finds it will believe I am crazy or believe in the barbed wire that does NOT exist in Jonestown." The last line, "We died because you would not let us live in peace," is written in different color ink. No other specific reference is made to the events of the day. Moore also wrote, "JONESTOWN – the most peaceful, loving community that ever existed."<sup id="cite_ref-moore_187-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-moore-187">[187]</a></sup>

In addition, she stated, "JIM JONES – the one who made this paradise possible – much to the contrary of the lies stated about Jim Jones being a power-hungry sadistic, mean person who thought he was God – of all things." And "His hatred of racism, sexism, elitism, and mainly classism, is what prompted him to make a new world for the people – a paradise in the jungle. The children loved it. So did everyone else."<sup id="cite_ref-moore_187-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-moore-187">[187]</a></sup>

Found near Carolyn Layton's body was a handwritten note signed by Layton, witnessed by Katsaris and Moore, dated 18 November 1978, stating, "This is my last will and testament.

In the early evening of 18 November, at the Temple's headquarters in Georgetown, Temple member Sharon Amos received a radio communication from Jonestown instructing the members at the headquarters to take revenge on the Temple's enemies and then commit revolutionary suicide.<sup id="cite_ref-189"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-189">[189]</a></sup> Later, after police arrived at the headquarters, Sharon escorted her children, Liane (21), Christa (11), and Martin (10), into a bathroom.<sup id="cite_ref-reiterman544_190-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-reiterman544-190">[190]</a></sup> Wielding a kitchen knife, Sharon first killed Christa, and then Martin.<sup id="cite_ref-reiterman544_190-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-reiterman544-190">[190]</a></sup> Then Liane assisted Sharon in cutting her own throat, after which Liane killed herself.<sup id="cite_ref-reiterman544_190-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-reiterman544-190">[190]</a></sup>

Stephan, Tim, and Jim Jr. eventually found them dead after they arrived at the Temple headquarters in their efforts to return to Jonestown to stop the suicide. They and other members of the Jonestown Basketball Team had been away in Georgetown, where they played an exhibition match against the Guyanese National Team.<sup id="cite_ref-jonestown.sdsu.edu_180-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-jonestown.sdsu.edu-180">[180]</a></sup>

At the airstrip, Reiterman photographed the aftermath of the shootings.<sup id="cite_ref-raven568_191-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-raven568-191">[191]</a></sup> Dwyer assumed leadership at the scene and, at his recommendation, Larry Layton was arrested by Guyanese police.<sup id="cite_ref-raven534_192-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-raven534-192">[192]</a></sup> Dwyer was grazed by a bullet in his buttock during the shootings.<sup id="cite_ref-raven534_192-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-raven534-192">[192]</a></sup> It took several hours before the eleven wounded and others in their party gathered themselves together.<sup id="cite_ref-raven534_192-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-raven534-192">[192]</a></sup> Most of them spent the night in the Port Kaituma café.<sup id="cite_ref-raven534_192-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-raven534-192">[192]</a></sup> The more seriously wounded slept in a small tent at the airstrip.<sup id="cite_ref-raven534_192-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-raven534-192">[192]</a></sup> A Guyanese government plane arrived the following morning to evacuate the wounded.<sup id="cite_ref-raven568_191-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-raven568-191">[191]</a></sup>

Five teenage members of the Parks and Bogue families, with one boyfriend, followed the instructions of defector Gerald Parks to hide in the adjacent jungle until help arrived and their safety was assured.<sup id="cite_ref-raven567_193-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-raven567-193">[193]</a></sup> Thereafter, that group was lost for three days in the jungle and nearly died. Guyanese soldiers eventually found them.

After escaping Jonestown, Rhodes arrived in Port Kaituma on the night of 18 November 1978.<sup id="cite_ref-odellinquest_169-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-odellinquest-169">[169]</a></sup> That night, Clayton stayed with a local Guyanese family and travelled to Port Kaituma the next morning.<sup id="cite_ref-claytoninquest_170-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-claytoninquest-170">[170]</a></sup> Prokes and the Carter brothers were put into protective custody in Port Kaituma.<sup id="cite_ref-reit580_176-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-reit580-176">[176]</a></sup> They were later released in Georgetown. Rhodes, Clayton, Garry, and Lane were also brought to Georgetown. Prokes died by suicide on March 14, 1979, during a press conference, four months after the Jonestown incident.<sup id="cite_ref-prokes_194-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-prokes-194">[194]</a></sup>

914<sup id="cite_ref-195"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-195">[195]</a></sup> of the 918 dead, including Jones himself, were collected by the United States military in Guyana, then transported by military cargo plane to [Dover Air Force Base](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dover_Air_Force_Base "Dover Air Force Base") in Delaware, a location that had been used previously for mass processing of the dead from the [Tenerife airport disaster](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenerife_airport_disaster "Tenerife airport disaster").<sup id="cite_ref-:0_196-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-:0-196">[196]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Tribune_197-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-Tribune-197">[197]</a></sup> The last shipment of bodies arrived early on the morning of November 27, 1978. The base's mortuary was tasked with fingerprinting, identifying, and processing the bodies.<sup id="cite_ref-Tribune_197-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-Tribune-197">[197]</a></sup> The base's resources were overwhelmed, and numerous individuals tasked with moving or identifying the bodies suffered symptoms of [PTSD](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder "Post-traumatic stress disorder").<sup id="cite_ref-:0_196-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-:0-196">[196]</a></sup> In many cases, responsibility for cremation of the remains was distributed to Dover area funeral homes.

In August 2014, the never-claimed cremated remains of nine people from Jonestown were found in a former funeral home in Dover.<sup id="cite_ref-198"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-198">[198]</a></sup> As of September 2014, four of their remains had been returned to next-of-kin, and the remaining five had not. Those five were publicly identified in the hope that family would claim their remains; all five remain unclaimed by family and have been interred at the Jonestown Memorial at Evergreen Cemetery in Oakland, CA, along with the remains of approximately half of those who perished on November 18, 1978.<sup id="cite_ref-199"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-199">[199]</a></sup>

Larry Layton, who had fired a gun at several people aboard the Cessna, was initially found not guilty of attempted murder in a Guyanese court, employing the defense that he was "brainwashed."<sup id="cite_ref-laytonlife_200-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-laytonlife-200">[200]</a></sup> Acquittal in a Guyanese court did not free Layton, who was promptly [deported](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation "Deportation") back to the US and arrested by the [US Marshals Service](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Marshals_Service "US Marshals Service") upon arrival in San Francisco. Layton could not be tried in the US for the attempted murders of Gosney, Bagby, Dale Parks, and the Cessna pilot on Guyanese soil and was, instead, tried under a federal statute against assassinating members of Congress and internationally protected people (Ryan and Dwyer).<sup id="cite_ref-laytonlife_200-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-laytonlife-200">[200]</a></sup> He was convicted of conspiracy and of aiding and abetting the murder of Ryan and of the attempted murder of Dwyer.<sup id="cite_ref-laytonlife_200-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-laytonlife-200">[200]</a></sup> [Paroled](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parole "Parole") in 2002, he is the only person ever to have been held criminally responsible for the events at Jonestown.<sup id="cite_ref-201"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-201">[201]</a></sup>

The event was covered heavily by the media, and photographs pertaining to it adorned newspaper and magazine covers for months after its occurrence. It was labeled a "cult of death" by both _[Time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine) "Time (magazine)")_ and _[Newsweek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek "Newsweek")_ magazines.<sup id="cite_ref-202"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-202">[202]</a></sup> In February 1979, 98% of Americans polled said that they had heard of the tragedy.<sup id="cite_ref-hall289_203-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-hall289-203">[203]</a></sup> [George Gallup](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gallup "George Gallup") stated that "few events, in fact, in the entire history of the Gallup Poll have been known to such a high percentage of the US public".<sup id="cite_ref-hall289_203-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-hall289-203">[203]</a></sup>

After the deaths, both the [House Committee on Foreign Affairs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Committee_on_Foreign_Affairs "House Committee on Foreign Affairs") and the US State Department itself criticized the latter's handling of the Temple.<sup id="cite_ref-multiref1_204-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-multiref1-204">[204]</a></sup> Guyanese political opposition seized the opportunity to embarrass Prime Minister Burnham by establishing an [inquest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquest "Inquest") which concluded that Burnham was responsible for the deaths at Jonestown.<sup id="cite_ref-multiref1_204-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-multiref1-204">[204]</a></sup>

The [Cult Awareness Network](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_Awareness_Network "Cult Awareness Network") (CAN), a group aimed at deprogramming members of cults, was formed soon after the Jonestown deaths. The group, which included Congressman Ryan's daughter Patricia, was involved in various personal, social and legal battles with a range of religious organizations, from [The Family International](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Family_International "The Family International") and [Scientology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology "Scientology") to [David Koresh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Koresh "David Koresh")'s [Branch Davidians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_Davidians "Branch Davidians"), where they were found to be influential on law enforcement's concerns for children in the eventual [Waco siege](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waco_siege "Waco siege") in 1993. After a slew of legal and fiscal issues, CAN went bankrupt in 1996.

In late February 1980, Al and [Jeannie Mills](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeannie_Mills "Jeannie Mills") (co-founders of the Concerned Relatives) and their daughter Daphene were shot and killed execution style in their Berkeley, California home.<sup id="cite_ref-205"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-205">[205]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-206"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-206">[206]</a></sup> Eddie Mills, Al and Jeannie's son, was believed to be involved to the extent that he was arrested in 2005, but charges were not filed against him.<sup id="cite_ref-207"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-207">[207]</a></sup> The case has not been solved. In 1984, former Temple member [Tyrone Mitchell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrone_Mitchell "Tyrone Mitchell"), who had lost both of his parents and five siblings at Jonestown, fired upon students at a Los Angeles elementary school from his second-story window, killing two people and injuring twelve; Mitchell then turned his weapon on himself and committed suicide.<sup id="cite_ref-LATimes2_208-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-LATimes2-208">[208]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-NYTimes_209-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-NYTimes-209">[209]</a></sup>

The sheer scale of the event, as well as Jones' socialism, purported inconsistencies in the reported number of deaths, allegedly poor explanation of events related to said deaths, and existence of classified documents<sup id="cite_ref-210"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-210">[210]</a></sup> led some conspiracy theorists to suggest [CIA involvement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown_Conspiracy_Theory "Jonestown Conspiracy Theory").<sup id="cite_ref-211"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-211">[211]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-reconstructing_212-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-reconstructing-212">[212]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-213"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-213">[213]</a></sup> including a Soviet-published book a decade later.<sup id="cite_ref-214"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-214">[214]</a></sup> The [House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Permanent_Select_Committee_on_Intelligence "House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence") investigated the event and announced that there was no evidence of CIA involvement at Jonestown.<sup id="cite_ref-Knight2003_215-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-Knight2003-215">[215]</a></sup> Others suggested [KGB](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/KGB "KGB") involvement, beyond the attested visits of Soviet diplomatic personnel to Jonestown and the overtures made by Jim Jones to the USSR.<sup id="cite_ref-216"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-216">[216]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-217"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-217">[217]</a></sup>

The bodies of over 400 of those who died are buried in a mass grave at [Evergreen Cemetery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreen_Cemetery_(Oakland,_California) "Evergreen Cemetery (Oakland, California)") in [Oakland, California](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California "Oakland, California").

Although Jones used poisoned Flavor Aid, the drink mix was also commonly (mistakenly) referred to as [Kool-Aid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kool-Aid "Kool-Aid"). This has led to the phrase "[drinking the Kool-Aid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_the_Kool-Aid "Drinking the Kool-Aid")", referring to a person or group holding an unquestioned belief, argument, or philosophy without critical examination.<sup id="cite_ref-stop_saying_219-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-stop_saying-219">[219]</a></sup>

### Conspiracy theories [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jonestown&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Conspiracy theories")

In 1979, Joseph Hollinger, a former aide to Congressman [Leo Ryan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Ryan "Leo Ryan"), claimed that Jonestown was a "mass mind control experiment" conducted by the CIA. A 1980 newspaper column by [Jack Anderson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Anderson_(columnist) "Jack Anderson (columnist)") also claimed that the CIA was involved in the Jonestown Massacre, and speculated that [Deputy Chief of Mission](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Department "State Department") of the US Embassy to Guyana Richard Dwyer had ties to the CIA.<sup id="cite_ref-220"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-220">[220]</a></sup> In 1980, an investigation by the [United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Permanent_Select_Committee_on_Intelligence "United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence") found no evidence of CIA activity in Jonestown.<sup id="cite_ref-Knight2003_215-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-Knight2003-215">[215]</a></sup>

In 1987, _The Jonestown Carnage: A CIA Crime (1978)_ (Russian: _Гибель Джонстауна - преступление ЦРУ_) was published in the Soviet Union, claiming that group members were assassinated by CIA agents and mercenaries to prevent further political emigration from the US as well as suppress opposition to the US regime. Political scientist [Janos Radvanyi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janos_Radvanyi "Janos Radvanyi") cites the book as an example of Soviet active measures during the 1980s that "spread both disinformation stories and enemy propaganda against the United States", adding, "It's hard to imagine that anyone could believe so ridiculous a story".<sup id="cite_ref-Radvanyi1990_221-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-Radvanyi1990-221">[221]</a></sup>

According to religious studies scholar Rebecca Moore, "In the twenty-three years since the deaths in Jonestown, conspiracy theories have blossomed in number and sophistication."<sup id="cite_ref-Moore_222-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-Moore-222">[222]</a></sup>

## Former site [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jonestown&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Former site")

Now deserted, the compound at Jonestown was first tended by the Guyanese government following the deaths.<sup id="cite_ref-faqq8_223-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-faqq8-223">[223]</a></sup> The government then allowed its re-occupation by [Hmong](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hmong_people "Hmong people") refugees from [Laos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laos "Laos") for a few years in the early 1980s.<sup id="cite_ref-faqq8_223-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-faqq8-223">[223]</a></sup> The buildings and grounds were looted by local Guyanese people, but were not taken over because of their association with the mass killing. The buildings were mostly destroyed by a fire in the mid-1980s, after which the ruins were left to decay and be reclaimed by the jungle.<sup id="cite_ref-224"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-224">[224]</a></sup>

During a visit to tape a segment for the [ABC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company "American Broadcasting Company") news show _[20/20](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/20/20_(US_television_show) "20/20 (US television show)")_ in 1998, Jim Jones Jr., the adopted son of the cult leader, discovered the rusting remains of an oil drum near the former entrance to the pavilion. Jones recognized the drum, originally adapted for use during meal times, as the drum used for drink mixtures during the White Night exercises, and which he believed was used to hold the beverage mix of poison and grape-flavored punch during the events of 18 November 1978.<sup id="cite_ref-garysmith_225-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-garysmith-225">[225]</a></sup>

In 2003, with the help of Gerry Gouveia, a pilot involved with the Jonestown cleanup, a television crew recording a special for the 25th anniversary of the event returned to the site to uncover any remaining artifacts.<sup id="cite_ref-youtube.com_226-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-youtube.com-226">[226]</a></sup> Although the site was covered with dense vegetation, the team uncovered a standing [cassava](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassava "Cassava") mill (possibly the largest remaining structure), the remains of a tractor (speculated to be the same tractor used by the airstrip shooters), a generator, a filing cabinet, a truck near the site of Jones' house, a fuel pump, and other smaller miscellaneous items. Gouveia also led the team to the former site of the pavilion, where they found the remains of a steel drum, an organ, and a bed of [daisies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteraceae "Asteraceae") growing where the bodies once lay.<sup id="cite_ref-youtube.com_226-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-youtube.com-226">[226]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-227"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-227">[227]</a></sup>

Unfortunately, not enough about their foreign policy. But in the Soviet Union, they have it.... The sale of nearly 30,000 pounds of copper to China has been announced by the Ministry of Mining in Industry of Chile. Another blunder of China's foreign policy, supporting fascist regimes... In spite of the beauty of China, what it's done domestically, getting rid of the rats, the flies... _nothing_ justifies this kind of uh, inexcusable behavior. That's why we're pro-Soviet. That's why we stand by the Soviet Union as the avant-garde, because this is a _hellish_ thing to do, to support one of the most brutal fascist regimes, who has tortured _dark_ members – the black members of its population, presently more than any other color on up to how white your skin determines your rank in Chilean society."

The White Nights were originally called 'Omegas', denoting their finality, but when Jones decided that the events more properly marked a new beginning and an evolution to a higher form of socialist consciousness, they were briefly renamed 'Alphas'. This second title was only briefly used, and 'White Night' was adopted soon thereafter. Jones refers to an 'Omega' on one tape recorded at Jonestown, the only known time when this title was used. Confusingly, this mention came after the switch to 'White Night' had been made.
