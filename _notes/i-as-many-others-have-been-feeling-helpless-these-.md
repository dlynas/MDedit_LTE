## I, as many others, have been feeling helpless these past few weeks. We are watching a genocide occur in front of our eyes, yet there is no direct and immediate way for us to end the horrors we are witnessing from afar. So, we do all that we can: we pray, donate, protest, and spread awareness through social media. However, as a person with a mostly Arab and pro Palestinian following, I feel like I have been preaching to the choir. Most of you already know what‚Äôs going on in Palestine and of the injustices that our brothers and sisters have been subjected to for more than 75 years. I feel like the stories and posts I have been sharing should be directed towards people with less knowledge on the matter, and I don‚Äôt think most of you fall under that category. 

That is why I have taken it upon myself to work on this small project catered towards people who already have sufficient information on the Palestinian cause. Through watching numerous interviews as well as input from a lot of you, I prepared a narrowed-down list of 8 talking points zionists rely on to defend their stance. I then conducted some preliminary research to be able to respond to each talking point. My hope is that this will be useful to at least one person who is debating a zionist who uses one of these points. I also hope that at least one person who considers themselves a neutral reads this and decides to do some more research to uncover the truth.

*Note: I tried to be as brief and concise as possible with the responses so they could fit on an Instagram post. If you need any further clarification or expansion, feel free to DM me.
