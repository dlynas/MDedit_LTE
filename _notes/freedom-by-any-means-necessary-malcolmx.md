## Freedom by any means necessary. #malcolmx

"You don't get freedom peacefully. Freedom is never a safe-guarded peacefully. Anyone who
is depriving you of freedom isn't deserving of a peaceful approach by the ones who are
being deprived of their freedom. The only way you can have peace is to eliminate those
injustices and the American white man is not going to eliminate them. He's going to
talk that pretty talk, but he'll still continue to practice those in human being.
That's our motto. We want freedom by any means necessary. We want justice by
any means necessary. We want equality by any means necessary."
