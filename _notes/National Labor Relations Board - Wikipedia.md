The **National Labor Relations Board** (**NLRB**) is an [independent agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_agencies_of_the_United_States_government "Independent agencies of the United States government") of the [federal government of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States "Federal government of the United States") that enforces [U.S. labor law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_labor_law "United States labor law") in relation to [collective bargaining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_bargaining "Collective bargaining") and [unfair labor practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfair_labor_practice "Unfair labor practice"). Under the [National Labor Relations Act of 1935](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Act_of_1935 "National Labor Relations Act of 1935"), the NLRB has the authority to supervise elections for [labor union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union "Trade union") representation and to investigate and remedy [unfair labor practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfair_labor_practice "Unfair labor practice"). Unfair labor practices may involve union-related situations or instances of [protected concerted activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_concerted_activity "Protected concerted activity").

The NLRB is governed by a five-person board and a [general counsel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Counsel "General Counsel"), all of whom are appointed by the [president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States "President of the United States") with the [consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advice_and_consent "Advice and consent") of the [Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate "United States Senate"). Board members are appointed for five-year terms and the general counsel is appointed for a four-year term. The general counsel acts as a prosecutor and the board acts as an [appellate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellate "Appellate") [quasi-judicial body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-judicial_body "Quasi-judicial body") from decisions of 36 [administrative law judges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_law_judge "Administrative law judge"), as of November 2023.<sup id="cite_ref-scope_2-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-scope-2">[2]</a></sup> The NLRB is headquartered at 1015 Half St. SE, [Washington, D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.

### 1933–1935: First collective bargaining organization National Labor Board\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_Labor_Relations_Board&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: 1933–1935: First collective bargaining organization National Labor Board")\]

The history of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) can be traced to enactment of the [National Industrial Recovery Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Industrial_Recovery_Act "National Industrial Recovery Act") in 1933. Section 7(a) of the act protected collective bargaining rights for unions,<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMorris20058_6-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMorris20058-6">[6]</a></sup> but was difficult to enforce. The NLRB was not given monitoring powers.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>**<sup><span title="Page / location: 23">: 23 </span></sup>**  A massive wave of union organizing was punctuated by employer and [union violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_violence "Union violence"), [general strikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_strike "General strike"), and [recognition strikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recognition_strike "Recognition strike").<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDubofskyDulles2004252–54_8-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDubofskyDulles2004252%E2%80%9354-8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEBernsteinPiven1969217–18_9-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBernsteinPiven1969217%E2%80%9318-9">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERayback328–29_10-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTERayback328%E2%80%9329-10">[10]</a></sup> The National Industrial Recovery Act was administered by the [National Recovery Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Recovery_Administration "National Recovery Administration") (NRA). At the outset, NRA Administrator [Hugh S. Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_S._Johnson "Hugh S. Johnson") believed that Section 7(a) would be self-enforcing, but the tremendous labor unrest proved him wrong. On August 5, 1933, President [Franklin D. Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt "Franklin D. Roosevelt") announced the establishment of the [National Labor Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Board "National Labor Board"), under the auspices of the NRA, to implement the collective bargaining provisions of Section 7(a).<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMorris200525_1-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMorris200525-1">[1]</a></sup>

The National Labor Board (NLB) established a system of 20 regional boards to handle the immense caseload. Each regional board had a representative designated by local labor unions, local employers, and a "public" representative. All were unpaid. The public representative acted as the chair. The regional boards could hold hearings and propose settlements to disputes. Initially, they lacked authority to order representation elections, but this changed after Roosevelt issued additional executive orders on February 1 and February 23, 1934.

The NLB, too, proved ineffective. Congress passed Public Resolution No. 44 on June 19, 1934, which empowered the president to appoint a new labor board with authority to issue subpoenas, hold elections, and mediate labor disputes.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMorris200547_11-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMorris200547-11">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESchlesinger2003151_12-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchlesinger2003151-12">[12]</a></sup> On June 29, President Roosevelt abolished the NLB and in [Executive Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States) "Executive order (United States)") 6763 established a new, three-member National Labor Relations Board.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEVittoz1987144_13-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEVittoz1987144-13">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGross197471–72_14-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGross197471%E2%80%9372-14">[14]</a></sup>

[Lloyd K. Garrison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_K._Garrison "Lloyd K. Garrison") was the first chairman of the National Labor Relations Board (often referred to by scholars the "First NLRB" or "Old NLRB").<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEVittoz1987145_3-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEVittoz1987145-3">[3]</a></sup> The "First NLRB" established organizational structures which continue at the NLRB in the 21st century. This includes the regional structure of the board; the use of [administrative law judges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_law_judge "Administrative law judge") and regional hearing officers to initially rule on cases; an appeal process to the national board; and the use of expert staff, organized into various divisions, at the national level.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGross1974156_15-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGross1974156-15">[15]</a></sup> Formally, Garrison established the:<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGross197479–80_16-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGross197479%E2%80%9380-16">[16]</a></sup>

-   Executive Office, which handled administrative activities of the national and regional boards, field staff, and Legal Division. It was overseen by an Executive Secretary.
-   Examining Division, national staff which conducted field investigations and assisted the regional boards with adjudications, hearings, and representative elections.
-   Information Division, which provided the press and public with news.
-   Legal Division, which assisted the [Department of Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice "United States Department of Justice") in seeking compliance with board decisions in the courts, or in responding to suits brought about by board decisions.<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>
-   Research Division, which studied decisions of the regional boards so that a comprehensive labor law might be developed, and studied the economics of each case.

Within a year, however, most of the jurisdiction of the "First NLRB" was stripped away. Its decisions in the automobile, newspaper, textile, and steel industries proved so volatile that Roosevelt himself often removed these cases from the board's jurisdiction. Several federal court decisions further limited the board's power. [Senator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate "United States Senate") [Robert F. Wagner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Wagner "Robert F. Wagner") ([D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States) "Democratic Party (United States)") – [NY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state) "New York (state)")) subsequently pushed legislation through Congress to give a statutory basis to federal labor policy that survived court scrutiny. On July 5, 1935, a new law—the [National Labor Relations Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Act "National Labor Relations Act") (NLRA, also known as the Wagner Act)—superseded the NIRA and established a new, long-lasting federal labor policy.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESchlesinger2003400–06_18-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchlesinger2003400%E2%80%9306-18">[18]</a></sup> The NLRA designated the National Labor Relations Board as the implementing agency.

### 1935–1939: Constitutionality, communism, and organizational changes\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_Labor_Relations_Board&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: 1935–1939: Constitutionality, communism, and organizational changes")\]

[J. Warren Madden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Warren_Madden "J.

The first chairman of the "new" NLRB was [J. Warren Madden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Warren_Madden "J. Warren Madden"), professor of the [University of Pittsburgh School of Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh_School_of_Law "University of Pittsburgh School of Law").<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> Madden largely confirmed the previous structure of the "first NLRB" by formally establishing five divisions within the agency:

-   Administrative Division: Oversaw all administrative activities of national and regional boards and their finances; led by Secretary
-   Economic Division: Analyzed economic evidence in cases; made studies of economics of labor relations for use by board and courts; supervised by Chief Industrial Economist; also known as the Technical Service Division<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGross1974219_20-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGross1974219-20">[20]</a></sup>
-   Legal Division: Handled NLRB either decisions appealed to courts or cases in which NLRB sought enforcement of its decisions; overseen by general counsel (hired by NLRB board); comprised two subdivisions:
    -   Litigation Section: Advised national and regional boards, prepared briefs, worked with Justice Department
    -   Review Section: Analyzed regional hearings and decisions; issued interpretations of law; prepared forms; drafted regulations
-   Publications Division: Handled all press and public inquiries; published decisions of national and regional boards and their rules and regulations; overseen by Director of Publications
-   Trial Examining Division: Held hearings before the national board; overseen by Chief Trial Examiner

Benedict Wolf served as first Secretary of the NLRB, [Charles H. Fahy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_H._Fahy "Charles H. Fahy") the first general counsel, and [David J. Saposs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_J._Saposs "David J. Saposs") the first Chief Industrial Economist.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGross197479,_170,_174–75_21-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGross197479,_170,_174%E2%80%9375-21">[21]</a></sup> Wolf resigned in mid-1937, and [Nathan Witt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Witt "Nathan Witt"), an attorney in the Legal Division, was named Secretary in October.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGross1974111,_143_22-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGross1974111,_143-22">[22]</a></sup>

The Economic Division was a critical one for the NLRB. Cause-and-effect was one of the fundamental assumptions of the National Labor Relations Act, and for the causes of labor unrest to be understood economic analysis was needed.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEStryker1989344_23-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStryker1989344-23">[23]</a></sup> From the start, the Economic Division undertook three important tasks: 1) Gather economic data in support of cases before the courts; 2) Conduct general studies of labor relations to guide the board in formulating decisions and policies; and 3) Research the history of labor relations (the history of written agreements, whether certain issues were historically part of collective bargaining, how unions functioned internally, trends in employer activities, trends in collective bargaining, whether certain employer actions led to labor disputes, etc.) so that the board could educate itself, the courts, Congress, and the public about labor relations.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGross1974176–79_24-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGross1974176%E2%80%9379-24">[24]</a></sup> The first function proved critical to the survival of the NLRB. It was the Economic Division's data and analysis, more than then NLRB's legal reasoning, which proved critical in persuading the Supreme Court to sustain the Wagner Act in _NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel_.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGross1974176–79,_191_25-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGross1974176%E2%80%9379,_191-25">[25]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEStryker1989347_26-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStryker1989347-26">[26]</a></sup> The Court even cited several Economic Division studies in its decision.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGross1974228–29_27-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGross1974228%E2%80%9329-27">[27]</a></sup> In the wake of _Jones & Laughlin Steel_, many labor relations experts outside the agency concluded that economic analysis was "an accepted fact" essential to the proper functioning of the agency.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGross1974233_28-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGross1974233-28">[28]</a></sup> The Economic Division did, too. It asked Madden to pair an economist with an attorney in every important case,<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEEisner2000101_29-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEisner2000101-29">[29]</a></sup> and prepared outline of the economic data needed to support each case in case it went before the courts.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGross1974182–83_30-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGross1974182%E2%80%9383-30">[30]</a></sup>

During his time on the NLRB, Madden was often opposed by the [American Federation of Labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Federation_of_Labor "American Federation of Labor") (AFL), which believed that Madden was using the NLRA and the procedures and staff of the NLRB to favor the AFL's primary competitor, the [Congress of Industrial Organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Industrial_Organizations "Congress of Industrial Organizations") (CIO).<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGall199983–84,_97–98_32-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGall199983%E2%80%9384,_97%E2%80%9398-32">[32]</a></sup> The NLRB and NLRA were also under intense pressure from employers, the press, congressional [Republicans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States) "Republican Party (United States)"), and conservative [Democrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States) "Democratic Party (United States)").<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGross1974171–73_33-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGross1974171%E2%80%9373-33">[33]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGross19812_34-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGross19812-34">[34]</a></sup>

The NLRB's Economic Division proved critical in pushing for a congressional investigation into employer anti-union activities, and ensuring that investigation was a success. The Economic Division was deeply aware of employer use of [labor spies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_spy "Labor spy"), violence, and [company unions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_union "Company union") to thwart union organizing, and quietly pressed for a congressional investigation into these and other tactics. Senator [Robert M. La Follette Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_M._La_Follette_Jr. "Robert M. La Follette Jr.") took up the suggestion, on June 6, 1936, the [Senate Committee on Education and Labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Health,_Education,_Labor,_and_Pensions "United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions") established a Subcommittee Investigating Violations of Free Speech and the Rights of Labor chaired by La Follette.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGross1974214–23_35-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGross1974214%E2%80%9323-35">[35]</a></sup> Better known as the "[La Follette Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Follette_Committee "La Follette Committee")", the subcommittee held extensive hearings for five years and published numerous reports. The committee uncovered extensive evidence of millions of company dollars used to pay for spies and [fifth columnists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_column "Fifth column") within unions, exposed the culpability of local law enforcement in acts of violence and murder against union supporters (particularly in the [Harlan County War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_County_War "Harlan County War")),<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEBakerStack200656–57_36-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBakerStack200656%E2%80%9357-36">[36]</a></sup> revealed the wide extent of illegal [blacklisting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacklisting "Blacklisting") of union members, and exposed the use of armed [strikebreakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikebreaker "Strikebreaker") and widespread stockpiling of tear gas, vomit gas, machine guns, mortars, and armor by corporations to use against [strikers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action "Strike action").<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELuff2007774_37-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTELuff2007774-37">[37]</a></sup> Some of the evidence the committee used was provided by the Economic Division,<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELambert200590_38-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTELambert200590-38">[38]</a></sup> and the investigation proved critical for a time in defending the agency from business and congressional attack.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGross1974214–23_35-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGross1974214%E2%80%9323-35">[35]</a></sup>

The biggest issue the NLRB faced was constitutional. The [Justice Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice "United States Department of Justice") and NLRB legal staff wanted the [Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States "Supreme Court of the United States") to rule as quickly as possible on the constitutionality of the NLRA. But the board and Justice Department also realized that the Court's [_Lochner_ era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lochner_era "Lochner era") legal philosophy made it unlikely for the Court to uphold the Act. Subsequently, Madden strove to resolve minor cases before they could become court challenges, and worked to delay appeals as long as possible until the best possible case could be brought to the Court.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEChasse201157_39-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChasse201157-39">[39]</a></sup> This legal strategy paid off. The Supreme Court upheld the NLRA in _[National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board_v._Jones_%26_Laughlin_Steel_Corporation "National Labor Relations Board v.

Fahy, the Supreme Court reviewed only 27 cases between August 1935 and March 1941, even though the board had processed nearly 5,000 cases since its inception. The Supreme Court enforced the NLRB's rulings in 19 cases without modifying them, enforced them with modification in six more, and denied enforcement in two cases. Additionally, the board won all 30 [injunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction "Injunction") and all 16 representation cases before the lower courts, a rate of success unequalled by any other federal agency.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEBernsteinPiven1969662–63_41-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBernsteinPiven1969662%E2%80%9363-41">[41]</a></sup>

AFL opposition to the "Madden Board" grew after decisions in _Shipowners' Ass'n of the Pacific Coast_, 7 NLRB 1002 (1938), _enf'd_ _American Federation of Labor v. National Labor Relations Board_, 308 U.S. 401 (1940) (awarding a longshoremen's unit to the CIO rather than the AFL), and _American Can Co_., 13 NLRB 1252 (1939) (unit's history of collective bargaining outweighs desire of workers to form craft-only unit).<sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup>

The AFL began pushing for an investigation into the NLRB, and this investigation led to allegations of communist influence within the agency. In June 1938, the [House Un-American Activities Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Un-American_Activities_Committee "House Un-American Activities Committee") (led by Chairman [Martin Dies Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Dies_Jr. "Martin Dies Jr.") \[D-[TX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas "Texas")\]) heard testimony from AFL leader [John P. Frey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_P._Frey "John P.

A second investigation into the NLRB led to organizational changes at the board. On July 20, 1939, Republicans and conservative Democrats formed a coalition to push through the [House of Representatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives "United States House of Representatives") a resolution establishing a Special Committee to Investigate the National Labor Relations Board (the "[Smith Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Warren_Madden#The_Smith_Committee "J.

The Smith Committee investigation had a lasting effect on labor law in the U.S., and was the basis for the [Taft–Hartley Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taft%E2%80%93Hartley_Act "Taft–Hartley Act") of 1947.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGross1981225_58-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGross1981225-58">[58]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAtleson199811_59-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAtleson199811-59">[59]</a></sup> Madden's term on the NLRB came to an end after just four years.

### 1940–1945: Economics Division and World War II\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_Labor_Relations_Board&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: 1940–1945: Economics Division and World War II")\]

Another major structural change occurred at the same time that Madden left the NLRB. The Smith committee's anti-communist drive also targeted David J. Saposs, the NLRB Chief Industrial Economist. Saposs had been surreptitiously assessed by members of the Communist Party USA for membership, and rejected as a prospect.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGross1974220_61-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGross1974220-61">[61]</a></sup> But Smith and others attacked Saposs as a communist, and Congress defunded his division and his job on October 11, 1940.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGross1981199,_202_62-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGross1981199,_202-62">[62]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEJacobs2007171–72_63-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJacobs2007171%E2%80%9372-63">[63]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEChasse201158_64-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChasse201158-64">[64]</a></sup> Although the Smith committee's investigation proved critical, the disestablishment of the Economic Division was due to many reasons—both internal and external to the NLRB, and only some of which involved allegations of communist infiltration. As historian James A. Gross observed:.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGross1981264_65-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGross1981264-65">[65]</a></sup>

> The Division was eliminated for all kinds of reasons which had nothing to do with the merits and importance of its work: political pressures and maneuverings, jealousy and empire building between and among lawyers and economists inside the Board, opposition to leftist ideologies, a personal attack on the Chief Economist, David Saposs, and a mighty hostility to the administrative process.

The loss of the Economic Division was a major blow to the NLRB. It had a major tactical impact: Economic data helped the NLRB fulfill its adjudicatorial and prosecutorial work in areas such as [unfair labor practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfair_labor_practice "Unfair labor practice") (ULPs), representation elections, and in determining remedial actions (such as reinstatement, back pay awards, and fines).<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEStryker1989346–47_66-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStryker1989346%E2%80%9347-66">[66]</a></sup> Economic data also undermined employer resistance to the agency by linking that opposition to employer ULPs.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEStryker1989349_67-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStryker1989349-67">[67]</a></sup> The loss also left the board dependent on the biased information offered by the parties in dispute before it, leading to poor decision-making and far less success in the courts.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGross1981266–67_68-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGross1981266%E2%80%9367-68">[68]</a></sup> It also had a major strategic impact: It left the board unable to determine whether its administration of the law was effective or not.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGross1981265_69-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGross1981265-69">[69]</a></sup> Nor could the board determine whether labor unrest was a serious threat to the economy or not. As [labor historian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_history_(discipline) "Labor history (discipline)") Josiah Bartlett Lambert put it: "Without the Economic Research Division, the NLRB could not undertake empirical studies to determine the actual impact of [secondary boycotts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_action "Secondary action"), [jurisdictional strikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdictional_strike "Jurisdictional strike"), national emergency strikes, and the like."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELambert2005104_70-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTELambert2005104-70">[70]</a></sup> The Economic Division was critical to a long-range NLRB process to lead to the long-term evolution of industrial labor relations in the U.S., but that goal had to be abandoned.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEEisner2000101_29-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEisner2000101-29">[29]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEEisner2010336–37_71-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEisner2010336%E2%80%9337-71">[71]</a></sup> Most importantly, however, the evisceration of the Economic Division struck at the fundamental purpose of federal labor law, which was to allow experts to adjudicate labor disputes rather than use a legal process. With this data and analysis, widespread skepticism about the board's expertise quickly spread through Congress and the courts. It also left the board largely unable to engage in [rulemaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rulemaking "Rulemaking"), forcing it to make labor law on an inefficient, time-consuming case-by-case basis.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGross1981266_72-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGross1981266-72">[72]</a></sup> As of 1981, NLRB was still the only federal agency forbidden to seek economic information about the impact of its activities.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGross1981264–65_73-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGross1981264%E2%80%9365-73">[73]</a></sup>

The second chairman of the NLRB, [Harry A. Millis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_A._Millis "Harry A. Millis"), led the board in a much more moderate direction.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELambert2005104_70-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTELambert2005104-70">[70]</a></sup> Lacking an economic division to give it ammunition to fight with Millis deliberately made the NLRB dependent on Congress and the executive branch for its survival.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGross1981261_74-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGross1981261-74">[74]</a></sup> Millis made a large number of organizational changes. He stripped the office of Secretary of its power, set up an Administrative Division to supervise the 22 regional offices, initiated a study of the board's administrative procedures, and genuinely delegated power to the regional offices.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGross1981229_75-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGross1981229-75">[75]</a></sup> He removed casehandling and regional office communication from the jurisdiction of the Office of the Secretary and created a Field Division.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTETomlins1985225_76-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTETomlins1985225-76">[76]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-77"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-77">[77]</a></sup> He also adopted procedures requiring the board made its decisions based solely on the trial examiner's report, authorized NLRB review attorneys to review trial examiner report, required decisions to be drafted ahead of time and distributed for review, authorized review attorneys to revise drafts before a final decision was issued, required trial examiners to emphasize findings of fact and to address points of law, and began holding board meetings when there were differences of opinion over decisions.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTETomlins1985225_76-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTETomlins1985225-76">[76]</a></sup>

Millis eliminated the Review Division's decisive role in cases, which had been established under Madden and Witt.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTETomlins1985226_78-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTETomlins1985226-78">[78]</a></sup> Madden and Witt had adopted a highly centralized board structure so that (generally speaking) only the cases most favorable to the board made it to the courts. The centralized structure meant that only the strongest cases made it to national board, so that the board could apply all its economic and legal powers to crafting the best decision possible. This strategy enabled the NLRB to defend itself very well before the Supreme Court. But Madden and Witt had held on to the centralized strategy too long, and made political enemies in the process. Millis substituted a decentralized process in which the board was less a decision-maker and more a provider of services to the regions.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTETomlins1985226_78-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTETomlins1985226-78">[78]</a></sup> Many of the changes Millis instituted were designed to mimic requirements placed on other agencies by the [Administrative Procedure Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_Procedure_Act_(United_States) "Administrative Procedure Act (United States)").<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGross1981264_65-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGross1981264-65">[65]</a></sup>

American entry into World War II on December 8, 1941, significantly changed the NLRB. On January 12, 1942, President Roosevelt created the [National War Labor Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_War_Labor_Board_(1942%E2%80%931945) "National War Labor Board (1942–1945)") (NWLB), which displaced the NLRB as the main focus of federal labor relations for the duration of the war. The NWLB was given the authority to "finally determine" any labor dispute which threatened to interrupt war production, and to stabilize union wages and benefits during the war. Although Roosevelt instructed the NWLB not to intrude on jurisdiction exercised by the NLRB, the War Labor Board refused to honor this request. From 1942 to 1945, Millis tried to secure a jurisdictional agreement with NWLB Chairman George W. Taylor. But these discussions proved fruitless, and Millis broke them off in June 1945. The NWLB also heavily raided the NLRB for staff, significantly hindering NLRB operations.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGross1981243_79-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGross1981243-79">[79]</a></sup>

Additional changes came with the passage of the [War Labor Disputes Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Labor_Disputes_Act "War Labor Disputes Act") (WLDA) on June 25, 1943. Enacted over Roosevelt's veto after 400,000 coal miners, their wages significantly lower due to high wartime inflation, struck for a $2-a-day wage increase,<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMalsberger2000104_80-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMalsberger2000104-80">[80]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKaratnycky2000115_81-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKaratnycky2000115-81">[81]</a></sup> the legislation (in part) required the NLRB to issue a ballot outlining all the collective bargaining proposals and counter-proposals, wait 30 days, and then hold a strike vote.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGross1981244_82-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGross1981244-82">[82]</a></sup> The War Labor Disputes Act proved very burdensome. The NLRB processed 2,000 WLDA cases from 1943 to the end of 1945, of which 500 were strike votes. The act's strike vote procedures did little to stop strikes, however, and Millis feared unions were using the referendums to whip up pro-strike feelings among their members. Millis also believed the law's strike vote process permitted more strikes to occur than the NLRB would have allowed under its old procedures. There were so many strike vote filings in the six months after the war ended that NLRB actually shut down its long-distance telephone lines, cancelled all out of town travel, suspended all public hearings, and suspended all other business to accommodate the workload.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGross1981245_83-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGross1981245-83">[83]</a></sup> By early 1945, Millis was in ill health.<sup id="cite_ref-84"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-84">[84]</a></sup> He resigned from the NLRB on June 7, 1945,<sup id="cite_ref-85"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-85">[85]</a></sup> and [Paul M.

### 1947–1965: Taft–Hartley\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_Labor_Relations_Board&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: 1947–1965: Taft–Hartley")\]

A major turning point in the history of the NLRB came in 1947 with passage of the [Taft–Hartley Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taft%E2%80%93Hartley_Act "Taft–Hartley Act"). Disruptions caused by strikes during World War II as well as the huge wave of strikes that followed the end of the war fueled a growing movement in 1946 and 1947 to amend the NLRA to correct what critics saw as a pro-labor tilt in federal law.<sup id="cite_ref-86"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-86">[86]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGross1981251–52_87-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGross1981251%E2%80%9352-87">[87]</a></sup> Drafted by the powerful Republican Senator [Robert A. Taft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Taft "Robert A. Taft") and the strongly anti-union Representative [Fred A. Hartley Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_A._Hartley_Jr. "Fred A. Hartley Jr."), the Taft–Hartley Act banned jurisdictional strikes, [wildcat strikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcat_strike_action "Wildcat strike action"), political strikes, [secondary boycotts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_action "Secondary action"), secondary picketing, mass picketing, union campaign donations made from dues money, the [closed shop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_shop "Closed shop"), and unions of supervisors. The act also enumerated new employer rights, defined union-committed ULPs, gave states the right to opt out of federal labor law through [right-to-work laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-to-work_law "Right-to-work law"), required unions to give an 80-days' strike notice in all cases, established procedures for the president to end a strike in a national emergency, and required all union officials to sign an anti-Communist oath. Organizationally, the act made the general counsel a presidential appointee, independent of the board itself, and gave the general counsel limited powers to seek injunctions without referring to the Justice Department. It also banned the NLRB from engaging in any mediation or conciliation, and formally enshrined in law the ban on hiring personnel to do economic data collection or analysis.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGross1981264_65-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGross1981264-65">[65]</a></sup>

In August 1947, [Robert N. Denham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_N._Denham "Robert N. Denham") became the NLRB's [general counsel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_counsel "General counsel"). He held "conservative views" and wielded "considerable influence" on labor-management relations and interpretations of the newly passed Taft–Hartley Act. In 1950, US President [Harry S.

Herzog publicly admitted the need for some change in the NLRA, but privately he opposed the proposed Taft–Hartley amendments. He felt the communist oath provisions were unconstitutional, that the amendments would turn the NLRA into a management weapon, that creation of an independent general counsel would weaken the NLRB, and that the law's dismantling of the agency's economic analysis unit deprived the NLRB of essential expertise.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGross201011–13_94-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGross201011%E2%80%9313-94">[94]</a></sup> Nonetheless, Congress overrode Truman's veto of the Taft–Hartley Act on June 23, 1947, and the bill became law.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELee1980101–03_95-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTELee1980101%E2%80%9303-95">[95]</a></sup>

The Taft–Hartley Act fundamentally changed the nature of federal labor law, but it also seriously hindered the NLRB's ability to enforce the law. The loss of the mediation function left the NLRB unable to become involved in labor disputes, a function it had engaged in since its inception as the National Labor Board in 1933. This hindered the agency's efforts to study, analyze, and create bulwarks against [bad-faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_faith "Good faith") [collective bargaining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_bargaining "Collective bargaining"); reduced its ability to formulate national labor policy in this area; and left the agency making labor law on an ineffective, time-consuming case-by-case basis.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELambert2005104_70-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTELambert2005104-70">[70]</a></sup> The separation of the general counsel from supervision by the national board also had significant impact on the agency. This separation was enacted against the advice of the Justice Department, contradicted the policy Congress had enacted in the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946, and ignored Millis' extensive internal reforms. The change left the NLRB as the only federal agency unable to coordinate its decision-making and legal activities, and the only agency exempted in this manner under the Administrative Procedure Act. The separation of the general counsel was not discussed by the committee or by any witnesses during the legislation's mark-up. Indeed, there was no basis for it at all in the public record.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGross1981264_65-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGross1981264-65">[65]</a></sup> It was, in the words of sociologist Robin Stryker, "little-noted" and "unprecedented".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEStryker1989344_23-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStryker1989344-23">[23]</a></sup>

The anti-communist oath provisions generated extensive public debate, and generated disputes before the Supreme Court several times. The Taft–Hartley oath first reached the court in _[American Communications Ass'n v. Douds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Communications_Ass%27n_v._Douds "American Communications Ass'n v. Douds")_, [339](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_cases,_volume_339 "List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 339") [U.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Reports "United States Reports") 382 (1950), in which the court held 5-to-1 that the oath did not violate the [First Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"), was not an _[ex post facto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_post_facto "Ex post facto")_ law or [bill of attainder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_attainder "Bill of attainder") in violation of [Article One, Section 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Section_10:_Limits_on_the_States "Article One of the United States Constitution"), and was not a "test oath" in violation of [Article Six](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Six_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Oaths "Article Six of the United States Constitution"). The issue again came before the court in _[Garner v. Board of Public Works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garner_v._Board_of_Public_Works "Garner v. Board of Public Works")_, [341](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_cases,_volume_341 "List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 341") [U.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Reports "United States Reports") 716 (1951), in which the court unanimously held that a municipal [loyalty oath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalty_oath "Loyalty oath") was not an _ex post facto law_ or bill of attainder. It came before the court yet a third time in _Wieman v. Updegraff_, [344](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_cases,_volume_344 "List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 344") [U.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Reports "United States Reports") 183 (1952). This time, the outcome was radically different. The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that state loyalty oath legislation violated the [due process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process "Due process") clause of the [Fourteenth Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution "Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution"). In 1965, the Supreme Court held 5-to-4 that the anti-communist oath was a bill of attainder in _[United States v. Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Brown_(1965) "United States v. Brown (1965)")_, [381](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_cases,_volume_381 "List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 381") [U.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Reports "United States Reports") 437 (1965).<sup id="cite_ref-96"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-96">[96]</a></sup> The Supreme Court essentially overturned _Douds_, but did not formally do so.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERabinowitz199656_97-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FOOTNOTERabinowitz199656-97">[97]</a></sup>

In 1949, the NLRB instated the [Joy Silk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_Silk "Joy Silk") doctrine, which held that "if a union provides evidence that a majority of workers want to unionize", the employer should recognize the union unless they have "good faith doubt" regarding that evidence. Further, "if there's an unfair labor practice, meaning the employer broke the law, then it is presumed that the workers wanted to join a union".<sup id="cite_ref-toussaint_98-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-toussaint-98">[98]</a></sup> The doctrine was replaced by the Gissel doctrine in 1969 following _[NLRB v.

In 1974, Congress amended the National Labor Relations Act to protect employees of non-profit hospitals and allow the board to adjudicate their claims. The 1935 Wagner Act had protected non-profit hospital workers, but the Taft–Hartley Act removed those protections in 1947. Congress had expressed concern about the impact of potential labor strikes on patient care, but decided that the proposed legislation was an appropriate compromise.<sup id="cite_ref-auto_100-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-auto-100">[100]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-101"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-101">[101]</a></sup>

In July 1987, the board began work on a comprehensive regulation for collective-bargaining units in health care organizations. The board held 14 days of hearings and considered testimony from 144 witnesses and over 1,800 public comments, and finally issued the rule in April 1989. The rule was challenged in court and ultimately reached the Supreme Court, which unanimously upheld the rule in April 1991.<sup id="cite_ref-auto_100-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-auto-100">[100]</a></sup>

### Since 2015\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_Labor_Relations_Board&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Since 2015")\]

Change in leadership: In 2017, the NLRB's leadership shifted when President Donald Trump nominated and the Senate confirmed new members, changing the board's composition to a 3–2 Republican majority.

Graduate students' right to unionize: In August 2016, the NLRB ruled that graduate students who worked as teaching or research assistants at private universities had the right to unionize under federal labor law.

Boeing decision: In 2018, the NLRB issued a decision in The Boeing Company case, which made it easier for employers to justify policies that restrict employees' rights to engage in protected concerted activity. Joint employer standard: In December 2017, the NLRB overturned an Obama-era decision that expanded the joint employer standard, which held employers liable for labor violations committed by their subcontractors or franchisees.

Independent contractor status: In January 2019, the NLRB issued a decision that clarified the test for determining whether workers are independent contractors or employees under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).

Joint employer standard reinstated: In 2020, the NLRB reinstated the joint employer standard that had been overturned in 2017, making it easier for employees to hold companies liable for labor violations committed by their subcontractors or franchisees.

In 2023, in response to the company [Cemex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cemex "Cemex") having been found guilty of illegal labor practices by interfering with a union election, the NLRB instated a new policy meant to deter election interference. Under the new policy if a majority of workers demonstrate support for a union, the company must recognize them or ask the NLRB to conduct an election. However, if they commit unfair labor practices, the union will automatically be recognized, and the company will be required to bargain.<sup id="cite_ref-131"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-131">[131]</a></sup> This differs from the then-defunct [Joy Silk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_Silk "Joy Silk") standard, which had required employers to recognize a union unless they had a good-faith doubt that the union had majority employee support. Nonetheless, Cemex was noted as a significant strengthening of union protections and a partial revival of Joy Silk.<sup id="cite_ref-132"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-132">[132]</a></sup>

Union members picketing NLRB rulings outside the agency's [Washington, D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C. "Washington, D.C."), headquarters in November 2007

In 1947, the [Taft–Hartley Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taft%E2%80%93Hartley_Act "Taft–Hartley Act") created a formal administrative distinction between the board and the general counsel of the NLRB. In broad terms, the general counsel is responsible for investigating and prosecuting [unfair labor practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfair_labor_practice "Unfair labor practice") claims and for the general supervision of the NLRB field offices.<sup id="cite_ref-135"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-135">[135]</a></sup> The general counsel is appointed by the president to a four-year term and independent from the board; it has limited independence to argue for a change in the law in presenting cases to the board. The general counsel oversees four divisions: the Division of Operations Management, the Division of Administration, the Division of Advice, and the Division of Enforcement Litigation.

The board, on the other hand, is the adjudicative body that decides the unfair labor practice cases brought to it. Once the board has decided the issue, it is the general counsel's responsibility to uphold the board's decision, even if it is contrary to the position it advocated when presenting the case to the board. The board is also responsible for the administration of the Act's provisions governing the holding of elections and resolution of jurisdictional disputes. It is a reactive and not a proactive power. The NLRB rarely promulgates administrative rules.<sup id="cite_ref-136"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-136">[136]</a></sup>

The board has more than thirty regional offices. The regional offices conduct elections, investigate unfair labor practice charges, and make the initial determination on those charges (whether to dismiss, settle, or issue complaints). The board has jurisdiction to hold elections and prosecute violations of the Act in [Puerto Rico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico "Puerto Rico") and [American Samoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Samoa "American Samoa").

### Jurisdiction\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_Labor_Relations_Board&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Jurisdiction")\]

The board's [jurisdiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction "Jurisdiction") is limited to [private sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector "Private sector") employees and the [United States Postal Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service "United States Postal Service"); other than Postal Service employees, it has no authority over labor relations disputes involving governmental, [railroad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railroad "Railroad") and [airline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline "Airline") employees covered by the [Adamson Railway Labor Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adamson_Railway_Labor_Act "Adamson Railway Labor Act"), or agricultural employees. On the other hand, in those parts of the private sector its jurisdictional standards are low enough to reach almost all employers whose business has any appreciable impact on [interstate commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_commerce "Interstate commerce").

### Processing of charges\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_Labor_Relations_Board&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Processing of charges")\]

Charges are filed by parties against unions or employers with the appropriate regional office. The regional office will investigate the complaint. If a violation is believed to exist, the region will take the case before an [Administrative Law Judge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_Law_Judge "Administrative Law Judge") who will conduct a hearing. The decision of the Administrative Law Judge may be reviewed by the five member board. Board decisions are reviewable by [United States Courts of Appeals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Courts_of_Appeals "United States Courts of Appeals"). The board's decisions are not self-executing: it must seek court enforcement in order to force a recalcitrant party to comply with its orders.<sup id="cite_ref-137"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-137">[137]</a></sup> (For greater detail on this process see the entry for [unfair labor practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfair_labor_practice "Unfair labor practice").)

## General counsel\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_Labor_Relations_Board&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: General counsel")\]

[Lafe Solomon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lafe_Solomon "Lafe Solomon") was named acting general counsel on June 21, 2010. His nomination was sent to the Senate on January 5, 2011. Solomon's authority came into question on August 13, 2013, when Judge [Benjamin Settle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Settle "Benjamin Settle") for the [United States District Court for the Western District of Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Western_District_of_Washington "United States District Court for the Western District of Washington") denied a petition for [injunctive relief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_restraining_order#Injunctions_in_US_labor_law_context "Temporary restraining order"), ruling that Solomon had not been properly appointed under the [Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Vacancies_Reform_Act_of_1998 "Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998") (FVRA).<sup id="cite_ref-138"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-138">[138]</a></sup> Although other [district courts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court "United States district court") had enforced Solomon's requests, Settle's decision called into question all of Solomon's activity since June 21, 2010, focusing on subsections (a)(1) and (2) of the FVRA; some pundits claimed that Solomon's appointment was allowed under subsection (a)(3).<sup id="cite_ref-139"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-139">[139]</a></sup> President Obama withdrew Solomon's nomination.<sup id="cite_ref-vail_140-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-vail-140">[140]</a></sup>

On July 31, 2013, President Obama nominated former NLRB nominee Richard Griffin as general counsel, calling Griffin "a kind of prosecutor at the board" who would fill "one of the most critical roles at the agency."<sup id="cite_ref-huffingtonpost_2013_141-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-huffingtonpost_2013-141">[141]</a></sup> The Senate approved Griffin's nomination on October 29, 2013, by a vote of 55 to 44.<sup id="cite_ref-142"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-142">[142]</a></sup>

[Peter B. Robb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_B._Robb "Peter B. Robb") was nominated by President [Donald J. Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_J._Trump "Donald J. Trump") in September 2017 and was confirmed by the [U.S. Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate "United States Senate") on November 8, 2017. He was sworn in as general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board on November 17, 2017, for a four-year term. Immediately following [President Joe Biden's inauguration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_Joe_Biden "Inauguration of Joe Biden") on January 20, 2021, the White House sent a letter to Robb requesting his resignation. Just hours later, Robb refused.<sup id="cite_ref-robb-letter-jan-21_143-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-robb-letter-jan-21-143">[143]</a></sup> He was fired that evening.<sup id="cite_ref-bl-ke-robb-jan-20-2021_144-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-bl-ke-robb-jan-20-2021-144">[144]</a></sup> Unions had wished for Robb to be replaced so that previous agency procedure could be restored; supporters of the firing argued that it was legal, citing the recent Supreme Court decision in _[Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seila_Law_LLC_v._Consumer_Financial_Protection_Bureau "Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau")_ (2020).<sup id="cite_ref-bl-ke-robb-jan-20-2021_144-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-bl-ke-robb-jan-20-2021-144">[144]</a></sup> The general counsel had never been fired previously.<sup id="cite_ref-Law360GCFired_145-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-Law360GCFired-145">[145]</a></sup>

On January 25, 2021, President Biden appointed Peter Sung Ohr, a veteran employee of the NLRB, to serve as acting general counsel.<sup id="cite_ref-146"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-146">[146]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-147"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-147">[147]</a></sup> On February 17, 2021, Biden nominated [Jennifer Abruzzo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Abruzzo "Jennifer Abruzzo"), a former acting general counsel of the NLRB, to serve as the new general counsel.<sup id="cite_ref-148"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-148">[148]</a></sup> Her nomination was confirmed by the Senate on July 21, 2021, in a 51–50 vote, with Vice President [Kamala Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris "Kamala Harris") [breaking the tie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tie-breaking_votes_cast_by_the_vice_president_of_the_United_States "List of tie-breaking votes cast by the vice president of the United States") in her favor.<sup id="cite_ref-149"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-149">[149]</a></sup> Her four-year team in office began on July 22, 2021.

### Chairpersons\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_Labor_Relations_Board&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Chairpersons")\]

J. Warren Madden, the first chairman of the NLRB, working at his desk at the NLRB in Washington, D.C., in June 1937

The president designates one member of the board to serve as chairman. Chairmen serve [at the pleasure of the president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_the_pleasure_of_the_President "At the pleasure of the President"), and the president can designate another member as chairman at any time.<sup id="cite_ref-164"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-164">[164]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-165"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-165">[165]</a></sup> The chairman's powers are limited. The chairman, like other board members, has a chief legal counsel and a legal staff.<sup id="cite_ref-FedReg_166-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-FedReg-166">[166]</a></sup> Except for certain limited and purely administrative functions (such as being the recipient of appeals or [Freedom of Information Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act_(United_States) "Freedom of Information Act (United States)") requests),<sup id="cite_ref-167"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-167">[167]</a></sup> one former NLRB Chairman has said "the chairmanship—given the authority of the general counsel to appoint regional staff and recommend regional directors to the entire board (not just to the chairman)—is more like a bully pulpit than a position of authority."<sup id="cite_ref-168"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-168">[168]</a></sup> The chairman does, however, work with the [Office of Management and Budget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Management_and_Budget "Office of Management and Budget") to craft the NLRB's budget proposal to Congress, may propose to the board changes to NLRB procedures and guidance manuals, and may propose that the board engage in [rulemaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rulemaking "Rulemaking").<sup id="cite_ref-Gould2_169-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-Gould2-169">[169]</a></sup>

From 1935 to 1953, it was customary for the chairman (like all members of the NLRB) to be a neutral career government employee rather than an advocate of either [labor unions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union "Trade union") or management.<sup id="cite_ref-170"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-170">[170]</a></sup> President [Dwight Eisenhower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_Eisenhower "Dwight Eisenhower")'s appointment of Guy Farmer in 1953 broke this two-decade-old tradition (Farmer was a management attorney).<sup id="cite_ref-Flynn_171-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-Flynn-171">[171]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-172"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-172">[172]</a></sup> Presidents [John F. Kennedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy "John F. Kennedy") and [Lyndon B. Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson "Lyndon B. Johnson") both returned to the tradition of appointing neutral third parties to the position of board chairman, but President [Richard M. Nixon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_M._Nixon "Richard M. Nixon") appointed a management-side attorney.<sup id="cite_ref-Flynn_171-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-Flynn-171">[171]</a></sup> The board as a whole was under intense Congressional scrutiny from its inception until the 1960s.<sup id="cite_ref-Bodah_173-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-Bodah-173">[173]</a></sup> This ended in the 1960s and 1970s, but resumed in the 1980s.<sup id="cite_ref-Bodah_173-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-Bodah-173">[173]</a></sup> Subsequent appointments to the position of chairman have been heavily partisan and from either a strongly pro-union or pro-management position.<sup id="cite_ref-Gould2_169-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board#cite_note-Gould2-169">[169]</a></sup>
