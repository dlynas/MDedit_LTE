He wrote on [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy"), [political theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_philosophy "Political philosophy"), [sociology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology "Sociology"), [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History "History"), and [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics "Linguistics"). He was a founding member and one-time leader of the [Italian Communist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Communist_Party "Italian Communist Party"). A vocal critic of [Benito Mussolini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini "Benito Mussolini") and [fascism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism "Fascism"), he was imprisoned in 1926 where he remained until his death in 1937.

During his imprisonment, Gramsci wrote more than 30 notebooks and 3,000 pages of history and analysis. His _[Prison Notebooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_Notebooks "Prison Notebooks")_ are considered a highly original contribution to 20th-century [political theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_theory "Political theory").<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESassoon1991d446_4-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-FOOTNOTESassoon1991d446-4">[4]</a></sup> Gramsci drew insights from varying sources — not only other [Marxists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxists "Marxists") but also thinkers such as [Niccolò Machiavelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Machiavelli "Niccolò Machiavelli"), [Vilfredo Pareto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilfredo_Pareto "Vilfredo Pareto"), [Georges Sorel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Sorel "Georges Sorel"), and [Benedetto Croce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedetto_Croce "Benedetto Croce"). The notebooks cover a wide range of topics, including the [history of Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Italy "History of Italy") and [Italian nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_nationalism "Italian nationalism"), the [French Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution "French Revolution"), [fascism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism "Fascism"), [Taylorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylorism "Taylorism") and [Fordism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fordism "Fordism"), [civil society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society "Civil society"), the [state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(polity) "State (polity)"), [historical materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_materialism "Historical materialism"), [folklore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore "Folklore"), [religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion "Religion"), and [high](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_culture "High culture") and [popular culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture "Popular culture").

Gramsci is best known for his theory of [cultural hegemony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_hegemony "Cultural hegemony"), which describes how the state and ruling capitalist class — the [bourgeoisie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeoisie "Bourgeoisie") — use cultural institutions to maintain wealth and power in capitalist societies. In Gramsci's view, the bourgeoisie develops a hegemonic culture using [ideology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology "Ideology") rather than violence, economic force, or coercion. He also attempted to break from the [economic determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_determinism "Economic determinism") of [orthodox Marxist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Marxist "Orthodox Marxist") thought, and so is sometimes described as a [neo-Marxist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Marxist "Neo-Marxist").<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHaralambosHolborn2013597–598_5-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHaralambosHolborn2013597%E2%80%93598-5">[5]</a></sup> He held a [humanistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanistic "Humanistic") understanding of Marxism, seeing it as a philosophy of [praxis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praxis_(process) "Praxis (process)") and an absolute [historicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicism "Historicism") that transcends traditional [materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism "Materialism") and traditional [idealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism "Idealism").

### Early life\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antonio_Gramsci&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Early life")\]

Gramsci was born in [Ales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ales,_Sardinia "Ales, Sardinia"), in the [province of Oristano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Oristano "Province of Oristano"), on the island of [Sardinia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardinia "Sardinia"), the fourth of seven sons of Francesco Gramsci (1860–1937) and Giuseppina Marcias (1861–1932).<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> Francesco Gramsci was born in the small town of [Gaeta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaeta "Gaeta"), in the [province of Latina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Latina "Province of Latina"), [Lazio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazio "Lazio") (today in the [central Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Italian "Central Italian") region of Lazio but at the time Gaeta was still part of [Terra di Lavoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_di_Lavoro "Terra di Lavoro") of [Southern Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Italy "Southern Italy")), to a well-off family from the southern Italian regions of [Campania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campania "Campania") and [Calabria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabria "Calabria") and of [Arbëreshë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arb%C3%ABresh%C3%AB_people "Arbëreshë people") (Italo-Albanian) descent.<sup id="cite_ref-IGS_7-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-IGS-7">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> Gramsci himself believed that his father's family had left [Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania "Albania") as recently as 1821.<sup id="cite_ref-Pipa234_9-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-Pipa234-9">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> The Albanian origin of his father's family is attested in the surname Gramsci, an Italianised form of _Gramshi_, that stems from the definite noun of the placename [Gramsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramsh_(municipality) "Gramsh (municipality)"), a small town in central-eastern Albania.<sup id="cite_ref-Manzelli161_12-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-Manzelli161-12">[12]</a></sup> Gramsci's mother belonged to a [Sardinian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardinian_people "Sardinian people") landowning family from [Sorgono](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorgono "Sorgono"), in the [province of Nuoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Nuoro "Province of Nuoro").<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> Francesco Gramsci worked as a low-level official,<sup id="cite_ref-IGS_7-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-IGS-7">[7]</a></sup> and his financial difficulties and troubles with the police forced the family to move about through several villages in Sardinia until they finally settled in [Ghilarza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghilarza "Ghilarza").<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHoareSmith1971xviii_14-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHoareSmith1971xviii-14">[14]</a></sup>

In 1898, Gramsci's father was convicted of [embezzlement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embezzlement "Embezzlement") and imprisoned, reducing his family to destitution. The young Gramsci had to abandon schooling and work at various casual jobs until his father's release in 1904.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHoareSmith1971xviii–xix_15-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHoareSmith1971xviii%E2%80%93xix-15">[15]</a></sup> As a boy, Gramsci suffered from health problems, particularly a malformation of the spine that stunted his growth, as his adult height was less than 5 feet,<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> and left him seriously hunchbacked. For decades, it was reported that his condition had been due to a childhood accident — specifically, having been dropped by a nanny — but more recently it has been suggested that it was due to [Pott disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pott_disease "Pott disease"),<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> a form of tuberculosis that can cause deformity of the spine. Gramsci was also plagued by various internal disorders throughout his life.

Gramsci started secondary school in [Santu Lussurgiu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santu_Lussurgiu "Santu Lussurgiu") and completed it in [Cagliari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cagliari "Cagliari"),<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESantangelo2021216_18-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-FOOTNOTESantangelo2021216-18">[18]</a></sup> where he lodged with his elder brother Gennaro, a former soldier whose time on the mainland had made him a militant [socialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist "Socialist"). At the time, Gramsci's sympathies then did not yet lie with socialism but rather with Sardinian autonomism,<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> as well as the grievances of impoverished Sardinian peasants and miners, whose mistreatment by the mainlanders would later deeply contribute to his intellectual growth.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHoareSmith1971xix_20-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHoareSmith1971xix-20">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> They perceived their neglect as a result of privileges enjoyed by the rapidly industrialising [Northern Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Italy "Northern Italy"), and they tended to turn to a growing [Sardinian nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardinian_nationalism "Sardinian nationalism"), brutally repressed by troops from the Italian mainland,<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> as a response.<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup>

### Turin\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antonio_Gramsci&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Turin")\]

In 1911, Gramsci won a scholarship to study at the [University of Turin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Turin "University of Turin"), sitting the exam at the same time as [Palmiro Togliatti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmiro_Togliatti "Palmiro Togliatti").<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHoareSmith1971xx_25-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHoareSmith1971xx-25">[25]</a></sup> At [Turin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turin "Turin"), he read literature and took a keen interest in [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics "Linguistics"), which he studied under [Matteo Bartoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matteo_Bartoli "Matteo Bartoli"). Gramsci was in Turin as it was going through industrialization, with the [Fiat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat "Fiat") and [Lancia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancia "Lancia") factories recruiting workers from poorer regions. Trade unions became established, and the first industrial social conflicts started to emerge.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHoareSmith1971xxv_26-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHoareSmith1971xxv-26">[26]</a></sup> Gramsci frequented socialist circles as well as associating with Sardinian emigrants on the Italian mainland. Both his earlier experiences in Sardinia and his environment on the mainland shaped his worldview. Gramsci joined the [Italian Socialist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Socialist_Party "Italian Socialist Party") (PSI) in late 1913, where he would later occupy a key position and observe from Turin the [Russian Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution "Russian Revolution").<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup>

Although showing a talent for his studies, Gramsci had financial problems and poor health. Together with his growing political commitment, these led to him abandoning his education in early 1915, at age 24. By this time he had acquired an extensive knowledge of history and philosophy. At university, he had come into contact with the thought of [Antonio Labriola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Labriola "Antonio Labriola"), [Rodolfo Mondolfo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodolfo_Mondolfo "Rodolfo Mondolfo"), [Giovanni Gentile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Gentile "Giovanni Gentile"), and most importantly, [Benedetto Croce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedetto_Croce "Benedetto Croce"), possibly the most widely respected Italian intellectual of his day. Labriola especially propounded a brand of [Hegelian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegelian "Hegelian") Marxism that he labelled "philosophy of [praxis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praxis_(process) "Praxis (process)")".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHoareSmith1971xxi_28-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHoareSmith1971xxi-28">[28]</a></sup> Although Gramsci later used this phrase to escape the prison censors, his relationship with this current of thought was ambiguous throughout his life.

From 1914 onward, Gramsci's writings for socialist newspapers such as _Il Grido del Popolo_ ([The Cry of the People](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Cry_of_the_People&action=edit&redlink=1 "The Cry of the People (page does not exist)") \[[it](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_Grido_del_Popolo "it:Il Grido del Popolo")\]) earned him a reputation as a notable journalist. In 1916 he became co-editor of the [Piedmont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piedmont "Piedmont") edition of [_Avanti!_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avanti!_(Italian_newspaper) "Avanti! (Italian newspaper)"), the Socialist Party official organ. An articulate and prolific writer of political theory, Gramsci proved a formidable commentator, writing on all aspects of Turin's social and political events.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHoareSmith1971xxx_29-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHoareSmith1971xxx-29">[29]</a></sup> Gramsci was at this time also involved in the education and organisation of Turin workers; he spoke in public for the first time in 1916 and gave talks on topics such as [Romain Rolland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romain_Rolland "Romain Rolland"), the [French Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution "French Revolution"), the [Paris Commune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Commune "Paris Commune"), and [the emancipation of women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism "Feminism"). In the wake of the arrest of Socialist Party leaders that followed revolutionary riots in August 1917, Gramsci became one of Turin's leading socialists; he was elected to the party's provisional committee and also made editor of _Il Grido del Popolo_.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHoareSmith1971xxx–xxxi_30-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHoareSmith1971xxx%E2%80%93xxxi-30">[30]</a></sup>

In April 1919, with Togliatti, [Angelo Tasca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelo_Tasca "Angelo Tasca") and [Umberto Terracini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umberto_Terracini "Umberto Terracini"), Gramsci set up the weekly newspaper _[L'Ordine Nuovo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Ordine_Nuovo "L'Ordine Nuovo")_ (The New Order). In October the same year, despite being divided into various hostile factions, the PSI moved by a large majority to join the [Third International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_International "Third International"). [Vladimir Lenin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin "Vladimir Lenin") saw the _L'Ordine Nuovo_ group as closest in orientation to the [Bolsheviks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsheviks "Bolsheviks"), and it received his backing against the anti-parliamentary programme of a [left communist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_communist "Left communist"), [Amadeo Bordiga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadeo_Bordiga "Amadeo Bordiga").<sup id="cite_ref-Kolakowski1_31-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-Kolakowski1-31">[31]</a></sup>

In the course of tactical debates within the party, Gramsci's group mainly stood out due to its advocacy of [workers' councils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers%27_council "Workers' council"), which had come into existence in Turin spontaneously during the large strikes of 1919 and 1920. For Gramsci, these councils were the proper means of enabling workers to take control of the task of organising production, and saw them as preparing "the whole class for the aims of conquest and government".<sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup> Although he believed his position at this time to be in keeping with Lenin's policy of "All Power to the Soviets",<sup id="cite_ref-33"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup> his stance that these Italian councils were [communist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist "Communist") rather than just one organ of political struggle against the bourgeoisie, was attacked by Bordiga for betraying a [syndicalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndicalist "Syndicalist") tendency influenced by the thought of [Georges Sorel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Sorel "Georges Sorel") and [Daniel De Leon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_De_Leon "Daniel De Leon"). By the time of the defeat of the Turin workers in spring 1920, Gramsci was almost alone in his defence of the councils.

### Communist Party of Italy\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antonio_Gramsci&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Communist Party of Italy")\]

The failure of the workers' councils to develop into a national movement convinced Gramsci that a [Communist party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_party "Communist party") in the [Leninist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leninist "Leninist") sense was needed. The group around _L'Ordine Nuovo_ declaimed incessantly against the PSI's centrist leadership and ultimately allied with Bordiga's far larger abstentionist faction. On 21 January 1921, in the town of [Livorno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livorno "Livorno") (Leghorn), the [Communist Party of Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Italy "Communist Party of Italy") (_Partito Comunista d'Italia_, PCd'I) was founded. In opposition to Bordiga, Gramsci supported the _[Arditi del Popolo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arditi_del_Popolo "Arditi del Popolo")_, a militant anti-fascist group which struggled against the [Blackshirts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackshirts "Blackshirts"). Gramsci would be a leader of the party from its inception but was subordinate to Bordiga, whose emphasis on discipline, centralism and purity of principles dominated the party's programme until the latter lost the leadership in 1924.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHoareSmith1971xlvi_34-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHoareSmith1971xlvi-34">[34]</a></sup> In 1922, Gramsci travelled to Russia as a representative of the new party. Here, he met Julia Schucht (Yulia Apollonovna Schucht, 1896–1980), a young violinist whom he married in 1923 and with whom he had two sons, Delio (1924–1982) and Giuliano (1926–2007).<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> Gramsci never saw his second son.<sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup>

A commemorative plaque for Gramsci in [Mokhovaya Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mokhovaya_Street "Mokhovaya Street") 16, Moscow. Translated, the inscription reads: "In this building in 1922–1923 worked the eminent figure of international communism and the labour movement and founder of the Italian Communist Party, Antonio Gramsci."

The Russian mission coincided with the advent of fascism in Italy, and Gramsci returned with instructions to foster, against the wishes of the PCd'I leadership, a [united front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_front "United front") of leftist parties against fascism. Such a front would ideally have had the PCd'I at its centre, through which Moscow would have controlled all the leftist forces, but others disputed this potential supremacy, as socialists had a significant, while communists seemed relatively young and too radical. Many believed that an eventual coalition led by communists would have functioned too remotely from political debate, and thus would have run the risk of isolation.

In late 1922 and early 1923, [Benito Mussolini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini "Benito Mussolini")'s government embarked on a campaign of repression against the opposition parties, arresting most of the PCd'I leadership, including Bordiga. At the end of 1923, Gramsci travelled from Moscow to [Vienna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna "Vienna"), where he tried to revive a party torn by factional strife. In 1924, Gramsci, now recognised as head of the PCd'I, gained election as a deputy for the [Veneto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneto "Veneto"). He started organizing the launch of the official newspaper of the party, called _[L'Unità](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Unit%C3%A0 "L'Unità")_ (Unity), living in Rome while his family stayed in Moscow. At its Lyon Congress in January 1926, Gramsci's theses calling for a united front to restore democracy to Italy were adopted by the party.

In 1926, [Joseph Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin "Joseph Stalin")'s manoeuvres inside the Bolshevik party moved Gramsci to write a letter to the [Comintern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comintern "Comintern") in which he deplored the opposition led by [Leon Trotsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Trotsky "Leon Trotsky") but also underlined some presumed faults of the leader. Togliatti, in Moscow as a representative of the party, received the letter, opened it, read it, and decided not to deliver it. This caused a difficult conflict between Gramsci and Togliatti which they never completely resolved.<sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup>

On 9 November 1926, the Fascist government enacted a new wave of emergency laws, taking as a pretext an alleged attempt on Mussolini's life that had occurred several days earlier. The Fascist police arrested Gramsci, despite his [parliamentary immunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_immunity "Parliamentary immunity"), and brought him to the Roman prison _[Regina Coeli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regina_Coeli_(prison) "Regina Coeli (prison)")_.

Gramsci's many prison notebooks

Gramsci was one of the most influential Marxist thinkers of the 20th century, and a particularly key thinker in the development of [Western Marxism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Marxism "Western Marxism"). He wrote more than 30 notebooks and 3,000 pages of history and analysis during his imprisonment. These writings, known as the _[Prison Notebooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_Notebooks "Prison Notebooks")_, contain Gramsci's tracing of [Italian history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_history "Italian history") and [nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism "Nationalism"), as well as some ideas in [Marxist theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist_theory "Marxist theory"), [critical theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_theory "Critical theory"), and educational theory associated with his name, such as:

-   [Cultural hegemony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_hegemony "Cultural hegemony") as a means of maintaining and legitimising the [capitalist state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist_state "Capitalist state")
-   The need for [popular workers' education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_education "Popular education") to encourage the development of intellectuals from the working class
-   An analysis of the modern capitalist state that distinguishes between [political society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_society "Political society"), which dominates directly and coercively, and [civil society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society "Civil society"), where leadership is constituted through consent
-   Absolute [historicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicism "Historicism")
-   A critique of [economic determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_determinism "Economic determinism") that opposes [fatalistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalistic "Fatalistic") interpretations of Marxism
-   A critique of [philosophical materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism "Materialism")

### Hegemony\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antonio_Gramsci&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Hegemony")\]

[Hegemony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemony "Hegemony") was a term previously used by Marxists such as [Vladimir Lenin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin "Vladimir Lenin") to denote the political leadership of the working-class in a democratic revolution.<sup id="cite_ref-NLR_46-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-NLR-46">[46]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 15–17">: 15–17 </span></sup>  Gramsci greatly expanded this concept, developing an acute analysis of how the ruling capitalist class — the [bourgeoisie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeoisie "Bourgeoisie") — establishes and maintains its control.<sup id="cite_ref-NLR_46-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-NLR-46">[46]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 20">: 20 </span></sup> 

[Classical Marxism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Marxism "Classical Marxism") had predicted that socialist revolution was inevitable in capitalist societies. By the early 20th century, no such revolution had occurred in the most advanced nations, and those [revolutions of 1917–1923](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1917%E2%80%931923 "Revolutions of 1917–1923"), such as in Germany or the [Biennio Rosso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biennio_Rosso "Biennio Rosso") in Italy, had failed. As capitalism seemed more entrenched than ever, Gramsci suggested that it maintained control not just through violence and political and economic coercion but also through [ideology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology "Ideology"). The [bourgeoisie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeoisie "Bourgeoisie") developed a hegemonic culture, which propagated its own values and norms so that they became the [common sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_sense "Common sense") values of all. People in the working class and other classes identified their own good with the good of the bourgeoisie and helped to maintain the _status quo_ rather than revolting.

To counter the notion that bourgeois values represented natural or normal values for society, the working class needed to develop a culture of its own. While Lenin held that culture was ancillary to political objectives, Gramsci saw it as fundamental to the attainment of power that cultural hegemony be achieved first. In Gramsci's view, a class cannot dominate in modern conditions by merely advancing its own narrow economic interests, and neither can it dominate purely through force and coercion.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESassoon1991c230_47-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-FOOTNOTESassoon1991c230-47">[47]</a></sup> Rather, it must exert intellectual and moral leadership, and make alliances and compromises with a variety of forces.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESassoon1991c230_47-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-FOOTNOTESassoon1991c230-47">[47]</a></sup> Gramsci calls this union of social forces a _historic bloc_, taking a term from [Georges Sorel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Sorel "Georges Sorel"). This bloc forms the basis of consent to a certain social order, which produces and re-produces the hegemony of the dominant class through a nexus of institutions, [social relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation "Social relation"), and ideas.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESassoon1991c230_47-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-FOOTNOTESassoon1991c230-47">[47]</a></sup> In this way, Gramsci's theory emphasized the importance of the political and ideological [superstructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_and_superstructure "Base and superstructure") in both maintaining and fracturing relations of the economic base.

Gramsci stated that bourgeois cultural values were tied to [folklore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore "Folklore"), popular culture and religion, and therefore much of his analysis of hegemonic culture is aimed at these. He was also impressed by the influence that the [Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church "Catholic Church") had and the care it had taken to prevent an excessive gap from developing between the religion of the learned and that of the less educated. Gramsci saw Marxism as a marriage of the purely intellectual critique of religion found in [Renaissance humanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_humanism "Renaissance humanism") and the elements of the [Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformation "Reformation") that had appealed to the masses. For Gramsci, Marxism could supersede religion only if it met people's spiritual needs, and to do so people would have to think of it as an expression of their own experience.

### Intellectuals and education\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antonio_Gramsci&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Intellectuals and education")\]

Gramsci gave much thought to the role of intellectuals in society.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKiernan1991259_48-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKiernan1991259-48">[48]</a></sup> He stated that all men are intellectuals, in that all have intellectual and rational faculties, but not all men have the social function of intellectuals.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGramsci19719_49-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGramsci19719-49">[49]</a></sup> He saw modern intellectuals not as talkers but as practical-minded directors and organisers who produced hegemony through ideological apparatuses such as education and the media. Furthermore, he distinguished between a traditional [intelligentsia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligentsia "Intelligentsia"), which sees itself (in his view, wrongly) as a class apart from society, and the thinking groups that every class produces from its own ranks organically.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKiernan1991259_48-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKiernan1991259-48">[48]</a></sup> Such organic intellectuals do not simply describe social life in accordance with scientific rules but instead articulate, through the language of culture, the feelings and experiences which the masses could not express for themselves. To Gramsci, it was the duty of organic intellectuals to speak to the obscured precepts of folk wisdom, or common sense (_senso comune_), of their respective political spheres. These intellectuals would represent excluded social groups of a society, or what Gramsci referred to as the [subaltern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaltern_(postcolonialism) "Subaltern (postcolonialism)").<sup id="cite_ref-50"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup>

In line with Gramsci's theories of cultural hegemony, he argued that capitalist power needed to be challenged by building a [counter-hegemony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-hegemony "Counter-hegemony"). By this, he meant that, as part of the war of position, the organic intellectuals and others within the working-class, need to develop alternative values and an alternative ideology in contrast to bourgeois ideology. He argued that the reason this had not needed to happen in Russia was because the Russian ruling class did not have genuine cultural hegemony. So the [Bolsheviks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsheviks "Bolsheviks") were able to carry out a war of manoeuvre (the [Russian Revolution of 1917](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution_of_1917 "Russian Revolution of 1917")) relatively easily because ruling-class hegemony had never been fully achieved. He believed that a final war of manoeuvre was only possible, in the developed and advanced capitalist societies, when the war of position had been won by the organic intellectuals and the working class building a counter-hegemony.

The need to create a [working-class culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working-class_culture "Working-class culture") and a counter-hegemony relates to Gramsci's call for a kind of education that could develop working-class intellectuals, whose task was _not_ to introduce Marxist ideology into the consciousness of the proletariat as a set of foreign notions but to renovate the existing intellectual activity of the masses and make it natively critical of the status quo. His ideas about an education system for this purpose correspond with the notion of [critical pedagogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_pedagogy "Critical pedagogy") and [popular education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_education "Popular education") as theorized and practised in later decades by [Paulo Freire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulo_Freire "Paulo Freire") in Brazil, and have much in common with the thought of [Frantz Fanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frantz_Fanon "Frantz Fanon"). For this reason, partisans of adult and popular education consider Gramsci's writings and ideas important to this day.<sup id="cite_ref-51"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup>

### State and civil society\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antonio_Gramsci&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: State and civil society")\]

Gramsci's theory of hegemony is tied to his conception of the capitalist state. Gramsci does not understand the state in the narrow sense of the government. Instead, he divides it between political society (the police, the army, legal system, etc.) — the arena of political institutions and legal constitutional control — and [civil society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society "Civil society") (the family, the education system, trade unions, etc.) — commonly seen as the private or non-state sphere, which mediates between the state and the economy.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESassoon1991b83_52-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-FOOTNOTESassoon1991b83-52">[52]</a></sup> He stresses that the division is purely conceptual and that the two often overlap in reality.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGramsci1971160_53-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGramsci1971160-53">[53]</a></sup>

Gramsci posits that the capitalist state rules through force plus consent: political society is the realm of force and civil society is the realm of consent. He argues that under modern capitalism the bourgeoisie can maintain its economic control by allowing certain demands made by trade unions and mass political parties within civil society to be met by the political sphere. Thus, the bourgeoisie engages in [passive revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_revolution "Passive revolution") by going beyond its immediate economic interests and allowing the forms of its hegemony to change. Gramsci posits that movements such as [reformism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformism "Reformism") and fascism, as well as the [scientific management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_management "Scientific management") and [assembly line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_line "Assembly line") methods of [Frederick Winslow Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Winslow_Taylor "Frederick Winslow Taylor") and [Henry Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford "Henry Ford") respectively, are examples of this.

Drawing from [Niccolò Machiavelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Machiavelli "Niccolò Machiavelli"), Gramsci argues that the modern [Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prince "The Prince") — the revolutionary party — is the force that will allow the working class to develop organic intellectuals and an alternative hegemony within civil society. For Gramsci, the complex nature of modern civil society means that a war of position, carried out by revolutionaries through political agitation, the trade unions, advancement of [proletarian culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proletarian_culture "Proletarian culture"), and other ways to create an opposing civil society was necessary alongside a war of manoeuvre — a direct revolution — in order to have a successful revolution without danger of a counter-revolution or degeneration.

Despite his claim that the lines between the two may be blurred, Gramsci rejects the state-worship that results from equating political society with civil society, as was done by the [Jacobins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobin_(politics) "Jacobin (politics)") and fascists. He believes the proletariat's historical task is to create a regulated society, where political society is diminished and civil society is expanded. He defines the [withering away of the state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withering_away_of_the_state "Withering away of the state") as the full development of civil society's ability to regulate itself.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESassoon1991b83_52-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-FOOTNOTESassoon1991b83-52">[52]</a></sup>

### Historicism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antonio_Gramsci&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Historicism")\]

Like the [young Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Marx "Young Marx"), Gramsci was an emphatic proponent of [historicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicism "Historicism").<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGramsci1971404–407_54-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGramsci1971404%E2%80%93407-54">[54]</a></sup> In Gramsci's view, all meaning derives from the relation between human practical activity (or [praxis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praxis_(process) "Praxis (process)")) and the objective historical and social processes of which it is a part. Ideas cannot be understood outside their social and historical context, apart from their function and origin. The concepts by which we organise our knowledge of the world do not derive primarily from our relation to [objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy) "Object (philosophy)"), but rather from the [social relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation "Social relation") between the users of those concepts. As a result, there is no such thing as an unchanging [human nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nature "Human nature") but only historically variable social relationships. Furthermore, philosophy and science do not reflect a reality independent of man. Rather, a theory can be said to be true when, in any given historical situation, it expresses the real developmental trend of that situation.

For the majority of Marxists, truth was truth no matter when and where it was known, and scientific knowledge, which included Marxism, accumulated historically as the advance of truth in this everyday sense. In this view, Marxism (or the Marxist theory of history and economics) did not belong to the illusory realm of the superstructure because it is a science. In contrast, Gramsci believed Marxism was true in a socially pragmatic sense: by articulating the [class consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_consciousness "Class consciousness") of the [proletariat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proletariat "Proletariat"), Marxism expressed the truth of its times better than any other theory. This anti-[scientistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientistic "Scientistic") and anti-[positivist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivist "Positivist") stance was indebted to the influence of [Benedetto Croce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedetto_Croce "Benedetto Croce"). At the same time, it should be underlined that Gramsci's absolute historicism broke with Croce's tendency to secure a metaphysical synthesis of historical destiny. Although Gramsci repudiates the charge, his historical account of truth has been criticised as a form of [relativism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativism "Relativism").<sup id="cite_ref-Kolakowski2_55-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-Kolakowski2-55">[55]</a></sup>

### Critique of economism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antonio_Gramsci&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Critique of economism")\]

In a pre-prison article titled "The Revolution against _[Das Kapital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital "Das Kapital")_", Gramsci wrote that the [October Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_Revolution "October Revolution") in Russia had invalidated the idea that socialist revolution had to await the full development of capitalist forces of production.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESassoon1991a221_56-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-FOOTNOTESassoon1991a221-56">[56]</a></sup> This reflected his view that Marxism was not a [determinist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinist "Determinist") philosophy. The principle of the causal primacy of the forces of production was a misconception of Marxism. Both economic changes and cultural changes are expressions of a basic historical process, and it is difficult to say which sphere has primacy over the other.

The belief from the earliest years of the [workers' movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers%27_movement "Workers' movement") that it would inevitably triumph due to historical laws was a product of the historical circumstances of an oppressed class restricted mainly to defensive action. This [fatalistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalistic "Fatalistic") doctrine must be abandoned as a hindrance once the working class becomes able to take the initiative. Because Marxism is a philosophy of praxis, it cannot rely on unseen historical laws as the agents of social change. History is defined by human praxis and therefore includes human will. Nonetheless, willpower cannot achieve anything it likes in any given situation: when the consciousness of the working class reaches the stage of development necessary for action, it will encounter historical circumstances that cannot be arbitrarily altered. It is not predetermined by historical inevitability as to which of several possible developments will take place as a result.

His critique of [economic determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_determinism "Economic determinism") extended to that practised by the syndicalists of the Italian trade unions. He believed that many trade unionists had settled for a reformist, gradualist approach in that they had refused to struggle on the political front in addition to the economic front. For Gramsci, much as the ruling class can look beyond its own immediate economic interests to reorganise the forms of its own hegemony, so must the working class present its own interests as congruous with the universal advancement of society. While Gramsci envisioned the trade unions as one organ of a counter-hegemonic force in a capitalist society, the trade union leaders simply saw these organizations as a means to improve conditions within the existing structure. Gramsci referred to the views of these trade unionists as vulgar economism, which he equated to covert reformism and [liberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism "Liberalism").

### Critique of materialism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antonio_Gramsci&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Critique of materialism")\]

By virtue of his belief that human history and collective praxis determine whether any philosophical question is meaningful or not, Gramsci's views run contrary to the metaphysical materialism and copy theory of perception advanced by [Friedrich Engels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Engels "Friedrich Engels"),<sup id="cite_ref-57"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-57">[57]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-58"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup> and Lenin,<sup id="cite_ref-59"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup> although he does not explicitly state this. For Gramsci, Marxism does not deal with a reality that exists in and for itself, independent of humanity.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGramsci1971440–448_60-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGramsci1971440%E2%80%93448-60">[60]</a></sup> The concept of an [objective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy) "Objectivity (philosophy)") universe outside of human history and human praxis was analogous to belief in God.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGramsci1971445_61-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGramsci1971445-61">[61]</a></sup> Gramsci defined objectivity in terms of a universal [intersubjectivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity "Intersubjectivity") to be established in a future communist society.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGramsci1971445_61-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGramsci1971445-61">[61]</a></sup> Natural history was thus only meaningful in relation to human history. In his view philosophical materialism resulted from a lack of critical thought,<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGramsci1971444–445_62-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGramsci1971444%E2%80%93445-62">[62]</a></sup> and could not be said to oppose religious dogma and superstition.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGramsci1971420_63-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGramsci1971420-63">[63]</a></sup> Despite this, Gramsci resigned himself to the existence of this arguably cruder form of Marxism. Marxism was a philosophy for the proletariat, a subaltern class, and thus could often only be expressed in the form of popular superstition and common sense.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGramsci1971419–425_64-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGramsci1971419%E2%80%93425-64">[64]</a></sup> Nonetheless, it was necessary to effectively challenge the ideologies of the educated classes, and to do so Marxists must present their philosophy in a more sophisticated guise and attempt to genuinely understand their opponents' views.

## Legacy\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antonio_Gramsci&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Legacy")\]

According to the American socialist magazine _[Jacobin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobin_(magazine) "Jacobin (magazine)")_, Gramsci "is one of the most cited Italian authors — certainly the most cited Italian Marxist ever — and one of the most celebrated Marxist philosophers of the twentieth century.", adding that the _Prison Notebooks_ "allowed his unorthodox Marxism to spread worldwide."<sup id="cite_ref-65"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup>

Gramsci's thought emanates from the organised [political left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_left "Political left") but has also become an important figure in current academic discussions within [cultural studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_studies "Cultural studies") and [critical theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_theory "Critical theory"). Political theorists from the [political centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_centre "Political centre") and the [political right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_right "Political right") have also found insight into his concepts; for instance, his idea of hegemony has become widely cited. His influence is particularly strong in contemporary [political science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science "Political science"), such as [neo-Gramscianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Gramscianism "Neo-Gramscianism"). His critics charge him with fostering a notion of power struggle through ideas. They find the Gramscian approach to philosophical analysis, reflected in current academic controversies, to be in conflict with open-ended, liberal inquiry grounded in apolitical readings of the classics of Western culture.

As a socialist, Gramsci's legacy has been met with a mixed reception.<sup id="cite_ref-NLR_46-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-NLR-46">[46]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 6–7">: 6–7 </span></sup>  Togliatti, who led the party (renamed in 1943 as the [Italian Communist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Communist_Party "Italian Communist Party"), PCI) after World War II and whose gradualist approach was a forerunner to [Eurocommunism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurocommunism "Eurocommunism"), stated that the PCI's practices during this period were congruent with Gramscian thought.<sup id="cite_ref-66"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-67"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup> It is speculated that he would likely have been expelled from his party if his true views had been known, particularly his growing hostility towards [Joseph Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin "Joseph Stalin").<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEJones200625_41-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJones200625-41">[41]</a></sup>

One issue for Gramsci related to his speaking on topics of violence and when it might be justified or not. When the socialist [Giacomo Matteotti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giacomo_Matteotti "Giacomo Matteotti") was murdered, Gramsci did not condemn the murder. Matteotti had already called for the rule of law and had been murdered by the fascists for that stance. The murder produced a crisis for the [Italian fascist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_fascist "Italian fascist") regime that Gramsci could have exploited.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEFrétigné2021156–159_68-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFr%C3%A9tign%C3%A92021156%E2%80%93159-68">[68]</a></sup> The historian Jean-Yves Frétigné argues that Gramsci and the socialists more generally were naïve in their assessment of the fascists and as a result underestimated the brutality of which the regime was capable.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEFrétigné2021182–183_69-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFr%C3%A9tign%C3%A92021182%E2%80%93183-69">[69]</a></sup>

## Association football\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antonio_Gramsci&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Association football")\]

Like fellow Turinese and communist [Palmiro Togliatti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmiro_Togliatti "Palmiro Togliatti"), Gramsci took an interest in [association football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football "Association football"), which was becoming a sport with massive following and was elected by the [fascist regime in Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascist_regime_in_Italy "Fascist regime in Italy") as a national sport, and was said to have been a supporter of [Juventus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juventus "Juventus"), as were other notable communist and left-wing leaders.<sup id="cite_ref-70"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-70">[70]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-71"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-72"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-72">[72]</a></sup> On 16 December 1988, the PCI's newspaper _[l'Unità](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Unit%C3%A0 "L'Unità")_ published an article on the front page titled "Gramsci Was Rooting for Juve". Signed by Giorgio Fabre, it contained some letters in which Gramsci asked [Piero Sraffa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piero_Sraffa "Piero Sraffa") for "news from our Juventus". Even though those letters later turned out to be false, the article remains part of the Gramscian bibliography and triggered numerous reactions, including from [Giampiero Boniperti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giampiero_Boniperti "Giampiero Boniperti"), who on behalf of the club the following day told at _[La Stampa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Stampa "La Stampa")_: "We are pleased to know that among our fans there have been personalities who have marked an era from the political, economic, and intellectual point of view. This shows that Juventus truly have something special, a charm that has never lost strength over the years." Gramsci's interest in football dates back to a 16 August 1918 article for the PSI's newspaper _[Avanti!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avanti!_(newspaper) "Avanti! (newspaper)")_, titled "Football and Scopone". Fifteen years later, he pointed at the degeneration of stadium cheering, which emerged with the advent of fascism and the consequent nationalisation of the sport that he said extinguished political and trade union commitment.<sup id="cite_ref-73"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#cite_note-73">[73]</a></sup>

'E tu pretendi di fare la rivoluzione senza conoscere i risultati della Juve?.' Come a dire, senza conoscere gli umori del popolo a cui chiedi di insorgere? Il capo del Partito comunista, tifoso della 'Vecchia Signora', rimproverava così al suo vice di misconoscere l'importanza di un fenomeno di massa come il calcio, eletto dal fascismo a sport nazionale, in grado di influenzare mentalità e costumi dei ceti popolari. Un punto, questo, che aveva catturato l'attenzione di Antonio Gramsci già all'alba Novecento. Lo testimonia 'Il foot-ball e lo scopone', un celebre articolo pubblicato il 16 agosto 1918 sull'Avanti!. \["And you expect us to make the revolution without knowing the results of Juve?" As to say, without knowing the moods of the people, how do you ask \[the people\] to rise up? The head of the Communist Party, a fan of the "Old Lady", thus reproached his deputy for disregarding the importance of a mass phenomenon such as football, elected by fascism as a national sport, capable of influencing the mentality and customs of the working class. A point which had already captured the attention of Antonio Gramsci at the dawn of the twentieth century. Witness "Football and Scopone", a famous article published on 16 August 1918 on Avanti!\]
