## CMV: Parents have no right to hit their child. Spanking a child is a form of physical abuse that requires intervention and counseling by CPS or other authorities.

> It is commonly agreed that denying a child food or medical care constitutes child abuse, because of the adverse impacts on the child's health, physical and emotional development, and wellbeing. We have reached this conclusion based on numerous long term research studies that have demonstrated the adverse impacts of these practices. Drinking while pregnant with your child is similarly considered a form of child abuse, because of its negative effects on child development.

> However, despite decades of scientific research and an overwhelming body of evidence indicating that spanking or corporal punishment in children creates a host of adverse effects on the child, we still accept that parents have the right to punish their children in this manner.

A large Canadian study found that *children who were spanked by their parents were seven times more likely to be severely assaulted by their parents* (e.g., punched or kicked) than children who were not spanked. In an American study, *infants in their first year of life who had been spanked by their parents in the previous month were 2.3 times more likely to suffer an injury requiring medical attention* than infants who had not been spanked.

> **To me it's simple: parents have no right to permanently damage their child's brain, whether that's drinking while pregnant or hitting it after it's born. Any action which permanently harms a child's brain development is a form of child abuse that requires intervention. And anyone who spanks their child is a bad parent.**

	There is research on this. It's been thoroughly addressed [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8194004/):

	The best way to ensure that physical punishment precedes child outcomes in a statistical model is through a longitudinal design in which spanking is used to predict subsequent child outcomes. Although longitudinal designs meet the temporal precedence criterion, they do not necessarily address selection bias. A particularly important selection factor, as mentioned earlier, is a child effect of children‚Äôs initial behavior: Children‚Äôs difficult behaviors could elicit physical punishment from their caregivers. If the ‚Äútrue‚Äù association between physical punishment and child outcomes is either entirely or partially a child effect, an association between physical punishment and child outcomes could be mistakenly viewed as a parent effect. With this selection concern in mind, nine longitudinal studies have controlled for children‚Äôs initial behavior problems. All of these studies determined that parents‚Äô use of physical punishment predicted increases in children‚Äôs externalizing behavior problems over time, even after race, gender, and family socioeconomic status had been statistically controlled (e.g., Grogan-Kaylor, 2005; Larzelere, Cox, &amp; Smith, 2010; Olson, Lopez-Duran, Lunkenheimer, Chang, &amp; Sameroff, 2011).

	Even stronger are research designs that model both the longitudinal parent effect (physical punishment to child behavior) and the longitudinal child effect (child behavior eliciting more physical punishment) simultaneously, such that each statistically controls for the other; these are known as cross-lagged panel designs. Using this design, spanking at an initial time point predicted increases in behavior problems from Ages 1 to 3 (Berlin et al., 2009), 3 to 5 (Maguire-Jack, Gromoske, &amp; Berger, 2012), 5 to 8 (Gershoff et al., 2012), and 12 to 14 as well as 14 to 16 (Wang &amp; Kenny, 2014). Three of these four studies used large and nationally representative samples (N = 2,573: Berlin et al., 2009; N = 11,044: Gershoff et al., 2012; N = 3,870: Maguire-Jack et al., 2012).

	These three approaches to determining temporal order effects generally find that spanking predicts a worsening of child behavior over time, with only a few exceptions that find no relation between spanking and changes in child behavior (e.g., Lansford, Wager, Bates, Pettit, &amp; Dodge, 2012). It is important to note that in none of the cross-lagged studies did physical punishment predict a decrease in child problem behaviors over time while controlling for the child elicitation effect. If selection entirely explained the links between physical punishment and children‚Äôs behavior, physical punishment would have significantly predicted improvements in child behavior. Longitudinal studies have overwhelmingly found that physical punishment predicts deteriorations in child behavior over time. That said, it is worth noting that in the Gershoff and Grogan-Kaylor (2016a) meta-analysis, the mean effect size for longitudinal studies was not significantly different from the mean effect size for correlational studies, indicating that both methods reached the same conclusion.
