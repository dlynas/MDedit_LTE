This article is about the philosophical concept of "Communicative Action". For Jurgen Habermas's magnum opus, see [The Theory of Communicative Action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Theory_of_Communicative_Action "The Theory of Communicative Action").

In [sociology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology "Sociology"), **communicative action** is cooperative action undertaken by individuals based upon mutual deliberation and argumentation. The term was developed by [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany "Germany") [philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy")\-[sociologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociologist "Sociologist") [Jürgen Habermas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Habermas "Jürgen Habermas") in his work _[The Theory of Communicative Action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Theory_of_Communicative_Action "The Theory of Communicative Action")_.

## Structures\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Communicative_action&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Structures")\]

Communicative action for Habermas is possible given human capacity for [rationality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality "Rationality"). Habermas says rationality is a capacity inherent within language, especially in the form of argumentation. "We use the term argumentation for that type of speech in which participants thematize contested validity claims and attempt to vindicate or criticize them through argumentation."<sup id="cite_ref-Habermas_1-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicative_action#cite_note-Habermas-1">[1]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 18">: 18 </span></sup>  The structures of argumentative speech, which Habermas identifies as the absence of coercive force, the mutual search for understanding, and the compelling power of the better argument, form the key features from which intersubjective rationality can make communication possible. Action undertaken by participants through a process of such argumentative communication can be assessed as to their rationality to the extent which they fulfill those criteria.

[Communicative rationality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicative_rationality "Communicative rationality") is distinct from instrumental, normative, and [dramaturgical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramaturgy_(sociology) "Dramaturgy (sociology)") rationality by its ability to concern all three "worlds" as he terms them, following [Karl Popper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper "Karl Popper")—the subjective, objective, and intersubjective or social. Communicative rationality is self-reflexive and open to a dialogue in which participants in an argument can learn from others and from themselves by reflecting upon their premises and thematizing aspects of their cultural background knowledge to question suppositions that typically go without question.

Communicative action is action based upon this deliberative process, where two or more individuals interact and coordinate their action based upon agreed interpretations of the situation.<sup id="cite_ref-Habermas_1-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicative_action#cite_note-Habermas-1">[1]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 86">: 86 </span></sup>  Communicative action is distinguished by Habermas from other forms of action, such as instrumental action, which is pure goal-oriented behavior, dealt with primarily in economics, by taking all functions of language into consideration.<sup id="cite_ref-Habermas_1-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicative_action#cite_note-Habermas-1">[1]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 95">: 95 </span></sup>  That is, communicative action has the ability to reflect upon language used to express propositional truth, normative value, or subjective self-expression.

## \[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Communicative_action&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Social implications")\]

Much of Habermas' work has been in response to his predecessors in the [Frankfurt School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_School "Frankfurt School"). Communicative rationality, for instance, can be seen as a response to the critique of enlightenment reason expressed in [Max Horkheimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Horkheimer "Max Horkheimer") and [T.W. Adorno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_W._Adorno "Theodor W. Adorno")'s _[Dialectic of Enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic_of_Enlightenment "Dialectic of Enlightenment")_. Horkheimer and Adorno had argued that the Enlightenment saw a particular kind of rationality enshrined as dominant in western culture, instrumental reason, which had only made possible the more effective and ruthless manipulation of nature and human beings themselves.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicative_action#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> Habermas' form of [critical theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_theory "Critical theory") is designed to rediscover through the analysis of positive potentials for human rationality in the medium of language, the possibility of a critical form of reason that can lead to reflection and examination of not only objective questions, but also those of social norms, human values, and even aesthetic expression of subjectivity.

Habermas' earlier work, _[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structural_Transformation_of_the_Public_Sphere "The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere")_, anticipates his concern for argumentation and can be read retrospectively as a historical case study of Western European societies institutionalizing aspects of communicative action in the political and social spheres. Habermas notes the rise of institutions of public debate in late seventeenth and eighteenth century Britain and France especially. In these nations, information exchange and communication methods pioneered by capitalist merchants became adapted to novel purposes and were employed as an outlet for the public use of reason. The notion of communicative rationality in the public sphere is therefore heavily indebted to [Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant "Immanuel Kant")'s formulation of the public use of reason in _[What is Enlightenment?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_is_Enlightenment%3F "What is Enlightenment?")_ Habermas argues that the [bourgeoisie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeoisie "Bourgeoisie") who participated in this incipient [public sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sphere "Public sphere") universalized those aspects of their class that enabled them to present the public sphere as inclusive—he even goes so far as to say that a public sphere that operates upon principles of exclusivity is not a public sphere at all.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicative_action#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> The focus on foundations of democracy established in this work carried over to his later examination in _[The Theory of Communicative Action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Theory_of_Communicative_Action "The Theory of Communicative Action")_ that greater democratization and the reduction to barriers to participation in public discourse (some of which he identified in the first public sphere of the [Enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment "Age of Enlightenment")) could open the door to a more open form of social action. The shift from a more Marxist focus on the economic bases of discourse in Structural Transformation to a more "super-structural" emphasis on language and communication in _Theory of Communicative Action_ signals Habermas' transition to a post-Marxist framework.

## Critiques\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Communicative_action&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Critiques")\]

Habermas views communication and debate in the public sphere as argumentatively [meritocratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy "Meritocracy"). Critics have argued that Habermas' notion of communicative rationality, upon which communicative action must be based, is illusory. The formal prerequisites of equality among argument participants, for instance, may mask the reality of unequal social capital. "There is no guarantee that a formally symmetrical distribution of opportunities to select and employ speech acts will result in anything more than an expression of the status quo."<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicative_action#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> Historian Ian McNeeley, for instance, contrasts Habermas' view with Michel Foucault's notion of communication as embodying pre-existing power relationships: "Jürgen Habermas subscribes to an unrealistic ideal of power-free communication…Michel Foucault remedies this idealism by treating knowledge as power; his work is in fact suffused with applications of knowledge for the control of human bodies."<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicative_action#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> In a like manner, the discursive fiction of consensus achieved through rational argumentation might be used as a legitimating prop for social action to the detriment of marginalized members-this is the basis of much feminist critique of Habermas' notions.

Another radical critique is that of [Nikolas Kompridis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolas_Kompridis "Nikolas Kompridis"), a former student of Habermas, who views Habermas' theory as another attempt to arrive at a "[view from nowhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View_from_nowhere "View from nowhere")", this time by locating rationality in procedures of reaching agreement independent of any particular participants' perspective or background. In response, he proposes a "[possibility-disclosing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_disclosure "Reflective disclosure")" role of reason to correct the problems with Habermas' work.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicative_action#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>
