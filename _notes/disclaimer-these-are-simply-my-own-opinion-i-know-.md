## ‚ö†Ô∏èDisclaimer: These are simply my own opinion. I know I might be wrong on certain things. Please don‚Äôt assume the worst in me. I am just trying to shed light on areas in the world that I feel like they need our attention. And I encourage you to do your own researches.I am uneducated on a lot of this, I know I am biased. I am a nobody. I am not a politician nor a historian. I am just a woman trying to tell everyone that we should care about everyone. If you feel like I am misinformed or you want to shed light on my blind spots, you are more than welcome to. But for my own peace of mind, I am temporarily turning the comments off because some people have been very hurtful. 

‚ÑπÔ∏è A list of populations to research : Palestinian Nakba, Gaza Strip and West Bank. The silent holocaust in DRC, Tigray, Sudan, Nagrno karabakh, the Uyghurs, Myanmar, Kurds, Haiti Syrians Tibet  Sikh Ukrain Yemen Peru Kashmir Afghanistan Cameron Hazaras Macedonia im adding them as I go, thank you for leaving educational comments 

üî¥EDIT :  I AM NOT PURPOSELY KEEPING OTHER POPULATIONS OUT. I posted this to bring awareness about ALL genocides happening in the world. If you feel like I forgot something, PLEASE leave a comment and help raise awareness and educate people. Please don‚Äôt assume the worst. I am your ally. 

üî¥If you want to spread awareness about other oppressed populations, i created a post right after this one, please feel free to leave comments, resources and informations.
