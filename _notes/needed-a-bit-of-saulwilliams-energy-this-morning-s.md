## Needed a bit of @saulwilliams energy this morning so I thought I‚Äôd share this with you guys üíú it‚Äôs an unusual way of transitioning a conversation from technology. Exploration into the power of (your) art but those who feel or feel it and I know it will reach those who needed to hear this too üôèüèΩ #happymonday

"that when we look at modern devices,
as long as they are dependent on those unnamed workforces
in the Congo, as long as they are dependent on all
of these resources, I'm not impressed with that as technology.
Because technology is supposed to move us forward,
not continue some sort of analog exploitation
that has gone on ever since.
And so the technology that we represent through poetry,
through coding, language.
It can be ignored, it can be slept on,
it can be renamed slay, it can be renamed spoken word,
you can call it whatever the fuck you want.
That I was in acting school,
that the dream was fucking Hollywood.
But not fitting in,
saying no, no, no, art is powerful.
Art can mean something, art can change lives,
art can progress society,
art can uplift society,
art can free fucking life sentences,
art yes, the lawyers play their role,
yes, the activists play their role,
yes, we all play our role,
the school teachers, everybody has to play their role.
Art is to remind you of the purpose of playing that role."
