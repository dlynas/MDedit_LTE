## What is the consensus of Robert Sapolsky’s hard determinism among philosophers?

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/1bct9pd/what_is_the_consensus_of_robert_sapolskys_hard/](https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/1bct9pd/what_is_the_consensus_of_robert_sapolskys_hard/)

> So I discovered Robert Sapolsky’s hard determinism recently, and I am unable to properly understand what his view of free will is, or what makes his view of hard determinism superior to free will, or even compatibilism. It comes across as vague in my opinion. I am unsure as to what the consensus is among philosophers, but I see a lot of laymen agreeing with him. The following interview is Robert Sapolsky with David Pakman. In it, Sapolsky discusses his October 2023 release "Determined". I'm currently reading through it and though I don't fully understand it, I've heard mixed responses to it. I've seen his debate with Daniel Dennett on hard determinism vs compatibilism, and although I believe that Dennett won, I see the majority of the viewers believe that Sapolsky won. Maybe I'm missing something, so l'm looking to hear from others.

				You aren't reading the right stuff, then. Precisely what we mean by free will is central to the real debate between incompatibilists and compatibilists. So, they discuss it thoroughly.

						The capacity to act in accord with one's will. An action is free if it casually flows from one's own beliefs, desires, motivations.
						
						The compatibilist trick is to not worry about how the beliefs, etc are formed (at least too much - they'd be concerned about brain washing).

			Hossenfelder misses the point of the free will debate in almost the same way as Sapolsky does.

				Do physicists learn, at some point during their education, that they are also philosophers? Or is this just a personality defect? I mean, sure, there are some physicists that are also philosophers, but I imagine that this is the exception, rather than the rule.

				* 🟪 **[BloodAndTsundere](https://www.reddit.com/user/BloodAndTsundere)** ⬆️ 10 _(2024-03-12 19:20:04)_

					I was trained as a physicist (PhD). This is anecdotal, of course, but in my experience, physicists as a group are pretty arrogant. There's a relatively common view that physics is something like the "king" discipline.

					* 🟥 **[mymicrobiome](https://www.reddit.com/user/mymicrobiome)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-03-12 23:09:46)_

						That's also my experience, but my sample size is quite small. It's as if a PhD in Physics is worth a whole lot more than a PhD in any other area.

				* 🟪 **[Dhaeron](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dhaeron)** ⬆️ 8 _(2024-03-12 19:24:26)_

					It's a personality defect you can find in various people, not just physicists. Some experts seem to get so used to being right, that they start to assume their opinions must always be correct, even outside their actual expertise. Dawkins is an example of a non-physicist who's said stuff outside his field and got dunked on by experts. And Hossenfelder has also talked about non-philosophy topics (iirc autism or something similar) and got criticized for saying nonsense. I tend to think that people in the social sciences are a little less prone to this because they're more interdisciplinary and thus more used to seeing the complexity of other fields. But you've still got people like lobster guy.

				* 🟪 **[SnooSprouts4254](https://www.reddit.com/user/SnooSprouts4254)** ⬆️ 5 _(2024-03-12 17:14:34)_

					It's just not philosophy. Stephen Weinberg and others have made their forays into the history of science with similarly disastrous results. I think that at this point, it's just pure ego for many.

				* 🟪 **[ahumanlikeyou](https://www.reddit.com/user/ahumanlikeyou)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-03-12 19:19:30)_

					this sounds grating to my ears because "learn" is (often?) a factive verb, so you can't learn something false (like "know")

			> Doesn't mean determinism is wrong, does it?
			
			Of course not. This is a seriously hard question that thousands of people have made progress on.
			
			The point is that Sapolsky has not contributed much, if anything at all, to this question.

	I think Sapolsky is quite sloppy with his methodology in the debate. He gives very broad and imprecise statistical correlations which leave large explanatory gaps—if 60% of people in situation x go on to do y, that leaves a rather stark question about why the other 40% *doesn't* do that. Sapolsky, in a not particularly scientific way, hand waves any and all responses of this kind as "something we just don't understand yet". If I was feeling fighty, I might even call it a "Darwin of the gaps"—such confidence that the answer is in the observable sciences seems unfounded and simply slots in "science will sort it out" where inconvenient rebuttals appear.

	The thing that really got me to raise an eyebrow, however, was that he lays the case before Dennett to present one case where the exercising of free will is justifiable *whilst also* invoking the problem of induction. Again, referring to the above, there's a scepticism of free will claims that he doesn't extend to his own position of determinism claims. While he presents rather fuzzy correlative evidence and comes to the conclusion that hard determinism is true, he doesn't extend such methodological charity to Dennett and is instead unequal in his threshold for what would constitute as reasonable. 

	I would have liked for him to have discussed the problem with someone who is a radical libertarian because Dennett's probably the compatibilist most sympathetic to Sapolsky's cause as you can find. I will certainly be keeping an eye open for reviews and commentary from the likes of Kane, O'Connor, and the "wide source incompatibilists".

		[He did a debate/discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjAYvhv1-Lg&amp;t=2s) with Michael Huemer on this same topic, so if you're looking for him having a conversation with a libertarian free-will advocate, this is worth listening to. 
		
		It goes about as well as you can imagine. Huemer lays out a philosophical critique of determinism as being self-defeating and self-undermining, and Sapolsky simply ignores everything Huemer says and simply reiterates the main points of his book. 
		
		Another example of how frustrating it is when scientists chime in on a subject that historically has been the domain of philosophy, but can't be bothered to actually engage with any of that philosophy.

	I like him a lot. He’s no good at arguing his point and doesn’t engage philosophy much, but his autobiographical and scientific content is top-notch. It might be said that he does great monologues and terrible dialogues, comparable to early-career Richard Dawkins.

	I do not find his views on determinism per se convincing because he’s too bootstrappy to fully understand the context of his own argument, but he’s a provocative thinker and a really good interdisciplinary writer.
