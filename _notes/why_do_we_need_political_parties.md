## Why do we need political parties?

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/z8tvt/why_do_we_need_political_parties/](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/z8tvt/why_do_we_need_political_parties/)

> This thought just struck me today. What do we, as a country, gain from our two-party system? Wouldn't we be better off just choosing between a handful of candidates whose stances aren't based on a party?

	Suppose you have a handful of candidates. How do they get their message out? Probably they recruit some people to help them do that, then the ones who recruit the most people to help with their campaigns get elected, and that's how it begins.

	Political parties are often disliked because they seem self-serving and only care about their own interests at the expense of the nation as a whole. But having multiple parties, whether two or more -- I tend to prefer a multi-party system with three or more parties -- is necessary for large federal democracies with multiple branches (executive and legislative) and several layers of government (federal, state and local).  Political parties basically coordinate programs and policies across these different layers and branches, while also managing the conflicts of interests that naturally arise between different groups.

	Take the issue of gay rights. The interests of gay people and the interests of people who don't like gay people are going to be quite different. Which is why -- in general -- gay people will work together to make sure their interests are reflected in policy and do it through a party (the Democrats). The same is true of the people who don't like gay people, and who have found a home with the Republicans. So if you're looking at ending anti-gay laws, or making the laws more equal, you want a party like the Democrats that can coordinate efforts at the federal, state and local levels: that could be on marriage issues, Don't Ask Don't Tell, anti-discrimination laws, adoption rights, etc.

	It's not really the two party system that screws things up, it's the electoral college.  I think the person with the most votes should win . . . sounds the most democratic to me.

		I disagree.  We should have a few rounds so that people can ensure the one with the most votes wins.
		
		If someone like Romney gets only 30% of the vote, then that's 60% of the populace that doesn't want him.  He should be eliminated if we have three or four parties vying for a position.
		
		That's why Instant Runoff Voting is a lot more popular and democratic.

		The Electoral College would be more interesting if it weren't a "winner take all" system.
		
		Imagine if the Electoral College went like this:
		Electors for a President are based on the congressional district. The winner of each district gets the electoral vote. The winner of the state popular vote (regardless of how it breaks down by district counts) gets the 2 electoral votes that would come from the Senate.
		
		This preserves the Electoral College, acknowledges popular vote on a state-by-state basis, and prevents the "winner take all" approach that seems to ignore the popular vote in the College.

	The history of political parties explains why they exist.

	The Democratic Party formed in the mid-1830s to unite farmers with urban workers and immigrants against banking &amp; big business interests.

	Meanwhile, the Republican Party formed in the 1850s to organize like-minded individuals against slavery.

	These parties began as grass-roots movements with the ultimate goal to unite many people because a big group of people are more persuasive than one individual.

	These days, political parties help unite voters to candidates with similar beliefs about economics, education, environment, etc.  Furthermore, a elected official beholden to party guidelines is less like to "go off the reservation" and implement policies that his voters never intended.

	By the way, the fact that Jill Stein &amp; Gary Johnson are running as third-party candidates proves that our nation's democracy is predicated upon a multi-party system.
