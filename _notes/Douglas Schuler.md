For over 30 years Doug has been engaged with issues relating to society and computing. Doug has a masters degree in Software Engineering from Seattle University and a masters degree in Computer Science from the University of Washington. He's a former chair of [Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility](http://www.cpsr.org/) (CPSR), a founding member of the [Seattle Community Network](http://www.scn.org/) (SCN), and faculty emeritus of [The Evergreen State College](http://www.evergreen.edu/) where he [taught and learned](http://www.scn.org/edu/tesc-ds/) about civic intelligence, social imagination, technology, and social implications of the network society for over 20 years.

Doug's latest book _Liberating Voices: A Pattern Language for Communication Revolution_ contains [136 _patterns_](http://www.publicsphereproject.org/patterns/pattern-table-of-contents.php) was written by Doug and over 80 contributors. He co-edited two books with Peter Day, _Shaping the Network Society: The New Role of Civil Society in Cyberspace_ (MIT Press) and _Community Practice in the Network Society: Local Action / Global Interaction_ (Routledge). He also co-edited Cyberculture: The Key Concepts (Routledge) with David Bell, Brian Loader, and Nicholas Pleace. His book _New Community Networks: Wired for Change_ (Addison-Wesley) is freely available online in both [English](http://www.publicsphereproject.org/ncn/) and [Spanish.](http://www.publicsphereproject.org/ncn/nrc/)

For over 30 years Doug has been engaged with issues relating to society and computing. As an activist with CPSR he worked on many projects including all eight of CPSR's biannual symposia on the "Directions and Implications of Advanced Computing" (DIAC) conferences, which provided a public forum for social implications of computers. Doug is currently the historian for the ACM's Special Interest Group on Computers and Society (SIGCAS) and the president of the [Public Sphere Project](https://publicsphereproject.org/), a non-profit organization focusing on civic intelligence. ([definition](http://publicsphereproject.org/civic-intelligence/index.php) / [blog](http://civic-intelligence.blogspot.com/))

Doug has presented in Africa, Asia, Europe, and South and North America on issues related to democratic, equitable and sustainable uses of technology. Please see his [presentations page](http://www.scn.org/commnet/Presentations/) for a more extensive listing.
