## Where are the skeptical takes on Donald Hoffman and Bernardo Kastrup?

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/samharris/comments/16pr820/where_are_the_skeptical_takes_on_donald_hoffman/](https://www.reddit.com/r/samharris/comments/16pr820/where_are_the_skeptical_takes_on_donald_hoffman/)

> I get that they aren’t necessarily taken seriously in their fields. I’ve watched Shermer interview them. I’ve listened to Harris interview Hoffman. These interviews did press Hoffman a little. But Hoffman is everywhere on YouTube advocating for his ideas. I’m just wondering why it’s so hard to find more skepticism and critiques of the views of these two, especially Hoffman.

	You dont think Donald Hoffman gets flak?? I love his thinking is so far out there and a creative way to see life it makes my brain fire in all different directions. But I dont see the jump from writing computer code and having a reward structure just knock out ones ability to sense the rest of physics. In a simple reward based universe what would be the reward for human curiosity about things like space and the universe? We dont need to see Infrared light but it’s been proven nonetheless. He’s just incredibly interesting to listen to imho just that the substance of what he says is beyond our vision. I see it as being similar to criticizing some new fascinating hypothesis about what happens after death. Its beyond our horizon and we just may never know.

		I’m guessing there are critiques. I’d like to find them. I saw that there are people commenting on the Shermer interview that are incensed that he expressed mild disbelief of, or articulated basic questions to, Hoffman. It doesn’t take away from him but boy does he have devotees. I guess what I want to ask is this: is his hypothesis falsifiable?

		* 🟧 **[ItiGaja](https://www.reddit.com/user/ItiGaja)** ⬆️ 2 _(2023-09-23 02:34:26)_

			Is his hypothesis falsifiable?
			Now, Hoffman and Kastrup are slightly different cases. But first and foremost, they are questioning very basic, infact the most basic assumptions that most of us have while we interact with our moment to moment experiences. And that being,are we experiencing reality as it is? And that 'experiencing' includes scientific discovery like quantum worlds and black holes that cannot be  directly experienced by us as of yet, but only through measurements and inferences, which also are experiences. So even including the 'experience' of drawing scientific conclusions and insights about reality, do we still experience reality as it is?
			
			I think that's a valid line of inquiry. Now, as what they claim to be actual reality, more Kastrup/Spira than Hoffman(who is a little more agnostic at least publicly), that is the consciousness only model, whereby every experience, internal or external are basically different flavors of the same things from a particular vantage point. 
			It is true that everything everyone experiences are within their consciousness, so a claim of an external reality, outside of consciousness experience is guess work. Also, most conscious beings seem to have a significant enough overlap of the 'world outside'  to not question the assumption at all.
			So, to your question, is the claim falsifiable, I think yes, if we can find an example of an experience outside of consciousness. But i have no conception of what that means or may look like.

		The point is that the mathematical models show conclusively that organisms that are not attuned to reality "as it is" outcompete the ones that are. The fact that you are here to talk about it at all suggests therefore that you are not an organism with a veridical perception of the world at large.

			Mathematical models and computational simulations are powerful scientific tools, but we should be slow to draw firm conclusions from them. Even modest changes to their parameterization, or environmental conditions  to which they are applied, can lead us to wildly different conclusions. 
			
			For instance, this recent paper applies the Hoffman-style evolutionary simulations to a wider range of environments (i.e. environments with a single task like the original Hoffman paper, and environments in which agents confront many different tasks). They replicate Hoffman's results for simplistic environments with few tasks, but find that agents with more veridical perception are far more successful in complex environments with hundreds or thousands of tasks.

			Relevant quote from the paper: 
			
			>*Our evolutionary simulations suggest that the degree to which a perceptual system represents the world accurately may depend on the variety of tasks that it is used for—with more tasks driving greater veridicality. As such, it seems likely that humans perceive the world in a highly veridical way, given the vast number of goals that we can clearly entertain (from war and child-rearing to food and politics, and on and on). Of course, this rich and multidi- mensional “goalscape” may not apply to all organisms: perhaps a dung beetle, for example, has only a single goal for its ball of dung. And perhaps ITP is an appropriate description for organisms like beetles with a relatively limited goalscape and range of behavior. But for humans, the combined pressures of flexible goals and inflexible perceptual systems lead us to perceive the world as it is, after all.*

					I didn't discount model-based approaches at all, in fact I'm a big proponent of them. I simply pointed out that researchers have a great deal of flexibility in terms of how they define and test their models. The paper I referenced applies Hoffman's model to an arguably more realistic set of conditions (i.e. complex environments), and finds that the results under those conditions are inconsistent with Hoffman's broader claims :)

	Kastrup in particular has been in plenty of debates. they do get quite esoteric and semantic, so that near the end I often can't actually tell the difference in the ideas.

	Rupert Spira is the 3rd of this triad of what we might call the New Idealists, though he comes at it from a mystical perspective ... still, i find Spira to be quite grounded / logical (compared to , say, Ekhart Tolle).

	[Sam had a convo with Spira](https://youtu.be/Dpr6WhJEnIs?si=dOW1Mm2bYfHzx8sv) and, imo, he really struggled to articulate a counter-argument to Spira's view. Sam believes there is some objective physical reality that exists outside of consciousness, evidenced by, for example, the fact we can make predictions about things about which we were previously unaware.

	[But Spira's dream analogy really squares this for me](https://youtu.be/VAH-5v1w2e8?si=AvTXnTx4ezNs5IZa). There is absolutely nothing strange about a conscious being that can 1) generate multiple instances of what appear to be isolated, nested, individual conscious beings, and 2) generate a seemingly objective reality about which those nested consciousnesses can agree and even make predictions.

	Human beings do it every time they dream.

	Spira would say that the "objective" reality we experience, and the consciousnesses we interact with inside it, are nothing more than a dream in the mind of God ...

		I’ve no way to evaluate this claim. It’s seems like there are many descriptions of ultimate reality out there. It sounds like this is an argument for something plausible. But is there a way to test it? I see that Hoffman is saying he can or does test his ideas but It may be beyond me to evaluate that as well.

			There are no tests for the kinds of things you are looking for. There is no test that you can do that will tell you which fundamental axioms you can adopt.

				Agreed! The fact that so many physicalists hinge their hope on "oh but with progress in neuroscience, we can reach a paradigm shift in understanding what consciousness is" is so weird to me. That to me is the single biggest leap of faith in the realm of consciousness research and to me seems pretty certain to be logically impossible.

		This also happens in computer games where the main computation is subdivided into world simulation, and AI simulation and the AI simulations are divided into entities that can have own internal representations of what they see of the world, and predict things. If you go down the lane of reality being somehow analogous to computations, i.e. information that acts on rules then it really doesn't seem that far stretched.
		
		The difficulty lies not in conceptualising those ideas, but in forming testable hypotheses which might not even be possible.

	I heard Kastrup interviewed sometime last year and I couldn’t even follow his train of thought. Not that I necessarily think he’s wrong, I just didn’t feel qualified to even get a grasp.

* 🟩 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 2 _(2023-09-23 12:58:10)_

	I'm going to be reductive here but the entire crux of analytic idealism is buttressed by a logical fallacy.

	It's basically: "materialism/physicalism can't resolve the hard problem of consciousness, therefore for x,y,z reasons analytic idealism is the only ontology that makes sense".

	The problem is that his arguments explaining why materialism can't resolve the hard problem kind of suck. Yes, at best all we have currently are neural correlates, we are unable to tell what precise combination of brain states results in a particular conscious experience, but just because we don't know NOW doesn't mean we'll never know; there's still so much about the brain we don't understand; it's probably the most complex system in the universe.

	It doesn't necessarily follow that materialism is unequipped to ever resolve the hard problem.

	Because of this, Kastrup completely jumps to the conclusion that materialism is categorically unable to resolve the hard problem (yet), and thus produces a set of explanations why analytic idealism makes the most sense out of other idealist ontologies like panpsychism.

	I find Kastrup's argument/metaphysics interesting, but I don't find him particularly convincing, and his general condescending attitude makes me take him less seriously.

	Then when you get deeper into the whole Universal Consciousness, how we're all disassociated alters from that consciousness...it's all very interesting and decently argumented but kind of falls too much into spiritual woo woo territory.

	* 🟨 **[meatfred](https://www.reddit.com/user/meatfred)** ⬆️ 3 _(2023-10-05 14:23:24)_

		I actually disagree with this take. I think Kastrup makes a very good case for why materialism can't solve the hard problem. It has nothing to do with the fact that science is currently unequipped to grapple with the problem, it has to do with an in-principle impossibility (in Bernardo's view).
		
		Basically, he argues that materialists get caught in a "mistaking the map for the territory" fallacy. We have our ontological given, which is qualia. Qualia precedes any conceptualization, it is primary. Only after this can we start abstracting and describing. Ascribing the name "matter" to that which we perceive is already one level of abstraction. And then we abstract, categorize and describe further, mapping out nature and its workings in order to come up with viable theories of its workings. The problem is, the descriptions are taken to be the real thing. Obviously the thing described is real, rather than the description; descriptions are just properties of the reality they are describing. But this flipping of map and territory is at the heart of the materialist view. 
		So with the hard problem, this becomes apparent. We have our territory, appearing as qualia. Then we have our descriptions of that territory, our map. Scientists then want to take the map, and extract the territory (qualia) from it. This is clearly a backwards approach, doomed to failure. And even appeals to complexity become meaningless - no matter how meticulously we describe the territory, we are never going to be able to extract the territory in itself, from those descriptions.
		
		This is an in-principle unsolvable problem, as I said. This is what Bernardo holds, and it is on these grounds the claim that materislists will never resolve the hard problem is made.

		* 🟧 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 1 _(2023-10-05 14:56:08)_

			Right but that's a framing that doesn't have anything close a unanimous consensus.
			
			Like I said, if we're able to one day solve the most complex system in the universe, the brain, that will give us definitive confirmation about which ontology of reality is correct.
			
			Materialism can't resolve the hard problem in the particular way that Kastrup has framed it, but I disagree with his framing.

	In general anti-materialism is not taken serious by professionals  (with exceptions), because it is  based on what you believe and not based on objective facts so it's not suitable for a scientific debate. This also means you have to be a religious person (believing in things without evidence) to support things like idealism. On the other hand there are also a lot of materialists who have fact-free and incoherent believes. 

	Donald Hoffman is a failed scientist (most scientists fail, if they do their job right). His scientific work consisted mostly in trying to prove Darwin's Theory of Evolution was false (he tried to prove this with computer simulations). Many revisions and years later he didn't make any progress. There are certainly critical reviews of his work on the internet, I didn't bother to keep them and I'm too lazy to type in a search.

	Kastrup is a Trump-like influencer without substance. If you are a serious anti-materialist you could try a proper philosopher like David Chalmers. If your not serious Kastrup or his friend Deepak-Chopra will do fine; in the end it doesn't matter much. Also for people who do research on sophism in modern times these authors can be a valuable resource.

						Yeah. Kastrup can be harsh, but usually with people's views and arguments. Not my favorite style. But I don't buy the 'he does it so you can do it too.'
						
						I grant that Kastrups claim is extraordinary, if you mean by that 'uncommon'. But I'm not sure how that bears on its coherence or plausibility. I can easily understand how a mind could simulate a physical reality--a reality in which the objects of perception obey physical laws. I do it often while dreaming and imagining. I had a dream of kicking a rock. Putting a chip under an electron microscope. It *appeared* to be made out of matter.... I have no idea how a physical object like the brain could create consciousness experiences via its patterns of chemical and electrical activity. The fact that no physical theory of that activity predicts (or could possibly predict) the emergence of consciousness makes the central claim of physicalism on the mind body problem incoherent.

							It's currently an unsolved problem. Neuroscience is working on it and makes progress.

							That's true. I wouldn't assume that the emergence of consciousness is predictable or inevitable, we simply do not now. But I see no problem with plausibility. A bacterium that can detect light and moves in its direction is a very plausible scenario of the start of some very primitive consciousness.

							Extraordinary claims need extraordinary evidence. If I say my dog is a bulldog a simple photo would probably be enough to convince you that I'm telling the truth.

								Detecting light is in a completely different category from experiencing light. We have zero a priori reason to assume one is a precursor to the other. Any camera system can be programmed to, but no one expects self driving cars to be aware of anything. There's nothing it'sike to be a Tesla.
								
								People cite that principle to dismiss claims *they* find extraordinary or improbable. But unless there's some independent objective measures of exactly how unlikely the phenomenon in question is, your doing nothing more than expressing your bias. I would find the brain being the producer of experience as extraordinary as rubbing a lamp being the producer of a djinn. 
								
								Kastrup is a true empiricist. All we experience is our experience. You have to add in a whole other layer of reality beyond experience to get to independently existing physical phenomena as the cause of our experience. If you are unromantic, restrict yourself to the simplist, most coherent ontology. And set aside subjective measure of what's extraordinary. As far as I can tell, the hard problem represents as big of a conceptual hurdle for materialism as the interaction problem does for dualism. Both make conceptual leaps that are not just extraordinary, but prima facie incoherent.

									That's what Kastrup does. Kastrup is not a neuroscientist, just an amateur with a bias to prove that materialism is wrong. I'm neutral. Of course he may have his opinion, but it's not an important opinion.
									
									> Detecting light is in a completely different category from experiencing light. We have zero a priori reason to assume one is a precursor to the other. Any camera system can be programmed to, but no one expects self driving cars to be aware of anything.
									
									Our current scientific theories suggest that's exactly that happened to life on this planet, so we humans know for sure it's possible. In a way self-driving cars are already a tiny bit self-aware.

									"The hard problem of consiousness" not relevant for science, it's a rhetoric device for anti materials.  
									
									When neuroscience has solved the so called "easy problems"  we humans know everything that can be known  about consciousness.  Materialism just follows science, it has no agenda, it will be wrong when science is wrong, it will be right when science is right. It will take a while.

										>Kastrup is...just an amateur
										
										With 2 PhDs, one in computer science (worked in AI) and on in philosophy (of mind). 
										
										>Our current scientific theories suggest...
										
										We have no scientific theory of how or why consciousness emerged. Not even the start of one. We know how sensory organs like the eye evolved from light sensitive cells. But that's completely different. The ability to detect light and objects is sufficient for survival. Having an associated experience of the light or o ject detected is gratuitous as far as our best theoryoa are concerned. It's called the hard problem because no one, no neurosciencist on the planet, has even the slightest idea how consciousness is or could be produced by the brains activity. We have identified neuro correlates of conscious experiences and processes. But no clue why the correlated neural activity could produce conscious experiences. You can't find a single model that explains why such and such pattern of activity must be associated with the taste of chocolate rather than the smell of lavender.
										
										>I just follow the neuroscience
										
										Again, the neuroscience is completely divorced from the metaphysics. Nothing neurosciencists discover or research requires, presupposes, or entails materialism. Neurosciencists may largely be materialists. For all we know, we could be living in a collective dream or simulation and nothing they do or have discovered would be changed by that metaphysical reality in the slightest.
										
										>Solved the easy problems
										
										The easy problems are in a different category. What neural activities are correlated with what experiences or cognitive abilities. The hard problem asks why. What is the nature of consciousness? Why is it correlated with brain activity at all? Knowing the blah blah region of the medial temporal blah is correlated with face recognition or pain experiences doesn't even make any contribution to the hard problem at all.

		The idealist asserts that all there is is what we can experience, consciousness. The materialist, on the other hand, asserts that there exists a whole world of matter outside of consciousness, despite the fact that this could never be proven and never be experienced. As Rupert Spira has said before, materialists are actually more like the religious ones rather than idealists, only materialists refuse to acknowledge that their belief in matter is just that, a belief.

			Unavoidable because truth is not democratic or inclusive. Most people are religious and believe in one or more God's; pointing out that there is no evidence for these believes is arrogant.
			
			> Absolutely insane that you would say that idealism is based on belief and not ‘objective facts’ ... The idealist asserts that all there is is what we can experience, consciousness
			
			Idealism lacks positive evidence and makes untestable claims.
			
			There is no reason to believe that experience and consciousness is all there is, it's not an objective fact. Idealism uses the fact that we cannot gather evidence about non existent things; we cannot prove that Santa Close does not exist. Materialism uses the fact that we can gather evidence about physical things that can be objectively tested by anyone who cares.
			
			> who fail to understand that they are the ones making assumptions without evidence.
			
			In contrast to idealism there is an incredible amount of reliable evidence to believe there is an external world that can be explained in purely physical terms without referring to any magic. You may well claim that the so called "Standard model of physics" is false, but to say that it lacks evidence is not true.
			
			> I’m not even saying that idealism is ‘better’ than materialism
			
			I'm not at all claiming that materialists are superior to anti-materialists and, as I said before, many materialists have also incoherent and fact free believes. What I don't see often is that materialists/naturalists try to misrepresent science, like Kastrup.

				> Idealism lacks positive evidence and makes untestable claims.
				
				If you can be open-minded enough to assume that idealism is true for the sake of argument, what evidence would you like us to provide you with? It would be like if you were having a lucid dream where you told someone they were in a dream, and they demanded that you provide them positive evidence to back up that claim. What sort of mathematical equation or scientific formula are you going to come up with in order to convince them that objects in the dream don't reside in some external world that exists outside of the dream, and that space between dream objects is illusory? What if the person responded to your claim by hitting you in the face, causing you to get dizzy and your dream vision to go wonky, and they used that as evidence that consciousness resides in the brain of the dream character... what would you say to them? How are you going to prove the dream world isn't physical? Esp. if you try to walk through a wall, and can't do so because it's too solid. What makes that wall any less physical than one in the waking world?
				
				Let's even assume that you could stay in the dream long enough to conduct whatever scientific experiments you wanted. How do you suppose things would look if you drilled down to the sub-atomic level? Might things get a bit fuzzy, to the point where you could really only approximate what was going on using math? 
				
				Like materialists, there are idealists who have fact-free and incoherent beliefs, but some of us are even more skeptical than nihilists. As a nihilist (I assume you are because of your username), have you ever been skeptical of your own skepticism? There's a reason why philosophers don't like this kind of radical skepticism.

								The problem you have is there comes a point where additional accuracy no longer provides any fitness payoffs. You are assuming, without any evidence whatsoever, that improved detection of environmental factors will result in better decisions by the agent in question. The ability to interpret stimuli requires brain power, which is one of the most energy-demanding tasks an organism can undertake. The more information you take in, the more of it has to be discarded in order to deal with the information that's relevant at hand. It doesn't matter how well you can see the millions of pores on someone's skin as the axe in their hand comes swinging at your face...

	Frankly, I think it boils down to the fact that academic philosophy is not youtube. Idealism is a perfectly respectable philosophical position, and I suspect that most philosophers would say physicalism at the very least has some very deep issues, so it's not likely to produce the "Bernardo Kastrup *destroyed* with facts and logic!" kind of videos that become mainstream. The fact is that these debates come down to very complicated philosophical discussions where no honest observer can claim that it's really obvious who is right and who is wrong, and that just isn't very sexy.

	One thing I will say about Kastrup is that he is prone to mischaracterizing the views of physicalists to make them easier to refute. In one of the introductory videos to analytic idealism on his website, for instance, he charges physicalism with the view that "reality is essentially mathematical." But there are simply no physicalists who make this claim, and Kastrup makes it so vaguely that it's not even really clear what exactly it is he's accusing physicalists of believing. The only person who actually does make that claim is Max Tegmark, and I have no idea if he would consider himself a physicalist or not.

	There was also [this debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCKoL92EL4c&amp;ab_channel=BernardoKastrup) where he got absolutely roasted by Phillip Goff (who is not a physicalist) for misrepresenting the physicalist view of consciousness as synonymous with epiphenomenalism. Goff up to this point was pretty friendly and conciliatory in this debate, which gives you an idea of how outrageously bad faith Kastrup's statement here was.

	The fact that he has a whole organization devoted to his philosophical ideas is also very weird and screams cult. But as for his own philosophy itself, it's pretty interesting and seems to be taken seriously by any philosopher I've heard comment on it. I've been meaning to read about it more carefully myself and try to offer some responses to it. I've recently been convinced to move away from physicalism just because I don't find the ideas of supervenience or emergentism very plausible, but I think the awkward position physicalists find themselves in when they try to explain the existence of things like consciousness or mathematical objects is the same awkward position any idealist is going to run into when trying to explain why we should regard the physical world as something other than physical. I think it's best to just accept that mental things are mental and physical things are physical, and then see how we could rationally explain the existence of both without having to cram one category into the other.

		I haven't seen him characterize reality as essentially mathematical. I've seen him argue that physicalists mistake mathematical abstractions, used to predict observations, for the reality. But that's a standard antirealist stance on the philosophy of science. Not some quirky misapprehension of physicalism.

			No, I was saying that this was how he characterizes the physicalist position. He does this very explicitly in at the 13:25 mark of [this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbnfnveWUh0&amp;list=PL64CzGA1kTzi085dogdD_BJkxeFaTZRoq&amp;ab_channel=EssentiaFoundation) Maybe I'm mistaken, but he's charging physicalists with the idea that everything is fundamentally quantitative abstraction, because he's charging physicalists with denying the existence of qualia. It's perfectly fine to argue that this is what physicalism logically reduces to, but this is not something actual physicalists typically claim, so far as I'm aware. The whole point of physicalism is to argue that reality ultimately reduces to the physical, which entails arguing that mathematical objects are abstractions of the physical, not that reality is fundamentally quantitative. 
			
			To me, this is an unfair mischaracterization that results from the polemical tone of his work. What he ought to do is lay out the views of specific prominent physicalist philosophers like Searle, Armstrong, Lewis, Dennett, etc. in their own words, and then refute them. Not caricature their position and then refute the caricature.

				The physicalists want to argue that the physical description of the world is sufficient to describe all that we know to exist. It is reasonable to ask them how they fit the existence of qualia into their physicalist picture.
				
				But they don't (hence the hard problem), and so Kastrup is entitled to compare his alternative to theirs and claim that theirs has weaknesses that his doesn't, and therefore his is the better candidate for a reductionistic explanation of things.

		> One thing I will say about Kastrup is that he is prone to mischaracterizing the views of physicalists to make them easier to refute. In one of the introductory videos to analytic idealism on his website, for instance, he charges physicalism with the view that "reality is essentially mathematical." But there are simply no physicalists who make this claim, and Kastrup makes it so vaguely that it's not even really clear what exactly it is he's accusing physicalists of believing. The only person who actually does make that claim is Max Tegmark, and I have no idea if he would consider himself a physicalist or not.
		
		That no physicalists make the claim doesn't mean it isn't a fair characterisation. This aspect of physicalism is necessarily true by virtue of the way physical descriptions of things necessarily unfold themselves. You cannot quantify love the way you quantify a boulder rolling down a hill. Remove the quantification and you remove all description from any physical model.
		
		> There was also this debate where he got absolutely roasted by Phillip Goff (who is not a physicalist) for misrepresenting the physicalist view of consciousness as synonymous with epiphenomenalism. Goff up to this point was pretty friendly and conciliatory in this debate, which gives you an idea of how outrageously bad faith Kastrup's statement here was.
		
		Timestamp please. I'm not listening to a whole hour just to find something that you believe proves a highly dubious statement such as engaging in bad faith, certainly not when your first example was terribly underwhelming.
		
		> The fact that he has a whole organization devoted to his philosophical ideas is also very weird and screams cult. But as for his own philosophy itself, it's pretty interesting and seems to be taken seriously by any philosopher I've heard comment on it.

			Why is it necessary? It may be necessary to human minds, but human minds are biased observers, and we all presumably agree that they do not have access to things-in-themselves. You should at least be able to acknowledge that physicalists do not have to agree with this view.
			
			Physicalists are saying that things-in-themselves are not mathematical; they're physical. You and Kastrup are portraying them as making the exact opposite argument! The physicalist position is that mathematical things are merely fictions used to describe the physical, or if they are real, are real insofar as they supervene on the physical. Physicalism and mathematical platonism are incompatible, and Kastrup is behaving as if they're identical. Like I said, I don't agree with the physicalist argument, but you're mischaracterizing it. There is a massive difference between "this is my opponent's view" and "this is what I take to be a necessary logical consequence of my opponent's view." You have to state the view fairly before putting words in the opponent's mouth. A viewer of this video who didn't do any background reading would come away with a totally ridiculous strawman of the physicalist position which, at least in this case, is literally the opposite of actual physicalist claims.
			
			Kastrup makes the claim right around the 46:40 mark of the debate that materialists believe consciousness has no causal efficacy. As Goff explains to him, the conflation of supervenience with epiphenomenalism is unjustified because physicalists believe that consciousness is itself physical, and therefore can have causal power. They simply reject the belief that qualia are non-physical because they are property monists. It's perfectly fine to disagree with this-I happen to think it's very weird and almost certainly wrong-but that's their view. 
			
			An epiphenomenalist would acknowledge that consciousness is a phenomena which is parallel to, but distinct from brain states. But the epiphenomenalist then makes the added claim that it is only the brain states, and not the conscious experience, which has causal power. Supervenience doesn't exclude causal efficacy, whereas the whole point of epiphenomenalism is to do so. Supervenience also rejects the belief that brain states and consciousness are two distinct entities. On supervenience, they're not parallel phenomena, they're just one and the same. Supervenience and epiphenomenalism are not synoymous.

				Descriptions of physical systems are inherently mathematical. They are mathematical constructs and say nothing outside of their mathematical construction. Remove the maths and there's no description left. If physicalists are not committed to a mathematical view of the world, then it's not clear what they are committed to in the first place.
				
				If you are upset about how all of this has played out, take it up with Galileo and the way he split things up into primary and secondary qualities. It's really not my problem that the physicalist models have no capacity to meaningfully describe qualia.

				Alright, in that case all of science gives fictional accounts of the world. Somehow I do not believe you intend to commit yourself to this implication that sits behind what you claim.

				Supervenience does exclude causal efficacy insofar as you can simply create a causally complete description of the state of affairs without referring to the supervening stratum at all. If you're objecting to physicalism because of supervenience, then objecting to it because of epiphenomenalism is just as fair.
				
				
				https://www.britannica.com/topic/supervenience
				> supervenience, In philosophy, the asymmetrical relation of ontological dependence that holds between two generically different sets of properties (e.g., mental and physical properties) if and only if every change in an object’s properties belonging to the first set—the supervening properties—entails and is due to a change in properties belonging to the second set (the base properties). Supervenience has often been appealed to by philosophers who want to uphold physicalism while rejecting the identity theory: Though it may be impossible to identify mental properties with physical properties in a one-to-one fashion, mental properties may still supervene on, and thus be grounded in, physical properties. Thus, no two things that are physically alike can be mentally (or psychologically) different, and a being’s mental properties will be determined by its physical ones.

					>I have no interest in speculating upon that which is unknown within the context of discussing what humans profess.
					
					Great, then presumably you agree that physicalists don't need to commit themselves to the belief that physical events are fundamentally quantitative!
					
					>Descriptions of physical systems are inherently mathematical. They are mathematical constructs and say nothing outside of their mathematical construction. Remove the maths and there's no description left. If physicalists are not committed to a mathematical view of the world, then it's not clear what they are committed to in the first place.
					
					I agree, but this doesn't in any way commit them to the belief that things are mathematical just because they're described that way. The real problem here is that they're trying to ascribe to things-in-themselves a nature they cannot, on their own terms, clearly define, because they have made any possible means of description logically antecedent to the thing being described.
					
					To be fair, though, this will apply just as much to idealism. After all, what are ideas made of? What is their fundamental nature? It seems like you need to know this to claim that physical things are actually also ideas.
					
					>Alright, in that case all of science gives fictional accounts of the world. Somehow I do not believe you intend to commit yourself to this implication that sits behind what you claim.
					
					I haven't committed myself to much here since I'm a recovered ex-physicalist, but I guess if there were people claiming that scientific theories were ontologically independent features of the world, physicalists would reply that they are fictions we use to describe it. If you're asking me if I believe that there's such a thing as a "theory of evolution" out in the world, I would say there is in textbooks and the minds of biologists, but I don't think any physical thing is "fundamentally evolutionary" in the way Kastrup claims physicalists believe things are fundamentally quantitative. That just seems like a meaningless statement.
					
					>Mathematics is not mathematical Platonism.
					
					No, mathematical platonism is the view that mathematical objects are ontologically independent. If physicalists were claiming that reality is fundamentally quantitative, wouldn't that clearly entail this view? Otherwise, what are the mathematical objects ontologically dependent upon? Wouldn't *that* be what the physicalist thinks is fundamental to reality? 
					
					Of course, it is, and they just believe that that fundamental thing is physical stuff. So let's just work with the view they actually have.
					
					>You can fuck right off with your equivocation of materialism and physicalism in the same breath as your complaining that other people are mischaracterising what people said in bad faith. Holy shit.
					
					Okay, well I used the term because that's the view Kastrup ascribes to *both* physicalists and materialists in the video, because literally everybody uses the terms interchangeably. But I'll be more careful if it makes you feel better, lol
					
					>Supervenience does exclude causal efficacy insofar as you can simply create a causally complete description of the state of affairs without referring to the supervening stratum at all. If you're objecting to physicalism because of supervenience, then objecting to it because of epiphenomenalism is just as fair.
					
					I don't see how your description rules out the possibility of the supervenience causing something. For instance, an emotional reaction can result from the aesthetic qualities of a painting which supervene on its physical characteristics. The aesthetic quality, they claim, is what produces the reaction, but the physical characteristics are the source of that quality. If you alter the physical structure of the painting, you alter its beauty as well, and any other non-physical quality you might ascribe to it. Someone who viewed the beauty as an epiphenomenon would say, instead, that it was in fact the physical structure of the painting which produced the reaction, and the beauty was just an external consequence which has no power. Both are silly, they're just silly for different reasons.

						Mathematical Platonism is a theory about the status of mathematical objects. The existence of mathematical objects is not contingent upon the acceptance of mathematical Platonism. You have introduced a red-herring into the conversation.
						
						The point that you keep **failing** to grasp is that the physicalist account of the world is a purely mathematical description of the world. Nothing you say will stop this from being true. Remove the quantification, and there is no content left with which to form a description. The actual status of mathematics is irrelevant, the sum total of the physicalist description is to give mathematical accounts the world. Criticising it on this basis and pointing out that it is lacking is an eminently fair criticism to make. I mean the "hard problem of consciousness" relies directly on this state of affairs to make its case!

							Yes, idealists take the position that qualities exist and are a real part of experience. I have no problem with that, that seems obviously true. But that doesn't get us any closer to explaining where the qualia come from, what their underlying structure is, why it is that they exist. Again, what are ideas? What do they consist in? It seems to me the only essential feature of an idea is that it is distinct from anything physical.
							
							>That's fine, then we're playing a game of who has the most effective fiction rather than the game of who has the truest statement.

							>I am saying that if your description of the world isn't real, then attempting to use your description of the world as any kind of pointer to what is real is a pointless task with no prospect of success.
							
							I agree with this, all I'm saying is that the method of description is not the fundamental constituent of the thing being described. The fact that I can find my way around in the woods with a map and a compass and can *describe* the woods in terms of azimuths and waypoints does not mean the woods is fundamentally made up of maps and compasses, azimuths or waypoints. I think the physicalist can be effectively countered by pointing out that the maps and compasses need to exist to be useful, but this doesn't commit the physicalist to admitting the woods is fundamentally maps and compasses, or even fundamentally cartographical. Descriptions of things are not things-in-themselves.
							
							>The point that you keep failing to grasp is that the physicalist account of the world is a purely mathematical description of the world. Nothing you say will stop this from being true. Remove the quantification, and there is no content left with which to form a description. The actual status of mathematics is irrelevant, the sum total of the physicalist description is to give mathematical accounts the world.
							
							This might clarify our disagreement somewhat: you think the most accurate account of something a physicalist can give is mathematical. I think the most accurate account they believe they can give of anything is by pointing at it with their finger. That's what physicalism is: fundamentally, it's the belief that everything that exists are things that you can point at. What the purpose of mathematics is, is to offer a description of things being pointed at to serve different purposes. But as far as what it actually *is*, for the physicalist, it's whatever we're indicating when we point at something in physical space. The reason the hard problem of consciousness exists is, literally, that you can't point at qualitative affections or thoughts; consciousness seems to involve things which are categorically different from those which can be pointed at. When you point at your brain, you are not pointing at your consciousness. Math has nothing to do with it.
							
							>That would entail that the mental determines the physical, which would be contrary to the claim that the mental/physical causal arrow is unidirectional as supervenience dictates.
							
							That's not what supervenience dictates! That's my whole point! Epiphenomenalism dictates that. Supervenience only dictates that an A-property cannot change without a change in a B-property. In other words, a mental property *can* alter a physical property, but it has to alter the physical property *in order* to alter another mental property. The causal arrow is unidirectional *only with respect to a given subject's mental and physical properties*, not mental and physical properties between subjects.
							
							Anyway, I think we've gone back and forth a decent amount and I don't think we're likely to change each other's position beyond this point. Feel free to have the last word, thanks for an interesting and challenging exchange.

								You don't need to explain the qualia if you take them to be the fundamental constitutive building blocks of reality. You only need to explain them if you do not posit them to be fundamental. The fundamental layer can never be explained in terms of anything else, or it would not be fundamental.

								Perhaps, but then we're no longer talking about science in any meaningful sense.
								
								> I agree with this, all I'm saying is that the method of description is not the fundamental constituent of the thing being described.
								
								Then there is no reason to conclude that there is a relationship between the description and the thing being described. I.e. you've created a marvellous model filled with numbers, but there's no reason to believe it has any connection to reality.
								
								> The fact that I can find my way around in the woods with a map and a compass and can describe the woods in terms of azimuths and waypoints does not mean the woods is fundamentally made up of maps and compasses, azimuths or waypoints.

								Well, suffice it to say we greatly disagree on the meaning of physicalism. Seems to me that you're actually looking for some kind of externalism.
								
								> What the purpose of mathematics is, is to offer a description of things being pointed at to serve different purposes. But as far as what it actually is, for the physicalist, it's whatever we're indicating when we point at something in physical space.
								
								The physicalist has offered no description of what he has pointed at, according to your recounting of how things lie because there can be no meaningful distinction between a correct and incorrect description given the fundamental disjunction between the description and the thing being described in your recounting.

								Except that math has everything to do with it, because if those qualitative effects could be described mathematically, there'd be no reason to make a distinction between those effects and the physical effects we describe mathematically.

								The entry I quoted expressly disagrees with you.
								
								> The causal arrow is unidirectional only with respect to a given subject's mental and physical properties, not mental and physical properties between subjects.
								
								Word salad. The introduction of subjects does not in any way alter the relationship between the physical and mental layers in a supervenient description of mental activity.
								
								> Anyway, I think we've gone back and forth a decent amount and I don't think we're likely to change each other's position beyond this point. Feel free to have the last word, thanks for an interesting and challenging exchange.
								
								I don't really care to change your views, I just want you to stop claiming that Kastrup engages in bad faith on flimsy evidence.
