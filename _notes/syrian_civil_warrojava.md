## Syrian Civil War/Rojava

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchy101/comments/u9pjdq/syrian_civil_warrojava/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchy101/comments/u9pjdq/syrian_civil_warrojava/)

> Hello! I'm looking for a good place to learn about the Syrian Civil War, and the Rojava Revolution, since I often see their autonomous zone mentioned as an example of anarchism in practice today. The history seems very complicated, and although I've done a little bit of research, I'd like to know more. Do you have any recommendations for websites, texts, etc. on the matter?

	I would highly recommend three books to get a broad overview of the Rojava Revolution, these being:

	*A Small Key Can Open a Large Door: The Rojava Revolution* by Strangers In A Tangled Wilderness - An excellent, rather short book that talks about the many structures of the revolution, not too dense, lays out the organisation structures nicely, brief but clear discussion of the history and ideology given. It has an excellent Appendix to get your head around the various political parties, organisations and structures within greater Kurdistan (not just in Rojava but in Bakur√™,   Ba≈ü√ªr√™ and Rojhilat√™ as well) Here is a free online copy from the Anarchist Library. [https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/strangers-in-a-tangled-wilderness-a-small-key-can-open-a-large-door?v=1629490645](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/strangers-in-a-tangled-wilderness-a-small-key-can-open-a-large-door?v=1629490645)

	*Revolution in Rojava: Democratic Autonomy and Women's Liberation in Syrian Kurdistan* Anja Flach, Ercan Ayboga, and Michael Knapp (2016) - Talks about the history and ideology in a lot more detail. Excellent discussion of the women's liberation (if you want to get a hang of the details and "nitty gritty" of the organisational structures I recommend Small Key but if you are more interested in the ideology, this book is for you).

	*Battle for the Mountain of the Kurds: Self-Determination and Ethnic Cleansing in Rojava* by Andrej Grubaƒçiƒá and Thomas Schmidinger (2019) - A short but VERY in depth book about the role of Afrin and the invasion of 2018, goes into the history of Afrin, a little unobtainable if you haven't read the above but good nonetheless.

	&amp;#x200B;

	Here are some excellent online free texts

	[https://www.revistalegerin.com/revista-legerin-eng](https://www.revistalegerin.com/revista-legerin-eng) \- Can not recommend enough! L√™ger√Æn in kurmanji means "The search for Freedom". This is a monthly magazine, published in several languages which disseminates the ideology of Rojava. Publishes articles by Ocalan, interviews with Guerillas, women working in various communal organisations, health care workers, foreign volunteers etc as well as pieces on other historical figures and other topics and conversations within the revolution.

	[https://riseup4rojava.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Final-min\_compressed-compressed.pdf](https://riseup4rojava.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Final-min_compressed-compressed.pdf) \- Can not recommend highly enough, a free recently published 200+ page brochure with many interviews and insights into the revolution. If you read A Small Key first to get an understanding of the structures, then read this right after as it contains multiple interviews with people within said organisational structures.

	[https://anfenglishmobile.com/](https://anfenglishmobile.com/) \- Main media outlet within Rojava, publishes up to date information with NorthEast Syria. Perhaps not so good at getting a hold of the ideas and structures of Rojava but very important within contemporary reporting from within Rojava.

	[https://riseup4rojava.org/](https://riseup4rojava.org/) \- A website that published much material about the revolution as well as information about international solidarity campaigns.

	[https://twitter.com/YpgInt?ref\_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor](https://twitter.com/YpgInt?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) \- Not so good for understanding the Revolution but thought I'd promote it regardless. Publishes interviews by internationalists within the YPG.

	Robert Evans has done some reporting on it, check out his work on Bellingcat and his podcasts.

	* üü® **[I__Like_Stories](https://www.reddit.com/user/I__Like_Stories)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 2 _(2022-04-23 12:26:16)_

		Adding to this, Robert Evan‚Äôs specific series about his time and experiences in Rojava is called **The Woman‚Äôs War.**

	I recommend "Beyond the Frontlines of Rojava" to get a basic understand of it.

* üü© **[deleted]** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 2 _(2022-04-23 07:25:10)_

	It should be noted that the Rojavan revolution is not an anarchist revolution. I haven't read it yet but Daughters of Kobani is a book about the revolution and Abdullah Ocalan's work is pretty much essential to understanding the politics.
