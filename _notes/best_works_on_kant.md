## Best works *on* Kant?

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/pzytqr/best_works_on_kant/](https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/pzytqr/best_works_on_kant/)

> Hello, I hope I have the right sub, if I‚Äôm in the wrong sub please do tell me!
> 
> I hope you‚Äôre all doing well. Some context: after studying history for 2 years I found out it‚Äôs not what I want to study, I recently found myself a huge love for philosophy which means this year, since 2 weeks ago, I‚Äôm a philosophy student. Before this year started I had been reading some philosophy to get an okay basis (Plato, Aristotle, Descartes & Spinoza). I have had a history of philosophy class when I was studying history (which is where I discovered my love for philosophy) so I do have a few notions of most popular philosophers but anyway.

> Since I just finished reading about Spinoza (I read Michael Della Rocca‚Äôs routledge guide) I‚Äôm pretty excited to get to Kant. Now **I‚Äôm pretty sure reading Kant directly would confuse me more than anything so here‚Äôs my question: can you recommend me some good books *on* Kant?**

	Don't sell yourself too short. I'm pretty sure you could read the prefaces and intros to the first critique right now and make decent sense out of them. 

	In any case, major scholars are Henry Allison, Karl Ameriks, Beatrice Longuenesse, Dieter Henrich, Allen Wood, Lewis White Beck and H.J. Paton. The first three on his theoretical philosophy, the last three on his practical philosophy, and Henrich among other things on his influence.

		Seconding this: people often assume they just couldn't read Kant, and it's rarely true. It takes time and energy of course, but if you go into it accepting that you'll have to read slower than normal and be patient and mindful while you read, you will be fine.
		
		This is a nice list, though a bit outdated on the practical front I'd say. I would certainly add Onora O'Neill and Barbara Herman there, probably over Beck and Paton. (I disagree with a lot of Wood's interpretive views but I do think he makes good reading for people getting into Kant, and his work has been very important!) Karl Ameriks is brilliant but also quite tough to read in his own right, and I certainly wouldn't read him before reading Kant yourself. Lucy Allais and Rae Langton both write extremely lucidly on Kant's theoretical and sometimes practical philosophy, and could be profitably read before reading the primary texts if that is the way you'd choose to go.

			Absolutely, reading Kant is like learning a new language. The worst thing you can do is pick a secondary text that always "translates" for you and never tries to put you in a situation where you can understand Kant's own formulations on their own terms. There are many books that present a "modernized" version of Kant which will be of zero help when you actually try to read the text. Same reason I'm getting tired of post-Sellarsian readings of Hegel, but that's a whole 'nother can of worms. 
			
			>Karl Ameriks is brilliant but also quite tough to read in his own right, and I certainly wouldn't read him before reading Kant yourself
			
			tbf Allison and especially Longuenesse are very tough. I would not recommend any of the authors I mentioned to read before Kant (here, I think reading a few SEP articles is the most economical way). 
			
			>Lucy Allais and Rae Langton both write extremely lucidly on Kant's theoretical
			
			I'll give you Allais but Langton's interpretation of transcendental Idealism seems totally bizarre to me.

			I mentioned Paton because I am a very simple man: I once read a review by Dieter Henrich praising his book on the categorical imperative to the absolute moon, and if Henrich approves, I approve. I am not aware of any other book that so effectively dispels all the common myths about Kant's moral philosophy, and I'm sure you've seen the endless posts on this sub asking bizarre questions like whether Kant thinks its immoral to derive pleasure from a good deed.

				So you‚Äôd recommend I start reading Kant directly before reading secondary literature on him then? I usually try to read secondary literature first to get a notion of what the original author is about to have an easier time grasping their ideas. But I can see how it could make it actually harder to read the author‚Äôs own formulations

					Just do everything at once. Here's a concrete suggestion:
					
					You probably want to read both Kant's theoretical and practical philosophy (let's leave the aesthetics out for now). 
					
					First off, SEP articles. I am not a fan of reading an entire introduction first because I think they're too long and too shallow. SEP articles get you a quick overview of what Kant is about and what major scholarly points of contention are (so that when you come across a strange passage in his writings, you'll know what the major interpretive options are). Reading through some (maybe even all) of these links shouldn't take too much time, but you can prioritize:
					
					https://plato.stanford.ed[u/entries](https://www.reddit.com/user/entries)/kant/
					
					https://plato.stanford.ed[u/entries](https://www.reddit.com/user/entries)/kant-moral/
					
					https://plato.stanford.ed[u/entries](https://www.reddit.com/user/entries)/kant-transcendental-idealism/
					
					https://plato.stanford.ed[u/entries](https://www.reddit.com/user/entries)/kant-metaphysics/
					
					https://plato.stanford.ed[u/entries](https://www.reddit.com/user/entries)/kant-judgment/
					
					https://plato.stanford.ed[u/entries](https://www.reddit.com/user/entries)/kant-spacetime/
					
					https://plato.stanford.ed[u/entries](https://www.reddit.com/user/entries)/kant-development/#Rel
					
					
					Kant himself, bitter about everyone misunderstanding him, wrote an introduction to the first critique called the *Prolegomena*. It's about 150 pages long and drives home his main points quite well. The major difference between it and the first critique is that he pursues what he calls an analytic approach (as opposed to the first critiques synthetic approach) and he introduces the distinction between judgements of perception and judgements of experience, but that's ok. Read that first and pay attention to the things he says about Hume. Also, at the same time, you can read the intros and prefaces to the critique of pure reason. They're very clear. Pay attention to Kant's formulation of the problem of the possibility of synthetic a priori judgements. 
					
					Then, the obvious next steps are the first critique and the groundwork. Those two works form the minimum of Kant reading: You can stop after those if you've had enough, but not before, I'd say. 
					
					For the first critique, [Bernstein's Lectures](https://www.bernsteintapes.com/kantlist.html) are stupendous. Especially his discussion of the deduction (and where precisely Kant differs from Locke) hits the nail right on the head. For a book, look at Allison's *Kant's Transcendental Idealism*, imo the best book on his theoretical philosophy. Ah heck, one more fun thing: Theodor Adorno's lectures on the first critique (I believe they have been translated) are very interesting too (lots of cultural-historical context). It doesn't hurt to browse them. This stuff is all on libgen btw. When reading the first critique, pay EXTRA attention to the chapter on the ground of distinction between phaenomena and noumena. In fact, you can even get away with reading that one right after the intros and prefaces. If everyone could be forced to just read this chapter, I think 90% of all bizarre confusions about Kant would disappear. 
					
					For the Groundwork, I know of no better guide than Paton's *The Categorical Imperative*. As mentioned above, it dispels almost all bizarre misreadings. But read the groundwork first. It's very short. Read it quickly. Then read it again with Paton's help. 
					
					That should keep you occupied. 
					
					If you ever want to read the third critique, [Zammito's Book](https://press.uchicago.ed[u/ucp](https://www.reddit.com/user/ucp)/books/book/chicago/G/bo3630373.html) is marvelous, as is everything he's written. Just put a pin in that one and don't worry about it for now. 
					
					Have fun!

		I second Allen Wood. His *Kantian Ethics* provides his own interpretation of Kantianism. He tackles many misunderstandings about Kant and provides a reconstruction of his ideas. He also challenges some positions Kant held: retributive justice, opposition to homosexuality and women's subjection for example.

	In the same book series, Paul Guyer's [*Kant*](https://www.amazon.com/Kant-Routledge-Philosophers-Paul-Guyer-ebook/dp/B00ISVUDJG/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=guyer+kant&amp;qid=1633218854&amp;sr=8-1) is a good general introduction to Kant's theoretical and practical philosophy.

	ETA: Also, on the *Critique of Pure Reason* specifically, [Gardner](https://www.amazon.com/Routledge-Philosophy-GuideBook-Critique-GuideBooks/dp/041511909X/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=gardner+kant&amp;qid=1633218797&amp;sr=8-1), [Buroker](https://www.amazon.com/Kants-Critique-Pure-Reason-Introductions/dp/0521618258/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=buroker+kant&amp;qid=1633218822&amp;sr=8-1), and [O'Shea](https://www.amazon.com/Kants-Critique-Pure-Reason-Interpretation/dp/1844652793/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=o%27shea+kant&amp;qid=1633218833&amp;sr=8-1) are solid introductions.
