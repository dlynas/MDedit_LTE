## How impactful do you think campus protests are?

		Yeah, and unfortunately I’m seeing a lot of Biden-blame for this stuff as if he ordered the arrests himself.
		
		Instead the lesson should be, pay attention to local politics: election of mayors, judges, etc. Those are the types of people that have more power and control over what happens to protesters.

						That is 100% correct. The moderate base is voting for him currently because Trump is insane and he does not want to risk losing them.

The response from universities and local politicians has turned what was a normal campus protests (live long enough and you see this every 5-10 years) into a story about police brutality, free speech and how conservative college administrations have grown (in near total opposition to the faculty and students who are the reason they're in business).

				Understood. However my alma mater (USC) has essentially cancelled ceremonies regardless. Not sure if sending in LAPD rapid response teams was the best choice. Granted, Monday Morning QB'ing is always easier. And I'll acknowledge being a University President is one of the shittiest high-profile jobs in America, there are so many competing constituents it's the definition of "no win". Just saying sending in the cops with batons seemed like....a choice.

				Perhaps it's a function of my own media bubble, but I've seen numerous instances of outside agitators that have been directly hostile towards the antizionist student protesters and yet, I am not sure I've seen much, if any, coverage highlighting the existence of the "bad actors" on the zionist side. So part of my own frustration is the seemingly one-sided commentary on things. 
				
				Genuine question (assuming your media bubble is different than mine), have you seen what I'm talking about? And, if so, have you seen instances of the media calling out the bad actors on the pro-zionist side?

	Yeah, I mean, I’m not even sure what impact the protesters are intending to have beyond having their discontent with the war recognized. If that’s the goal, then it was successful.

	If the goal is to get universities to cut all ties, direct and indirect, with Israel, then that’s probably not going to happen. Even if they did, I’m not fully sure what that would accomplish. It’s not like Netanyahu will be fazed if Columbia University says they’ll stop accepting students or doing any sort of bushiness with Israel.

		I think in some cases those demands are symbolic. The real aim is likely to put pressure on the Biden admin to scale back the war funding. The other cases are where I think some important groups/colleges have large investments in giant technology and arms manufacturers, so the idea there would be to divest from these companies or threaten divestment if they don't cease business with Israel. Again this is probably a pipedream but at least makes some kind of logical sense on paper.
		
		To me the more realistic thing is to pressure Biden, because he is the one person in the US with by far the most influence on the way this war is being conducted, and like you said, to bring more awareness generally to their cause. A large contingent of voters have been content to sit idly by and not examine how the war is being prosecuted very closely.

		* 🟧 **[elefontius](https://www.reddit.com/user/elefontius)** ⬆️ 65 _(2024-04-30 18:17:28)_

			Brown and Northwestern haven't said they are divesting. They both agreed to allow student representatives meet with the investment boards that manage their endowments. In both cases, their respective boards will hear the students arguments for divestment and will then vote on it. In both cases I doubt that either schools will end up divesting in Israel. 
			
			For the sake of this argument let's ignore who's right or wrong. Divesting from SA vs divesting from Israel isn't comparable. South Africa was and is an economy based on resource exportation. Israel is one of the leading centers of technology research in the world. Every major tech company in the US operates R&amp;D centers in Israel currently because they've consistently produced breakthroughs in software, hardware and telecommunications. Take NVidia as an example outside their corporate HQ, they operate a R&amp;D lab in Tawian and Israel. 
			
			Divesting within the context of SA worked because it cut off access to capital that mining and resource extraction companies need. It also worked because the US government policy of banning imports from SA. It's not going to work in the case of Israel because their economy is heavily knowledge based and they can easily sell their technology to other countries. 
			
			Let's also consider how these schools would divest - would they need to sell all their assets and stock in companies that operate within Israel? That would be almost all of the technology sector and large parts of the SP500. Would they also need to sell stock in companies that license technology or IP from Israel? Again, that would be a large number of companies. These schools BDS'ing Israel isn't going to happen and from a practical standpoint even if it did happen it wouldn't cause an impact for Israel. They can easily sell/license their technology to any number of other interested countries.

	On campus or not, I think the context matters a lot with the comparison you've made. Vietnam was being protested largely by Americans who were actively being drafted and sent to war.

	The recent protests are aimed at a war that the USA is only involved in through it's allies. So it's not like these protests even *could* accomplish anything, and I think that logic is ultimately why the message is lost and why most people's opinions would be that it's all pretty nonsensical.

			As a former young person, I know I sound crazy to young people. But all there is, is voting and following their votes, over and over, and voting them out if they sell out.
			
			So much shit is wrong in America because our conservative billionaires won't fund it. Every 10 years it's like a whole new American voter appears, completely unaware of what the big words mean, yet confidant as fuck they need to crush their government in some way.
			
			Americans were led away from community and into this chaos. Trump and the stolen Supreme Court are the culmination of the Heritage Foundation, The Federalist Society, among others, a decade's long plan to ruin the New Deal. The voters aren't allowed to spend the Titans of Wealth's money on anything (hyperbole) but war and cops, which serve the Titans. Almost every brand has a billionaire family behind it spending mountains of gold in DC, always tempering the Democrats goals of people helping, always boosting the conservative goal of "I got mine, fuck you, you lazy taker!"

		Agreed. The protests have to be focused. This is why Occupy Wallstreet failed, and even why the BLM protests largely accomplished nothing.
		
		In contrast, the Tea Party protests were focused like a laser with clear political objectives, and were so successful they won elections and hijacked the GOP party strategy. The pro-life movement was also laser focused on its goal. Absolute dedication to one specific, clear goal with zero distractions. The pro-life movement accomplished what it set out to do.
		
		Protest movements must have clear leadership. There must be charismatic heads of the movement who speak for the movement, and who have clear objectives that can actually be accomplished.
		
		Trying to democratize a protest movement, ironically, dilutes its power. Everyone is a spokesman, which means every crackpot with a microphone speaks for the movement. Thats how you get the guy who said "Zionists don't deserve to live" as a spokesman for the Columbia campus protest movement: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68909942

				The Tea Party movement was so against the establishment that it invaded and overturned the establishment. It forced the establishment to accommodate the Tea Party movement because the movement won elections, and even today there's a group of around 15-25 Tea Partiers in Congress, and this group continually gives the GOP trouble even today, in recent votes in Congress.
				
				However, establishment vs non-establishment is a red herring and ultimately doesn't matter if a protest is successful. What matters is focused mission and skilled, charismatic political leadership.
				
				If the movement has no clear leadership who's competent and stays on message, the movement is doomed to failure.
				
				Meanwhile the left is so disorganized that it often protests a variety of unrelated causes. I remember the anti-war protests against the second Iraq war over two decades ago. I was in those protests. Unfortunately the protesters were unfocused and everyone brought a sign to protest their own pet cause. I saw PETA banners. Greenpeace save the planet stuff. Free Palestine signs were common. The goal of the march was to stop the Iraq war but no one could stay on message.

	They’re dysfunctional, unfocused. They’re focused on a niche issue and have zero means of actually extracting the change they truly want. Furthermore they are at the end of the year and have a timer. If anything they likely will draw the ire of more of their fellow students than administrators due to the threats against graduation.

	Also because of the grass roots nature; and the way they are conducting the protests (limited press engagements, hiding identities, etc) there is very little face leadership besides localized one. The movement will only interact locally to attempt to extract do nothing concessions that will have probably more medium to long term damage to the Palestinian cause (BDS specifically makes Palestinians poorer)

The US is not goign to change its position and say, ok never mind Hamas you can keep the hostages. They also aren't goign to stop resupplying Israel with weapons because Israel will just get overrun. Russia is watching this situation extremely closely and I 100% guarantee is pulling strings behind the scenes especially with Iran, Hezbollah, and Hamas.

	Currently, the US and Israel are only asking for 40 living hostages to be returned to start the ceasefire, and Hamas is saying they don't have enough within the critieria (living, elderly or female or children) that they can find to supply them. Is this a lie? Is this the truth? Idk but only asking for 40 of them back and Hamas pushign back on that isn't a good sign and seems to show that they are not negotiating in good faith.

	Protests are always very difficult to make effective. It takes a lot of effort and most protests, even/especially well organized ones fail. That said I don't view that reality as condemning protest as an entirely ineffective method of enacting change. Real change often requires a combination of factors. Protest, labor strikes, boycotts, investigative journalism, political campaigning, and "other" actions are often required in conjunction to make a difference. Malcolm X spoke on "diversity of tactics". Not a rejection of nonviolent protest but recognizing that it often needs more things happening alongside it to really work. More ways to put pressure on politicians and institutions, more avenues to direct supporters towards, more ways to think about overcoming the problem. 

	Let me put it another way. You can't completely  disassemble a car with just a single screwdriver. That said, if you really had to do that, at some point you are going to need a screwdriver. Protest is that screwdriver, and you'll do better with some experience with it, just dont expect it to be able to do everything.

You can see that a majority of folks don’t actually even know why they’re protesting. Sitting outside your university blocking classes, cancelling graduations, and inciting violence is doing nothing for Palestine. 

	Palestine held mass celebrations after 9/11. I’m not saying either side is right in this conflict, but sleeping outside your campus isn’t solving a LONG and inevitable conflict. I’ll likely get down voted for this, but that’s ok.

Combine that with stories of these protestors attacking Jewish students, destroying and occupying a building at Columbia, and just preventing people from getting to classes and they’re gonna burn through whatever goodwill they had at the start.

	It also kind of seems like the protests are starting to be kinda just about anything. It’s not just Palestine, it’s environmental justice, racism, police brutality, protesting a new cancer hospital in Chicago’s south side, the make up of the S&amp;P 500, the capitalist imperialist American empire, etc. I feel like it’s too many causes for one protest.

	It's hard to lump all protest movements together and then draw conclusions for this movement. Protesting is a tactic employed but it's effectiveness depends a lot on the messaging, ability to generate critical mass and the ability to build bridges to other groups. 

	Protesting is generally most effective when the broader population is sympathetic towards the protesters aims. This means that the government can't just squash the protests with force without risking a much broader backlash and any disruptions caused by the protest end up being blamed on the government in question for a refusal to realign with public sentiment. Sometimes protests can be used to shift public sentiment but this generally requires getting the most sympathetic people possible to ask for something reasonable and getting violent or extreme pushback. An elderly well dressed lady being arrested for not giving up her seat on a bus is a great example of this tactic. An ivy league student who is young, healthy and well off isn't going to play as well in terms of garnishing public sympathy.

	In terms of the current movement it doesn't seem like the protestors have widespread public support. Perhaps if they focused on narrower objectives like the removal of Netenyahu, the ending of Israeli settlements on Palestinian land and specific abuses then they could garner the sympathy from the public they need. Instead there are a number of people within the protest calling for the destruction of Israel and who are outright sympathetic of Hamas. These may not be the majority but they're common enough that it confuses the general public and makes potential allies skeptical about backing the movement. Protesting as a tactic can work but I don't think the current protest movement on campuses is setting itself up for success.

	Biden has not layed out the case for supporting israel. For the older voters he does not need to.

	For some younger voters they need a wake up call and reality check.  Because these younger voters are part of his base, he is not likely to give them a wake up call.

	Fundamentally no their will be no major foreign policy changes in the short term. Their is no justification for Israel's war crimes or their current governments clearly racially motivated genocide and targeting of civilians, and for that I imagine in the long run American policy will change to reflect that. But the truth is that the consequences of America not supporting Israel's right at the same time to wage war against Hamas for their barbarous attack, by upholding our longstanding agreements with literally the only democracy in the middle east, and the only country in the middle east whos system reflects a guarantee of ANY human rights, would be catastrophic. In contrast, Hamas has done far worse albeit on a smaller scale, and is responsible for the absolute oppressions and condition of Gaza and the Palestinians their. Hamas is also responsible for starting this war. Both Israel and America know that if Hamas survives it will have credibility for such acts and attacks, and will have proven barbarism as a plausible means for negotiation. Likewise if we look at any other nations in the middle east, they brutally oppress their people who live in horrendous conditions. Israel historically has been a beacon of democracy and human rights in the middle east and is truly the most free nation in the middle east. In the real world America is far more committed to the Israeli people and system then a very bad regime, one which many could argue has tried to break away at the democracy Israel represents. America is in a tough spot but my own opinion is that Biden is getting it right, and in the context of things, their is no comparison between the evil of Israel's current government, and those who would quickly if they could, exterminate all the people of Israel because of their ethnicity. If any other country in the Mideast was able to and they've demonstrated it in every case, they'd do far worse.

	Criticizing Israel's apartheid system is still beyond the pale to mainstream Dems. Michigan is already gone. The crackdown on these protests for people feeling "unsafe" is hilarious.

	  

	There is a generational change going on. People are sick and tired of bailing out a racist apartheid state that continues to build illegal settlements. Not one of you mentions how vile that practice is. The zionists need to figure out what they want: ethnic cleansing or peace. Also people are sick and tired of funding Israel's generous welfare system. They get free IVF and healthcare while Americans suffer.

	Some context for my reply: I actually participated in one of the university encampments and got to hang out with organizers for about a week.

	And my answer is that yes! They will have an impact, and they have already had an impact. You'd have to be blind not to see it!

	You'll mostly see it in the impact on the young people that were involved. You'll come back years after to many people having this as their political origin story. Many have gained a bunch of political experience organizing and managing the event. AND MY GOD it was so well put together, they were so determined, and they wanted REAL CHANGE.

	For many it was their first exposure to politics, they're just wandering around on campus and sit down to talk and learn about politics from their peers rather than the media or their parents.

	Young people didn't know about AIPAC, how much influence it has over what happens in our country, the only thing these kids may have known about is someone who could be brushed off as a racist spouting rhetoric about "who really controls the media" but NOW THEY'VE LIVED THROUGH IT

	They may have been raised to always see Israel as the victim, the underdog, or the good guy. The threats from the US and Israel against both NATO and the ICC has shown them to be militant aggressors. 

	Do you think someone who's been beaten and branded as a terrorist sympathizer by the state under Biden is going to continue to vote blue?

	I think I've already seen a real shift in discourse, young people making a clear distinction between Anti-Zion ism and being antisemitic

	I haven't felt so hopeful since 2016 when Bernie was running, I really think these Gen Z'ers will remake this stagnant nation where Millennials have failed

	I don’t expect them to have much impact at all. Why would they? People don’t take college students seriously on most issues, because young people tend to not vote. And these protests don’t represent a majority of students on any campus, just a very noisy interest group. So their influence is very limited.

	We live in an age of such abundant access to information, these protests (of a widely covered situation) have little impact on public awareness. 

	If a protest spawns enough mimicry, they could influence some political decision making, as politicians mainly operate based on what is popular with their constituents.

	I'm very skeptical of the divestment demands, simply because these schools have minimal influence through their investments, partnerships, and other programs. Even if a school decides they should cave, it's a very individual choice, and doesn't mean any other school (or organization) facing similar protests will have any reason to follow suit. I don't see this motivation inspiring any major movement.

	Schools like Columbia have more than enough people waiting in the wings to attend their school, should spots open up because students leave, choose not to attend, or are kicked out. They can often just ride out the protest, so there's little threat to their situation long term.

	Legitimately everyone is talking about them. Whether it's shutting down the bridge and ruining normal people's days as they sit in cars for hours, or getting media attention on ivy League college campuses and not necessarily winning the hearts and minds versus looking like out of touch or spoiled privileged people cosplaying as the people they are protesting for.

	So, not identifying the metric of what values how impactful they are, I will say everyone is talking about them. 

	The issue here is with the for-profit media companies that no longer want to create anything but a lack of nuance in a binary story to generate clicks through rage. 

	So everyone is talking about them but no one is doing so  in good faith, And the people that control the narrative do not want anything but a binary conversation that profits them.

	It's a touchy subject because on one hand protesting is a right we have and is not only lawful but defines American free speech. On the other hand, if Jewish students are being threatened then that's a big no-no. I'm not sure how severe the threats are but don't want to gaslight anybody. 

	Basically, you gotta allow peaceful protests but at the same time root out any antisemitism going on. The media needs to watch their step and not get too carried away when talking about one side or the other. The majority of Americans will make their minds up based on the news they listen to.

	But it is creating a shitstorm politically which you can argue is raising visibility of the issue and adding pressure to change the status quo on US policy.

	For me, there are some connections to the Vietnam protests. However there is major differences that they’re protesting not against the government but against an ideology tied toward the right for Jews to live safely in their homeland. ACAB is very different that From the River to the Sea

	Look at history, the young people who have protested through history in the 60's and 70's. Some advanced to be leading advocates for change.  It will be no different with some of these.

	I think they are mischaracterized, their primary stand is against the genocide, and they know of the history of how the Israeli State Sponsored Aparthied conduct has been imposed upon Palestinians for decades.   These young people have access to that information.   They are not out trying to have a lawn party, they are standing up against Imperialist styled genocide over poor people in Palestine and specifically at this time the devastation they have done in Garza.

	They are not alone, the U.N. and many members of the U.N. have declared these acts as genocide long before the students began their protest.       **I don't think they are anti Jewish Religion**, but they are not advocates for the ideology of *Zionism*

	* *(Which has always been about 'consolidating the land of Palestine under Israel and to dominate the whole of Jerusalem as a claim of Israel)*.

	quote

	(link) > [Zionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism):

	From 1897 to 1948, the primary goal of the Zionist movement was to establish the basis for a Jewish homeland in Palestine, ***and thereafter to consolidate it***.

	end quote

	I think the U.N. could do a great deal to stop this genocide, by immediately drafting the Resolution of Statehood for Palestine, and Israel will have to withdraw back inside of its own borders.   Israel could no longer claim land  or tax revenue from the Illegal settlement they built, because that will belong to Palestine. Jewish people who live in those settlements would become citizens of Palestine.    Israel could no longer run their apartheid promoting patrols in any part of Palestine.

	Ineffective, if the government of the Arab States wont pull back their investments in Israel, how likely would Colombia do. Their demand of closing all technology partnerships, shutting downt he Global campus in Israel, and divesting from any tech company involved, would basically mean Colombia can only invest in Hong Kong market now. Because all western countries in one form or another especially tech are invested in Israel. But further Israel is the leader in Desalination, meaning, rest of its neighbors cant just fully cut of tech, because they need water.

	They'll only be successful if they can provoke an excessive response from police. Most departments know this and will respond accordingly. The students are using strategies and tactics that are 50-60 years outdated.

	Depends on the context. Impactful to what?

	The Israeli War against Hamas? Completely and utterly ineffective.  Iran and Hamas is exploiting the protests to make political statements and the Israeli's don't really care what protest groups think. They're fighting a war. 

	On the Election? Well, this is going to harmful to Joe Biden. There's a side of his base that are calling him "Genocide Joe" and hate him because he hasn't done what they want and then there's everyone else turned off by the rising antisemitism in the nation and the hate these groups are putting on our college campuses. So, that reflects poorly.

	On Foreign Policy? The State Department doesn't care what protest groups do and they're certainly not going to take an antisemitic stance because a bunch of kids and hippies put tents and occupied a courtyard.

	On College Endowments? Yes, the colleges will lose federal funding and private funding as a result of this. Not because people support the protests but rather because people are disgusted by the college's inaction and enabling.

* 🟩 **[ArtGallery002](https://www.reddit.com/user/ArtGallery002)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-05-01 18:34:49)_

	I think when you consider that some campuses and even high schools have in the billions of dollars and they continually invest to increase the value of their asset portfolio. Its probably the most effective impact that a college student can have on the conflict.

	  

	Think about it, you could do 1000 bake sales for the conflict. Or you could convince your school to divest and then you'd remove over a millions or even of dollars per year from companies that support Isreal. 

	I think one thing that people don't really understand is that the companies that you are divesting from are those such as Siemens and LockHead Martin which provide a university with a lot more than just funding isreal. They provide things such as research materials, dry/wet lab machines, MRI Scanners. It's really hard to find a replacement for these companies especially when you have long contracts with them.

	The movement is really effective and it's worked in a lot of colleges already such as Dartmouth, and if it passed in the fall Brown might too (other colleges too). But student protesters often ruin the impacts that others make when they push the movement to become violent. Most evident in Columbia where the students who overtook Hamilton Hall will undeniably sour the progress made with the Administration. But theres a lot of variables that go into it.

	  

	TLDR: Yes I think it's effective to ask your college to divest considering some of their endowments reach into the billions. But the process of divesting is long and complex, finding substitutes for some corporations is simply not possible.
