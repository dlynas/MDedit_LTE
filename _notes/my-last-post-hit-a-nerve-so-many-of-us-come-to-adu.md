## My last post hit a nerve. So many of us come to adulthood and our mature relationships carrying around unhealed childhood injuries that continue to play out in our adult lives causing unnecessary pain and suffering.

We can heal with awareness, insight, and choosing another way.

Hereâ€™s an adjunct to my last post on healingâ€¦I hope itâ€™s helpful.

Sending you so much love ðŸ’—
