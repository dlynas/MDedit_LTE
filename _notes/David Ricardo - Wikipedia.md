**David Ricardo** (18 April 1772 – 11 September 1823) was a British [political economist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_economy "Political economy"), politician, and member of the [Parliament of Great Britain and Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom "Parliament of the United Kingdom"). He is recognized as one of the most influential [classical economists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_economics "Classical economics"), alongside figures such as [Thomas Malthus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Robert_Malthus "Thomas Robert Malthus"), [Adam Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith "Adam Smith") and [James Mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mill "James Mill").<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

Ricardo, born in London as the third surviving child of a successful stockbroker and his wife, came from a [Sephardic Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sephardic_Jews "Sephardic Jews") family of Portuguese origin. At 21, he eloped with a [Quaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaker "Quaker") and converted to [Unitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitarianism "Unitarianism"), causing estrangement from his family. He made his fortune financing government borrowing and later retired to an estate in [Gloucestershire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloucestershire "Gloucestershire"). Ricardo served as [High Sheriff of Gloucestershire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Sheriff_of_Gloucestershire "High Sheriff of Gloucestershire") and bought a seat in Parliament as an earnest reformer. He was friends with prominent figures like James Mill, [Jeremy Bentham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Bentham "Jeremy Bentham"), and [Thomas Malthus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Robert_Malthus "Thomas Robert Malthus"), engaging in debates over various topics. Ricardo was also a member of [The Geological Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Geological_Society "The Geological Society"), and his youngest sister was an author.

As MP for Portarlington, Ricardo advocated for liberal political movements and reforms, including free trade, parliamentary reform, and criminal law reform. He believed free trade increased the well-being of people by making goods more affordable. Ricardo notably opposed the [Corn Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_Laws "Corn Laws"), which he saw as barriers to economic growth. His friend John Louis Mallett described Ricardo's conviction in his beliefs, though he expressed doubts about Ricardo's disregard for experience and practice. Ricardo died at 51 from an ear infection that led to septicaemia (sepsis). He left behind a considerable fortune and a lasting legacy, with his free trade views eventually becoming public policy in Britain.

Ricardo wrote his first economics article at age 37, advocating for a reduction in the note-issuing of the Bank of England. He was also an [abolitionist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism "Abolitionism") and believed in the autonomy of a central bank as the issuer of money. Ricardo worked on fixing issues in Adam Smith's Labour Theory of Value, stating that the value of a commodity depends on the labour necessary for its production. He contributed to the development of theories of rent, wages, and profits, defining rent as the difference between the produce obtained by employing equal quantities of capital and labour. Ricardo's Theory of Profit posited that as real wages increase, real profits decrease due to the revenue split between profits and wages.

Ricardian theory of international trade challenges the mercantilism concept of accumulating gold or silver by promoting industry specialization and free trade. Ricardo introduced the concept of "comparative advantage," suggesting that nations should concentrate resources only in industries where they have the greatest efficiency of production relative to their own alternative uses of resources. He argued that international trade is always beneficial, even if one country is more competitive in every area than its trading counterpart. Ricardo opposed protectionism for national economies and was concerned about the short-term impact of technological change on labour.

## Personal life\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Ricardo&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Personal life")\]

Born in London, England, Ricardo was the third surviving of the 17 children of successful stockbroker Abraham Israel Ricardo (1733?–1812) and Abigail (1753–1801), daughter of Abraham Delvalle (also "del Valle"), of a respectable [Sephardic Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sephardi_Jews "Sephardi Jews") family that had been settled in England for three generations as "small but prosperous" tobacco and snuff merchants, and had obtained British citizenship. Abigail's sister, Rebecca, was wife of the engraver [Wilson Lowry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson_Lowry "Wilson Lowry"), and mother of the engraver [Joseph Wilson Lowry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Wilson_Lowry "Joseph Wilson Lowry") and the geologist, mineralogist, and author [Delvalle Lowry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delvalle_Lowry "Delvalle Lowry").<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Heertje_6-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-Heertje-6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:1_7-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-:1-7">[7]</a></sup> The Ricardo family were Sephardic Jews of [Portuguese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_people "Portuguese people") origin who had recently relocated from the [Dutch Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Republic "Dutch Republic").<sup id="cite_ref-Heertje_6-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-Heertje-6">[6]</a></sup> Ricardo began working with his father at the age of 14. At the age of 21 Ricardo eloped with a [Quaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_Society_of_Friends "Religious Society of Friends"), Priscilla Anne Wilkinson, and, against his father's wishes, converted to [Unitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitarianism "Unitarianism").<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> This religious difference resulted in estrangement from his family, and he was led to adopt a position of independence.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> His father disowned him and his mother apparently never spoke to him again.<sup id="cite_ref-sraffa_10-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-sraffa-10">[10]</a></sup>

Following this estrangement he went into business for himself with the support of Lubbocks and Forster, an eminent banking house. He made the bulk of his fortune by profitably financing Government borrowing. There is a story that he made his fortune as a result of speculation on the outcome of the [Battle of Waterloo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Waterloo "Battle of Waterloo"): _The Sunday Times_ reported in Ricardo's obituary, published on 14 September 1823, that during the battle Ricardo "netted upwards of a million sterling", a huge sum at the time, and this was later popularised by the economist [Paul Samuelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Samuelson "Paul Samuelson"); in reality Ricardo was already very rich and in June 1815 sold his latest government stock before the result of the battle was known in London, so missing half of the rise.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>

He retired, and subsequently purchased [Gatcombe Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatcombe_Park "Gatcombe Park"), an estate in [Gloucestershire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloucestershire "Gloucestershire"), and retired to the country. He was appointed [High Sheriff of Gloucestershire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Sheriff_of_Gloucestershire "High Sheriff of Gloucestershire") for 1818–19.<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> In August 1818 he bought Lord Portarlingtons' seat in Parliament for £4,000, as part of the terms of a loan of £25,000. His record in Parliament was that of an earnest reformer. He held the seat until his death five years later.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>

Ricardo was a close friend of [James Mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mill "James Mill"). Other notable friends included [Jeremy Bentham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Bentham "Jeremy Bentham") and [Thomas Malthus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Malthus "Thomas Malthus"), with whom Ricardo had a considerable debate (in correspondence) over such things as the role of landowners in a society. He also was a member of Malthus' [Political Economy Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_Economy_Club "Political Economy Club"), and a member of the [King of Clubs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Clubs_(Whig_club) "King of Clubs (Whig club)"). He was one of the original members of [The Geological Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Geological_Society "The Geological Society").<sup id="cite_ref-sraffa_10-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-sraffa-10">[10]</a></sup> His youngest sister was author [Sarah Ricardo-Porter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Richardson_Porter#Family "George Richardson Porter") (e.g., _Conversations in Arithmetic_).

## Parliamentary record\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Ricardo&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Parliamentary record")\]

As MP for [Portarlington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portarlington_(UK_Parliament_constituency) "Portarlington (UK Parliament constituency)"), Ricardo voted with the opposition in support of liberal political movements in [Naples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naples "Naples") and [Sicily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily "Sicily"), and for inquiry into the administration of justice in [Tobago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobago "Tobago"). He divided for (voted for) repeal of the [Blasphemous and Seditious Libels Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Acts "Six Acts"); then for inquiry into the [Peterloo massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peterloo_massacre "Peterloo massacre"); and, in 1821, for abolition of the death penalty for forgery.

He adamantly supported [free trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade "Free trade"). In 1821 he voted against renewal of the sugar duties, and objected to the higher duty on _East_ Indian as opposed to _West_ Indian produce. He opposed the timber duties. He voted silently for parliamentary reform and in 1822 spoke in its favour at the Westminster anniversary reform dinner; and again voted for criminal law reform.

Ricardo believed that increasing imports by free trade boosted the wellbeing of mankind by increasing the amount of goods cheaply available for subsistence and consumption. He was said to have "possessed an extraordinary quickness in perceiving in the turns of the market any accidental difference which might arise between the relative price of different stocks".<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> And he grew his wealth dealing in securities during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars.

As the Napoleonic Wars waged on, Ricardo developed a disdain for the [Corn Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_Laws "Corn Laws") imposed by the British to encourage exports. Notably, government intervention in the [grain trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain_trade "Grain trade") can be traced as far back as the 1400s; and thereafter trade was controlled, regulated, and taxed. Meanwhile, England developed a capitalist economy involving workers and landlords generating and consuming incomes and capital accumulations that depended entirely on capitalists’ profits,<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> and these key economic elements were under perpetual pressure during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

Political reform was needed as agricultural output was struggling to keep pace with population growth. The Corn Laws imposed barriers to imports that increased subsistence/consumption costs and triggered demand for higher wages. Higher wages reduced profits for agricultural producers, and had the immediate effects of reducing capital investments and slowing the growth of a nation's economy. Rising rents, attributed by Ricardo to the Corn Laws, came at the expense of the economic profits of nations. For David Ricardo, free trade was ever the answer; he envisioned Britain as importing agriculture products in exchange for exporting manufactured goods.<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> Eventually, after his death, the interventionist laws were repealed, and his free trade views became public policy in Britain.<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>

Of David Ricardo, his friend John Louis Mallett commented: " … he meets you upon every subject that he has studied with a mind made up, and opinions in the nature of mathematical truths. He spoke of parliamentary reform and ballot as a man who would bring such things about, and destroy the existing system tomorrow, if it were in his power, and without the slightest doubt on the result … It is this very quality of the man’s mind, his entire disregard of experience and practice, which makes me doubtful of his opinions on political economy."

## Death and legacy\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Ricardo&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Death and legacy")\]

Ten years after retiring and four years after entering Parliament, Ricardo died from an infection of the middle ear that spread into his brain and induced [septicaemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septicaemia "Septicaemia"). He was 51.

He and his wife Priscilla had eight children together including [Osman Ricardo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osman_Ricardo "Osman Ricardo") (1795–1881; MP for [Worcester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcester_(UK_Parliament_constituency) "Worcester (UK Parliament constituency)") 1847–1865), [David Ricardo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo_(the_younger) "David Ricardo (the younger)") (1803–1864, MP for [Stroud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroud_(UK_Parliament_constituency) "Stroud (UK Parliament constituency)") 1832–1833) and Mortimer Ricardo, who served as an officer in the [Life Guards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_Guards_(British_Army) "Life Guards (British Army)") and was a [deputy lieutenant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_lieutenant "Deputy lieutenant") for [Oxfordshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxfordshire "Oxfordshire").<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup>

Ricardo is buried in an ornate grave in the churchyard of [Saint Nicholas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_of_Myra "Nicholas of Myra") in Hardenhuish, now a suburb of [Chippenham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chippenham "Chippenham"), Wiltshire. At the time of his death his assets were estimated at £675,000–£775,000.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_7-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-:1-7">[7]</a></sup>

## Ideas\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Ricardo&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Ideas")\]

Ricardo wrote his first economics article at 37, firstly in _[The Morning Chronicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Morning_Chronicle "The Morning Chronicle")_ advocating reduction in the note-issuing of the [Bank of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England "Bank of England") and then publishing _The High Price of Bullion, a Proof of the Depreciation of Bank Notes_ in 1810.<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup>

He was also an [abolitionist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism "Abolitionism"), speaking at a meeting of the Court of the [East India Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company "East India Company") in March 1823, where he said he regarded [slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery "Slavery") as a stain on the character of the nation.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup>

### Banking\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Ricardo&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Banking")\]

[Adam Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith "Adam Smith") argued that free commercial banking, such as the banking system in Scotland which had no [central bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank "Central bank") when _[Wealth of Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Nations "Wealth of Nations")_ was written in 1776, was favourable to economic growth. Writing just a few decades later, Ricardo argued for a central bank, a cause that was taken up by his students, including [John Stuart Mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill "John Stuart Mill"), who was known to favour the _[laissez-faire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire "Laissez-faire")_ policies in every place but banking.

Ricardo wrote the _Plan for the Establishment of a National Bank_ (published posthumously in 1824), which argued for the autonomy of the central bank as the issuer of money.<sup id="cite_ref-bindseil2019_22-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-bindseil2019-22">[22]</a></sup>

Ricardo proposed that a ratio of gold and Treasury bills, and a fixed claim (asset) against the government, would secure the central bank's liquidity:<sup id="cite_ref-binsdseil2019_23-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-binsdseil2019-23">[23]</a></sup>

> The public, or the Government on behalf of the public, is indebted to the Bank in a sum of money larger than the whole amount of Bank notes in circulation; for the Government not only owes the Bank fifteen million, its original capital, which is lent at 3 per cent. interest, but also many more millions which are advanced on Exchequer bills, on half-pay and pension annuities, and on other securities. It is evident, therefore, that if the Government itself were to be the sole issuer of paper money instead of borrowing it of the Bank, the only difference would be with respect to the interest: the Bank would no longer receive interest and the Government would no longer pay it; but all other classes in the community would be exactly in the same position in which they now stand.

Ricardo was a man of many trades, economically and financially speaking. Ricardo was able to recognize and identify the problem presented through banking within regulations and debauched standards of approval at certain times. Ricardo knew that banks in rural areas as well as the Bank of England had increased note lending and overall lending in 1810. Through this, Ricardo proved subsequent changes in price level through the market was also affected and thus new regulations needed to be made available. Furthermore, Ricardo was able to understand and distinguish the socioeconomic makeup that created and established parameters around different classes within the economy. Ricardo advocated for the productive powers of labour to be held in high concern as the most influential of devices that played a role in the progression of the American Economy along with others. In addition, Ricardo made notable advancements in the concept build involving reactions in the open market when considering banking altercations, stock investments, or other considerable impacting events. Ricardo wanted to establish a firm ground between the bank and the control over monetary policy because there was power within the banking system that Ricardo believed needed to be considered carefully. In 1816, Ricardo said “In the present state of the law, they have the power, without any control whatever, of increasing or reducing the circulation in any degree they may think proper: a power which should neither be entrusted to the State itself, nor to anybody in it; as there can be no security for the uniformity in the value of the currency, when its augmentation or diminution depends solely on the will of the issuers.” Ricardo felt the circulation of money and the decision behind how much is available at any time should not be entrusted to either the State, or any individual. Ricardo argued for the most even distribution possible with the highest control readily available.

### Value theory\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Ricardo&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Value theory")\]

David Ricardo worked to fix the issues he felt were most concerning with [Adam Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith "Adam Smith")’s Labour Theory of Value.<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> Both men worked with the assumption that land, labour, and capital were the three basic factors of production. However, Smith narrowed in on labour as the determinant of value. Ricardo believes that with production having three factors it is impossible for only one of them to determine value on its own.<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> Ricardo illustrates his point by adapting Smith's deer beaver analogy<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> to show that even when labour is the only factor of production the hardship and tools of the labour will drive a wedge in the relative value of the good. Due to his criticisms of the Labour Theory of Value [George Stigler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stigler "George Stigler") called his theory a "93% labor theory of value".<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup>

Ricardo's most famous work is his _[Principles of Political Economy and Taxation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_Political_Economy_and_Taxation "Principles of Political Economy and Taxation")_ (1817). He advanced a [labour theory of value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_theory_of_value "Labour theory of value"):<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup>

> The value of a commodity, or the quantity of any other commodity for which it will exchange, depends on the relative quantity of labour which is necessary for its production, and not on the greater or less compensation which is paid for that labour.

Ricardo's note to Section VI:<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup>

> Mr. Malthus appears to think that it is a part of my doctrine, that the cost and value of a thing be the same;—it is, if he means by cost, "cost of production" including profit.

### Rent\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Ricardo&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Rent")\]

Ricardo contributed to the development of theories of rent, wages, and profits. He defined [rent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_rent "Economic rent") as "the difference between the produce obtained by the employment of two equal quantities of capital and labour."<sup id="cite_ref-:2_30-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-:2-30">[30]</a></sup> Ricardo believed that the process of economic development, which increased land use and eventually led to the cultivation of poorer land, principally benefited landowners. According to Ricardo, such premium over "real social value" that is reaped due to ownership constitutes value to an individual but is at best<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> a paper monetary return to "society". The portion of such purely individual benefit that accrues to scarce resources Ricardo labels "rent".

In particular, Ricardo postulates that rent is a result of increased populations which results in assets growing scarce and in some cases diminished returns of which were once abundant. Ricardo breaks down this premise by first supposing there are three fields of land - No. 1, 2, 3, - to yield corn, with an equal employment of capital and labour. Initially land No.1 is cultivated and is very productive as measured through the abundant surplus. Over time this abundant surplus becomes diminished as the result of an increase in population, which subsequently creates an increased demand for food. The less desired land, No.2, must now be cultivated and eventually so must land No.3 and so on and so forth. For Ricardo each new cultivated results in diminished surplus as the quality of land fails to yield the equal of that before it. In light of such diminishing surplus landowners see opportunities to charge rent as a means to compensate for the loss of returns on output.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_30-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-:2-30">[30]</a></sup>

### Ricardo's theories of wages and profits\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Ricardo&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Ricardo's theories of wages and profits")\]

In his _Theory of Profit_, Ricardo stated that as [real wages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_wages "Real wages") increase, real profits decrease because the revenue from the sale of manufactured goods is split between profits and wages. He said in his _Essay on Profits_, "Profits depend on high or low wages, wages on the price of necessaries, and the price of necessaries chiefly on the price of food."

## Ricardian theory of international trade\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Ricardo&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Ricardian theory of international trade")\]

Between 1500 and 1750 most economists advocated [mercantilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism "Mercantilism"), which promoted the idea of international trade for the purpose of earning bullion by running a trade surplus with other countries. Ricardo challenged the idea that the purpose of trade was merely to accumulate gold or silver. With "[comparative advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage "Comparative advantage")" Ricardo argued in favour of industry specialisation and [free trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade "Free trade"). He suggested that industry specialization combined with free international trade always produces positive results. This theory expanded on the concept of [absolute advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_advantage "Absolute advantage").

Ricardo suggested that there is mutual national benefit from trade even if one country is more competitive in every area than its trading counterpart and that a nation should concentrate resources only in industries where it has a [comparative advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage "Comparative advantage"),<sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup> that is in those industries in which it has the greatest efficiency of production relative to its own alternative uses of resources, rather than industries where it holds a competitive edge compared to rival nations. Ricardo suggested that national industries which were, in fact, mildly profitable and marginally internationally competitive should be jettisoned in favour of the industries that made the best use of limited resources—the assumption being that subsequent economic growth due to better resource use would more than offset any short-run economic dislocation which would result from closing mildly profitable and marginally competitive national industries.

Ricardo attempted to prove theoretically that international trade is always beneficial.<sup id="cite_ref-33"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup> [Paul Samuelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Samuelson "Paul Samuelson") called the numbers used in Ricardo's example dealing with trade between England and Portugal the "four magic numbers".<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup> "In spite of the fact that the Portuguese could produce both cloth and wine with less amount of labour, Ricardo suggested that both countries would benefit from trade with each other".

### Comparative advantage\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Ricardo&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Comparative advantage")\]

Ricardo's theory of international trade was reformulated by John Stuart Mill in 1844.<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> The term "comparative advantage" was introduced by J. S. Mill and his contemporaries.

John Stuart Mill started a neoclassical turn of international trade theory, i.e. his formulation was inherited by Alfred Marshall and others, and has both contributed to the resurrection of the anti-Ricardian concept of law of supply and demand, and induced the arrival of neoclassical theory of value.<sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup>

### New interpretation\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Ricardo&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: New interpretation")\]

Ricardo's four magic numbers have long been interpreted as comparison of two ratios of labour (or other input in fixed supply) coefficients. This interpretation is now considered as overly simplistic by modern economists. The point was rediscovered by Roy J. Ruffin<sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup> in 2002 and re-examined and explained in detail in Andrea Maneschi<sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup> in 2004. The more flexible approach is now known as the _new interpretation_, despite having been previously mentioned by [Piero Sraffa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piero_Sraffa "Piero Sraffa") in 1930 and by Kenzo Yukizawa in 1974.<sup id="cite_ref-39"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup> The new interpretation affords a totally new reading of Ricardo's _Principles of Political Economy and Taxation_ with regards to trade theory, although it does not change the mathematics of optimal resource allocation.<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup>

### Protectionism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Ricardo&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Protectionism")\]

Like Adam Smith, Ricardo was an opponent of [protectionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectionism "Protectionism") for national economies, especially for agriculture. He believed that the British "[Corn Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_Laws "Corn Laws")"—imposing tariffs on agricultural products—ensured that less-productive domestic land would be cultivated and rents would be driven up ([Case & Fair 1999](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#CITEREFCaseFair1999), pp. 812, 813). Thus, profits would be directed toward landlords and away from the emerging industrial capitalists. Ricardo believed landlords tended to squander their wealth on luxuries, rather than invest. He believed the Corn Laws were leading to the stagnation of the British economy.<sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup> In 1846, his nephew [John Lewis Ricardo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ricardo "John Ricardo"), [MP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament_(United_Kingdom) "Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)") for [Stoke-upon-Trent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoke-upon-Trent_(UK_Parliament_constituency) "Stoke-upon-Trent (UK Parliament constituency)"), advocated [free trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade "Free trade") and the repeal of the Corn Laws.

Modern empirical analysis of the Corn Laws yields mixed results.<sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup> Parliament repealed the Corn Laws in 1846.

### Technological change\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Ricardo&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Technological change")\]

Ricardo was concerned about the impact of technological change on labour in the short-term.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_43-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-:0-43">[43]</a></sup> In 1821, he wrote that he had become "convinced that the substitution of machinery for human labour, is often very injurious to the interests of the class of labourers," and that "the opinion entertained by the labouring class, that the employment of machinery is frequently detrimental to their interests, is not founded on prejudice and error, but is conformable to the correct principles of political economy."<sup id="cite_ref-:0_43-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-:0-43">[43]</a></sup> Ricardo's idea of technological change is now formulated in a modern form.<sup id="cite_ref-Shiozawa20_44-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-Shiozawa20-44">[44]</a></sup>

### Criticism of the Ricardian theory of trade\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Ricardo&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Criticism of the Ricardian theory of trade")\]

Ricardo himself was the first to recognize that comparative advantage is a domain-specific theory, meaning that it applies only when certain conditions are met. Ricardo noted that the theory applies only in situations where capital is immobile. Regarding his famous example, he wrote:

> it would undoubtedly be advantageous to the capitalists \[and consumers\] of England... \[that\] the wine and cloth should both be made in Portugal \[and that\] the capital and labour of England employed in making cloth should be removed to Portugal for that purpose.<sup id="cite_ref-Ricardo_1821_7.19_45-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-Ricardo_1821_7.19-45">[45]</a></sup>

Ricardo recognized that applying his theory in situations where capital was mobile would result in [offshoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offshoring "Offshoring"), and thereby economic decline and job loss. To correct for this, he argued that (i) "most men of property \[will be\] satisfied with a low rate of profits in their own country, rather than seek\[ing\] a more advantageous employment for their wealth in foreign nations", and (ii) capital was functionally immobile.<sup id="cite_ref-Ricardo_1821_7.19_45-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-Ricardo_1821_7.19-45">[45]</a></sup>

Ricardo's argument in favour of [free trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade "Free trade") has also been attacked by those who believe trade restriction can be necessary for the economic development of a nation. [Utsa Patnaik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utsa_Patnaik "Utsa Patnaik") claims that Ricardian theory of [international trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade "International trade") contains a logical fallacy. Ricardo assumed that in both countries two goods are producible and actually are produced, but developed and underdeveloped countries often trade those goods which are not producible in their own country. In these cases, one cannot define which country has comparative advantage.<sup id="cite_ref-46"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup>

Critics also argue that Ricardo's theory of [comparative advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage "Comparative advantage") is flawed in that it assumes production is continuous and absolute. In the real world, events outside the realm of human control (e.g. natural disasters) can disrupt production. In this case, specialisation could cripple a country that depends on imports from foreign, naturally disrupted countries. For example, if an industrially based country trades its manufactured goods with an [agrarian country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrarian_country "Agrarian country") in exchange for agricultural products, a natural disaster in the agricultural country (e.g. drought) may cause the industrially based country to starve.

As [Joan Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Robinson "Joan Robinson") pointed out, following the opening of free trade with England, Portugal endured centuries of economic underdevelopment: "the imposition of free trade on Portugal killed off a promising textile industry and left her with a slow-growing export market for wine, while for England, exports of cotton cloth led to accumulation, mechanisation and the whole spiralling growth of the industrial revolution". Robinson argued that Ricardo's example required that economies be in static equilibrium positions with full employment and that there could not be a trade deficit or a trade surplus. These conditions, she wrote, were not relevant to the real world. She also argued that Ricardo's math did not take into account that some countries may be at different levels of development and that this raised the prospect of 'unequal exchange' which might hamper a country's development, as we saw in the case of Portugal.<sup id="cite_ref-47"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup>

The development economist [Ha-Joon Chang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ha-Joon_Chang "Ha-Joon Chang") challenges the argument that free trade benefits every country:

> Ricardo’s theory is absolutely right—within its narrow confines. His theory correctly says that, _accepting their current levels of technology as given_, it is better for countries to specialize in things that they are relatively better at. One cannot argue with that. His theory fails when a country wants to acquire more advanced technologies—that is, when it wants to develop its economy. It takes time and experience to absorb new technologies, so technologically backward producers need a period of protection from international competition during this period of learning. Such protection is costly, because the country is giving up the chance to import better and cheaper products. However, it is a price that has to be paid if it wants to develop advanced industries. Ricardo’s theory is, thus seen, for those who accept the _status quo_ but not for those who want to change it.<sup id="cite_ref-48"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup>

## Ricardian equivalence\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Ricardo&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Ricardian equivalence")\]

Another idea associated with Ricardo is [Ricardian equivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardian_equivalence "Ricardian equivalence"), an argument suggesting that in some circumstances a government's choice of how to pay for its spending (_i.e.,_ whether to use tax revenue or issue debt and run a deficit) might have no effect on the economy. This is due to the fact the public saves its excess money to pay for expected future tax increases that will be used to pay off the debt. Ricardo notes that the proposition is theoretically implied in the presence of intertemporal optimisation by rational taxpayers: but that since taxpayers do not act so rationally, the proposition fails to be true in practice. Thus, while the proposition bears his name, he does not seem to have believed it. Economist [Robert Barro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Barro "Robert Barro") is responsible for its modern prominence.

## Influence and intellectual legacy\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Ricardo&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Influence and intellectual legacy")\]

David Ricardo's ideas had a tremendous influence on later developments in economics. US economists rank Ricardo as the second most influential economic thinker, behind Adam Smith, prior to the twentieth century.<sup id="cite_ref-49"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup>

### \[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Ricardo&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Ricardian socialists")\]

Ricardo's writings fascinated a number of early socialists in the 1820s, who thought his value theory had radical implications. They argued that, in view of labour theory of value, labour produces the entire product, and the profits capitalists get are a result of exploitations of workers.<sup id="cite_ref-50"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup> These include [Thomas Hodgskin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hodgskin "Thomas Hodgskin"), [William Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Thompson_(philosopher) "William Thompson (philosopher)"), [John Francis Bray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Francis_Bray "John Francis Bray"), and [Percy Ravenstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Ravenstone "Percy Ravenstone").

### Georgists\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Ricardo&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Georgists")\]

[Georgists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgists "Georgists") believe that rent, in the sense that Ricardo used, belongs to the community as a whole. [Henry George](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_George "Henry George") was greatly influenced by Ricardo, and often cited him, including in his most famous work, _[Progress and Poverty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress_and_Poverty "Progress and Poverty")_ from 1879. In the preface to the fourth edition he wrote: "What I have done in this book, if I have correctly solved the great problem I have sought to investigate, is, to unite the truth perceived by the school of Smith and Ricardo to the truth perceived by the school of Proudhon and Lasalle; to show that laissez faire (in its full true meaning) opens the way to a realization of the noble dreams of socialism; to identify social law with moral law, and to disprove ideas which in the minds of many cloud grand and elevating perceptions."<sup id="cite_ref-51"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup>

### Neo-Ricardians\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Ricardo&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Neo-Ricardians")\]

After the rise of the 'neoclassical' school, Ricardo's influence declined temporarily. It was [Piero Sraffa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piero_Sraffa "Piero Sraffa"), the editor of the Collected Works of David Ricardo<sup id="cite_ref-52"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup> and the author of seminal _Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities_,<sup id="cite_ref-53"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup> who resurrected Ricardo as the originator of another strand of economic thought, which was effaced with the arrival of the neoclassical school. The new interpretation of Ricardo and Sraffa's criticism against the marginal theory of value gave rise to a new school, now named neo-Ricardian or Sraffian school. Major contributors to this school include [Luigi Pasinetti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Pasinetti "Luigi Pasinetti") (1930–), [Pierangelo Garegnani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierangelo_Garegnani "Pierangelo Garegnani") (1930–2011), [Ian Steedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Steedman "Ian Steedman") (1941–), [Geoffrey Harcourt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Harcourt "Geoffrey Harcourt") (1931–2021), [Heinz Kurz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinz_Kurz "Heinz Kurz") (1946–), [Neri Salvadori](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neri_Salvadori&action=edit&redlink=1 "Neri Salvadori (page does not exist)") (1951–), [Pier Paolo Saviotti](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pier_Paolo_Saviotti&action=edit&redlink=1 "Pier Paolo Saviotti (page does not exist)") (–) among others. See also [Neo-Ricardianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Ricardianism "Neo-Ricardianism"). The Neo-Ricardian school is sometimes seen to be a component of [Post-Keynesian economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Keynesian_economics "Post-Keynesian economics").

#### Neo-Ricardian trade theory\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Ricardo&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Neo-Ricardian trade theory")\]

Inspired by [Piero Sraffa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piero_Sraffa "Piero Sraffa"), a new strand of trade theory emerged and was named neo-Ricardian trade theory. The main contributors include [Ian Steedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Steedman "Ian Steedman") and [Stanley Metcalfe](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stanley_Metcalfe_(trade_theorist)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Stanley Metcalfe (trade theorist) (page does not exist)"). They have criticised neoclassical international trade theory, namely the [Heckscher–Ohlin model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heckscher%E2%80%93Ohlin_model "Heckscher–Ohlin model") on the basis that the notion of capital as primary factor has no method of measuring it before the determination of profit rate (thus trapped in a logical vicious circle).<sup id="cite_ref-54"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-55"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup> This was a second round of the [Cambridge capital controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_capital_controversy "Cambridge capital controversy"), this time in the field of international trade.<sup id="cite_ref-56"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup> Depoortère and Ravix judge that neo-Ricardian contribution failed without giving effective impact on neoclassical trade theory, because it could not offer "a genuine alternative approach from a classical point of view."<sup id="cite_ref-57"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-57">[57]</a></sup>

#### Evolutionary growth theory\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Ricardo&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Evolutionary growth theory")\]

Several distinctive groups have sprung out of the neo-Ricardian school. One is the evolutionary growth theory, developed notably by [Luigi Pasinetti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Pasinetti "Luigi Pasinetti"), J.S. Metcalfe, Pier Paolo Saviotti, and Koen Frenken and others.<sup id="cite_ref-58"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-59"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup>

Pasinetti<sup id="cite_ref-60"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-60">[60]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-61"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-61">[61]</a></sup> argued that the demand for any commodity came to stagnate and frequently decline, demand saturation occurs. Introduction of new commodities (goods and services) is necessary to avoid economic stagnation.

#### Contemporary theories\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Ricardo&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Contemporary theories")\]

Ricardo's idea was even expanded to the case of continuum of goods by Dornbusch, Fischer, and Samuelson<sup id="cite_ref-62"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-62">[62]</a></sup> This formulation is employed for example by Matsuyama<sup id="cite_ref-63"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-63">[63]</a></sup> and others.

Ricardian trade theory ordinarily assumes that the [labour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_labour "Wage labour") is the unique input. This is a deficiency as intermediate goods occupies now a great part of international trade. The situation changed after the appearance of [Yoshinori Shiozawa](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A1%A9%E6%B2%A2%E7%94%B1%E5%85%B8 "ja:塩沢由典")'s work of 2007.<sup id="cite_ref-64"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-64">[64]</a></sup> He has succeeded to incorporate traded input goods in his model.<sup id="cite_ref-65"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup> His theory became more useful by the discovery of new definition of regular international values (a couple of wage rates for countries and prices for products), because it is not defined as the normal vector at a facet of world production possibility set, which is the set where all countries enjoy full employment. The new definition is given in Shiozawa and Fujimoto (2018)<sup id="cite_ref-66"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup> and in Shiozawa (2020).<sup id="cite_ref-Shiozawa20_44-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-Shiozawa20-44">[44]</a></sup> Shiozawa's theory of international values is now the unique theory of international trade that can treat unemployment and input trade in a general form.

Yeats found that 30% of world trade in manufacturing is intermediate inputs.<sup id="cite_ref-67"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup> Bardhan and Jafee found that intermediate inputs occupy 37 to 38% in the imports to the US for the years from 1992 to 1997, whereas the percentage of intrafirm trade grew from 43% in 1992 to 52% in 1997.<sup id="cite_ref-68"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-68">[68]</a></sup>

#### Unequal exchange\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Ricardo&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Unequal exchange")\]

Chris Edward includes Emmanuel's [unequal exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unequal_exchange "Unequal exchange") theory among variations of neo-Ricardian trade theory.<sup id="cite_ref-69"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo#cite_note-69">[69]</a></sup> [Arghiri Emmanuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arghiri_Emmanuel "Arghiri Emmanuel") argued that the [Third World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_World "Third World") is poor because of the international exploitation<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify" title="Wikipedia:Please clarify"><span title="The text near this tag may need clarification or removal of jargon.

It also clearly laid out the theory of [comparative advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage "Comparative advantage"), which argued that all nations could benefit from [free trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade "Free trade"), even if a nation was less efficient at producing all kinds of goods than its trading partners.
