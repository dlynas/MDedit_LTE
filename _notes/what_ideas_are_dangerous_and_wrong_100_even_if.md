	Kindness on the road by unessecarily giving away your right of way.

	Don't be polite, be predictable. Stick to the road laws.

		This is especially frustrating when someone slows to let you in but traffic is very light. Had they just kept going you could have turned and been on your way quicker than waiting to figure out why they are slowing down.

			Yes! I’d rather go more quickly than go in front of you.

			It's honestly worse when someone does it when traffic is heavy.
			
			
			For example, today, I was trying to turn left out of a parking lot onto a 4 lane road. One person in the far lane moving to my right slowed down to let me turn, but they had no control over their other lane, or the two lanes of their oncoming traffic. 
			
			
			And they sat there waving me in while I clearly couldn't go, but then someone from their oncoming traffic decided to try to turn left into the parking lot, but couldn't, because the near lane in the same direction wasn't slowing down.
			
			
			This resulted in 3 of the 4 lanes being blocked, and no one being able to go. 
			
			
			All the while, had that one person just passed, I could have started to turn behind them and waited for the oncoming traffic to clear. 
			
			
			This was close enough to a light that people from the oncoming lanes got stuck in the intersection, now preventing the cross traffic going the entirely perpendicular directions to also be stopped at their green light. 
			
			
			This one person fucked up traffic for like 30+ cars because they were trying to be polite, rather than safe and predictable.

		I can’t even express how much I agree with this. When people do this trying to be kind, they are creating chaos and putting other people in danger. Right of way laws exist for a reason, to create order while we operate incredibly dangerous deadly large pieces of metal.

					Not who you were asking but I took it as the people who sit when the light turns green so the person can turn left. It may sound nice, but if there is no one behind you I can go once you are out of the way, and if people are behind you then you are pissing them off as well as annoying me because I have no idea why you are sitting there. Did you expect me to go so you were checking? Were you trying to let me go? Were you just not paying attention to the light and you're going to hit me because you saw the light is green and you're going to go in the intersection without looking?

		* 🟧 **[austinmiles](https://www.reddit.com/user/austinmiles)** ⬆️ 40 _(2024-04-16 22:41:23)_

			This is a huge problem on a bike. 
			
			I try to follow the road laws and stop at stop signs and give right of way, etc. people who try to be nice and wave me through can be so confusing. 
			
			Especially if I signal that I’m stopping and they should go. It becomes a whole thing and people get frustrated with me but I’m usually already stopped and just waiting for them because I’m afraid that as soon as I go their brain is going to click that I’m letting them go and they will run me over. 
			
			I live in a very bike friendly place so this is common

				God do I get this one. In Vancouver I've encountered this so much that now I just stop and do everything to avoid eye contact, check my watch, start a knitting project, whatever, until they just go. THEN I go. It's super idiotic and super frustrating and it only started in recent years for some reason.

				He was so easy to spot, just by the speed he approached that sign. Maybe I'm used to it, but MA drivers are predictable ass holes to me now.

		Someone literally stopped to let me make a left turn onto a side street, even with cars behind them, and I was like "wtf are you doing?!?!" Traffic had been backed up from a light up ahead, but it just started moving when the guy tried to let me go - like dude. Just go!! I can wait my turn i promise!

			Had almost this exact thing happen a few weeks back. To make matters worse, each side of the road had 2 lanes, so cars behind him were switching into the other lane on his side to pass him. He was driving a pickup truck that obscured my view of the other lane, so it was unsafe for me to make the turn.
			
			In the end, he might have been peeved that I didn't take him up on his kindness because he sped off, after which I safely made my left turn. Lol.

		I have seen more than one accident caused by letting someone in through a line of traffic, only to get nailed by someone in the neighboring lane who couldn't see them and didn't expect it.

			It's pretty much all 2 lane roads around me, and this is exactly what I'm always wondering. Where do you think you're getting to driving like that? I had someone earlier today who kept getting on my ass, then backing off. Almost side swiped me by blasting by me in the breakdown lane when I took a turn to get rid of them. Took the back way that takes just as long. Watched this same asshole drive by, still stuck in the same line of cars after I parked a few minutes later.

				So when they are in situations where no one around can help them, they just crank up the "HELLO CAN'T YOU SEE I'M HAVING A PROBLEM HERE" behavior until the problem goes away.

					Once upon a time I found myself getting really upset by the way people were driving around me, like a car speeding and weaving through lanes, or the person who thinks they’re the speed limit police and will box cars in going 3 mph under the speed limit 
					
					I started telling myself “oh that guy speeding and weaving through traffic must have eaten something he shouldn’t have, he’s probably rushing to the nearest toilet so he doesn’t ruin his pants” and the person who refuses to acknowledge the flow of traffic “they probably have a newborn baby/delicate tiered cake/pot of chili, so they’re driving extra carefully”
					
					It’s all situations I’ve found myself in, so I could relate and then wouldn’t be so irritated, and it’s sort of morphed into my subconscious and instead of being annoyed, I just slow to let them in front of me or I eventually work my way into a different lane so I can safely pass them. I don’t have to get myself irritated and annoyed, I can acknowledge they’re not driving safely, and change my own driving to accommodate it safely.

			* 🟦 **[myBisL2](https://www.reddit.com/user/myBisL2)** ⬆️ 126 _(2024-04-16 19:28:13)_

				My theory is they see you've left space between you and the car in front of you and they interpret that to mean you could be going faster.  So they tailgate you to try and pressure or intimidate you into going faster.  They don't ever think that through and realize that if that space is not getting ever wider you are maintaining the same speed as the car in front.

				* 🟪 **[cat_prophecy](https://www.reddit.com/user/cat_prophecy)** ⬆️ 111 _(2024-04-16 19:51:46)_

			The issue I have with this is when there's someone going way under the speed limit in front and instead of anyone passing, everyone drives just close enough to the next car so a long line builds up to where someone that actually wants to pass HAS to do this maneuver or they're trapped way back in preventable slow moving traffic.

			* 🟦 **[mahjimoh](https://www.reddit.com/user/mahjimoh)** ⬆️ 29 _(2024-04-16 19:49:45)_

				Yes, when everyone is crowded it’s often no longer possible for anyone but the person in the very front to pass, because you’d have to pass the whole damn train.

		I have a long stretch of two lane road to get to my house, with few safe passing zones due to curves and hills. I sometimes turn into a driveway or side road when there's one like this behind me, just to get out of the hassle. Often I see them driving fast until they reach another car in their lane, and then they start tailgating that one.

		It’s recommended to slow down if you’re being tailgated. The slower a car means less distance needed to brake so it’s safer to slowdown, especially with bright headlights. You are meant to keep a certain distance for that purpose. The rule is usually for ever 10 mph you drive keep about that much of a cars distance. 60
		Mph=6 car distances. So if they’re riding your ass half a car length away it’s your civic duty to drive 5mph. (Don’t actually slow down to 5mph the tailgater will absolutely make rear seat renovations.)

					A highly specialized use where you are in a situation where you need to power a specific circuit that's been cut off from the main source.

							Lineman can be killed when people use a generator to power up their homes like this after a storm when they neglect to disconnect their main circuit breaker.  A suicide cord is never the proper way to power up a circuit during an outage.  The correct way is to have a dedicated male plug for the generator infeed wired up to your main panel with a transfer switch or generator interlock. This way, there is never hazardous voltage on exposed conductors, and it is impossible to backfeed power onto the grid.  In many cases, this is the only legal way to power your house during an outage. Otherwise, you are supposed to only power the appliances you need straight off the generator with extension cords.

							* ⬛️ **[Broken6r](https://www.reddit.com/user/Broken6r)** ⬆️ 53 _(2024-04-16 21:25:39)_

								And if you backfeed by plugging your generator in to an outlet using a cord with dual male ends, We can absolutely fry your generator when we ground out the power line. 
								
								The reason that a transfer switch is necessary is because it  isolates you from the transformer, and therefore the power line. 
								
								Transformers don't care how they are fed. If fed from the power line on the high side, it will put out a reduced voltage on the low side (towards your home for example). But if you feed it with that reduced voltage from the low side (like from a generator plugged in to a wall outlet with no transfer switch in use), it will spit out full line voltage on the high side with the potential to burn maim or kill the linemen trying to restore your power

Any generator that's being used as a backup should be connected with a disconnect that shuts off power from the grid when power is being supplied by the generator, and vice versa. Otherwise, you have a situation where your generator could shock the person who goes to repair the cause of the outage.

			An electrical cord with two male ends. Typically it's used when someone strings up a strand of christmas lights backwards and has two female ends pointing at each other. Instead of taking the lights down and redoing it (what a sane person would do) they make one of these to connect them together.
			
			It's dangerous because the pins sticking out of the male end on the other side are still live, and can electrocute someone if they touch them, and can potentially start an electrical fire too.
			
			They're also sometimes used to backfeed power into a home electrical circuit from a generator during a power outage. Which is even more dangerous because that power will go all the way out to the mains and can potentially kill the person trying to fix the power lines. There is a correct way to connect a generator to your home, but using a suicide cord is not the right way to do it.
			
			You also can't buy them, the only way to get one is to make one yourself.

			> The "fuck everyone else and just somehow shotgun happiness/satisfaction into your brain" does not work for most people.
			
			That's because this isn't the right approach :)
			
			The goal isn't to ignore all feedback or standards, or to say "fuck everyone else". The goal is to understand why those standards exist, whether they are something useful or helpful to you, and evaluate whether or not they're something you want to follow. 
			
			For example, I don't work out to make myself look more fit. That's a motivation that's heavily dependent on how other people view me, and (for the most part) I can't control my weight in a healthy and sustainable way. My weight will fluctuate over time and that's fine. 
			
			Instead, I work out to make myself feel better, for the anxiety reduction benefits, etc. That makes me feel a lot better and is more sustainable, and it can have the accidental side effect of making me lose weight.

		Realistically, this is the best one. So many people point out “hey, there were times in the past where the human race thought it was up against the hard limits of nature, but then a technology came along that made things better.”  And they’re right, that’s true. But there also can be black swan events — unprecedented failures or catastrophes, probably arising from the fact that eventually our resource depletion outstrips our efficiency gains. Even the current level of depletion could prove catastrophic long run — we produce more carbon dioxide in 8 months than earth can turn to oxygen in 12 months. 
		
		The only people who sometimes point this out are liberals, but any realistic solutions are shouted down as classist or partial. They usually are — hyperconsumption should be targeted more so than overpopulation — but addressing only the first one will never solve the issue.

		The problem is that in order to count a vote, you have to identify it. In 1876 Congress received rival sets of votes from some states, leading to a highly unsatisfactory resolution by an appointed commission. Subsequently there have been laws about how a vote can be challenged. 
		
		The Constitution describes a number of things which logically require more detailed rules for the exact process. 
		
		Of course, refusing to accept a vote on the basis of party advantage would be improper, but it happened in 1876.

	Discrimination against homeless people. Realistically, the majority of people here are only a hospital bill or two away from homelessness themselves. The idea that every homeless person is a drug addict who could never contribute anything to society is not only wrong but harmful, since it makes it that much harder for them to get help.

	I remember being told once not to give homeless people money because they'd just buy drugs and alcohol. I now realize how stupid that notion is. Yes, there are some people out there who are going to do just that. But I'd rather give someone money and risk having them spend it irresponsibly than turn down a starving person because I'm prejudiced against them.

	Also, hostile architecture. Why is it a thing? These people are already struggling, and the majority of hostile architecture is inconvenient for everyone regardless of wealth. A person being "undesirable" is not an excuse to treat them as less than human, and yet a shocking number of people seem to think that anyone who doesn't have a guaranteed place to sleep each night is somehow worse than them.
