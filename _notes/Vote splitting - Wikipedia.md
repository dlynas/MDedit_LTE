**Vote splitting** is an [electoral](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election "Election") effect in which the distribution of votes among multiple similar candidates reduces the chance of winning for any of the similar candidates, and increases the chance of winning for a dissimilar candidate. This is commonly known as the [spoiler effect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoiler_effect "Spoiler effect"), which can discourage [minor party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_party "Minor party") candidacies.

Vote splitting most easily occurs in [plurality voting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_voting "Plurality voting") (also called [first-past-the-post](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_election_system "First-past-the-post election system")) in which each voter indicates a single choice and the candidate with the most votes wins, even if the winner does not have majority support.<sup id="cite_ref-Sen-2017_1-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-Sen-2017-1">[1]</a></sup> For example, if candidate A1 receives 30% of the votes, similar candidate A2 receives another 30% of the votes, and dissimilar candidate B receives the remaining 40% of the votes, plurality voting declares candidate B as the winner, even though 60% of the voters prefer either candidate A1 or A2.

## Occurrence [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vote_splitting&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Occurrence")

One of the main functions of political parties is to mitigate the effect of spoiler-prone voting methods by winnowing on a local level the contenders before the election. Each party nominates at most one candidate per office since each party expects to lose if they nominate more than one.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-2">[n 1]</a></sup> This means empirical observations of the frequency of spoiled elections may not be a good measure, because they exclude relevant information from candidates who chose not to run.

Vote splitting occurs when candidates or ballot questions<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-3">[n 2]</a></sup> have similar ideologies. A spoiler candidate can draw votes from a major candidate with similar politics, thereby causing a strong opponent of both or several to win.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-4">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-5">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Borgers2_6-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-Borgers2-6">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-7">[5]</a></sup> The minor candidates causing this effect are referred to as [spoilers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoiler_effect "Spoiler effect").<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-8">[n 3]</a></sup>

The problem also exists in [two-round system](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system "Two-round system")<sup id="cite_ref-:3_9-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-:3-9">[6]</a></sup> and [instant-runoff voting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting#Spoiler_Effect "Instant-runoff voting"),<sup id="cite_ref-Borgers2_6-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-Borgers2-6">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:5_10-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-:5-10">[7]</a></sup> though it is reduced, because weaker spoilers are eliminated.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (March 2024)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> However, a candidate that can win head-to-head against all rivals (called a [Condorcet winner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_winner "Condorcet winner")) can still lose from third place in a 3-way vote split, a phenomenon known as a [center squeeze](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_squeeze "Center squeeze"). This occurred in the [2009 Burlington Vermont mayoral election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Burlington_mayoral_election "2009 Burlington mayoral election") and the [2022 Alaska's at-large congressional district special election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Alaska%27s_at-large_congressional_district_special_election "2022 Alaska's at-large congressional district special election").

All [ranked-choice systems](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting_systems "Ranked voting systems") suffer from variations of the spoiler effect, as proven by [Arrow's impossibility theorem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem "Arrow's impossibility theorem").

### Australia [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vote_splitting&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Australia")

In Australia, seats where vote splitting occurs are called "three-corned contests". While the vote is split in a three-cornered contest, it is not always a disadvantage as Australia uses [preferential voting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferential_voting "Preferential voting"). However, depending on the level of government it can still act as a disadvantage due to the different forms of preferential voting used in Australia; [full preferential voting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_preferential_voting "Full preferential voting") (FPV) is used on a federal level and in some states and territories while [optional preferential voting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optional_preferential_voting "Optional preferential voting") (OPV) is used in [New South Wales](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales "New South Wales"). Due to this, three-cornered contests are rare in New South Wales (on both a state and federal level) as well as in the federal [Senate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Senate "Australian Senate").

Three-cornered contests generally occur with the centre-right [Liberal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Australia "Liberal Party of Australia")\-[National](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Party_of_Australia "National Party of Australia") [Coalition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_(Australia) "Coalition (Australia)"). However, the frequency of these contests varies in different states and it does not occur in the [Queensland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland "Queensland"), [Tasmania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania "Tasmania") or the two territories, due to the fact that the Nationals do not exist in the [Australian Capital Territory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Capital_Territory "Australian Capital Territory") (ACT) and they do not currently contest elections in Tasmania, while in Queensland and the [Northern Territory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory "Northern Territory") the two Coalition parties merged to become the [Liberal National Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_National_Party_of_Queensland "Liberal National Party of Queensland") (LNP) and the [CLP](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Liberal_Party "Country Liberal Party"), respectively. While they are rare in New South Wales, three-cornered contests do often occur in [Victoria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_(state) "Victoria (state)"), [Western Australia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia "Western Australia") and [South Australia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia "South Australia").

#### Federal politics [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vote_splitting&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Federal politics")

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Coalition_candidates_2022.png/250px-Coalition_candidates_2022.png)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Coalition_candidates_2022.png)

[Coalition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_(Australia) "Coalition (Australia)") candidates by party (i.e. [Liberal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Australia "Liberal Party of Australia"), [National](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Party_of_Australia "National Party of Australia"), [LNP](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_National_Party_of_Queensland "Liberal National Party of Queensland"), [CLP](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Liberal_Party "Country Liberal Party") or Liberal and National) in each federal division at the [2022 Australian federal election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Australian_federal_election "2022 Australian federal election").

Federally, three-cornered contests are uncommon in most seats. However, they do occur in certain regional seats. At the [2022 federal election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Australian_federal_election "2022 Australian federal election"), both Coalition parties ran candidates in four seats; two in Victoria ([Division of Indi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_Indi "Division of Indi"), [Nicholls](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_Nicholls "Division of Nicholls")), one in Western Australia ([Durack](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_Durack "Division of Durack")) and one in South Australia ([Barker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_Barker "Division of Barker")). The number of federal seats with three-cornered contests has dropped over the years. In fact, there was a significantly low number of three-cornered contests in 2022, even when compared to [the previous federal election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Australian_federal_election "2019 Australian federal election"), which was held in 2019. In that election, both Coalition parties ran candidates in ten seats; two in New South Wales ([Eden-Monaro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_Eden-Monaro "Division of Eden-Monaro") and [Gilmore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_Gilmore "Division of Gilmore")), two in Victoria (Indi and [Mallee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_Mallee "Division of Mallee")), two in Western Australia (Durack and [O'Connor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_O%27Connor "Division of O'Connor")), one in South Australia (Barker) and three in Tasmania ([Bass](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_Bass "Division of Bass"), [Braddon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_Braddon "Division of Braddon") and [Lyons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_Lyons "Division of Lyons")).

#### State politics [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vote_splitting&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: State politics")

In New South Wales (the only state where the Coalition has never been broken), three-cornered contests are rare as most Coalition voters exhaust their preferences (meaning they only number one candidate, thus being a disadvantage except in conservative strongholds on the [Mid North Coast](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid_North_Coast_(New_South_Wales) "Mid North Coast (New South Wales)") and in central and western parts of the state). However, at the [2023 state election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_New_South_Wales_state_election "2023 New South Wales state election"), this phenomenon did occur in two regional seats: [Port Macquarie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Port_Macquarie "Electoral district of Port Macquarie") (a conservative seat held by National-turned-Liberal MP [Leslie Williams](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Williams_(politician) "Leslie Williams (politician)")) and [Wagga Wagga](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Wagga_Wagga "Electoral district of Wagga Wagga") (a traditionally conservative seat, despite being held by [independent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician "Independent politician") MP [Joe McGirr](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_McGirr "Joe McGirr")). In Port Macquarie, Williams was the Liberal candidate and Peta Pinson, the Mayor of the [Port Macquarie-Hastings Council](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Macquarie-Hastings_Council "Port Macquarie-Hastings Council"), was the Nationals candidate. Williams won the seat, which despite having a three-cornered contest remained a safe seat on both [two-candidate-preferred](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-candidate-preferred "Two-candidate-preferred") (TCP) and [two-party-preferred](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-party-preferred "Two-party-preferred") (TPP) margin. In Wagga Wagga, the Nationals candidate was Adrianna Benjamin and the Liberal candidate was Julia Ham. McGirr retained the seat with an increased TCP margin against Benjamin, although the Nationals still won the TPP count. It is unlikely that a three-cornered contest will occur in either of these seats at the [next state election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2027_New_South_Wales_state_election "2027 New South Wales state election"), which will be held in 2027.

In Victoria, three-cornered contests occur in some seats, despite the Coalition existing in Victoria (although it has previously been broken). At the [2022 state election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Victorian_state_election "2022 Victorian state election"), both Coalition parties ran candidates in five seats ([Bass](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Bass "Electoral district of Bass"), [Euroa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Euroa "Electoral district of Euroa"), [Mildura](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Mildura "Electoral district of Mildura"), [Morwell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Morwell "Electoral district of Morwell") and [Shepparton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Shepparton "Electoral district of Shepparton")). The Nationals intended to run a candidate in the [Narracan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Narracan "Electoral district of Narracan"), but the candidate they preselected died before the election, forcing [a supplementary by-election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Narracan_state_by-election "2023 Narracan state by-election") in that seat, in which the Liberal candidate was re-elected and the Nationals did not run a candidate.

In Western Australia, three-cornered contests do commonly occur. This is due to the fact that the Coalition agreement is different in that both parties are independent of each other and each party can vote differently if they believe that their decision it is in the best interests of the people and areas they represent. The Nationals can also opt-out of Cabinet and when a Coalition government is elected, the leader of the Liberal Party becomes the state [Premier](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_Western_Australia "Premier of Western Australia"), but the leader of the Nationals does not always become the [Deputy Premier](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Premier_of_Western_Australia "Deputy Premier of Western Australia"), unlike in New South Wales and Victoria where in the event of a Coalition government, the Liberal leader becomes the Premier and the Nationals leader becomes the Deputy Premier. For example, following the [2008 state election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Western_Australian_state_election "2008 Western Australian state election"), which saw a Coalition government elected, the Liberal leader ([Colin Barnett](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Barnett "Colin Barnett")) became the Premier, but the Nationals leader ([Brendon Grylls](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendon_Grylls "Brendon Grylls")) did not become the Deputy Premier, an office that the deputy Liberal leader ([Kim Hames](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Hames "Kim Hames")) was given instead.

In South Australia, three-cornered-contests do occur in some seats, due to the absence of the Coalition. In most states, the Liberal Party holds seats in cities while the Nationals hold seats in regional, rural and remote areas, but in South Australia and Tasmania, the Nationals have limited activity and thus the Liberals hold both metropolitan and non-metropolitan seats in these states. At the [2022 state election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_South_Australian_state_election "2022 South Australian state election"), both the Liberals and the Nationals ran candidates in eight seats ([Chaffey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Chaffey "Electoral district of Chaffey"), [Finniss](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Finniss "Electoral district of Finniss"), [Flinders](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Flinders "Electoral district of Flinders"), [Frome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Frome "Electoral district of Frome"), [Hammond](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Hammond "Electoral district of Hammond"), [MacKillop](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district_of_MacKillop "Electoral district of MacKillop"), [Narungga](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Narungga "Electoral district of Narungga") and [Schubert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Schubert "Electoral district of Schubert")). Due to the limited activity of the party, the Nationals finished last or close-to-last in all of these seats, even being outvoted by some minor parties and winning a statewide vote of just 0.48%, the lowest in the country on a state level (excluding states the party does not contest elections in).

In Australia, the [1918 Swan by-election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1918_Swan_by-election "1918 Swan by-election") saw the conservative vote split between the [Country Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Party_of_Australia "National Party of Australia") and [Nationalist Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalist_Party_(Australia) "Nationalist Party (Australia)"), which allowed the [Australian Labor Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party "Australian Labor Party") to win the seat. That led the Nationalist government to implement preferential voting in federal elections to allow Country and Nationalist voters to transfer preferences to the other party and to avoid vote splitting.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-11">[8]</a></sup> Today, the [Liberal Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Australia "Liberal Party of Australia") and National Party rarely run candidates in the same seats, which are known as three-cornered contests. When three-cornered contests do occur the Labor Party would usually direct preferences to the Liberals ahead of the Nationals as they considered the Liberal Party to be less conservative than the Nationals. The 1996 Southern Highlands state by-election in New South Wales is an example of this when the Nationals candidate Katrina Hodgkinson won the primary vote but was defeated after preferences to Liberal candidate Peta Seaton when Seaton received Labor Party preferences.<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-12">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-13">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-14">[11]</a></sup>

In [2001](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Bulgarian_parliamentary_election "2001 Bulgarian parliamentary election"), the former tsar of Bulgaria [Simeon II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simeon_Saxe-Coburg-Gotha "Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha") founded the [NDSV](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Movement_for_Stability_and_Progress "National Movement for Stability and Progress"). The NDSV won exactly 50% of the seats (120 out of 240 seats) thus barely missing an outright majority. Similarly named parties "Simeon II" Coalition, "National Union for Tsar Simeon II", "National Union Tsar Kiro" Coalition and "National Movement for New Era" (NDNE) got 3.44%, 1.70%, 0.60% and 0.05% respectively.<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-15">[12]</a></sup>

### Canada [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vote_splitting&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Canada")

When the cities of [Fort William](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_William,_Ontario "Fort William, Ontario") and [Port Arthur](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Arthur,_Ontario "Port Arthur, Ontario") merged and (in 1969) voted on a name for the new town, the vote was split between the popular choices of "Lakehead" and "The Lakehead", allowing the third option to win, creating the town of [Thunder Bay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder_Bay "Thunder Bay"), [Ontario](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario "Ontario").<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-19">[15]</a></sup>

From 1993 to 2004, the conservative vote in [Canada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada "Canada") was split between the [Progressive Conservatives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_Canada "Progressive Conservative Party of Canada") and the [Reform](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_Party_of_Canada "Reform Party of Canada") (later the [Alliance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Alliance "Canadian Alliance")) Party. That allowed the [Liberal Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada "Liberal Party of Canada") to win almost all seats in [Ontario](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario "Ontario") and to win three successive majority governments.

The [2015 provincial election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Alberta_general_election "2015 Alberta general election") in [Alberta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta "Alberta") saw the left-wing [New Democratic Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta_New_Democratic_Party "Alberta New Democratic Party") win 62% of the seats with 40.6% of the province's popular vote after a division within the right-wing [Progressive Conservative Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Conservative_Association_of_Alberta "Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta"), which left it with only 27.8% of the vote, and its breakaway movement, the [Wildrose Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildrose_Party "Wildrose Party"), with 24.2% of the vote. In 2008, the last election in which the Progressive Conservative Party had been unified, it won 52.72% of the popular vote. The Progressive Conservatives had won every provincial election since the 1971 election, making them the longest-serving provincial government in Canadian history—being in office for 44 years. This was only the fourth change of government in Alberta since Alberta became a province in 1905, and one of the worst defeats a provincial government has suffered in Canada. It also marked the first time in almost 80 years that a left-of-centre political party had formed government in Alberta since the defeat of the United Farmers of Alberta in 1935 and the Depression-era radical monetary reform policies of William Aberhart's Social Credit government. During the [2021 Canadian federal election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Canadian_federal_election "2021 Canadian federal election"), it is speculated that the [People's Party of Canada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Party_of_Canada "People's Party of Canada") might have coast the CPC up to 24 seats.<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-20">[16]</a></sup>

In Canada, vote splits between the two major left-of-centre parties ([Liberals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada "Liberal Party of Canada") and [NDP](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democratic_Party "New Democratic Party")) assisted the [Conservative Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_of_Canada "Conservative Party of Canada") in winning the [2006](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Canadian_federal_election "2006 Canadian federal election"), [2008](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Canadian_federal_election "2008 Canadian federal election"), and [2011](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Canadian_federal_election "2011 Canadian federal election") federal elections, despite most of the popular vote going to left-wing parties in each race. During the [2022 Ontario General Election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Ontario_general_election "2022 Ontario general election"), [Progressive Conservative](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_Ontario "Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario") [Doug Ford](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Ford "Doug Ford") won a second term as Premier of the [Province of Ontario](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario "Ontario"). The Progressive Conservatives won several ridings due to vote splitting.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-21">[17]</a></sup> [ONDP](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_New_Democratic_Party "Ontario New Democratic Party") and [Liberal Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_Liberal_Party "Ontario Liberal Party") voters combined for 47.8% of votes, whereas Ford emerged victorious with only 40.82% of total votes.<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-22">[18]</a></sup>

Similarly, in [Quebec](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec "Quebec"), it is argued that the success of the [Bloc Québécois](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloc_Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois "Bloc Québécois") in elections from 1993 to 2008 was because of the federalist vote being split between the Liberals and the Conservatives.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (June 2023)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

### Czech Republic [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vote_splitting&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Czech Republic")

In [2021](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Czech_legislative_election "2021 Czech legislative election"), [Přísaha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C5%99%C3%ADsaha "Přísaha") (4.68%), [ČSSD](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Social_Democratic_Party "Czech Social Democratic Party") (4.65%) and [KSČM](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Bohemia_and_Moravia "Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia") (3.60%) all failed to cross the 5 percent threshold, thus allowing a coalition of [Spolu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spolu_(Czech_Republic) "Spolu (Czech Republic)") and [PaS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirates_and_Mayors "Pirates and Mayors"). This was also the first time that neither ČSSD nor KSČM had representation in parliament since [1992](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Czech_legislative_election "1992 Czech legislative election").

### Egypt [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vote_splitting&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Egypt")

In the [2012 Egyptian presidential election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Egyptian_presidential_election "2012 Egyptian presidential election"), the two candidates who qualified for the runoff election, Freedom and Justice Party candidate Mohamed Morsi (24.8%) and the independent candidate Ahmed Shafik (23.7%), each received more votes than any other candidate, but they failed to get enough votes to prove that each winning candidate was actually more popular than the Dignity Party candidate Hamdeen Sabahi (20.7%), the independent candidate Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh (17.5%), or the independent candidate Amr Moussa (11.1%).<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (June 2023)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

### France [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vote_splitting&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: France")

In France, the [2002 presidential elections](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_French_presidential_election "2002 French presidential election") have been cited as a case of the spoiler effect: the numerous left-wing candidates, such as [Christiane Taubira](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiane_Taubira "Christiane Taubira") and [Jean-Pierre Chevènement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Pierre_Chev%C3%A8nement "Jean-Pierre Chevènement"), both from political parties allied to the [French Socialist Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Socialist_Party_(1902) "French Socialist Party (1902)"), or the three candidates from [Trotskyist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trotskyism "Trotskyism") parties, which altogether totalled around 20%, have been charged with making [Lionel Jospin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Jospin "Lionel Jospin"), the Socialist Party candidate, lose the two-round election in the first round to the benefit of [Jean-Marie Le Pen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Marie_Le_Pen "Jean-Marie Le Pen"), who was separated from Jospin by only 0.68%. Some also cite the case of some districts in which the moderate right and the far right had more than half of the votes together, but the left still won the election; they accuse the left of profiting from the split. Also in the presidential elections [1969](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_French_presidential_election "1969 French presidential election") (with five left-wing candidates which combined had 32%), in [2017](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_French_presidential_election "2017 French presidential election") (split between four candidates which had 27% combined) and in [2022](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_French_presidential_election "2022 French presidential election") (six left-wing candidates with 32% combined), the left failed to reach the run-off which may be traced back the amount of left-of-centre candidates. Similarly in the [1993 parliamentary election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_French_legislative_election "1993 French legislative election"), where the green parties ran against the parties of the presidential majority. This led to many right-wing run-offs and the most right-wing dominated parliament since [1968](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_French_legislative_election "1968 French legislative election").

### Germany [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vote_splitting&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Germany")

In the [German presidential election of 1925](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1925_German_presidential_election "1925 German presidential election"), [Communist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Germany "Communist Party of Germany") [Ernst Thälmann](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Th%C3%A4lmann "Ernst Thälmann") refused to withdraw his candidacy although it was extremely unlikely that he would have won, and the leadership of the [Communist International](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_International "Communist International") urged him not to run. In the second (and final) round of balloting, Thälmann shared 1,931,151 votes (6.4%). [Centre Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Party_(Germany) "Centre Party (Germany)") candidate [Wilhelm Marx](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Marx "Wilhelm Marx"), backed by pro-republican parties, won 13,751,605 (45.3%). The right-wing candidate [Paul von Hindenburg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_von_Hindenburg "Paul von Hindenburg") won 14,655,641 votes (48.3%).<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-30">[26]</a></sup> If most of Thälmann's supporters had voted for Marx, Marx likely would have won the election. That election had great significance because after 1930, Hindenburg increasingly favoured authoritarian means of government, and in 1933, he appointed [Adolf Hitler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler "Adolf Hitler") as [chancellor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_Germany "Chancellor of Germany"). Hindenburg's death the following year gave Hitler unchecked control of the German government.<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-31">[27]</a></sup>

In the [1990 German federal election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990_German_federal_election "1990 German federal election"), the Western Greens did not meet the threshold, which was applied separately for former East and West Germany. The Greens could not take advantage of this, because the "[Alliance 90](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_90 "Alliance 90")" (which had absorbed the East German Greens) ran separately from "The Greens" in the West. Together, they would have narrowly passed the 5.0 percent threshold (West: 4.8%, East: 6.2%). The Western Greens returned to the Bundestag in 1994.

The post-communist [PDS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_of_Democratic_Socialism_(Germany) "Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)") and its successor [Die Linke](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Linke "Die Linke") often hovered around the 5 percent threshold: [In 1994](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_German_federal_election "1994 German federal election"), it won only 4.4 percent of the party list vote, but won four districts in [East Berlin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Berlin "East Berlin"), which saved it, earning 30 MPs in total. In [2002](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_German_federal_election "2002 German federal election"), it achieved only 4.0 percent of the party list vote, and won just two districts, this time excluding the party from proportional representation. This resulted in a narrow red-green majority and a [second term for Gerhard Schröder](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6der_Cabinet_II "Schröder Cabinet II"), which would not have been possible had the PDS won a third constituency. In [2021](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_German_federal_election "2021 German federal election"), it won only 4.9 percent of the party list vote, but won the bare minimum of three districts ([Berlin-Lichtenberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin-Lichtenberg "Berlin-Lichtenberg"), [Berlin-Treptow-Köpenick](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin-Treptow-K%C3%B6penick "Berlin-Treptow-Köpenick"), and [Leipzig II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig_II "Leipzig II")), salvaging the party, which received 39 MPs.

In the [2013 German federal election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_German_federal_election "2013 German federal election"), the [FDP](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Democratic_Party_(Germany) "Free Democratic Party (Germany)"), in Parliament since 1949, received only 4.8 percent of the list vote, and won no single district, excluding the party altogether. This, along with the failure of the right-wing eurosceptic party [AfD](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_for_Germany "Alternative for Germany") (4.7%), gave a left-wing majority in Parliament despite a center-right majority of votes ([CDU/CSU](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDU/CSU "CDU/CSU") itself fell short of an absolute majority by just 5 seats). As a result, Merkel's CDU/CSU formed a [grand coalition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_coalition "Grand coalition") with the [SPD](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany "Social Democratic Party of Germany").

[Klimaliste](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klimaliste "Klimaliste") has been accused of splitting the vote which would have gone to [Alliance 90/The Greens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_90/The_Greens "Alliance 90/The Greens").<sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-32">[28]</a></sup> For example, in the [2021 Baden-Württemberg state election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg_state_election "2021 Baden-Württemberg state election") a [Red-Green coalition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-Green_coalition "Red-Green coalition") was just a single seat short of a majority while Klimaliste missed the threshold with receiving 0.9% of the vote.<sup id="cite_ref-33"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-33">[29]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-34">[30]</a></sup>

In [Greece](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece "Greece"), [Antonis Samaras](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonis_Samaras "Antonis Samaras") was the [Minister for Foreign Affairs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_(Greece) "Minister for Foreign Affairs (Greece)") for the [liberal conservative](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_conservatism "Liberal conservatism") government of [New Democracy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democracy_(Greece) "New Democracy (Greece)") under [Prime Minister](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Greece "Prime Minister of Greece") [Konstantinos Mitsotakis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantinos_Mitsotakis "Konstantinos Mitsotakis") but ended up leaving and founding the [national conservative](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_conservatism "National conservatism") [Political Spring](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_Spring "Political Spring") in response to the [Macedonia naming dispute](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia_naming_dispute "Macedonia naming dispute"), resulting in the [1993 Greek legislative election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Greek_legislative_election "1993 Greek legislative election") where [PASOK](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PASOK "PASOK") won with its leader [Andreas Papandreou](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Papandreou "Andreas Papandreou") making a successful political comeback, which was considered to be responsible for the [Greek government debt crisis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_government_debt_crisis "Greek government debt crisis").<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-35">[31]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-36">[32]</a></sup>

### Guatemala [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vote_splitting&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Guatemala")

In [2019](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Guatemalan_general_election "2019 Guatemalan general election") the different parties to the left of [National Unity of Hope](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Unity_of_Hope "National Unity of Hope") ([Semilla](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semilla_(political_party) "Semilla (political party)"), [Winaq](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winaq "Winaq"), [MLP](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_for_the_Liberation_of_Peoples "Movement for the Liberation of Peoples"), [URNG](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemalan_National_Revolutionary_Unity "Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity"), [EG](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encuentro_por_Guatemala "Encuentro por Guatemala"), [CPO-CRD](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_(Guatemala) "Convergence (Guatemala)") and [Libre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libre_(Guatemala) "Libre (Guatemala)")) ran with their own lists and presidential candidates. Their highest candidates [Thelma Cabrera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelma_Cabrera "Thelma Cabrera") and [Manuel Villacorta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Villacorta "Manuel Villacorta") archived 10.3% and 5.2% respectively, combined stronger than the main conservative candidate [Alejandro Giammattei](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandro_Giammattei "Alejandro Giammattei") 13.9% (who was elected in the run-off). If they ran together there wont have been any conservative candidate in the run-off.<sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-37">[33]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-38">[34]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-39"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-39">[35]</a></sup> A similar scenario happened in the [2023 election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Guatemalan_general_election "2023 Guatemalan general election"), in which four right-of-centre candidates ([Manuel Conde](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Conde "Manuel Conde"), [Armando Castillo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armando_Castillo_(politician) "Armando Castillo (politician)"), [Edmond Mulet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond_Mulet "Edmond Mulet") and [Zury Ríos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zury_R%C3%ADos "Zury Ríos")) gained just below 11% each, all behind Semilla's candidate [Bernardo Arévalo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernardo_Ar%C3%A9valo "Bernardo Arévalo") with around 16%.

### Hong Kong [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vote_splitting&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Hong Kong")

In [Hong Kong](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong "Hong Kong"), vote splitting is very common for the [pro-democracy camp](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-democracy_camp_(Hong_Kong) "Pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)"), which caused it to suffer greatly in many elections, including the [2016 Hong Kong legislative election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Hong_Kong_legislative_election "2016 Hong Kong legislative election") and the [2015 Hong Kong local elections](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Hong_Kong_local_elections "2015 Hong Kong local elections"). Pro-democracy supporters typically have different ideologies and suffer from factional disputes that are exacerbated after the advent of [localist camp](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localist_camp "Localist camp"). However, many have wider aggregate support fewer seats are earned than the [pro-Beijing camp](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-Beijing_camp_(Hong_Kong) "Pro-Beijing camp (Hong Kong)"), an example being in Kowloon East in which pro-democracy parties got over 55% of cast ballots but won only 2 seats out of 5.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

### Israel [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vote_splitting&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Israel")

In [April 2019](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_2019_Israeli_legislative_election "April 2019 Israeli legislative election"), among the 3 lists representing right-wing to far-right Zionism and supportive of Netanyahu, only one crossed the threshold the right-wing government had increased to 3.25 percent: the [Union of the Right-Wing Parties](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_the_Right-Wing_Parties "Union of the Right-Wing Parties") with 3.70 percent, while future Prime Minister Bennett's [New Right](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Right_(Israel) "New Right (Israel)") narrowly failed at 3.22 percent, and [Zehut](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zehut "Zehut") only 2.74 percent, destroying Netanyahu's chances of another majority, and leading to snap elections in [September](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2019_Israeli_legislative_election "September 2019 Israeli legislative election").

### Italy [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vote_splitting&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Italy")

Sicily is traditionally dominated by the [centre-right](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre-right_coalition_(Italy) "Centre-right coalition (Italy)") but in the [2012 Sicilian regional election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Sicilian_regional_election "2012 Sicilian regional election") the centre-right was split between [Nello Musumeci](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nello_Musumeci "Nello Musumeci"), [Gianfranco Micciché](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianfranco_Miccich%C3%A9 "Gianfranco Micciché"), Mariano Ferro and [Cateno De Luca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cateno_De_Luca "Cateno De Luca") allowing the [centre-left](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre-left_coalition_(Italy) "Centre-left coalition (Italy)") [Rosario Crocetta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosario_Crocetta "Rosario Crocetta") to win the election with just 30.5%.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

The Italian Left often struggled to meet thresholds after the formation of the [Democratic Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(Italy) "Democratic Party (Italy)"), in [2008](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Italian_general_election "2008 Italian general election") most left-wing parties ran on the [Rainbow Left](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Left_%E2%80%93_The_Rainbow "The Left – The Rainbow") list which got 3.08% but other left-wing parties, the [Workers' Communist Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers%27_Communist_Party_(Italy) "Workers' Communist Party (Italy)") (PCL) with 0.57%, the [Critical Left](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Left "Critical Left") with 0.46% and the [Communist Alternative Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Alternative_Party "Communist Alternative Party") (PdAC) with 0.01%, still split enough votes for them to fell below the 4% threshold.<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-40">[36]</a></sup> In [2009](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_European_Parliament_election_in_Italy "2009 European Parliament election in Italy") three different left-wing lists competed against each other.

### New Zealand [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vote_splitting&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: New Zealand")

In New Zealand, there have been two notable cases of the spoiler effect. In the [1984 general election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_New_Zealand_general_election "1984 New Zealand general election"), the free-market [New Zealand Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Party "New Zealand Party") deliberately ran for office to weaken support former Prime Minister [Robert Muldoon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Muldoon "Robert Muldoon"), the incumbent. The [1993 general election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_New_Zealand_general_election "1993 New Zealand general election") saw the [New Zealand Labour Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Labour_Party "New Zealand Labour Party")'s vote split by [The Alliance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_(New_Zealand_political_party) "Alliance (New Zealand political party)"), which has been attributed to the vagaries of the [plurality vote](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_vote "Plurality vote"). In response to these problems, New Zealand has since adopted [mixed-member proportional representation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-member_proportional_representation "Mixed-member proportional representation").<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

While [New Zealand First](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_First "New Zealand First") received only 4.07 percent in the [2008 New Zealand general election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_New_Zealand_general_election "2008 New Zealand general election") of the list vote (so it was not returned to parliament), [ACT New Zealand](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT_New_Zealand "ACT New Zealand") won 3.65 percent of the list vote, but its leader won an electorate seat ([Epsom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_(NZ_electorate) "Epsom (NZ electorate)")), which entitled the party to list seats (4). In the [2011 election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_New_Zealand_general_election "2011 New Zealand general election"), leaders of the [National Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_National_Party "New Zealand National Party") and ACT had tea together before the press to promote the implicit alliance (see [tea tape scandal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_tape_scandal "Tea tape scandal")). After their victories, the Nationals passed a [confidence and supply](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_and_supply "Confidence and supply") agreement with ACT to form the [Fifth National Government of New Zealand](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_National_Government_of_New_Zealand "Fifth National Government of New Zealand").

### Nicaragua [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vote_splitting&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Nicaragua")

Before the [2006 Nicaraguan presidential election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Nicaraguan_general_election "2006 Nicaraguan general election"), the [Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaraguan_Liberal_Alliance "Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance") broke away from the [Constitutionalist Liberal Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionalist_Liberal_Party "Constitutionalist Liberal Party"). This allowed [Daniel Ortega](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ortega "Daniel Ortega") to win the election with 38%, his two liberal opponents got 51% combined.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (June 2023)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

### Norway [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vote_splitting&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Norway")

In [2009](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Norwegian_parliamentary_election "2009 Norwegian parliamentary election"), the [Liberal Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_(Norway) "Liberal Party (Norway)") received 3.9 percent of the votes, below the 4 percent threshold for [leveling seats](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leveling_seats "Leveling seats"), although still winning two seats. Hence, while right-wing opposition parties won more votes between them than the parties in the governing coalition, the narrow failure of the Liberal Party to cross the threshold kept the governing coalition in power. It crossed the threshold again at the [following election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Norwegian_parliamentary_election "2013 Norwegian parliamentary election") with 5.2 percent.

### Paraguay [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vote_splitting&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Paraguay")

In the [2008 Paraguayan presidential election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Paraguayan_general_election "2008 Paraguayan general election"), the candidate of the [opposition alliance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriotic_Alliance_for_Change "Patriotic Alliance for Change") [Fernando Lugo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Lugo "Fernando Lugo") won the election with just 42% because [Lino Oviedo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lino_Oviedo "Lino Oviedo") ran on his own. The two right-wing candidates had 54% together but due to the split of the [Colorado Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Party_(Paraguay) "Colorado Party (Paraguay)") went into opposition for the first time since 1947.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (June 2023)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

### Poland [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vote_splitting&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Poland")

In [2015](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Polish_parliamentary_election "2015 Polish parliamentary election"), the [United Left](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Left_(Poland) "United Left (Poland)") achieved 7.55 percent, which is below the 8 percent threshold for multi-party coalitions. Furthermore, [KORWiN](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_(Poland) "Liberty (Poland)") only reached 4.76 percent, narrowly missing the 5 percent threshold for individual parties. This allowed the victorious [PiS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_and_Justice_(Poland) "Law and Justice (Poland)") to obtain a majority of seats with 37 percent of the vote. This was the first parliament without left-wing parties represented.

### Philippines [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vote_splitting&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Philippines")

In the [2004 Philippine presidential election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Philippine_presidential_election "2004 Philippine presidential election"), those who were opposed to [Gloria Macapagal Arroyo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Macapagal_Arroyo "Gloria Macapagal Arroyo")'s presidency had their vote split into the four candidates, thereby allowing Arroyo to win. The opposition had film actor [Fernando Poe, Jr.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Poe,_Jr. "Fernando Poe, Jr.") as its candidate, but [Panfilo Lacson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panfilo_Lacson "Panfilo Lacson") refused to give way and ran as a candidate of a breakaway faction of the [Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laban_ng_Demokratikong_Pilipino "Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino"). Arroyo was later accused of [vote-rigging](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_Garci_scandal "Hello Garci scandal").

### Romania [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vote_splitting&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Romania")

In 2000, the different candidates of the incumbent government got in the [Romanian presidential election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Romanian_general_election "2000 Romanian general election") 11.8% ([Stolojan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Stolojan "Theodor Stolojan")), 9.5% ([Isărescu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mugur_Is%C4%83rescu "Mugur Isărescu")), 6.2% ([Frunda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Frunda "György Frunda")) and 3.0% ([Roman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petre_Roman "Petre Roman")) respectively. Combined they had more than [Corneliu Vadim Tudor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneliu_Vadim_Tudor "Corneliu Vadim Tudor") of the [Greater Romania Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Romania_Party "Greater Romania Party"), who got 28.3% in the first round.

### Serbia [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vote_splitting&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Serbia")

In Serbia, there are often quite a few [nationalist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_nationalism "Serbian nationalism") and right-wing parties, which compete independently. Since the rise of [Aleksandar Vučić](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandar_Vu%C4%8Di%C4%87 "Aleksandar Vučić")'s [Serbian Progressive Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_Progressive_Party "Serbian Progressive Party"), which broke away from the [Serbian Radical Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_Radical_Party "Serbian Radical Party") in 2008, vote splitting became common among them. The most extreme cases of vote splitting were in [2014](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Serbian_parliamentary_election "2014 Serbian parliamentary election"), none of the nationalist lists ([DSS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_of_Serbia "Democratic Party of Serbia"), SRS, [Dveri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dveri "Dveri"), [Third Serbia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Serbia "Third Serbia"), "Patriotic Front" and the [Russian Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Party_(Serbia) "Russian Party (Serbia)"), a nominally Russian minority party) made it above 4.2% thus neither of them won seats despite having a total of 10.6%.<sup id="cite_ref-43"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-43">[39]</a></sup> and in [2020](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Serbian_parliamentary_election "2020 Serbian parliamentary election"), the [POKS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_for_the_Restoration_of_the_Kingdom_of_Serbia "Movement for the Restoration of the Kingdom of Serbia") (2.7%), [DJB](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enough_is_Enough_(party) "Enough is Enough (party)") (2.3%), the DSS (2.2%) and the SRS (2.1%) alongside smaller parties all ended up below the 3% threshold,<sup id="cite_ref-RS2020_44-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-RS2020-44">[40]</a></sup> which was introduced to make it easier for parties after the [main opposition alliance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Opposition_of_Serbia "United Opposition of Serbia") called for a boycott.<sup id="cite_ref-45"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-45">[41]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-46"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-46">[42]</a></sup> Only the [Serbian Patriotic Alliance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_Patriotic_Alliance "Serbian Patriotic Alliance") gained 3.8% in their first and only election.<sup id="cite_ref-RS2020_44-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-RS2020-44">[40]</a></sup>

This section **needs expansion** with: Hungarians. You can help by [adding to it](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vote_splitting&action=edit&section=). _(March 2024)_

[2002](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Slovak_parliamentary_election "2002 Slovak parliamentary election"). The [True Slovak National Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Slovak_National_Party "True Slovak National Party") (PSNS) split from [Slovak National Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovak_National_Party "Slovak National Party") (SNS), and [Movement for Democracy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_for_Democracy_(Slovakia) "Movement for Democracy (Slovakia)") (HZD) split from the previously dominant [People's Party – Movement for a Democratic Slovakia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Party_%E2%80%93_Movement_for_a_Democratic_Slovakia "People's Party – Movement for a Democratic Slovakia"). All of them failed to cross the 5 percent threshold with PSNS having 3.65 percent, SNS 3.33 percent and HZD 3.26 percent respectively, thus allowing a center-right coalition despite having less than 43 percent of the vote.

In [2016](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Slovak_parliamentary_election "2016 Slovak parliamentary election"), the [Christian Democratic Movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Democratic_Movement "Christian Democratic Movement") achieved 4.94 percent missing only 0.06 percent votes to reach the threshold after [#SIEŤ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NETWORK_(Slovak_party) "NETWORK (Slovak party)") split from KDH which meant the first absence of the party since the [Velvet Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvet_Revolution "Velvet Revolution") and the first democratic elections in [1990](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990_Slovak_parliamentary_election "1990 Slovak parliamentary election").

### Taiwan [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vote_splitting&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Taiwan")

In the [2000 presidential election in Taiwan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Republic_of_China_presidential_election "2000 Republic of China presidential election"), [James Soong](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Soong "James Soong") left [Kuomintang](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuomintang "Kuomintang") (KMT) party and ran as an independent against KMT's candidate [Lien Chan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lien_Chan "Lien Chan"). This caused vote-splitting among KMT voters and resulted in victory for [Democratic Progressive Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Progressive_Party "Democratic Progressive Party")'s candidate, [Chen Shui-bian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Shui-bian "Chen Shui-bian"). It is the first time in Taiwan history that the KMT did not win a presidential election, and it became the [opposition party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_party "Opposition party").

A similar scenario happened in [2024](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Taiwanese_presidential_election "2024 Taiwanese presidential election"), when after the opposition candidates [Hou Yu-ih](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hou_Yu-ih "Hou Yu-ih") (KMT) and [Ko Wen-je](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ko_Wen-je "Ko Wen-je") ([Taiwan People's Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_People%27s_Party "Taiwan People's Party")) failed to reached an agreement,<sup id="cite_ref-47"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-47">[43]</a></sup> [Lai Ching-te](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lai_Ching-te "Lai Ching-te") (DPP) won with just 40 % of the vote.<sup id="cite_ref-48"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-48">[44]</a></sup>

### Turkey [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vote_splitting&action=edit&section=29 "Edit section: Turkey")

[Regular military coups in the second half of the 20th century](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat "Turkish coup d'état") led to a situation, where two similar [centre-left kemalist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_of_Center_(Turkey) "Left of Center (Turkey)") parties, the [Republican People's Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_People%27s_Party "Republican People's Party") (CHP) and the [Democratic Left Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Left_Party_(Turkey) "Democratic Left Party (Turkey)") (DSP), and centre-right kemalist parties, the [True Path Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Path_Party "True Path Party") (DYP) and [Motherland Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherland_Party_(Turkey) "Motherland Party (Turkey)") (ANAP), competed against another. In the [2002 general election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Turkish_general_election "2002 Turkish general election"), the centre-left (CHP, DSP, [NTP](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Turkey_Party_(2002) "New Turkey Party (2002)")) got 21.76% and the centre-right (DYP, ANAP, [YP](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeland_Party_(Turkey) "Homeland Party (Turkey)"), [LDP](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democratic_Party_(Turkey) "Liberal Democratic Party (Turkey)")) got 15.89% but because of the split only the CHP and the new [Justice and Development Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_and_Development_Party_(Turkey) "Justice and Development Party (Turkey)") (AKP) made it above the 10% threshold with the AKP having 66% of the seats with just 34.28% of the vote. Attempts to merge ANAP and DYP before the [2007 election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Turkish_general_election "2007 Turkish general election") failed and the [Democrat Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democrat_Party_(Turkey,_current) "Democrat Party (Turkey, current)") (the successor of DYP) only won 5.4%.

### United Kingdom [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vote_splitting&action=edit&section=30 "Edit section: United Kingdom")

In the [1994 European Elections](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_European_Parliament_election_in_the_United_Kingdom "1994 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom"), [Richard Huggett](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Huggett "Richard Huggett") stood as a "Literal Democrat" candidate for the [Devon and East Plymouth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devon_and_East_Plymouth_(European_Parliament_constituency) "Devon and East Plymouth (European Parliament constituency)") seat, with the name playing on that of the much larger [Liberal Democrats](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats_(UK) "Liberal Democrats (UK)"). Huggett took over 10,000 votes, and the Liberal Democrats lost by 700 votes to the [Conservative Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK) "Conservative Party (UK)"). The [Registration of Political Parties Act 1998](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registration_of_Political_Parties_Act_1998 "Registration of Political Parties Act 1998"), brought in after the election, introduced a register of political parties and ended the practice of deliberately confusing party descriptions.<sup id="cite_ref-49"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-49">[45]</a></sup>

In the run up to [2019 UK General Election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_United_Kingdom_general_election "2019 United Kingdom general election"), the [Brexit Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit_Party "Brexit Party"), led by former [UKIP](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/UKIP "UKIP") leader [Nigel Farage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Farage "Nigel Farage"), initially put up candidates in 600 seats after a strong showing for the newly formed party in the [2019 European Elections](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_European_Parliament_election "2019 European Parliament election"), but days later, he reversed his position after [Conservative](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK) "Conservative Party (UK)") [British Prime Minister](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Prime_Minister "British Prime Minister") [Boris Johnson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson "Boris Johnson") stated that he would not consider an electoral pact with the Brexit Party. That was seen as benefiting the Conservative Party and disadvantaging the [Labour Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK) "Labour Party (UK)").<sup id="cite_ref-50"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-50">[46]</a></sup> Farage later encouraged voters not to vote for the Labour Party in areas that traditionally favoured it but voted to leave in the [2016 EU Membership Referendum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum "2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum") but instead to vote tactically.<sup id="cite_ref-51"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-51">[47]</a></sup> After the Conservatives' decisive victory, it was suggested by some media outlets and political analysts that Farage had acted as "kingmaker" and [stalking horse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking_horse "Stalking horse") and effectively won the election for the Tories, as Farage's decision avoided splitting the vote.<sup id="cite_ref-52"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-52">[48]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-53"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-53">[49]</a></sup>

### United States [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vote_splitting&action=edit&section=31 "Edit section: United States")

Since 1990, the Republican Party's presidential ticket, according to the research cited below, has benefited most from the spoiler effect of the [plurality voting system](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_voting_system "Plurality voting system") that chooses electors for the electoral college. The year 2000 was an especially clear case when Al Gore would likely have won without vote splitting by one or more of the third-party tickets on the ballot.<sup id="cite_ref-54"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-54">[50]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-55"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_note-55">[51]</a></sup> Which party benefits from a third-party ticket depends on the election and the candidates.

1.  **[^](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_ref-2 "Jump up")** For example, if the Democrats had nominated both [Hillary Clinton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton "Hillary Clinton") and [Barack Obama](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama "Barack Obama") for U.S. President in 2008, it would have allowed the Republican candidate (John McCain) to easily win; the voters who preferred both Clinton and Obama over McCain could not have been relied on to solve the strategy coordination problem on their own.
2.  **[^](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_ref-3 "Jump up")** Examples are the [first past the post electoral system](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_past_the_post_electoral_system "First past the post electoral system") and in [single transferable vote](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote "Single transferable vote") or similar systems with a first-preference votes [winning percentage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_percentage "Winning percentage").
3.  **[^](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_splitting#cite_ref-8 "Jump up")** A term designed to appeal to a wider section of the public as a result of the widespread, often national support of [political parties](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party "Political party").
