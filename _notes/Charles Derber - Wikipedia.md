**Charles Derber** is an American Professor of [Sociology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology "Sociology") at [Boston College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_College "Boston College"). His work focuses on the crises of capitalism, globalization, corporate power, neo-fascism, American militarism, the culture of hegemony, the [climate crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_crisis "Climate crisis"), and the new peace and global justice movements.

In Derber's view, the overwhelming economic and cultural power of global corporations, increasingly associated with the hegemonic power of the United States government and the issues of global capitalism and climate change, as well as with the rise of neo-fascist threats to democracy, has caused a crisis that has become the pre-eminent social issue of the 21st century. He advocates a new vision and political movement, orienting his research toward systemic analysis of the intertwined crises we face and analysis of the transformative potential of social movements aimed at creating a more democratic and egalitarian order.

## Early life and education\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Charles_Derber&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Early life and education")\]

Derber was born in Washington DC in January 1944, the son of New Deal economist [Milton Derber](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Milton_Derber&action=edit&redlink=1 "Milton Derber (page does not exist)"). Evenings in the Derber household included dinner discussions of politics and economics, imprinting a New Deal ideological framework upon young Derber.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (September 2019)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Reaching adulthood in the 1960s, Derber buried himself within the works of [Karl Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx "Karl Marx") and [Herbert Marcuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Marcuse "Herbert Marcuse") while in jail for protesting the [Vietnam War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War "Vietnam War").<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Derber#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> He attended [Yale University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University "Yale University"), where he graduated with a bachelor of arts degree in 1965 and was a member of [Manuscript Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuscript_Society "Manuscript Society"). He then studied at the [University of Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago "University of Chicago") where he earned a PhD in sociology.<sup id="cite_ref-BC_2-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Derber#cite_note-BC-2">[2]</a></sup>

## Career\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Charles_Derber&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Career")\]

Derber began teaching at Brandeis University in 1970 and switched to Boston College in 1980. He became a professor in 1991 and has been teaching in the graduate program on social economy and social justice ever since.<sup id="cite_ref-BC_2-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Derber#cite_note-BC-2">[2]</a></sup> He is a prolific author, having published 26 books, translated into 14 languages, with several best-selling works.

Derber's work falls into three major categories. One is a critique of individualism and American culture. His 1980 book _The Pursuit of Attention_ focuses on [ego-centeredness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egocentrism "Egocentrism") and "[conversational narcissism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversational_narcissism "Conversational narcissism")" in everyday life as structured by class, gender and America’s individualistic culture. In 2000, Oxford University Press printed a 20th year commemorative edition of the book.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Derber#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> _The Wilding of America_, in its sixth edition, is a widely used text in American sociology. It offers a sharp critique of the [American Dream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dream "American Dream") and the crisis of [hyper-individualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyper-individualism&action=edit&redlink=1 "Hyper-individualism (page does not exist)").<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (April 2018)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

Derber is best known to the general public for his analysis of [corporate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation "Corporation") power and globalization.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (April 2018)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> His book _Corporation Nation_ is a study of how corporations penetrate and control every sector of American life. _People Before Profit_, a treatment of corporate globalization and its alternatives, has been published in five languages.

His books, _Regime Change Begins at Home_ and _Hidden Power_, deal with the marriage of political and economic power in America. It is an early treatment of corporate regimes and how they can degrade into fascism, a theme of his later books, "Moving Beyond Fear" and "Glorious Causes," both co-authored with Yale Magrass. In 2006, the Independent Publisher Book Award (IPPY) nominated _Hidden Power_ as one of the three best American books on current events.

Derber's interests evolved to focus on ideology and political morality, as well as the new dynamics of global capitalism and of the movements, such as the Occupy Movement, that challenge it. His 2008 book, _Morality Wars_, analyzes hegemonic discourses from the Roman Empire to the present. It also examines religious and "born again" ideologies, from German fascism to contemporary evangelical politics in the United States. Another 2008 book, with Katherine Adam, _The New Feminized Majority_,<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Derber#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> examines the gendered character of values and politics in America. It shows that a new electoral majority has embraced progressive values historically associated with women, values now shared by millions of men.

In 2010, Derber published _Greed to Green: Solving Climate Change and Remaking the Economy_<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Derber#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> (Paradigm Publishers, 2010), that shows that [climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change "Climate change") is a symptom of a dysfunctional lifestyle that can be solved only through a transformation of American capitalism and [neo-liberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-liberal "Neo-liberal") globalization. He argues that we are seeing a third wave environmentalism that is inseparable from the broader social and economic justice movements. In 2011, he published _Marx's Ghost: Midnight Conversations on Changing the World_,<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Derber#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> also translated into Korean and Chinese. In an imaginative encounter, Derber engages Marx's ghost in a provocative conversation about today's crises, relying extensively on Marx's own quotations. Turning to a genre of literary social science, based on conversation, Derber lays out alternative visions and political strategies for movements such as the [Occupy Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Movement "Occupy Movement").

Derber's 2012 book _The Surplus American: How the 1% Is Making Us Redundant_,<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Derber#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> co-authored with Yale Magrass, continues Derber's evolution into new genres of political writing. _The Surplus American_ features not only a careful analysis of "surplus people", those without jobs or any meaningful place in society, but a concluding play already performed at [Boston Collegeand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_College "Boston College") other colleges. The book describes a [dystopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia "Dystopia") in 2020, where the majority of Americans have been rendered redundant through [outsourcing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsourcing "Outsourcing"), technological change and a corporate strategy to abandon the entire US economic infrastructure. While first drafted before the rise of the Occupy Movement the analysis is structured around a confrontation on Wall Street between financial elites and surplus people protesters.

In 2013, Derber published his book, "Sociopathic Society" with Paradigm Publishers. He shows how a society can be based on anti-social values, leading toward violence, fascism and sociocide. He argues that today's hyper-individualistic version of the American Dream, the master cultural script of US capitalism, is helping fuel all these perils in the US today.

Derber's 2017 book is Welcome to the Revolution: Universalizing Resistance for Social Justice.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Derber#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> It explores the anti-Trump resistance movement and the anti-systemic universalizing movement needed to transform contemporary militarized capitalism. In conjunction with that book, Derber has brought together leaders of unions and many social justice movement, to analyze where we go from here. With Routledge Publishers, Derber is editing a new Universalizing Resistance Book Series where leading critical public intellectuals and activists analyze and flesh out stories of mass anti-systemic resistance that moves beyond the siloes of our current identity politics in our Left and Progressive movements. Derber is also helping direct a series of films and books about and with [Noam Chomsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky "Noam Chomsky"), funded by the Wallace Action Fund. His most recent book, published in July, 2023, is Dying for Capitalism: How Big Money Is Fueling Our Extinction - and What We Can Do About It with Suren Moodliar; the book analyzes corporate capitalism, climate change and militarism as a deadly "triangle of extinction" and offers a novel approach to combating it. He is publishing a new book in July, 2024, called Who Owns Democracy?,in a conversational format with sociologist Yale Magrass, focusing on the history and future of capitalism, fascism and democracy in the US, and showing that Trumpism is the latest expression of a long tradition of American fascism.

Derber is known as a [public sociologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Public_sociologist&action=edit&redlink=1 "Public sociologist (page does not exist)") who writes for general audiences, offering not only sociological critiques but alternative visions. He appears frequently on talk shows, podcasts and social media, and has written opinion pieces for media including the _International Herald Tribune_, the _Boston Globe_, the _Christian Science Monitor_, _Newsday_, and _[Tikkun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikkun_(magazine) "Tikkun (magazine)")_ and Truthout. His interviews on Youtube, called "Failings of the Left" and "Security Tales," with Chris Hedges, have gotten wide attention. His books are excerpted in Salon, Alternet, CommonDreams, and many other online venues. He champions the sociological imagination conceived by sociologist [C. Wright Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._Wright_Mills "C. Wright Mills"), and, like Mills, he believes in the importance of melding critical scholarship with social justice activism.

## Personal life\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Charles_Derber&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Personal life")\]

Derber has long been active in the peace, environmental and labor movements, from his 1960s work to register African-American voters in the [Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_Freedom_Democratic_Party "Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party") and his opposition to the Vietnam War to current movements such as Occupy and the struggle to prevent climate change and transform global [corporate capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_capitalism "Corporate capitalism") into a robust economic and political democracy.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch"><span title="The material near this tag may use weasel words or too-vague attribution.
