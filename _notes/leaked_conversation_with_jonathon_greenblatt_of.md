	What Hamas did on October 7th was pure evil. I also think Israel’s response has been pure evil. 

	These aren’t football teams and you shouldn’t pick a side. If you believe what Hamas did was justified because of what Israel has been doing for the last 70 years then you’re wrong. Murdering innocent civilians is never, ever justified. 

	If you believe in what Israel has been doing for the last 70 years then you’re also wrong. Displacing millions of people - and murdering many of them because you believe you have a God given right to live where they were born is evil.

		I wish I could remember the actual name of the fallacy, but equating supporting Hamas’ actions with understanding how Palestine would get to that point is inherently wrong. Hamas is an evil organization through and through, yet its existence is directly tied to Israel’s brutalization of Palestinians. Hamas is the only real force with any power that’s consistently fighting for (in a very vague sense) regular Palestinians. That’s why they keep getting members. Every time Israel murders a Palestinians family member or close friend, they give Hamas another member and Israel knows that. 
		
		If Israel stopped and made a concerted effort to make peace with Palestine, which they never really did even during the Oslo Accords, their problems would get less and less a lot faster than it thinks.
		
		Edit: somewhat surprised that I haven’t had all of the Israel apologists and propaganda accounts hounding me like they are others in this comment section. Only had about two or three but they’re really going to work lower down.

		* 🟧 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 255 _(2024-03-14 03:29:17)_

			False dilemma, i.e. falsely presenting that an argument is between only two choices.
			
			The false dilemma here is that if you’re against Israel’s behavior, you believe Hamas was justified. 
			
			I also think he’s conflating people who get into whataboutism spirals about who did what when historically with people who don’t believe carpet bombing people is OK.
			
			TikTok has actual problematic social implications, but both Millennials and Gen-Z are by and large against ongoing indiscriminate bombings of pretty much anywhere.
			
			The blatant disrespect for two generations where most are beyond voting age is very in line with the underestimation of younger generations by various political people in US elections like 2008. This should pan out well come November.

				Thank you! Google was not helpful trying to figure it out. I also agree with TikTok and social media as a whole, but I think the thing that so many of the older generations and politicians seem to be incapable of understanding is the fact that we can get live footage of people being bombed as it’s happening. It’s the exact same reason why pro- Vietnam war people hated war journalists. Showing the consequences of indiscriminate war crimes usually turns people against the war and we just can’t have that. /s

				Funny you mention TikTok. I get that it's problematic re China gaining user data but the conversation/plans to shut it down are I think as much about those in power trying to control the flow of information and influence over younger populations. But what lawmakers fail to realise is that a new social media will take its place.

				* 🟪 **[smellyscrote](https://www.reddit.com/user/smellyscrote)** ⬆️ 60 _(2024-03-14 05:37:38)_

					Gaining user data? Everything you do gives out data. Not just tiktok. 
					
					The issue isn’t with china getting your data. They long have that. 
					
					It’s china being able to control the algorithms that let something be seen or unseen and thus manipulating influence/stuff to go viral. 
					
					But if you tell the masses that’s why China bad. They will tell you no. They aren’t sheep that can be herded and influence easily. 
					
					So you tell them china is harvesting their data and suddenly all the sheep panic even tho the large majority of them have been freely giving away their data since the internet was a thing.

			* 🟦 **[Aberration-13](https://www.reddit.com/user/Aberration-13)** ⬆️ 9 _(2024-03-14 09:16:02)_

				This instance is actually the false cause fallacy. People are assuming that gen z is supporting specific actions Hamas has taken because they support Hamas as an organization when in reality they just support fighting back against Israel in general even if the group doing it is objectively bad.
				
				
				When you have no options except tactical allyship with bad people or you and everyone you know and love succumbing to genocide then it's really not a choice. Most people would work together with hitler himself risen from the grave if it meant even a chance at saving their loved ones.
				
				
				Gen z recognizes this.

		* 🟧 **[Johnny_Fuckface](https://www.reddit.com/user/Johnny_Fuckface)** ⬆️ 39 _(2024-03-14 04:23:58)_

			Yeah, they keep getting members because Israel keeps them in an open air prison in an apartheid state where people they know get bombed or shot regularly with no consequences. What do you even expect? It would be like America dropping bombs on Iraq non-stop destabilizing the region and expecting it to make things better. 
			
			And the whole rhetorical cultural stance of having to qualify that you don't support Hamas or killing civilians is the most ridiculous bit of propaganda fuckery Israel has created from this mess. Like, hey, I don't support terrorism but I dislike killing kids." Yeah, no shit! As if Americans are famous fans of terrorism. The only insanity here is the opposite position that requires you to abjure  yourself from any kind of moral alignment with Hamas to prove that you're not antisemitic when your initial disagreement is with dropping fucking bombs unarmed civilians! 
			
			That's the false dichotomy. Being gaslight by people so shamelessly racist they would kill children one day and then claim that the Jewish director of *Zone of Interest* is antisemitic for saying don't bomb those kids in an award speech for showing the banality of genocidal evil toward the Jews during the holocaust. 
			
			And then realize that Netanyahu supported Hamas countless times as a way of dividing support for Palestinians while oppressing them. That kind of shit show attracts hostility.

		* 🟧 **[Fit_Cycle](https://www.reddit.com/user/Fit_Cycle)** ⬆️ 69 _(2024-03-14 03:32:25)_

			We’re well past that point. Forget Hamas for a moment. The Israeli propaganda machine has dehumanized Palestinians so effectively that I feel like I’m in a Time Machine watching history repeat itself. This is a textbook tactic of oppression. There’s no coming back from that mentality unless Israel faces massive consequences for its actions and Israel takes a long hard look at itself. Israel has to be held accountable otherwise nothing will change. It took a war to topple the Nazis for Germans to understand how bad things had gotten and do some soul searching.

The oligarchs and politicians in our country also do not wish good things for average U.S. citizen, which seems like a much more pressing issue in my opinion.

I dont think if i grew up in a violent occupation that i would be thinking about the nuances of civilian deaths in war, while civilians on my side are being mowed down by the IDF for petty things such as throwing rocks. Civilian deaths are never justified but we know that bc we are taught that.

	Here’s the thing, it’s absolutely acceptable to be critical of the Israeli government. Very few people have an issue with honest criticism of their gov. It’s when one calls for a ceasefire and in the same breath, calls for the destruction of Israel,  problems arise.

	If you are actually pro Palestinian, you should also be highly critical of the Palestinian government (Aka In Gaza, Hamas). Why? Because the Hamas government is also a brutal, fascist, genocidal regime. 

	If you want peace, you have to demand that both sides stop shooting rockets at each other. Not just one or another. Call out the bad shit that both are committing.

		You can point to Hamas, but that doesnt excuse the decades long treatment of Palestinians in the West Bank, where Hamas has never ruled. Hundreds of people killed in West Bank each year for decades. The difference is if a rocket gets fired and kills an Israeli citizen, Israel can and will retaliate. If IDF shoots a 2 year old in the head (something that literally happened in West Bank in 2023 **before** October 7th), Palestinians have absolutely no ability to respond.
		
		It’s been a shitshow like this for 70 years, both sides have proven incapable of resolving this, repeatedly. They need to be separated like children fighting and let the adults dictate what happens from here.

	He still misunderstands because of his bias, IMO. "Justified" is the wrong take here. "Understandable" is the word he is looking for. Is it understandable that when a people are degraded, demeaned, dehumanized, disenfranchised,  and disrespected for decades that their behavior may become dangerous? When they have had and still have their homes and livelihoods taken from them and their families over the course of decades?

	The history of living in an apartheid state has shown us this pattern. The [Truth and Reconciliation](https://www.justice.gov.za/trc/) report detailed ANC [violence against the apartheid state](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1997/05/13/anc-admits-crimes-of-apartheid-era/a8a9d007-4dad-4262-a3c2-b79ef0cf5806/) of S. Africa:

	>In all, the ANC report detailed 550 armed actions carried out by its armed wing, Spear of the Nation, and another 100 incidents that may have been committed by its operatives. It seemed to put the attacks in a political context, saying civilians were never targeted but the ANC gradually accepted that such casualties were unavoidable.

	>"We have not attempted to argue that because our struggle was just, this fact justified . . . unacceptable methods of struggle," Mbeki said.

	Is the murder of civilians justified? Never. Has it been used as a tactic likely since the dawn of civilization? I suspect so. Is the struggle as noted "just"? Yes, it is a natural right of people to resist oppression.

	As Bob Dylan noted so many years ago "When *you got nothing*, *you got nothing* to *lose*."

	As a Jew I really wish these people would shut the fuck up. Move to Israel if it's so damn important to you. If you decide to shackle our ancient religion and culture to the existence of an 80 year colonial outpost, it makes you an idiot. Our religion is pretty clear that rebuilding the temple and recalling all jews to israel is something that the mashiach does.

	They have certainly opened up a gaping chasm inside of jewry, at least in the states. I won't pray at the temple anymore, I worry that Israel will come up and I don't want to deal with that. I've actually gone and prayed with a group of chasids because they don't believe in the current "state of israel". I have always been disgusted by israels actions, but the propaganda is worse and more pervasive than ever before. And angled towards trying to radicalize jews as fast as they can.

	They simply do not support isreal

	You can be firmly anti-zionist and at the same time, not being a supporter of hamas.  This also does not make you anti-Semitic.  There is a difference between Jewish people of Jewish religion, and Isreal, which is not a religion, it is a state.

	What isreal has been doing for nearly a century there is.. awful.  It's well documented, well reported, and very clear to see.

	Hamas are bastards for Sure.  But, if your people were being treated the same way Palestinians are treated by the isrealis,  you would probably join a fight against whoever was doing that to you too
