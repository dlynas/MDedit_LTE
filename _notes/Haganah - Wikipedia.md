**Haganah** ([Hebrew](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language "Hebrew language"): הַהֲגָנָה _ha-Haganah_, lit. 'The Defense') was the main [Zionist paramilitary organization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionist_political_violence "Zionist political violence") that operated for the [Yishuv](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yishuv "Yishuv") in the [British Mandate for Palestine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine "Mandatory Palestine").<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> It was founded in 1920 to defend the Yishuv's presence in the region, and was formally disbanded in 1948, when it became the core force integrated into the [Israel Defense Forces](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces "Israel Defense Forces") shortly after the [Israeli Declaration of Independence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Declaration_of_Independence "Israeli Declaration of Independence").

Formed out of previous existing militias, Haganah's original purpose was to [defend Jewish settlements against Arab attacks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercommunal_conflict_in_Mandatory_Palestine "Intercommunal conflict in Mandatory Palestine"); this was the case during the [1920 Nebi Musa riots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1920_Nebi_Musa_riots "1920 Nebi Musa riots"), the [1921 Jaffa riots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaffa_riots "Jaffa riots"), the [1929 Palestine riots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1929_Palestine_riots "1929 Palestine riots"), the [1936 Jaffa riots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaffa_riots_(April_1936) "Jaffa riots (April 1936)"), and the [1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936%E2%80%931939_Arab_revolt_in_Palestine "1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine"), among others. The paramilitary was under the control of the [Jewish Agency](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Agency_for_Israel "Jewish Agency for Israel"), the official governmental body in charge of Palestine's Jewish community during the British era. Until the end of [World War II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), Haganah's activities were moderate, in accordance with the strategic policy of _[havlagah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havlagah "Havlagah")_ (lit. 'self-restraint'), which caused the breakaway of the more radical paramilitaries: [Irgun](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irgun "Irgun") and [Lehi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehi_(militant_group) "Lehi (militant group)"). Haganah militants received clandestine military support from [Poland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Polish_Republic "Second Polish Republic") and sought cooperation with the [United Kingdom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom") in the event of an [Axis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_powers "Axis powers")\-led invasion of Palestine through [North Africa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_African_campaign "North African campaign"), prompting the creation of the [Palmach](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmach "Palmach"), their elite fighting force, in 1941.

Following the end of World War II, the British refused to lift the restrictions on Jewish immigration that they had imposed with the [1939 White Paper](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Paper_of_1939 "White Paper of 1939"). This resulted in Haganah leading a [Jewish insurgency against the British authorities in Palestine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_insurgency_in_Mandatory_Palestine "Jewish insurgency in Mandatory Palestine"); the campaign included the paramilitaries' bombing of bridges, railways, and ships used to deport [illegal Jewish immigrants](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Bet "Aliyah Bet"), as well as assisting in bringing more [diaspora Jews](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_diaspora "Jewish diaspora") to Palestine in defiance of British policies. After the adoption of the [United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine "United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine") in 1947, Haganah came into the open as the biggest fighting force among the [Palestinian Jews](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Jews "Palestinian Jews"), successfully overcoming Arab militias during the [Palestinian Civil War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947%E2%80%931948_civil_war_in_Mandatory_Palestine "1947–1948 civil war in Mandatory Palestine"). Shortly after the beginning of the [1948 Arab–Israeli War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War "1948 Arab–Israeli War"), Haganah was merged with other paramilitary groups and reorganized into the official military force of the [State of Israel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel "Israel").

Hagana poster from the 1940s

The evolution of Jewish defense organizations in Palestine and later Israel went from small self-defense groups active during [Ottoman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire") rule, to ever larger and more sophisticated ones during the [British Mandate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine "Mandatory Palestine"), leading through the Haganah to the national army of Israel, the IDF. The evolution went step by step from [Bar-Giora](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar-Giora "Bar-Giora"), to [Hashomer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashomer "Hashomer"), to Haganah, to IDF.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (March 2021)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

The Jewish paramilitary organizations in the [New Yishuv](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yishuv "Yishuv") (the Zionist enterprise in Palestine) started with the [Second Aliyah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Aliyah "Second Aliyah") (1904 to 1914).<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> The first such organization was [Bar-Giora](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar-Giora_(organization) "Bar-Giora (organization)"), founded in September 1907. It consisted of a small group of Jewish immigrants who guarded settlements for an annual fee. It was converted to Hashomer ([Hebrew](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language "Hebrew language"): השומר; "The Watchman") in April 1909, which operated until the British Mandate of Palestine came into being in 1920. Hashomer was an elitist organization which never had more than 100 members.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> During [World War I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I"), the forerunners of the Haganah/IDF were the [Zion Mule Corps](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zion_Mule_Corps "Zion Mule Corps") and the [Jewish Legion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Legion "Jewish Legion"), both of which were part of the British Army. After the [Arab riots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1920_Palestine_riots "1920 Palestine riots") against Jews in April 1920, the Yishuv's leadership saw the need to create a nationwide underground defense organization, and the Haganah was founded in June of the same year. The Haganah became a full-scale defense force after the [1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936%E2%80%931939_Arab_revolt_in_Palestine "1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine") with an organized structure, consisting of three main units—the [Field Corps](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hish_(Haganah_corps) "Hish (Haganah corps)"), [Guard Corps](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_Corps_(Haganah) "Guard Corps (Haganah)"), and the [Palmach](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmach "Palmach") strike force. During World War II the successor to the Jewish Legion of World War I was the [Jewish Brigade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Brigade "Jewish Brigade"), which was joined by many Haganah fighters. During the 1947–48 civil war between the Arab and Jewish communities in what was still Mandatory Palestine, a reorganized Haganah managed to defend or wrestle most of the territory it was ordered to hold or capture. At the beginning of the ensuing 1948–49 full-scale conventional war against regular Arab armies, the Haganah was reorganized to become the core of the new Israel Defense Forces.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

### 1920 Palestine riots and 1921 Jaffa riots

After the [1920 Nebi Musa riots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1920_Nebi_Musa_riots "1920 Nebi Musa riots") and 1921 [Jaffa riots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaffa_riots "Jaffa riots") by [Palestinians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians "Palestinians"), the Jewish leadership in Palestine believed that the British, to whom the [League of Nations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations "League of Nations") had given a mandate over Palestine in 1920, had no desire to confront local Arab groups that frequently attacked Palestinian Jews.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> Believing that they could not rely on the British administration for protection from these gangs, the Jewish leadership created the Haganah to protect Jewish farms and [kibbutzim](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbutz "Kibbutz"). The first head of the Haganah was a 28-year-old named Yosef Hecht, a veteran of the [Jewish Legion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Legion "Jewish Legion").<sup id="cite_ref-vanCreveld_6-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-vanCreveld-6">[6]</a></sup>

In addition to guarding Jewish communities, the role of the Haganah was to warn the residents of and repel attacks by Palestinians. In the period between 1920 and 1929, the Haganah lacked a strong central authority or coordination. Haganah "units" were very localized and poorly armed: they consisted mainly of Jewish farmers who took turns guarding their farms or their kibbutzim.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (March 2021)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

Following the [1929 Palestine riots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1929_Palestine_riots "1929 Palestine riots"), the Haganah's role changed dramatically. It became a much larger organization encompassing nearly all the youth and adults in the Jewish settlements, as well as thousands of members from the cities. It also acquired foreign arms and began to develop workshops to create [grenades](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenade "Grenade") and simple military equipment, transforming from an untrained [militia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia "Militia") to a capable underground army.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (March 2021)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

### 1931 Irgun split

Many Haganah fighters objected to the official policy of _[havlagah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havlagah "Havlagah")_ (restraint) that Jewish political leaders (who had become increasingly controlling of the Haganah) had imposed on the militia. Fighters had been instructed to only defend communities and not initiate counterattacks against Arab gangs or their communities. This policy appeared [defeatist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defeatism "Defeatism") to many who believed that [the best defense is a good offense](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_best_defense_is_a_good_offense "The best defense is a good offense"). In 1931, the more militant elements of the Haganah splintered off and formed the _Irgun Tsva'i-Leumi_ (National Military Organization), better known as "[Irgun](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irgun "Irgun")" (or by its Hebrew acronym, pronounced "Etzel").<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

### 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine

Haganah fighters guarding [Migdal Tzedek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Migdal_Tzedek&action=edit&redlink=1 "Migdal Tzedek (page does not exist)"), 1936

During the [1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936%E2%80%931939_Arab_revolt_in_Palestine "1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine"), the Haganah worked to protect British interests and to quell the rebellion using the [Posh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posh_(Haganah_unit) "Posh (Haganah unit)") and then the [Hish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hish_(Haganah_corps) "Hish (Haganah corps)") units. At that time, the Haganah fielded 10,000 mobilized men along with 40,000 reservists. Although the British administration did not officially recognize the Haganah, the British security forces cooperated with it by forming the [Jewish Settlement Police](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Settlement_Police "Jewish Settlement Police"), [Jewish Supernumerary Police](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Supernumerary_Police "Jewish Supernumerary Police") and [Special Night Squads](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Night_Squads "Special Night Squads"), which were trained and led by Colonel [Orde Wingate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orde_Wingate "Orde Wingate"). The battle experience gained during the training was useful in the [1948 Arab–Israeli War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War "1948 Arab–Israeli War").<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

### Support from the Second Polish Republic

During the interwar period, as part of its policy of supporting a Jewish state in Palestine in order to facilitate mass Jewish emigration from its territory, the [Second Polish Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Polish_Republic "Second Polish Republic") provided military training and weapons to Zionist paramilitary groups, including Haganah.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> Envoys from Haganah headed by [Yehuda Arazi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yehuda_Arazi "Yehuda Arazi") received dozens of shipments with military supplies, including 2750 Mauser rifles, 225 RKM machine guns, 10,000 hand grenades, two million bullets for rifles and machine guns, and a large number of pistols with ammunition. The British exerted heavy pressure on the Polish government to stop these deliveries. One of the last purchases of Arazi were two airplanes and two gliders. When he fled Poland to France, around 500 rifles were abandoned in a Warsaw warehouse.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> Members of the Haganah were also trained in a military camp in [Rembertow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rembertow "Rembertow") along with [Betar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betar "Betar") members between the years 1931 and 1937; it is estimated that training courses at the camp were attended by around 8,000 to 10,000 participants during their existence.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>

### 1939 White Paper

By 1939, the British had issued the [White Paper](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Paper_of_1939 "White Paper of 1939"), which severely restricted Jewish immigration to Palestine, deeply angering the Zionist leadership. [David Ben-Gurion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ben-Gurion "David Ben-Gurion"), then chairman of the [Jewish Agency](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Agency "Jewish Agency"), set the policy for the Zionist relationship with the British: "We shall fight the war against Hitler as if there were no White Paper, and we shall fight the White Paper as if there were no war."<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>

In reaction to the White Paper, the Haganah built up the [Palmach](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmach "Palmach") as the Haganah's elite strike force and organized illegal Jewish immigration to Palestine. Approximately 100,000 Jews were brought to Palestine in over one hundred ships during the final decade of what became known as [Aliyah Bet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Bet "Aliyah Bet"). The Haganah also organized demonstrations against British immigration quotas.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

However the ship sank, killing 267 people and injuring 172.<sup id="cite_ref-jewishmag_11-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-jewishmag-11">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Perl_12-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-Perl-12">[12]</a></sup>

Marching Jewish troops in the British army (1942)

In the first years of [World War II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), the British authorities asked Haganah for cooperation again, due to the fear of an [Axis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_powers "Axis powers") breakthrough in North Africa.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (October 2010)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> After [Rommel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Rommel "Erwin Rommel") was defeated at [El Alamein](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Alamein "El Alamein") in 1942, the British stepped back from their all-out support for Haganah.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (October 2010)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> In 1943, after a long series of requests and negotiations, the British Army announced the creation of the [Jewish Brigade Group](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Brigade "Jewish Brigade"). While Palestinian Jews had been permitted to enlist in the British army since 1940, this was the first time an exclusively Jewish military unit served in the war under a Jewish flag. The Jewish Brigade Group consisted of 5,000 soldiers and was initially deployed with the 8th Army in North Africa and later in [Italy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy "Italy") in September 1944. The brigade was disbanded in 1946.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (October 2010)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> All in all, some 30,000 Palestinian Jews served in the British army during the war.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>

On May 14, 1941, the Haganah created the [Palmach](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmach "Palmach") (an acronym for _Plugot Mahatz_—strike companies), an elite commando section, in preparation against the possibility of a British withdrawal and [Axis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_powers "Axis powers") invasion of Palestine. Its members, young men and women, received specialist training in guerilla tactics and sabotage.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> During 1942 the British gave assistance in the training of Palmach volunteers but in early 1943 they withdrew their support and attempted to disarm them.<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> The Palmach, then numbering over 1,000, continued as an underground organization with its members working half of each month as [kibbutz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbutz "Kibbutz") volunteers, the rest of the month spent training.<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> It was never large—by 1947 it amounted to merely five battalions (about 2,000 men)—but its members had not only received physical and military training, but also acquired leadership skills that would subsequently enable them to take up command positions in Israel's army.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

In 1944, after the assassination of [Lord Moyne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Moyne "Lord Moyne") (the British Minister of State for the Middle East) by members of the [Lehi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehi_(group) "Lehi (group)"), the Haganah worked with the British to kidnap, interrogate, and, in some cases, deport Irgun members. This action, which lasted from November 1944 to February 1945, was called the _[Saison](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunting_Season "The Hunting Season")_, or the Hunting Season, and was directed against the Irgun and not the Lehi.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (October 2010)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Future [Jerusalem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem "Jerusalem") mayor [Teddy Kollek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_Kollek "Teddy Kollek") was later revealed to be a [Jewish Agency](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Agency "Jewish Agency") liaison officer working with the British authorities who had passed on information that led to the arrest of many Irgun activists.<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>

Many Jewish youth, who had joined the Haganah in order to defend the Jewish people, were greatly demoralized by operations against their own people.<sup id="cite_ref-Bell_18-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-Bell-18">[18]</a></sup> The Irgun, paralyzed by the Saison, were ordered by their commander, [Menachem Begin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Begin "Menachem Begin"), not to retaliate in an effort to avoid a full blown civil war. Although many Irgunists objected to these orders, they obeyed Begin and refrained from fighting back. The Saison eventually ended due to perceived British betrayal of the Yishuv becoming more obvious to the public and increased opposition from Haganah members.<sup id="cite_ref-Bell_18-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-Bell-18">[18]</a></sup>

The Saison officially ended when the Haganah, Irgun and the Lehi formed the [Jewish Resistance Movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Resistance_Movement "Jewish Resistance Movement"), in 1945. Within this new framework, the three groups agreed to operate under a joint command. They had different functions, which served to drive the British out of Palestine and create a [Jewish state](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_state "Jewish state").

The Haganah was less active in the [Jewish Rebellion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_insurgency_in_Palestine "Jewish insurgency in Palestine") than the other two groups, but the Palmach did carry out anti-British operations, including a raid on the [Atlit detainee camp](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlit_detainee_camp "Atlit detainee camp") that released 208 illegal immigrants, the [Night of the Trains](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_Trains "Night of the Trains"), the [Night of the Bridges](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_Bridges "Night of the Bridges"), and attacks on [Palestine Police](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Police_Force "Palestine Police Force") bases.<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> The Haganah withdrew on 1 July 1946, but "remained permanently unco-operative" with the British authorities.<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> It continued to organize illegal Jewish immigration as part of the [Aliyah Bet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Bet "Aliyah Bet") program, in which ships carrying illegal immigrants attempted to breach the British blockade of Palestine and land illegal immigrants on the shore (most were intercepted by the [Royal Navy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy "Royal Navy")), and the Palmach performed operations against the British to support the illegal immigration program. The Palmach repeatedly bombed British radar stations being used to track illegal immigrant ships, and sabotaged British ships being used to deport illegal immigrants, as well as two British landing and patrol craft.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> The Palmach performed a single assassination operation in which a British official who had been judged to be excessively cruel to Jewish prisoners was shot dead.<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> The Haganah also organized the [Birya affair](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birya_affair "Birya affair"). Following the expulsion of the residents of the Jewish settlement of Birya for illegal weapons possession, thousands of Jewish youth organized by the Haganah marched to the site and rebuilt the settlement. They were expelled by British shortly afterward while showing [passive resistance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_resistance "Passive resistance"), but after they returned a third time, the British backed off and allowed them to remain.<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup>

In addition to its operations, the Haganah continued to secretly prepare for a war with the Arabs once the British left by building up its arms and munitions stocks. It maintained a secret arms industry, with the most significant facility being an underground bullet factory underneath Ayalon, a kibbutz that had been established specifically to cover it up.<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup>

British estimates of the Haganah's strength at this time were a _paper strength of 75,000 men and women_ with an effective strength of 30,000.<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> After the British army, the Haganah was considered the most powerful military force in the Middle East.<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> Research by Amos Perlmutter estimated that the Haganah budget in 1946 was £400,000, and by October 1947 its budget had reached £3.3 million. The same source estimated that the membership of the Haganah was 7% of the Jewish population in Palestine.<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup>

In July 1947, eager to maintain order with the visit of [UNSCOP](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNSCOP "UNSCOP") to Palestine and under heavy pressure from the British authorities to resume collaboration, the Jewish Agency reluctantly came into brief conflict with the Irgun and Lehi, and ordered the Haganah to put a stop to the operations of the other two groups for the time being. As Palmach members refused to participate, a unit of about 200 men from regular Haganah units was mobilized, and foiled several operations against the British, including a potentially devastating attack on the British military headquarters at Citrus House in Tel Aviv, in which a Haganah member was killed by an Irgun bomb. The Haganah also joined the search for two British sergeants abducted by the Irgun as hostages against the death sentences of three Irgun members in what became known as the [Sergeants' affair](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sergeants_affair "The Sergeants affair"). The Jewish Agency leadership feared the damage this act would do to the Jewish cause, and also believed that holding the hostages would only jeopardize the fates of the three condemned Irgun members. The attempts to free the sergeants failed, and following the executions of the three Irgun members, the two sergeants were killed and hanged in a eucalyptus grove. However, the campaign soon disintegrated into a series of retaliatory abductions and beatings of each other's members by the Haganah and Irgun, and eventually petered out. The campaign was dubbed the "Little Season" by the Irgun.<sup id="cite_ref-Bell_18-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-Bell-18">[18]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Hoffman_28-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-Hoffman-28">[28]</a></sup>

### Reorganization

Theatre of Operation of each Haganah brigade.

After "having gotten the Jews of Palestine and of elsewhere to do everything that they could, personally and financially, to help [Yishuv](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yishuv "Yishuv")," Ben-Gurion's second greatest achievement was his having successfully transformed Haganah from being a clandestine paramilitary organization into a true army.<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup> Ben-Gurion appointed [Israel Galili](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Galili "Israel Galili") to the position of head of the High Command counsel of Haganah and divided Haganah into 6 [infantry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry "Infantry") brigades, numbered 1 to 6, allotting a precise theatre of operation to each one. [Yaakov Dori](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaakov_Dori "Yaakov Dori") was named Chief of Staff, but it was [Yigael Yadin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yigael_Yadin "Yigael Yadin") who assumed the responsibility on the ground as chief of Operations. Palmach, commanded by [Yigal Allon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yigal_Allon "Yigal Allon"), was divided into 3 elite brigades, numbered 10–12, and constituted the mobile force of Haganah.<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup> Ben-Gurion's attempts to retain personal control over the newly formed [IDF](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces "Israel Defense Forces") culminated with [The Generals' Revolt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Generals%27_Revolt "The Generals' Revolt").<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (March 2021)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

On 19 November 1947, obligatory [conscription](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription "Conscription") was instituted for all men and women aged between 17 and 25. By end of March 21,000 people had been conscripted.<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup> On 30 March the call-up was extended to men and single women aged between 26 and 35. Five days later a General Mobilization order was issued for all men under 40.<sup id="cite_ref-33"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup>

"From November 1947, the Haganah, (...) began to change from a territorial militia into a regular army. (...) Few of the units had been well trained by December. (...) By March–April, it fielded still under-equipped battalion and brigades. By April–May, the Haganah was conducting brigade size offensive.<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup>

The brigades of the Haganah which merged into the IDF once this was created on 26 May 1948:

The northern [Levanoni Brigade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Levanoni_Brigade&action=edit&redlink=1 "Levanoni Brigade (page does not exist)"), located in the Galilee, was split on February 22, 1948 into the 1st and 2nd Brigades.

-   The 1st or [Golani Brigade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golani_Brigade "Golani Brigade") – was deployed in the Lower Galilee
-   The 2nd or [Carmeli Brigade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/188th_Armored_Brigade "188th Armored Brigade") – was deployed in the north and took its name after its commander, [Moshe Carmel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Carmel "Moshe Carmel")
-   The 3rd or [Alexandroni Brigade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandroni_Brigade "Alexandroni Brigade") – headquartered in [Netanya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netanya "Netanya"), it covered the area from [Tel Aviv](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv "Tel Aviv") to [Zichron Ya'akov](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zichron_Ya%27akov "Zichron Ya'akov")<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup>
-   The 4th or [Kiryati Brigade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiryati_Brigade "Kiryati Brigade") – formed in 1948 in the Tel Aviv area
-   The 5th or [Givati Brigade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Givati_Brigade "Givati Brigade") – formed in December 1947. During civil war the Givati Brigade was deployed in the central region, and during the conventional war in the south as the 5th Brigade
-   The 6th or [Etzioni or Jerusalem Brigade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etzioni_Brigade "Etzioni Brigade") – formed on December 1, 1947 and dismantled in the summer of 1949

    The Haganah mobilized Jewish youth for military training
    

To the initial six brigades, three were added later during the war:

-   The [7th Brigade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/7th_Armored_Brigade_(Israel) "7th Armored Brigade (Israel)"), in Hebrew "Hativat Sheva" – formed in 1948, manned mainly with [Holocaust](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust "Holocaust") survivors and including a number of [Machal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahal_(Israel) "Mahal (Israel)") troops. Almost annihilated at Latrun, then re-formed in the north. It had tanks and mounted infantry.
-   The [8th Brigade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/8th_Armored_Brigade_(Israel) "8th Armored Brigade (Israel)") – founded on May 24, 1948, and subordinated to [Yitzhak Sadeh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzhak_Sadeh "Yitzhak Sadeh") as the IDF's first armoured brigade, headquartered near Jerusalem.
-   The 9th or [Oded Brigade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oded_Brigade "Oded Brigade") – headquartered in Jerusalem.

The Palmach brigades which merged into the IDF:

-   The 10th or [Harel Brigade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harel_Brigade "Harel Brigade") – established on 16 April 1948
-   The 11th or [Yiftach Brigade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yiftach_Brigade "Yiftach Brigade")
-   The 12th or [Negev Brigade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negev_Brigade "Negev Brigade") – established in March 1948

Haganah High Command on the eve of the creation of the IDF, June 1948

After the British announced they would withdraw from Palestine, and the United Nations approved the partition of Palestine, the [1947-48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947-48_Civil_War_in_Mandatory_Palestine "1947-48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine") broke out. The Haganah played the leading role in the Yishuv's war with the Palestinian Arabs. Initially, it concentrated on defending Jewish areas from Arab raids, but after the danger of British intervention subsided as the British withdrew, the Haganah went on the offensive and seized more territory. Following the [Israeli Declaration of Independence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Declaration_of_Independence "Israeli Declaration of Independence") and the start of the [1948 Arab–Israeli War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War "1948 Arab–Israeli War") on May 15, 1948, the Haganah, now the army of the new state, engaged the invading armies of the surrounding Arab states.<sup id="cite_ref-Bell_18-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-Bell-18">[18]</a></sup>

On May 28, 1948, less than two weeks after the creation of the state of Israel on May 15, the provisional government created the [Israel Defense Forces](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces "Israel Defense Forces"), merging the Haganah, Irgun, and Lehi, although the other two groups continued to operate independently in Jerusalem and abroad for some time after.<sup id="cite_ref-Bell_18-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-Bell-18">[18]</a></sup> The reorganization led to several conflicts between Ben-Gurion and the Haganah leadership, including what was known as [The Generals' Revolt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Generals%27_Revolt "The Generals' Revolt") and the dismantling of the Palmach.

Famous members of the Haganah included [Yitzhak Rabin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzhak_Rabin "Yitzhak Rabin"), [Ariel Sharon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Sharon "Ariel Sharon"), [Rehavam Ze'evi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehavam_Ze%27evi "Rehavam Ze'evi"), [Dov Hoz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dov_Hoz "Dov Hoz"), [Moshe Dayan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Dayan "Moshe Dayan"), [Yigal Allon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yigal_Allon "Yigal Allon") and Dr. [Ruth Westheimer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Westheimer "Ruth Westheimer").

The [Museum of Underground Prisoners](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_Underground_Prisoners "Museum of Underground Prisoners") in Jerusalem commemorates the activity of the underground groups in the pre-state period, recreating the everyday life of those imprisoned there.

### Pal-Heib Unit for Bedouins

Some [Bedouins](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedouin "Bedouin") had longstanding ties with nearby [Jewish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews "Jews") communities. They helped defend these communities in the [1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936%E2%80%931939_Arab_revolt_in_Palestine "1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine"). During the [1948 Arab–Israeli War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War "1948 Arab–Israeli War"), some Bedouins of [Tuba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuba-Zangariyye "Tuba-Zangariyye") formed an alliance with the Haganah defending Jewish communities in the [Upper Galilee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Galilee "Upper Galilee") against [Syria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Syrian_Republic "First Syrian Republic"). Some were part of a Pal-Heib unit of the Haganah. Sheik Hussein Mohammed Ali Abu Yussef of Tuba was quoted in 1948 as saying, "Is it not written in the [Koran](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koran "Koran") that the ties of neighbors are as dear as those of relations? Our friendship with the Jews goes back for many years. We felt we could trust them and they learned from us too".<sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haganah#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup>
