## Joe Biden raised more money tonight than Trump did in the entire month of February. What does this mean for election?

					This is a big one that few people really want to talk about when it comes to 2016 polling. I wonder what would have happened had Comey come out and said they *both* were under investigation, like they were.

						Seems to me, to keep an even playing field, Democrats get one free FBI investigation into your political opponent a week before the election this year. Also, if Trump is elected and Dems hold the Senate, I believe they can stall on appointing judges for Trump's entire term. You know, in the interests of fairness.

								Not many of his supporters are the crazy MAGA conspirators. If convicted of a felony, he’ll loose supporters. Remember how much support Niki Haley got. Trump was only winning with 50-65% on average with a majority of the rest voting for Niki Haley. Niki Haley also got about 100K votes in Florida just recently even though she dropped out weeks ago. That’s dedication by her supporters and shows great disapproval of trump and that’s in Florida. We also saw a majority of voters in the republican primary saying they would disapprove of trump being the nominee.

							Would it even matter? Trump already has nearly 100 charges already and it hasn't slowed him down. A new FBI charge may just lead to more support for him.

				As I recall they had her at something like an 85% chance of victory and I think most people don't realize how far away that is from a sure thing. The Atlanta Falcons had like 90% of the points in the 3rd quarter and still blew the Superbowl

				* 🟪 **[Bay1Bri](https://www.reddit.com/user/Bay1Bri)** ⬆️ 42 _(2024-03-29 03:52:57)_

					It was at 85 percent at one point. The final polls showed it strong to 75 percent chance of winning, with a negative trend. But even accepting 75 percent, flip two coins. If they both come up tails, then the 25 percent chance occurred.

					* 🟥 **[cy_kelly](https://www.reddit.com/user/cy_kelly)** ⬆️ 38 _(2024-03-29 04:57:28)_

						People might understand it better if articles framed a candidate as having a 5 in 6 chance of winning, or a 3 in 4 chance of winning, or even a 75 in 100 chance of winning without reducing. I have a feeling that a lot of people hear "75% chance of winning" and translate it to "75% of the vote" in their heads, without even realizing that they've done it. Specifically because of it being a percent.

							This is one hundred percent a big part of it. People just don't understand the numbers. I think 538 had a something like a 70/30 breakdown going into the election (and that didn't consider Comey's October surprise). It was an unexpected result, but not *that* unlikely when you broke down the data. But it's really weird when people act like Trump totally dominated the 2016 election - he just barely made it. Had the election taken place a week before or after, the result probably would have been different.

								The 2020 election was similar. If only around 45,000 voters had voted the other way in a few critical swing states, Trump would have been re-elected. Biden's margin for winning was microscopic.
								
								I expect 2024 to have a similarly minuscule margin. Regardless of who wins its going to be very close.

							People aren't looking at the numbers, they're just listening to political pundits. A pundit on TV would look at the numbers and say the polls are all strongly indicating a Hillary win. As a viewer, I see that and assume Hillary will win, without even thinking about the actual statistics and what they mean.

				There's so much about the 2016 election that people exaggerate or get wrong or shift. Clinton herself as a candidate wasn't really any better or worse than most but she'd been heavily mudslung at by the GOP since the 90s. To get as far as she did with almost constant battering is impressive. Not really part of this discussion, but it is a frustrating aspect.
				
				The polls were likely part of the problem. I'm sure there were voters who stayed home because they thought she had a lock based on polling.
				
				But strategy was  big one, along with the Comey letter and the trolls/bots manipulating swing voters. Analysts were able to figure out counties that likely were flipped so Trump won the electoral college. It was some ridiculous total number of votes. He also LOST the general election, which doesn't matter overall but still goes against the idea he was some crazy popular guy.

					Mudslung or not, Clinton wasn't very popular in 2016. That said, I agree that people tend to overanalyze stuff that she did. I think the biggest factor why Trump was even within spitting distance of winning, is that Democrats were trying to to get a third term in the White House while the economic recovery was hitting a rough patch. After growth licked up a bit in 2014 and 2015, the Fed raised rates, prematurely as it turned out, and growth stalled a bit.

			Biden puts a lot of money into his ground game to get out the vote, opening more field offices etc. This can make the difference in a close election, and could put states like TX and NC into play so that Trump has to play defense instead of playing offense in states like PA and WI. Biden won GA in 2020 arguably because of his ground game. More money can equal more permeations to 270. 
			
			Another difference that a money advantage can have is on down ballot candidates who don’t have as much name recognition. Biden and the DNC have a symbiotic relationship,  while Trump and the RNC have more of a parasitic relationship in that the RNC’s coffers are being drained to pay Trump’s legal fees (so that Alina Haba can party in St. Bart).
			
			Trump had to cancel a rally last week (I think in AZ) because his campaign didn’t have enough money. He is hawking tacky tennis shoes and sticky bibles in between court appearances where he’s begging the court for more time to come up with money to cover his bonds. It is not a good look, especially for someone whose entire image is propped up by this superficial wealth and supposed business acumen.

			It's certainly not a guarantee of success.   It's a given that if people don't show up, Biden won't win.  With Trump on the ballot, and after Dobbs, and with Trump and other Republicans voicing support for a nationwide ban, and all kinds of other things, will lefties stay home?   We'll see.   
			
			Turnout among young people now is higher than when Gen X was their age.  And has been trending upward.   Will they stay home or suddenly jump to Trump?    I can't tell the future, though I doubt it.  Though I do get tired of "well we can't get complacent."   As if anyone ever argued for complacency, or said the outcome was guaranteed.   
			
			Complacency was a thing in 2016 largely because some lefties thought Clinton's win was a given, but partly that was because they thought that conservatives surely wouldn't turn out for Trump of all people.  So some lefties stayed home or voted third party "because of their conscience."  I don't see that happening again., not at that scale   Though "look at me" contrarians will always be with us, no doubt.

	No politician ever would be more effective having less money than more. Even if they are efficient at reaching their voters, persuading undecideds, cutting effective ads, have an engaging social media presence/personality and run competent get out the vote operations on a shoestring budget, more money simply allows them to do more of those things they’re good at and if the opposite is true, more money allows sheer volume to compensate for poor efficiency. So the short answer is, it can’t hurt Biden’s chances and probably helps.

	How much? That’s largely dependent on just how good Biden’s campaign is at those things I listed as well as how good the various campaign committees are (DSCC, DCCC, DNC, DSLC). There’s reason to believe given recent (last 3 cycles plus specials) electoral overperformance by Democrats that they have the better electoral machinery, but disentangling that from the national mood, economy, hot button issues and the candidates themselves is dissertation level research. Gun to my head I’d say it’s worth 1-1.5 pts, but even that begs the question of is Democratic electoral machinery actually better or just better funded.

	The one thing I *definitely* can say is Democratic partisans will not be overconfident this time. The existential dread that lives rent free in liberal’s heads of the prospect of a second Trump administration will have them campaigning like they’re 5 points down until the polls close in Hawaii.

Then, they kick out the traditional establishment wing, and the Haley donors. Meanwhile the usual dark money is going to this new Truth Social stock instead of the super pacs. Mccarthy was a great fundraiser, but now he's gone.

		The GOP has clearly hit donor fatigue, and Trump's draw on their base is *intensifying* not *dropping*. 
		
		The real problem is Trump is chowing down on the GOP's seed corn. Right now is when the GOP should be *spending* to help primary winners build up their own fundraising networks, campaign staff, and set up their campaign offices. When the GOP should be putting together coordinated polling at the state and local effort, putting together the infrastructure for voter outreach and GOTV effort.
		
		Instead they're *not*, and those local and state candidates are all trying to tap the same donors Trump is, and they're all tapped out -- and Trump has made himself the priority for their money. 
		
		Worse yet, with the Democrats having such a cash advantage? Democrats have plenty to spend on their vulnerable incumbents, to spend on races against the GOP's vulnerable incumbents, with a lot left over to attack more solid GOP seats as well!
		
		The GOP, on the other hand, is going to have to make tough choices on where to spend money, because Democrats can fund *far more seats* -- for attack or defense -- than the GOP can. 
		
		Do they try to fully fund their most vulnerable incumbents? Or fund challengers to vulnerable Democratic seats? There are going to be a *lot* of GOP candidates left on their own against well funded Democrats, in an election season that has seen massive Democratic overperformance in every special election since *Dobbs* and a GOP that has now decided to go after IVF.

This data is studied, parsed, sorted and packaged to see who is most likely manipulated into voting for their candidate, stay home on Election Day, or who could cross party lines. Foreign governments like Russia know how to use it and if they figure out they only need to flip a few counties (as they figured out in 2016). They hammer those counties big time in the months before the election with bots, fake news stories to people’s phones and social media accounts. Organize rallies from foreign soil using fake facebook accounts, etc.. frightening stuff but it’s been happening since the early 2000’s since smartphones became mainstream.

	Yes, money matters, A LOT. Without money campaigns not only are not able to compete in enough states but also get suffocated towards the last stretch of the campaign, where costs skyrocket cuz it's prime time to run ads and staff size reaches peak. Problem here is not just Trump's, it's the GOP as a whole. RNC, RSCC and RNCC are getting outraised big. A sizeable chunk of voters don't pay attention to politics at all, and if they don't see your ads/get contacted by a campaign they often don't even vote. People talk about 2016, but Trump got extremely lucky with EC advantage and larger than normal protest balloting coming from the fact that the electorate did not believe he could win, so a few % stayed home/voted third party to "protest" the two candidates. Relying on the first is dodgy, the second is not happening again.

	Not to mention dems are crushing in number of individual donors, which is a very good metric for enthusiasm.

Everyone knows who both of them are, everyone has seen both in action as president, everyone has seen the good, and everyone has seen the bad. All either of them is going to spend money on is ads telling us things about themselves and their opponents that we all already know and have been repeated ad nauseam in the media.

		A large war chest _could_ be indicative of a motivated voting block. If nothing else, it indicates that moneyed interests (people tied to the national status quo) are interested in maintaining the current trend. Conversely, dark money groups don’t really seem to be buying into Trump at this time.

Maybe he would do great, maybe he would fail, but folks in states like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania that Clinton basically ignored said "I'll give this Trump guy a chance" because he campaigned there and said the things they wanted to hear.

				Can't imagine why China would help Trump. Although stupid, he's a lot more hawkish on China than Biden. Any chance of the USA's IndoPac alliances disintegrating has to be balanced by the chance that they get bolstered or Trump suddenly decouples the US-China economies, likely provoking recessions in both.

	It's a dice roll. My guess is absolutely nothing. 

	Biden challenge is less having the money to spend and more having an actual campaign, in particular in battleground states like MI, WI, PA, NV, AZ and GA. Biden campaign needs to be a light to push back on the shadows cast by doubts on his presidency (be they superficial culture war issues, or actual issues with policy). 

	Bidens' path to victory is to not hemerage voters who hated the Trump years. And well, like a bad Ex, after they have been gone for a while, people can trick themselves into thinking, "it wasn't all bad all the time.. I should call him/her/them"

	Admittedly, Trumps path to victory is much more difficult. In the above battle ground states, Trump basically needs to win 5/6 above and maybe even all 6 really ... but that still leaves room for Biden to fuck it up between now and Nov.

	Remember: US elections are won by electoral college, and it has **repeatedly contradicted the popular vote,**  each time over-representing the white rural male voters.

	The last election was won by less than 1% in the states that matter : purple battleground states.  (North Carolina, Nevada, Ohio, Georgia, New Hampshire, Florida, Montana, and others...)

	Campaign money matters, but who in America is truly "undecided"?  Turnout is what matters most in this election, and some are **threatening** to stay home.  The right never misses a vote, it's their biggest election advantage: they always show up, **even when the devil himself is their candidate.**

	Food source companies are still gouging the shit out of the people every day, and the negative effect on home economics for the middle class and lower is undeniable.

	Anti-Biden Netanyahu, and the anything-goes opponent Hamas, are poised to deny Biden even a small diplomatic victory towards a "Two State Solution", which seems to be the last-best-chance to re-engage the progressive pro-Palestine voter who is too politically ignorant to remember Trump moving the American embassy to Israel to Jerusalem for no other reason than to provoke discord.  They won't ask themselves how much Trump prefers a **real** genocide.

	The Republican party wants the dumpster fire at the southern border to continue for overtly political reasons, so they will block any progress towards border control, no matter how much Biden compromises with the **impotent center-right**.

	In a post Roe-v-Wade country adding restrictive laws every day, child-bearing-aged women are the only x-factor I see that can protect us from Trump.  Who are their champions, and are they advocating for Biden publically ???!!!???!!!??  The answer seems to be no.  The answer seems to be **capitulation**?!?!?

	The **Supreme Court is stacked in Trump's favor** for any criminal rulings involving Trump, regardless of merit.  Even if they weren't, we will be given no reprieve of Trump's endless appeal strategy.  "Innocent" until proven guilty in a court of law.

	Is Kamala Harris ready to convince America that she has the **CHARISMA** to win us over in case of the likely death of a sitting president?  Where is her determination, her clarity, her audacity, her profundity?  Where is her **Limelight**?  She travels everywhere, but is she gaining popularity, is she making the **necessary difference**?

	Trump is likely to win the next election.

	The Iowa vote tally has **only been wrong twic**e in the last 40 years of presidential elections, and right now Iowa results are showing victory for Trump.

		> Remember: US elections are won by electoral college, and it has repeatedly contradicted the popular vote, each time over-representing the white rural male voters.
		
		Popular vote is irrelevant and always has been. Not a single president has ever become president by winning the popular vote, because thats not how the contest is decided. Not George Washington, not FDR, no one. No president has ever won because of popular vote.
		
		While popular vote often correlates to victory, its not how the game is scored. Its like saying the team with the most running yards wins the Superbowl. While the team with the most running yards correlates to winning the game its not how score is kept.
		
		Any person running for president should know the rules of the game, and if they're pursuing a popular vote win instead of an electoral vote win this person is too dumb to hold the office of presidency.
		
		I'm unsure why people keep bringing up popular vote relating to the presidency, as its never mattered.

			With great historical wisdom, the electoral college was written into the constitution as a "failsafe" against state election corruption.    It appears to have worked, in my opinion.
			
			However, it was never intended to serve as the primary method to silence the majority *and it does that too*.
			
			It keeps being brought up, because the states have never in our lifetimes been *corrupt enough* to sway any presidential election where the candidate would have been hypothetically chosen by a popular vote.  That means, that today Wyoming has far more representation (*by virtue of its 2 Senators*) per voter than Californians. [https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-09-20/electoral-college-why-should-wyoming-voters-have-more-power-than-californians](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-09-20/electoral-college-why-should-wyoming-voters-have-more-power-than-californians)
			
			This would probably not be a significant problem were voters not repeatedly bruised by popular/electoral contradictions and knife's edge margins.  The "recent" Gore/Bush, Clinton/Trump elections were both popular victories overruled by the EC.
			
			Couple those with BOTH extreme state gerrymandering aided by **software specifically designed to reduce or eliminate parity,** AND Trump's tsunami of frivolous election lawsuits, the best barometer for **the voice of the people has been disrespected beyond belief.**
			
			That is why.

Only takes 1 billionaire to totally reverse the disparity. And Musk, who owns one of the largest media companies, is very outwardly pro republican. The algorithms at twitter will probably have a bigger impact on the election than fundraising numbers.
