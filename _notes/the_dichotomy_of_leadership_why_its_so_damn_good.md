## The dichotomy of Leadership, why its so damn good

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Leadership/comments/18sdhnx/the_dichotomy_of_leadership_why_its_so_damn_good/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Leadership/comments/18sdhnx/the_dichotomy_of_leadership_why_its_so_damn_good/)

> I think one of the best books you can read on leadership is the dichotomy of leadership written by Jocko. Essentially the book is about possessing ultimate accountability and through that one must navigate the delicate balance that is leadership. 
> 
> Leadership is not just barking orders or being hands off. Leadership is about taking ownership of what the mission needs to ensure success. Sometimes it requires hand holding but sometimes you can let it play out.
> 
> To me its a must read even if you're not leading a team because at the very least you are leading yourself everyday.

	Haven’t read that one, but I firmly believe accountability and trust are foundational elements to effective leadership.

		I recommend it to anyone who is starting a business or entering a leadership position.

	I don’t recommend books to people often, but over the last few years I’ve found myself recommending his books quite a bit. Just very applicable to practical problems in work and in life.  Out of curiosity I even read through the Way of the Warrior Kid series, which I actually enjoyed, before buying them for the youngsters.

	I enjoyed both ‘Extreme Ownership’ and ‘The Dichotomy of Leadership.’ At first, I thought ‘Extreme Ownership’ was a little over the top—these are lessons learned because your life depended on it. Then, I started thinking about the ‘what ifs.’ What if my team showed up to work with the same thought process?

	If I don’t perform at a high level, manage the processes that prevent fires, and actively participate in my self-development, could I risk my life or those of my team?

	Imagine if everyone on your team showed up with this mentality; together, what could you overcome and accomplish?

		I learned “a leader is not supposed to be hands off all the time. It’s all about accountability”

	I've been workshopping this, the CASE for impactful leadership:

	Clarity (create a focus)

	Accountability (for yourself and everyone in your organization)

	Servanthood (help others be their best)

	Empowerment (listen and trust)

	All of Jocko’s books are fantastic as is his podcast. Big fan of his.

	That and EO are the first leadership books I’ve ever read that I’ve connected with and felt that the information was “real”. It wasn’t this believe in yourself stuff or dream big garbage.

	* 🟨 **[AskFelix](https://www.reddit.com/user/AskFelix) (OP)** ⬆️ 3 _(2023-12-27 18:56:18)_

		It’s so tactical.

* 🟩 **[NewDad907](https://www.reddit.com/user/NewDad907)** ⬆️ 3 _(2023-12-27 21:35:36)_

	It’s because they don’t just discuss lofty concepts and theory. They provide practical, actionable steps someone can take.

	* 🟨 **[AskFelix](https://www.reddit.com/user/AskFelix) (OP)** ⬆️ 2 _(2023-12-27 21:49:49)_

		I think too many books give too much back story and history when they can just be straight to the point

			Most leadership books suffer from the same problems “self help” books do. Lots of feel good fluff that gets a reader excited and motivated…
			
			…to do…
			
			…something? 
			
			With Dichotomy of Leadership and other books like it, there are actual scenarios and what to *specifically* say/do in those situations.
			
			The book has actual instructions, not just theory.

				Do you think these situational analysis recap are the ideal way to convey an idea/strategy?

* 🟩 **[warmind14](https://www.reddit.com/user/warmind14)** ⬆️ 3 _(2023-12-28 08:40:07)_

	If you like that, You're gonna love *turn the ship around* amazing leadership.

	* 🟨 **[AskFelix](https://www.reddit.com/user/AskFelix) (OP)** ⬆️ 2 _(2023-12-28 17:58:00)_

		Im going to check it

	* 🟨 **[Horror_Neighborhood](https://www.reddit.com/user/Horror_Neighborhood)** ⬆️ 1 _(2023-12-28 22:14:49)_

		Never heard of it

* 🟩 **[lokisavo](https://www.reddit.com/user/lokisavo)** ⬆️ 1 _(2023-12-28 01:00:03)_

	I didn't find Dichotomy as good as Extreme, perhaps because I read the latter first? EO pretty much lays the groundwork and Dichotomy is a deep dive?

	* 🟨 **[AskFelix](https://www.reddit.com/user/AskFelix) (OP)** ⬆️ 1 _(2023-12-28 01:52:32)_

		Splitting hairs. Extreme ownership as a concept is so critical that most founders don’t possess.

	I also like his books, the one thing that I think is missing is building relationships. He talks about it, but building relationships in the military is completely different than that of corporate America.  

	I have found the skill set needed to gain trust in a large corporation as opposed to the military is completely different.

		"For he today, that sheds his blood with me, shall. always be my brother.” — William Shakespear. You will build relationships the more crap you go through together.

			And it can take months/years to build trust among coworkers/colleagues but that trust can also be lost in a split second.
