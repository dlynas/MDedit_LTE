## Actual espionage movies?

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/comments/12fww3o/actual_espionage_movies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/comments/12fww3o/actual_espionage_movies/)

> Hello there. What I mean by an actual espionage movie is something far from James Bonds and Jason Bournes. I assume not many spies browse this sub so it's probably not going to be 100% correct. Yet, I have a feeling that Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is closer to reality than Atomic Blonde. From the top of my head I have also seen The Spy that came from the cold, Bridge of Spies, Argo, The Imitation Game, The Courier. Thanks.

		I believe Jack Barsky, who was a real KGB spy, consulted for that show. I listened to an interview he did for a podcast which is where I heard of The Americans. He has a book too where he details his life. It’s pretty wild if you’re one day in the mood for a non-fiction spy thriller book.

		* 🟧 **[tofupoopbeerpee](https://www.reddit.com/user/tofupoopbeerpee)** ⬆️ 2 _(2023-04-09 01:03:17)_

			Yeah this show will definitely do that to you in a bad way. I had a hard time with it but my antidote was to try to understand each characters perspective and worldview which thankfully the show writers did a good job fleshing out so as to be understandable.

	* 🟨 **[ryanmuller1089](https://www.reddit.com/user/ryanmuller1089)** ⬆️ 1 _(2023-04-09 04:38:43)_

		Just finish the series finale tonight for the first time. Fucking incredible show. Fun fact about the show:
		
		““Joseph Weisberg created the show. Weisberg worked in the Central Intelligence Agency's directorate of operations from 1990 to 1994. As a former agent, any script written by Weisberg must go in front of the CIA Publications Review Board.”
		
		A former KGB agent was on set as well giving pointers and advice. Again, it was amazing and has some incredible characters.

	Look up one from the early 80s called "Hopscotch" with Walter Mattheu and Ned Beatty.  It's more of a comedy, but if anyone can pull off being an actual spy, I think Mattheu nails it.

	I was gonna type Tinker Tailer Soldier Spy after seeing your title but you ended up mentioning it. Such a tense yet cool film. Not big on the spy theme but satire on stuff that happens in secret is Men Who Stare at Goats. A journalist's point of view on how wacky the army can get.

		If you like the movie *The Men Who Stare at Goats*, I always recommend reading the book. Anything in the movie with Ewan McGregor in it is fiction made for the movie. 
		
		The book is a fascinating look at the First Earth Battalion, and how that weird-ass experiment still affects U.S. intelligence and military work to this day.

	* 🟨 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 2 _(2023-04-08 17:42:49)_

		I believe this was a TV movie, but the Man who captured Eichmann shows espionage to be long, long stretches of boredom with only brief moments of actual  action.

	Can any actual former (or current) spies attest to any?

	I watched some podcasts with some and they seem to be pretty mundane jobs for the most part, it's just the paranoia and basically having to cover your tracks all the time, but what I found interesting is that they would otherwise seem like totally normal people with a normal job, wife, kids, etc, who are also completely oblivious to it. But the entire reason they're even there in the first place is to gather and send intel.

	I can safely say I've never seen a movie like that. Almost more like Breaking Bad captured it better than any actual movie about a spy, in terms of how much you really see the "double life".

	Tinker Tailor and Spy Who Came in from the Cold are both based on books by spy novelist John Le Carré. There’s a lot of other good adaptations of his stuff out there: The Constant Gardener, A Most Wanted Man, and The Tailor of Panama would be my recs after those two.

	Smiley’s People mini series from the 1970’s.   Had same actors (save one) as Tinker Tailor, but was about the final showdown between Smiley (the immortal Sir Alec Guinness) and Karla (the very briefly seen Sir Patrick Stewart).  Great stuff, and tons of Tradecraft.

	A Spy Among Friends is a show on MGM+.  I got the subscription just to watch it and highly recommend. It's slow, bleak, and intelligent.  If you liked Tinker, Tailor and Spy Who Came in from the Cold, I think you'll really enjoy it.   The book is one of my favorites, as is anything that Ben Macintyre has written about the Cold War era.
