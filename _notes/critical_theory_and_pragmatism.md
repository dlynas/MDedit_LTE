## Critical Theory and Pragmatism?

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CriticalTheory/comments/199vp6b/critical_theory_and_pragmatism/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CriticalTheory/comments/199vp6b/critical_theory_and_pragmatism/)

> I am starting to read the work of philosophers that are associated with Critical Theory especially those in the Frankfurt school of thought. I am aware of Jurgen Habermas and how he combined Critical Theory and Pragmatism in his work. Are there any other philosophers within the school of Critical Theory that would mingle with pragmatism?? I have seen Theodor Adorno’s name pop up on Google as well as Sydney Hook but I figured I might as well ask here since this is a pretty niche topic.

	Critical theory actually started out very hostile to pragmatism. Max Horkheimer's *Eclipse of Reason* directly attacks Sidney Hook and John Dewey, among others. Habermas and his students, as you are likely aware, broke away from this hostility toward a more productive relationship with figures like Charles Sanders Peirce and George Herbert Mead.

	While it is not necessarily "critical theory" in the classic, Frankfurt School sense, I highly recommend the collection *Deconstruction and Pragmatism,* which contains entries from Chantal Mouffe, Simon Critchley, Richard Rorty, Ernesto Laclau, and Jacques Derrida.

	Maybe [this](https://muse.jhu.ed[u/article](https://www.reddit.com/user/article)/901492) paper on Adorno and Dewey is interesting or has interesting references.

			The grandest pragmatist in my book was Charles Sanders Pierce - he obviously predated Critical Theory, but he was pretty prolific and he covered a whole lot of ground. I'd imagine there might be something there worth reading.
			
			**Edit: I just looked into it briefly, "Critical common-sense/sensism" would be good to check out.

	Look at Richard J. Bernstein, a good amount of his writing is on pragmatism and critical theory.
