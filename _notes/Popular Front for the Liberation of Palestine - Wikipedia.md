The **Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine** (**PFLP**; [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language"): الجبهة الشعبية لتحرير فلسطين, <small><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Arabic" title="Romanization of Arabic">romanized</a>:&nbsp;</small> _al-Jabha ash-Shaʿbīyya li-Taḥrīr Filasṭīn_<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>) is a secular Palestinian [Marxist–Leninist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist%E2%80%93Leninist "Marxist–Leninist") and [revolutionary socialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_socialist "Revolutionary socialist") organization founded in 1967 by [George Habash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Habash "George Habash"). It has consistently been the second-largest of the groups forming the [Palestine Liberation Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization "Palestine Liberation Organization"), the largest being [Fatah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah "Fatah").

[Ahmad Sa'adat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmad_Sa%27adat "Ahmad Sa'adat"), who was sentenced in 2006 to 30 years in an Israeli prison, has served as General Secretary of the PFLP since 2001. The PFLP currently considers both the Fatah-led government in the [West Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank "West Bank") and the [Hamas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas "Hamas") government in the [Gaza Strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip "Gaza Strip") illegal because elections to the [Palestinian National Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority "Palestinian National Authority") have not been held since 2006.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> As of 2015, the PFLP boycotts participation in the [PLO Executive Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Committee_of_the_Palestine_Liberation_Organization "Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization")<sup id="cite_ref-middleeasteye_5-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine#cite_note-middleeasteye-5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> and the [Palestinian National Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Council "Palestinian National Council").<sup id="cite_ref-reuters_8-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine#cite_note-reuters-8">[8]</a></sup>

The PFLP has generally taken a hard-line on Palestinian national aspirations, opposing the more moderate stance of Fatah. It does not recognize Israel, and promotes a [one-state solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-state_solution "One-state solution") to the [Israeli–Palestinian conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict "Israeli–Palestinian conflict"), in a "democratic Palestine", where "Arabs and Jews would live without discrimination". The military wing of the PFLP is called the [Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Ali_Mustafa_Brigades "Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades").

The PFLP is well known for pioneering armed [aircraft-hijackings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_hijacking "Aircraft hijacking") in the late 1960s and early 1970s.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> According to PFLP Politburo member<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> and former aircraft-hijacker [Leila Khaled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leila_Khaled "Leila Khaled"), the PFLP does not see suicide bombing as a form of resistance to occupation or as a strategic action or policy and no longer carries out such attacks. The PFLP has been designated a [terrorist organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_designated_terrorist_groups "List of designated terrorist groups") by the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States"),<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan "Japan"),<sup id="cite_ref-Japan_ban_12-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine#cite_note-Japan_ban-12">[12]</a></sup> [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada "Canada"),<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> and the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union "European Union").<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>

## History

### Arab Nationalist Movement

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/George_Habash.jpg/150px-George_Habash.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:George_Habash.jpg)

[George Habash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Habash "George Habash"), a Palestinian Christian, was PFLP's Secretary General at its beginning. He had been influenced by the ideas of [Constantin Zureiq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantin_Zureiq "Constantin Zureiq") and [Sati' al-Husri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sati%27_al-Husri "Sati' al-Husri"), Arab nationalists of the 1940s and 1950s

The PFLP grew out of the _Harakat al-Qawmiyyin al-Arab_, or [Arab Nationalist Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Nationalist_Movement "Arab Nationalist Movement") (ANM), founded in 1953 by [George Habash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Habash "George Habash"), a Palestinian Christian from [Lydda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydda "Lydda"). In 1948, 19-year-old Habash, a medical student, went to his home town of Lydda during the [1948 Arab–Israeli War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War "1948 Arab–Israeli War") to help his family. While he was there, the [Israel Defense Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces "Israel Defense Forces") attacked the city and forced most of its civilian population to leave in what became known as the [Lydda Death March](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydda_Death_March "Lydda Death March"). They marched for three days without food or water until they reached the [Arab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab "Arab") armies' front lines, leading to the death of his sister. Habash finished his medical education in [Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon "Lebanon") at the [American University in Beirut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_University_in_Beirut "American University in Beirut"), graduating in 1951.<sup id="cite_ref-Khazziha_15-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine#cite_note-Khazziha-15">[15]</a></sup>

In an interview with US journalist [John K. Cooley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_K._Cooley "John K. Cooley"), Habash argued for viewing "the liberation of Palestine as something not to be isolated from events in the rest of the Arab world" and identified "the main reason for \[Palestinians'\] defeat" as triumph of "the scientific society of Israel" over "our own backwardness in the Arab world"; because of this, he "called for the total rebuilding of Arab society into a twentieth-century society" and a "scientific and technical renaissance in the Arab world".<sup id="cite_ref-GreenMarchBlackSeptember_16-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine#cite_note-GreenMarchBlackSeptember-16">[16]</a></sup> The ANM was founded in this nationalist spirit. "\[We\] held the '[Guevara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara "Che Guevara") view' of the '[revolutionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution "Revolution") human being'", Habash told Cooley. "A new breed of man had to emerge, among the Arabs as everywhere else. This meant applying everything in human power to the realization of a cause."<sup id="cite_ref-GreenMarchBlackSeptember_16-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine#cite_note-GreenMarchBlackSeptember-16">[16]</a></sup>

The ANM formed underground branches in several Arab countries, including [Libya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya "Libya"), [Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia "Saudi Arabia") and [Kuwait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait "Kuwait"), then still under British rule. It adopted [secularism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism "Secularism") and [socialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist "Socialist") economic ideas, and pushed for armed struggle. In collaboration with the [Palestinian Liberation Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Liberation_Army "Palestinian Liberation Army"), the ANM established _Abtal al-Audah_ (Heroes of the Return) as a [commando](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commando "Commando") group in 1966.

### Formation of the PFLP

After the [Six-Day War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War "Six-Day War") of June 1967, ANM merged in August with two other groups, Youth for Revenge and [Ahmed Jibril](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Jibril "Ahmed Jibril")'s Syrian-backed [Palestine Liberation Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Front "Palestine Liberation Front"), to form the PFLP, with Habash as leader.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (December 2023)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Three other independent groups, namely Heroes of the Return, the National Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and the Independent Palestine Liberation Front, also met with Habash to form the PFLP.<sup id="cite_ref-Alexander-pp-33_17-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine#cite_note-Alexander-pp-33-17">[17]</a></sup>

By early 1968, the PFLP had trained between one and three thousand [guerrillas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare "Guerrilla warfare"). It had the financial backing of [Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria "Syria"), and was headquartered there, and one of its training camps was based in [as-Salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As-Salt "As-Salt"), [Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan "Jordan"). In 1969, the PFLP declared itself a [Marxist–Leninist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist%E2%80%93Leninist "Marxist–Leninist") organization, but it has remained faithful to [Pan Arabism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Arabism "Pan Arabism"), seeing the Palestinian struggle as part of a wider uprising against Western [imperialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism "Imperialism"), which also aims to unite the [Arab world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world "Arab world") by overthrowing "[reactionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactionary "Reactionary")" regimes. It published a magazine, _[al-Hadaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Hadaf "Al-Hadaf")_ (The Target, or Goal), which was edited by [Ghassan Kanafani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghassan_Kanafani "Ghassan Kanafani").

### Operations

The PFLP gained notoriety in the late 1960s and early 1970s for a series of armed attacks and [aircraft hijackings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_hijacking "Aircraft hijacking"), including on non-Israeli targets. Their [Abu Ali Mustapha Brigades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Ali_Mustapha_Brigades "Abu Ali Mustapha Brigades") also claimed responsibility for several suicide attacks during the [Al-Aqsa Intifada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Aqsa_Intifada "Al-Aqsa Intifada"). See [#Armed attacks of the PFLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine#Armed_attacks_of_the_PFLP) below.

### Breakaway organizations

A PFLP patrol in Jordan, 1969

In 1967, [Palestinian Popular Struggle Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Popular_Struggle_Front "Palestinian Popular Struggle Front") (PPSF) broke away from the PFLP.

In 1968, [Ahmed Jibril](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Jibril "Ahmed Jibril") broke away from the PFLP to form the Syrian-backed [Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine_%E2%80%93_General_Command "Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command") (PFLP-GC).

In 1969, the [Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine "Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine") (DFLP) formed as a separate, ostensibly [Maoist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maoist "Maoist"), organization under [Nayef Hawatmeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayef_Hawatmeh "Nayef Hawatmeh") and [Yasser Abd Rabbo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasser_Abd_Rabbo "Yasser Abd Rabbo"), initially as the PDFLP.

In 1972, the [Popular Revolutionary Front for the Liberation of Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Revolutionary_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine "Popular Revolutionary Front for the Liberation of Palestine") was formed following a split in PFLP.

The PFLP had a troubled relationship with George Habash's one-time deputy, [Wadie Haddad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wadie_Haddad "Wadie Haddad"), who was eventually expelled because he refused orders to stop attacks and kidnapping operations abroad. Haddad has been identified in released Soviet archival documents as having been a KGB intelligence agent in place, who in 1975 received arms for the movement directly from Soviet sources in a nighttime transfer in the Sea of Aden.<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup>

### PLO membership

The PFLP joined the [Palestine Liberation Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization "Palestine Liberation Organization") (PLO), the [umbrella organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbrella_organization "Umbrella organization") of the Palestinian national movement, in 1968, becoming the second-largest faction after [Yassir Arafat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yassir_Arafat "Yassir Arafat")'s [Fatah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah "Fatah").<sup id="cite_ref-Alexander-pp-33_17-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine#cite_note-Alexander-pp-33-17">[17]</a></sup> In 1974, it withdrew from the [PLO Executive Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Committee_of_the_Palestine_Liberation_Organization "Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization") (but not from the PLO) to join the [Rejectionist Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejectionist_Front "Rejectionist Front") following the creation of the [PLO's Ten Point Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLO%27s_Ten_Point_Program "PLO's Ten Point Program"), accusing the PLO of abandoning the goal of destroying Israel outright in favor of a [binational solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binational_solution "Binational solution"), which was opposed by the PFLP leadership.<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> It rejoined the executive committee in 1981.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEParkinson202347–48_20-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine#cite_note-FOOTNOTEParkinson202347%E2%80%9348-20">[20]</a></sup>

In December 1993 PFLP withdrew from the PLO and became one of the ten founding members of the Damascus-based [Alliance of Palestinian Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_of_Palestinian_Forces "Alliance of Palestinian Forces"), eight of which had been members of the PLO, which was opposed to the Oslo Accords process. PFLP withdrew from APF in 1998. Currently, the PFLP is boycotting participation in the PLO Executive Committee<sup id="cite_ref-middleeasteye_5-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine#cite_note-middleeasteye-5">[5]</a></sup> and the [Palestinian National Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Council "Palestinian National Council").<sup id="cite_ref-reuters_8-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine#cite_note-reuters-8">[8]</a></sup>

In December 2009, around 70,000 supporters demonstrated in Gaza to celebrate the PFLP's 42nd anniversary.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup>

### After the Oslo Accords

After the occurrence of the [First Intifada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Intifada "First Intifada") and the subsequent [Oslo Accords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Accords "Oslo Accords") the PFLP had difficulty establishing itself in the [West Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank "West Bank") and [Gaza Strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip "Gaza Strip"). At that time (1993–96) the popularity of [Hamas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas "Hamas") was rapidly increasing in the wake of<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writing_better_articles#WPCOLLOQUIAL" title="Wikipedia:Writing better articles"><span title="The word or phrase preceding this tag is a colloquialism. Please replace it with literal language. (May 2021)">colloquialism</span></a></i>]</sup> their successful strategy of [suicide bombings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_bombing "Suicide bombing") devised by [Yahya Ayyash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Ayyash "Yahya Ayyash") ("the Engineer"). The [dissolution of the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union "Dissolution of the Soviet Union") together with the rise of [Islamism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism "Islamism")—and particularly the increased popularity of the Islamist groups Hamas and [Palestinian Islamic Jihad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad "Palestinian Islamic Jihad")—disoriented many left activists who had looked towards the Soviet Union, and has marginalized the PFLP's role in Palestinian politics and armed resistance. However, the organization retains considerable political influence within the PLO, since no new elections have been held for the organization's legislative body, the [PNC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Council "Palestinian National Council").

The PFLP developed contacts at this time with Islamic fundamentalist groups linked to [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran "Iran") – both Palestinian Hamas, and the Lebanon-based [Hizbullah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hizbullah "Hizbullah"). The PLO's agreement with Israel in September 1993, and negotiations which followed, further isolated it from the umbrella organization and led it to conclude a formal alliance with the Iranian backed groups.<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>

As a result of its post-Oslo weakness, the PFLP has been forced to adapt slowly and find partners among politically active, preferably young, Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, in order to compensate for their dependence on their aging commanders returning from or remaining in exile.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (April 2023)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> The PFLP has therefore formed alliances with other leftist groups formed within the [Palestinian Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Authority "Palestinian Authority"), including the [Palestinian People's Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_People%27s_Party "Palestinian People's Party") and the [Popular Resistance Committees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Resistance_Committees "Popular Resistance Committees") of Gaza.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (April 2023)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

In 1990, the PFLP transformed its [Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan "Jordan") branch into a separate [political party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party "Political party"), the [Jordanian Popular Democratic Unity Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordanian_Popular_Democratic_Unity_Party "Jordanian Popular Democratic Unity Party"). From its foundation the PFLP sought [superpower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower "Superpower") patrons, early on developing ties with the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union"), the [People's Republic of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China"), and, at various times, with [regional powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_power "Regional power") such as [Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria "Syria"), [South Yemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen "South Yemen"), [Libya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya "Libya"), [North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea "North Korea"), and [Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq "Iraq"), as well as with left-wing groups around the world, including the [FARC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FARC "FARC") and the [Japanese Red Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Red_Army "Japanese Red Army").<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> When that support diminished or stopped, in the late 1980s and 1990s, the PFLP sought new allies and developed contacts with [Islamist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism "Islamism") groups linked to [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran "Iran"), despite the PFLP's strong adherence to secularism and [anti-clericalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-clericalism "Anti-clericalism"). The relationship between the PFLP and the [Islamic Republic of Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran "Iran") has fluctuated – it strengthened as a result of Hamas moving away from Iran due to differing positions on the [Syrian Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_civil_war "Syrian civil war"). Iran rewarded the PFLP for its pro-[Assad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashar_al-Assad "Bashar al-Assad") stance with an increase in financial and military assistance.<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> The PFLP has been accused by Israel of diverting European humanitarian aid from [Palestinian NGOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_NGOs_Network "Palestinian NGOs Network") to itself.<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup>

Following the death of [Yasser Arafat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasser_Arafat "Yasser Arafat") in November 2004, the PFLP entered discussions with the DFLP and the Palestinian People's Party aimed at nominating a joint left-wing candidate for the [Palestinian presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Palestinian_presidential_election "2005 Palestinian presidential election") to be held on 9 January 2005. These discussions were unsuccessful, so the PFLP decided to support the independent [Palestinian National Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Initiative "Palestinian National Initiative")'s candidate [Mustafa Barghouti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_Barghouti "Mustafa Barghouti"), who gained 19.48% of the vote.

In the municipal elections of December 2005 it had more success, e.g. in [al-Bireh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Bireh "Al-Bireh") and [Ramallah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramallah "Ramallah"), and winning the mayorship of [Bir Zeit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bir_Zeit "Bir Zeit").<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> There are conflicting reports about the political allegiance of [Janet Mikhail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Mikhail "Janet Mikhail") and [Victor Batarseh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Batarseh "Victor Batarseh"), the mayors of Ramallah and [Bethlehem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethlehem "Bethlehem"); they may be close to the PFLP without being members.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch"><span title="The material near this tag may use weasel words or too-vague attribution.

The PFLP participated in the [Palestinian legislative elections of 2006](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Palestinian_legislative_election "2006 Palestinian legislative election") as the "Martyr Abu Ali Mustafa List". It won 4.2% of the popular vote, winning three of the 132 seats in the [Palestinian Legislative Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Legislative_Council "Palestinian Legislative Council"). Its deputies are [Ahmad Sa'adat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmad_Sa%27adat "Ahmad Sa'adat"), [Jamil Majdalawi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamil_Majdalawi "Jamil Majdalawi"), and [Khalida Jarrar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalida_Jarrar "Khalida Jarrar"). In the lists, its best vote was 9.4% in [Bethlehem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethlehem_Governorate "Bethlehem Governorate"), followed by 6.6% in [Ramallah and al-Bireh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramallah_and_al-Bireh_Governorate "Ramallah and al-Bireh Governorate"), and 6.5% in [North Gaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Gaza_Governorate "North Gaza Governorate"). Sa'adat was sentenced in December 2006 to 30 years in an Israeli prison.

### Successors to George Habash

At the PFLP's Sixth National Conference in 2000, Habash stepped down as General Secretary. [Abu Ali Mustafa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Ali_Mustafa "Abu Ali Mustafa") was elected to replace him, but was assassinated on 27 August 2001 when an Israeli [helicopter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter "Helicopter") fired rockets at his office in the West Bank town of Ramallah.

After Mustafa's death, the Central Committee of the PFLP on 3 October 2001 elected [Ahmad Sa'adat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmad_Sa%27adat "Ahmad Sa'adat") as General Secretary. He has held that position, though since 2002 he has been incarcerated in Palestinian and Israeli prisons.

## Attitude to the peace process

When it was formed in the late 1960s the PFLP supported the established line of most Palestinian [guerrilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare "Guerrilla warfare") fronts and ruled out any negotiated settlement with Israel that would result in [two states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-state_solution "Two-state solution") between the [Jordan River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_River "Jordan River") and the [Mediterranean Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea "Mediterranean Sea"). Instead, George Habash in particular, and various other leaders in general advocated one state with an [Arab identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_identity "Arab identity") in which [Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jew "Jew") were entitled to live with the same rights as any minority. The PFLP declared that its goal was to "create a people's democratic Palestine, where Arabs and Jews would live without discrimination, a state without classes and national oppression, a state which allows Arabs and Jews to develop their national culture."

The PFLP platform never compromised on key points such as the overthrow of conservative or [monarchist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy "Monarchy") Arab states like [Morocco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco "Morocco") and Jordan, the [Right of Return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_Return "Right of Return") of all [Palestinian refugees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugee "Palestinian refugee") to their homes in pre-1948 [Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region) "Palestine (region)"), or the use of the liberation of Palestine as a launching board<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writing_better_articles#WPCOLLOQUIAL" title="Wikipedia:Writing better articles"><span title="The word or phrase preceding this tag is a colloquialism.

It opposed the [Oslo Accords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Accords "Oslo Accords") and was for a long time opposed to the idea of a [two-state solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-state_solution "Two-state solution") to the [Israeli–Palestinian conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict "Israeli–Palestinian conflict"), but in 1999 came to an agreement with the PLO leadership regarding negotiations with the [Israeli government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_government "Israeli government"). However, in May 2010, PFLP general secretary [Ahmad Sa'adat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmad_Sa%27adat "Ahmad Sa'adat") called for an end to the PLO's negotiations with Israel, saying that only a [one-state solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-state_solution "One-state solution") was possible.<sup id="cite_ref-One-state_solution_2-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine#cite_note-One-state_solution-2">[2]</a></sup>

In January 2011, the PFLP declared that the [Camp David Accords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_David_Accords "Camp David Accords") stood for "subservience, submission, dictatorship and silence", and called for [social](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_revolution "Social revolution") and [political revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_revolution "Political revolution") in [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt "Egypt").<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup>

In December 2013, the PFLP stated: "Hamas is a vital part of the Palestinian national movement, and this is the position of the PFLP."<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup>

The PFLP gained notoriety in the late 1960s and early 1970s for a series of armed attacks and [aircraft hijackings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_hijacking "Aircraft hijacking"), including on non-Israeli targets:

-   The [hijacking of El Al Flight 426](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Al_Flight_426_hijacking "El Al Flight 426 hijacking") from Rome to [Lod airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lod_airport "Lod airport") in Israel on 23 July 1968.<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup> The Western media reported that the flight was targeted because the PFLP believed Israeli general [Yitzhak Rabin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzhak_Rabin "Yitzhak Rabin"), who was Israeli ambassador to the US, was on board. Several individuals involved with the hijacking, including [Leila Khaled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leila_Khaled "Leila Khaled") deny this. The plane was diverted to [Algiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algiers "Algiers"), where 21 passengers and 11 crew members were held for 39 days, until 31 August.
-   Gunmen [opened fire on El Al Flight 253](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Al_Flight_253_attack "El Al Flight 253 attack") in [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens "Athens") about to take off for New York on 26 December 1968, killing one Israeli – this prompted [a reprisal by Israel destroying airliners in Beirut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Israeli_raid_on_Lebanon "1968 Israeli raid on Lebanon").
-   An [attack on El Al Flight 432](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Al_Flight_432_attack "El Al Flight 432 attack") passengers jet at [Zürich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C3%BCrich "Zürich") airport on 18 February 1969, killing the co-pilot and wounding the pilot; an Israeli undercover agent thwarted the hijacking after killing the terrorist leader.
