## Thank you for your interest in the monetary policy game, Chair the Fed.

The game has been a useful and fun tool to learn more about monetary policy. However, the Fed has [updated its approach to monetary policy](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200827a.htm), and the changes are not readily accommodated within the existing structure of the game. As of June 1, 2021, the game is no longer available.
