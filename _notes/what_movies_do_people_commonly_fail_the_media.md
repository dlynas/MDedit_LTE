## What movies do people commonly fail the “media literacy” test on?

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/19b3ew4/what_movies_do_people_commonly_fail_the_media/](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/19b3ew4/what_movies_do_people_commonly_fail_the_media/)

> In essence, what movies do people watch and love but consistently miss the point. Think of conservatives and suddenly being made about RATM or Green Day being “woke,” when really they missed the point.
> 
> Fight Club, Network, V for Vendetta, Scott Pilgrim vs The World, American Pyscho, The Wolf of Wall Street and RoboCop/Starship Troopers are a few of the more mainstream examples of this issue. This summer there was the spat that went across social media about people watching Oppenheimer and coming out thinking it painted him as a hero. Maybe you have a film you love that has a lot of subtextual stuff that people miss like what people say about Mad Max: Fury Road?

			I missed the satire of Ali G, but to be fair, I was twelve. I knew he was a comedic character, but I didn't pick up on him satirising middle class white kids pretending to be 'from the streets', or the glorification of anti-intellectualism, materialism, and misogyny. I just thought he was genuinely cool and really wanted to be him.

					What's funny is that its very apparent that all the dangerous and terrifying is just a front. They have their Prey trapped in a tiny space, outnumbered, outgunned, and all pretty physically weak compared to some of the bodybuilders the nazis have. And yet somehow they manage to bungle every attempt they make, and their entire organization is dismantled by a few kids. Then when their leader is confronted, all he can think to do is turn his back and ignore that they're there, because he's so weak that he can't even face evidence of his weakness head on.
					
					It's hard to think of many movies that do a better job of showing how pathetic nazis are.

		I really like American History X, but I think a fundamental flaw it shares with fight club is that Edward Norton is really goddamn charismatic and attractive. Even if you rationally understand that they are not heros (during part of the movie at least), it doesn't change the wish fulfillment nature of wanting to look/be like them.
		
		At some level people just aren't rational enough

			I think that is very much the point. So often in media the "bad guys" are shown to be ugly, deformed, or off putting but that's not the case. Derek was smart, charismatic, and attractive which made him very effective at recruiting others because that's how it happens. We think these are bad ideas that come from cretins but in reality these abhorrent beliefs are brought to us by well spoken people who you want to like. It's a ln especially poignant lesson for today's world.

		* 🟧 **[Lcatg](https://www.reddit.com/user/Lcatg)** ⬆️ 53 _(2024-01-20 04:56:37)_

			This. Add to it that he’s handsome &amp; super fit/buff in this movie. To them, it’s EN literally looking the best physical, idealistic version of a Nazi. I think this underscored for the Nazis the fallacy that it’s proNazi. Never mind the crazy eyes, murder, family sorrow, &amp; lost time. Idiots gonna idiot

	* 🟨 **[Turqoise-Planet](https://www.reddit.com/user/Turqoise-Planet)** ⬆️ 164 _(2024-01-20 00:32:45)_

		In the case of American History X, I don't think its too surprising that skinheads would see it that way. Regardless of what the film's intentions might have been, there are numerous scenes throughout the film that could be interpreted as supporting the skinhead viewpoint. For example, take the basketball scene: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm6Qw3ou0kg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm6Qw3ou0kg)
		
		Look at how this scene plays out, and how things are framed. You have the white skinheads playing against the black guys. The white guys win. But its not just the fact that they win, its how its presented. The scene ends with Derek making the winning basket in slow motion with triumphant music playing. We then see the skinheads victoriously hugging and celebrating, including Derek hugging his nazi girlfriend, while the same big, triumphant music plays, and the whole thing almost feels like the ending of some other movie.
		
		And that's just one example. There are other scenes like that too. So yeah, I'm not totally surprised skinheads like it.

		* 🟧 **[Recover20](https://www.reddit.com/user/Recover20)** ⬆️ 199 _(2024-01-20 01:13:48)_

			I think that's intentional though. Because it's a flashback and it highlights just how petty of a victory it really is. Making the music unnecessarily triumphant adds to the sense of what the characters may have been feeling at the time. I believe the flashback is also from Danny's perspective so in this juvenile way he looks up to his brother in this moment of celebration and remembers it fondly but also with a tinge of sadness in the reflection. If I remember correctly.

		* 🟧 **[iz-Moff](https://www.reddit.com/user/iz-Moff)** ⬆️ 91 _(2024-01-20 02:12:38)_

			It's not really a matter of interpretation, they're well aware that the overall message of the movie is anti-racist, they just don't really care and disregard it, and enjoy it for the parts in which they see Derek as being a badass.

	A Clockwork Orange.  

	The point wasn't that Alex was secretly a "good guy" the whole time, the point is 1) sometimes (actually more often than not) there are no "good guys" and 2) yeah Alex was human scum, but was psychologically torturing him to ellicit trauma responses towards his negative urges any better than what he was doing pre-incarceration?  Was he really "cured"?

	* 🟨 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 192 _(2024-01-20 02:08:21)_

		Nobody really cared about Alex or his victims. All the politicians just viewed them as pawns in their game to gain more power.

		I'm appalled that anyone would think that Alex was in any way good. He's a murderous rapist. He's a sociopath and he loves seeing people get hurt. 
		
		
		That being said: the movie is supposed to make you feel sorry for him. And damn it, there is a point where I do feel bad for him, despite him being a piece of shit. He's tortured for a government PR move and then discarded. The priest was right: he's lost his choice. And once we lose our ability to choose, could we even be considered human? And even worse - that means the government fully intends to mass use the Ludovico technique to pacify the country. That's some apocalyptic, tyrannical shit. 
		
		
		And that's the genius of not only Burgess' writing, but also Kubrick's directing and McDowell's acting.

		* 🟧 **[GreatestRegards](https://www.reddit.com/user/GreatestRegards)** ⬆️ 14 _(2024-01-20 12:06:59)_

			Anthony Burgess (the author) specifically blasts the movie for leaving this out because it’s not so much he’s bored so much as he grows up. I realize some people will not accept this based on the hyper violence depicted but it’s supposed to be redemptive. Even the worst can change. Without it, the narrative is nihilistic.

		He spends half the speech talking about how rich he is like an MLM flunkie and the other half insulting people, while briefly showing tired corporate acronyms that they’ve probably heard 1000 times.

		I think a lot of people miss too that Levine, Moss, and George were basically given impossible circumstances and the bosses used the contest as an excuse to fire them regardless of how well they did while still trying to milk some sales from them before the end. It's why the leads they are given are all dead ends that they've worked before. And all were probably like Levine's sale at the end that even if they did somehow manage to close one of these leads, the cheques probably would've bounced anyways.

			I used to have a friend who prided himself as being Jay Gatsby. This guy was a rich, heavy alcoholic who threw extravagant parties to try and live up to that character. He literally took me to see the Baz Luhrman film thinking it would open my eyes to seeing him (the friend) as a misunderstood romantic with aspirations just out of reach. 
			
			I had to break it to him that Gatsby was an out of touch, troubled individual who was not only insulated from reality by his wealth, but also didn't understand people. And that his "aspirations" treaded on the lives of others for his own greed. Gatsby isn't larger than life, that's an illusion he manifested through his wealth and insecurities. 
			
			My friend thought I was delusional and insulting him. I told him to read the book if Leonardo Dicaprio was too handsome to see past the message of the story.

				To be honest I don't think it is most people's fault that they fall in love with the romantic ideals of morally grey characters. Jay Gatsby, et cetera all have this coolness to them regardless of any percieved message in a film.
				
				(even if their character fails in the end it is still a romantic faliure: the character is "tragic" and perhaps becomes more appealing)

			* 🟦 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 23 _(2024-01-20 08:57:47)_

				I don't think Gatsby really treaded on others much. He was certainly insecure about being new money, but the Buchanans were the ones who destroyed lives and then carried on without a care because of the insulation of their old money. The Wilsons being the obvious example. 
				
				
				I mean, Gatsby gets murdered because of Daisy's carelessness behind the wheel. 
				
				Edit: Gatsby's greatest flaw was his obsession with appearing refined and upper class. His obsession with Daisy was part of this because she symbolized a prize that proved that he was worthy of the upper class. (Part of the tragedy is that Daisy is treated as an object by both suitors, and she's aware of it, as evidenced by what she says about having a girl.) Gatsby had always had this dream, going back to his childhood working on elecution exercises to try to talk like the wealthy talk. 
				
				The tragedy is that the rich just saw him as a place to go for parties and he was never considered one of them. He had to engage in crime to get his riches, which the old money looked down on, but it isn't like the Buchanans made their money without exploiting and engaging in unethical behavior. It's just that their business ventures were legally sanctioned. 
				
				Gatsby is a fool obsessive, but a sympathetic fool obsessive. In the book and in both movies.

					Not as far as I know. 
					
					We haven't talked in at least ten years. At the time he was living off his dad's money (he wasn't wealthy by his own means), he lived in a huge loft in downtown Vancouver next to Stadium and his neighbors were literally TV/movie stars.
					
					Me, being someone who comes from nothing, was quite impressed by all this at first. 
					
					 He, himself, was a failed airline pilot who was disqualified for being a *heavy* alcoholic.... seriously, I watched him crack open a 2'6 bottle of vodka and guzzle the whole damn thing - without so much as stopping for a breath - until there wasn't a drop in it. And that was his pre-party drink to warm upm To this day, I've never seen anything like it, and i came from a family of alcoholics. He *concerned* me. His addiction fed his failures and his failures fed his addiction.
					
					The last time we spoke, a mutual friend came to me and showed me a voice message of him sounding super drunk and saying things that implied he was going to hurt himself. So, we showed up at his flat and he wouldn't answer any calls from us or the door manager guy. The fire department was called. Hearing the voice mail, the FD battered down his door. 
					
					He had been sleeping (and seemed quite sober) and said he was preparing for a court appointment in the morning. But he was cordial and invited us all in for drinks. He literally gave no shits about his busted door or our worries (in fact, he was flattered about our concerns). It was this show of attention that made me cut ties with him. He was always seeking attention and crying for help but all he ever wanted was attention. 
					
					So, in a way, he probably was Gatsby... Just not in how he perceived it.

			I always thought the point of his character in Jojo Rabbit was to be more of a tragic character. He was manipulated by the system just as Jojo was in part because of who he was that he had to keep a secret. His disillusionment with the system along with starting to embrace who he actually was is where the cracks started to form in his nazism. But he still wasn't just free to be, and that took him to his death.

		Rorschach stands with Travis Bickle (taxi driver, a movie that probably belongs on this list) as great examples of an author giving his audience too much credit. These are characters that were thought to be so repellent that the audience would have no trouble seeing them as anti-heroes and deconstructions of toxic ideals that led to their own creation.

He is violent, crazy guy who breaks law and bones because he things he has moral right to do it to punish evil people. Like many guys before and after him in superhero media. People love Punisher and he is even more violent guy so I don't know why so many people are surprised that people like Rorschach, even if they know what type of character he is. Plus in the end he is shown to die for the truth, for opposing someone who was exposed as mass murderer.

				Reading that comic was the first time I heard about the Kitty Genovese story, and I still remember how thoroughly disturbed I was by it. But what Moore doesn't lay out for you, and what Rorschach doesn't realize, is that the story he heard, that no one tried to help her, was a lie. People did try to help her, but that wasn't a juicy enough story for the reporters. His entire worldview is built on a lie.

Everyone thinks they'd be able to resist a cult's brainwashing tactics or whatever in real life, and sure things do unfold extremely quickly, but it shows how the average person can get trapped in such a situation and the conditioning is so effective it makes them think it's their own choice

		As we get to know him however, we keep having to check the balance on “do I like this guy?”. Maybe you don’t mind drug use or soliciting prostitutes but what about dwarf-darts, wife-beating, absentee father, corporate fraud, homophobia, and outright disdain and mistreatment of the working class?

		Wolf of wall street is definitely a thickly smeared splodge of vaseline on Belfort's life. An unreliable narrator for sure, plus Hollywood needing to tell a fun story. The film practically screams at you that the main character is drunk and drugged and there's no way this is actually what happened. The car scene spells it out plainly for sure. Belfort believed everything was fine, but the reality was twisted wreckage. I imagine his life was drug fueled paranoia and anxiety until it all came crashing down. He probably found peace in prison.

		There’s something so unique about the feeling that film gives me. It’s hilarious but also deeply melancholy and aching. The fact that one of the characters is essentially wrestling to see any purpose in living anymore frames all of their interactions with the people they bump into in bruges in this kind of under the microscope way. They are hilarious interactions but at the same time it’s running the gamut of what life is. Love, pain, hope, hate, anger, etc.
		
		Is this enough? Can I handle this? Can I no longer be part of these things and live as a normal, moral person? I feel like Ray is constantly seeking these answers throughout. I find it incredibly poignant.

			A big reason why In Bruges works so well is because the film waits until the audience has gotten to know Ray before showing us the full horror of what he did. If the film started with the shooting scene then no amount of roguish Irish charm could make us feel sympathy for Ray.  (When it's finally revealed the film then gets tons of mileage out of it)
			
			Telling the story out of order like that placed Ray in a kind of purgatory in the minds of the audience too. What he did was unforgivable. But we can't help but feel for him. He wasn't rreeeaaally shit. But he wasn't all that great either. A bit like Tottenham.

	Let me share a weird and very niche one, the Japanese animated movie Sky Crawlers (adapting a novel of the same name). 

	https://youtu.be/W9BjLhPrZkA?si=qhHR8w4XJZTrh6ZU

	The premise is that private corporations fight mock aerial battles with each other for public entertainment, using cloned teenage pilots. The fighting itself is very real, and the pilots are regularly killed. In particular the antagonist team has an ace called The Teacher who slaughters the protag's team in every encounter. 

	A lot of commenters seem to view this as an antiwar movie, but I've seen very few pick up on it as a criticism of the education system. Young teens are seen as disposable clones, and sent to the slaughter by a dude called The Teacher. To me that's pretty blunt!

	* 🟨 **[Bale_Fire](https://www.reddit.com/user/Bale_Fire)** ⬆️ 19 _(2024-01-20 06:27:17)_

		* 🟧 **[Unplaceable_Accent](https://www.reddit.com/user/Unplaceable_Accent)** ⬆️ 21 _(2024-01-20 08:38:47)_

			I think that's there too, but like I say few people seem to pick up the social commentary. The school system as literal violence is a theme that crops up in Japan from time to time (eg Battle Royale in 2000) and parallels the idea of social competition as violence seen in the Korean movie Parasite. Again, I think The Teacher is key to understanding this: 
			
			- the call sign, of course
			
			- specifically mentioned to be an adult, not kildren
			
			- originally on the protag's side but switched and now fights against them
			
			- pilots speak English in the cockpit: English education in japan begins in junior high, when they are teens
			
			The teacher as an adult who is supposed to be helping these teens but instead cuts them down is I think a fairly clear criticism of the role teachers play in the Japanese education system.

		I guess just that people easily miss that Scott is kind of a self-centered dick especially in how he treats the people he dates.
		The most obvious example is Knives which the movie does very clearly call him out for for stringing her along and not being the mature person and letting her know, when he has clearly moved on. But there also seems to be a hint about Scort's history with Kim and there being some baggage there. Several of Scott's friends call him out for his past and present behavior, but haha he is just a quirky dweeb who ignores them.
		
		I think Scott and Ramona are both showed to have a selfish, insensitive streak and their whole journey in the film is overcoming that. But I guess some people miss that nuance because they're the hero couple.

	In Brazil, Elite Squad (2007). The movie follows a police officer doing monstrous things to allegedly combat crime and corruption. He is the narrator and rationalizes his actions as being a necessary evil. The script makes it clear he is just as bad as the criminals he faces and shows you just how brutal, senseless, and ineffective it all is. However, when the movie came out, about 90% of the viewers thought he was an absolute hero and was justified in all he did. The movie is brilliant, and yet very few people in Brazil appreciate it for what it truly is: a harsh criticism of the militarized police and the State that turns a blind eye to its many failings.

		Been a while since I read the comic or watched the movie, but as I recall, the movie tries to establish V as a plucky hero, and paints Guy Fawkes with the same brush, as the underdogs standing up to the fascists in charge. The comic did not. It was a case of fascism vs anarchy, with V reflecting a very extremist version of the latter, and just because he was blowing up fascists didn’t make him any less of a terrorist. I think it even mentioned that, true to life, Guy Fawkes Day is not the celebration of a man who stood up to tyrants, but a day of acknowledging a  historical terrorist attack. 
		
		But the movie made bank and Hugo Weaving is a charismatic motherfucker, so people see V as a hero and the Guy Fawkes mask became a meme for standing up to oppressors.

		* 🟧 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 62 _(2024-01-20 04:50:25)_

			Thank you! I've not read the comic so this context is really helpful
			
			I agree that V is unquestionably painted as a hero figure in the movie, but I think the movie is still clever and effective in how is portays V. He never wavers from seeing himself as a monster with no role in the future. I distinctly remember that >!V dying!&lt; came as a real surprise when I first watched it, but that's the point. The closing speech by Evie encapsulates this really well (>!he was you, me, and all of us!&lt;) as V is depersonalised, which is how he always saw himself.
			
			There's definitely scope to say that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter (or the reverse in this instance), and this is subjective interpretation is to some extent unavoidable in conflict not resolved by dialogue. But the movie very unambiguously makes clear that the fascist government are totally corrupt, self serving, and leave no room for negotiation, and that the philosophy to which V subscribes (which is broadly creative expression, freedom, and discourse, truth and tolerance are good, and that 'people should not be afraid of their governments, governments should be afraid of their people') is inherently a positive one.

	Barbieland is a pink-bubblegum reflection of real world patriarchy, not a feminist utopia. It's not intended to be "good". It's why Ken was able so effectively channel Ken frustration and import reactionary patriarchy in a superficial way, and why the Ken movement was effectively dismantled using the system which oppressed and divided them.

It is completely and utterly absurd that there even are lower district courts in Barbieland. Yet, an overwhelming amount of people seem to think that that is the point the movie gets serious and that it's meant to be a straight-faced, genuine resolution.
