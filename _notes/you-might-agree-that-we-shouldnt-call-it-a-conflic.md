## You might agree that we shouldn’t call it a “conflict”, but you might still do so occasionally due to how pervasive the term is.

But it’s not about the term, it’s about the way of thinking and the framework it subconsciously forces into our minds.

Chances are that this framework might be the reason you struggle when someone asks you “what’s the solution?”

If this was actually a “conflict” then the solution would be complicated. But since it’s not, the solution is simple:
• end the genocide, the siege, the occupation, the apartheid, the ethnic cleansing, and the colonial project
• full freedom for all Palestinians
• justice and remedies for Israeli crimes
• return of all exiled Palestinians
• Land redistribution to return lands to Palestinians
• Dismantle the Israeli state and replace it with a state based on universal principles of freedom, justice and equality — not ethnic supremacy

Send this to your friends who still say “conflict” or don’t understand that it’s not about semantics — it’s about political frameworks.
