	It means that it is impossible for our universe to be both local and real, one or both of those properties must be false. It means that either there are interactions at a distance in our universe or that the underlying foundations of our universe behave in a very exotic and strange way, taking actual form only when indeed interacting with anything.

	**Local** means here that all interactions take place in the direct spatial and temporal neighborhoods. While the temporal part is intuitive for us, the spatial one is not - we are used to perceiving and even manipulating things at a distance. But this is all an illusion (we see only photons that reach our eyes and we use electromagnetic radiation to transfer sound to our wireless headphones) and from what we know so far, our universe is entirely local as we know not a single action at a distance. Even famous quantum entanglement is an inherently local phenomenon because for the entanglement itself to happen, both particles must be in a direct neighborhood.

	**Real** means here that all quantum objects indeed have specific properties since the moment of their creation, just like we are used to perceiving the world. To simplify a lot, whether they are hard or soft in touch is defined at the very moment when they were created. If they were non-real instead, whether they are hard or soft would be determined only when you actually touch them, long after their creation. In other words, to answer if our universe is real is to answer if we perceive quantum world behavior in a probabilistic way because it is inherently probabilistic (non-real universe) or because we lack some kind of knowledge about the measured object (real universe).

	It's important to note here that there is no such thing as "passive observation/measurement" in the quantum world. You can't just sit idly by and watch quantum objects behave. You have to actually "touch" them, to actually interact with them, altering their state.

	That said, it's also important to state that we don't know which of those properties is actually false or even if both are false. We only know that they can't simultaneously be true.

		Amazing response, this is the best breakdown by terms in this thread in my opinion. Total layman here but I guess this is the three outcomes. Fair warning, this might be entirely wrong. (Note I use the word "properties" probably incorrectly, but I think it helps get the point across for me):
		
		1. Local=True Real=False:
		Interactions must occur within spacial/temporal neighborhoods. Quantum objects *possibly* collapse, or do *something else*, according to prevailing theories only when interacted with, and such properties don't really exist before doing so.
		
		2. Local=False Real=True:
		Interactions can occur outside of direct spacial or even temporal neighborhoods. Quantum objects have a hidden variable that determines their properties before being interacted with.
		
		3. Local=False Real=False:
		Interactions can occur outside of direct spacial or even temporal neighborhoods. Quantum objects *possibly* collapse, or do *something else*, according to prevailing theories only when interacted with, and such properties don't really exist before doing so.
		
		4. **Local=True Real=True: Proven impossible by the Nobel prize winners.** It cannot be the case that interactions are local and quantum objects have a hidden variable that determines their properties before measurement.

					It’s saying the universe is not local, nor is it real. Not “Real” means that objects don’t have innate traits before measurement, like the top/bottom spin of particles. Not “Local” meaning that particles can seemingly interact in a certain fashion regardless of distance from one another.
					
					That’s paraphrasing from this [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-universe-is-not-locally-real-and-the-physics-nobel-prize-winners-proved-it/) article. I wouldn’t say I’m at all knowledgeable on this topic.
					
					Comes from this passage:
					“Under quantum mechanics, nature is not locally real—particles lack properties such as spin up or spin down prior to measurement, and seemingly talk to one another no matter the distance.”
					
					Edit: Slight mistake, it means at least one is false. It does not have to be both, though it could be both.

	Hi /[u/kabir9966](https://www.reddit.com/user/kabir9966)!

	Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon, in which the measurement results of two entangled particles are correlated. I.e. if  I measure the spin of 100 pairwise entangled particles along the same axis, the results of the entangled pairs will always correlate. In other words, when one measurement gives spin up, measuring the other will always give spin down. This holds true, no matter how far the two particles are apart, or how short the time between the two measurements is. 

	One possible explanation of this phenomenon goes as follows: The measurement results follow a secret plan that is created together with the entangled pair. That is, the measurement results are deterministic. You can imagine this like hiding a small item in one of two identical boxes. Then you take one of the boxes to the moon and open it. If you find the item, you instantly know that the other box is empty. This would be a very neat solution, as no signal would have to be exchanged for you to gain this information, thereby side-stepping the problem of relativity.  Furthermore, this theory is [realist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_in_physics#Local_realism), in the sense that the state of each object is well-defined at all times. 

	This is called a [local hidden-variable theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_hidden_variable). Here, the term "local" signifies, that this theory holds on to the constraints of relativity, any object can only influence its immediate surroundings. This constraint is also called "locality". The idea of this theory is, that the measurement result of all quantum mechanical particles is pre-determined from the moment of their creation in such a way, that conservation-laws are respected. When we measure one particle of an entangled pair, we get the secretly pre-determined measurement result, and thereby instantly know the state of the other particle, without the need for  any signal to be exchanged between them. 

	As it turns out, we can test whether or not such local hidden variables exist using the  [Bell inequalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_inequalities): Veritasium has made a [pretty good explainer how this test works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuvK-od647c).

	The bottom line is, that such a hidden-variable theory would lead to different outcomes that what we measure. 

	Consequently, the local realist theory described above cannot be true. We have to let go of at least one of these constraints: The universe can respect realism, but not locality; or it could respect locality, but not realism; or it could respect neither. 

	A theory that respects locality but gives up local realism would mean quantum states really remain in an undetermined state of superposition until they are measured, and in the moment of the measurement, the wave function of both particles instantaneously collapses (according to the Copenhagen Interpretation anyway). There are no hidden variables pre-determining the outcome of these measurements, and no signal is exchanged faster-than-light.

	The Nobel price was given for experimental evidence that realism does not hold locally.

		As a lowly chemist who puts stuff in flask to make new stuff, I can't really wrap my mind around the idea that something like spin isn't an innate property to a particle. My understanding is that when the spin of a particle is measured, it is either up or down, but it has no spin before being measured. Then, its entangled partner also has no spin until measured, but will always be the opposite of the first. What I'm getting hung up on is how do the entangled particles not have spin until they are measured? I don't understand how the two particles don't always have a spin of up or down, regardless of whether they've been measured or not. I don't know if that makes sense, but it's hard to explain with my limited knowledge.

			>but it has no spin before being measured
			
			I don't think this is the correct way to think about it. You should think it more as "the particle has every possible achievable spins for its quantum state, all associated with different probabilities". And the measurement will make the spin observable collapse onto one of the achievable states, and the states will be realized with their given probabilities.

				A lot of people get hung up on the almose religious terms "measure" and "observe" as if it is conscious perception that is the catalyst. It's just as valid to say that "interaction" causes the collapse of the wave function. That interaction may be an "observation" by someone in a lab, or by simply interacting with something in its environment (EG a cosmic ray, or a reactive ion).

					As a layman I understand it like, it's a property that the particle can have but is irrelevant to the particle right now, and since it's irrelevant it's undefined. Like if the universe was an empty vacuum except for 1 particle, that particle wouldn't really have any defined "speed" because there's nothing to reference its motion against. Add a stationary/or differently accelerating particle to this universe and suddenly your first particle has a defined speed measurable in relation to the second particle. So if a particle with undefined spin interacts with a "spin-detector" then the spin of the particle is suddenly relevant &amp; needs a defined answer. Sort of like the information relating to certain quantum states only exists when you ask the universe for it. Or like if it was a video game and these quantum states are like the textures of an object - the game only renders higher &amp; higher resolution textures as you look closer &amp; closer at the model. The detail is there, but only if you're asking for it. Or for the universe, only if interactions demand a defined value

					I couldn't get past what was special about observation or measurement, but *never happened otherwise*. But I guess anotherbword might be "realized". A state isn't known until it is realized by whichever interaction causes the probabilities to collapse.

				* 🟪 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 17 _(2022-10-07 18:54:12)_

					From a physics perspective, a phenomenon cannot be observed without interacting with the universe outside of it in some way. Imagine a pitch black room. You may know from prior experience where the chairs and tables are, but you can't detect them without turning the lights on (photons), stubbing your toe on one (direct physical contact), perhaps clapping your hands and listening to the echo (sound waves), etc.
					
					Similarly, to detect subatomic particles they have to hit a sensor designed for specific particles. Sometimes we first have to hit them with other particles or wait for them to decay, and then pick up the secondary particles that result.

					But say in the double slit experiment, you fire an atom in a vacuum chamber, and an observation collapses the wave function, but that atom must be colliding with atoms all along its path, so why does the observation, and not the collisions(s) collapse the wave function.

						See the delayed erasure experiments. 
						
						The short answer is that if any other object carries information about what path the first particle took, then the wave behavior is broken *period*. 
						
						Deleting the information about what path was taken (before it hits the sensor) restores wave behavior.
						
						Observations are nothing more than interactions which create causal dependency, meaning that information about that property of that particle is now known by something else because the nature of the interaction means this value of this property has an effect on the second system. 
						
						It remains undecided until any other system has knowledge of it, but becomes decided once it's known. Any interaction which does not reveal information about the property in question will not cause "decoherence" and will not break the wave behavior. Passing by other atoms does not change anything as long as the particle don't impart path information to them in any interaction.

					I think that is what gets me the most. How do we go about intentionally "measuring/observing" when some random particle or fluctuation in energy states could cause the spin to be measured incorrectly? How do we keep pairs intentionally entangled if every time we keep at them we get a different result? I'm 6 years out of college since last quantum class but can't a quantum particle be measured as one spin during one observation and then the other on another observation? What keeps pairs entangled? How do we contain them and lock them into one spin so that we can do this style of what seems to be quantum encryption?

					Nono, you're not far off at all, it basically the same thing. If you think as the cat's life as a quantum state with two possible outcomes (|alive> and |dead>), you can think about the cat's life in a box as a superposition of the two states, so |cat> = a|alive> + b|dead> where a\^2+b\^2=1 for probability conservation (and because Hilbert spaces are L2). Once you measure the cat's state, i.e. open the box, you are making its state collapse onto one of the two states with the corresponding probability. The same goes with the spin of a particle, even though the situation might be more complex when computing the spin of an atom, because spin summation rules are [quite complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clebsch%E2%80%93Gordan_coefficients).

			This is one of my favorite things in QM. It is weird and counterintuitive, as many things are in QM.
			
			Our expectation that particles have specific values for quantities like position, momentum, spin, etc. is a natural one, but one that is grounded in an intuition honed by evolution over millions of years responding to pressures on a scale much larger than the scale on which the weirdness of QM can be seen. Simply put, it is ok to accept that your intuition chafes at QM weirdness.
			
			Pretty neat that our science has advanced beyond what our minds were evolutionarily prepared to imagine.
			
			As for spin and other intrinsic properties of particles, the answer is to remember that particles are not "super tiny bits of stuff". That is a definition we foisted on them. It is better to think of them as "these things which have the property of having indeterminate conjugate properties until measured". It is a little hand-wavy but it is the only way I ever managed to re-calibrate my intuitions. Spin is just something we invented to quantify a property of quantum particles. The universe doesn't care about our formalism. subatomic particles just "are" and the properties we measure are manifestations of the behavior of the particle. The superposition of states is just another formalism - one that explains a lot - and it has its own limitations.

			It makes a lot of sense, as this result is utterly baffling and there is no *good* way to wrap your head around that. Quantum mechanics poses very deep questions of [ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology), which cannot, unfortunately, be answered by the formalism. That is why we are left with [a plethora of interpretations of the formalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics).

			It does, but the spin is not as simple as "up" or "down". It's more like 70% up, 30% down. As a chemist, mixtures should come naturally to you! QM is basically the math behind mixtures (aka superpositions) of basic states.

			I don't know whether or not the many worlds interpretation is remotely accepted as true or not, but here is how it explains it, as far as I know.
			
			There is a universe in which the particle has an up spin, and a universe in which the particle has a down spin. In each of these universes, the other particle has the opposite spin.
			
			However, when you measure it, you basically determine which universe you are in. Until then, the particle only has a probability of being in each universe. But once you know which universe you are in, you know the state of the other particle instantly.
			
			This probably isn't actually the go to scientific explanation, however I think it helps explain it at a slightly more understandable level.
			
			Now, someone come along and tell me that the many worlds idea has been disproven or is not accepted or something.

		I have a question about your last paragraph. You say that in order to respect locality, no information is transmitted faster than light. If it was proven that there can't be predetermined states, then why is it that *both* entangled particles collapse when only one is measured? 
		
		In other words, there's no communication between entangled particles (local), and there's no hidden predetermined outcome (not real), so how would the non-measured particle "know" to collapse when the other one is measured?

			No information is transmitted when the wave function collapses through Alice's measurement, as there is no way for Bob to know whether their measurement result was random or pre-determined by the collapsed wave function. As relativity only forbids the faster-than-light transmission of *information*, this does not violate relativity. That being said, the Copenhagen interpretation of a collapsing wave function, is controversial. Other interpretations do solve the [measurement problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_problem) differently.

			As I stated in my initial post, the collapse of the wave function is an artifact of the [Copenhagen interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_interpretation). As the name suggests, the CI is only an *interpretation* of the quantum mechanical formalism, as the formalism itself unfortunately does not tell us *how* exactly the measurement influences the particles. This is known as the [measurement problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_problem).
			
			The tragedy of quantum mechanics is, that while the formalism works spectacularly well to *predict* the outcome of experiments in a statistical manner, it does nothing to *explain* what is going on. General Relativity, for example, is a theory that both gives us tools to predict the outcome of experiments, *as well as a way to interoperate it*. Quantum mechanics is not as cooperative, unfortunately, which is why we have [a plethora of interpretations of the formalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics).  
			
			That being said, the Copenhagen interpretation solves your question by noting that the collapse of the wave function does not transmit *information*. While Alice's measurement forces Bob's particle into a well-defined state, there is no way for Bob to *know* that. That is, there is no way for Bob to know if their measurement result was random or pre-determined. As relativity only forbids the faster-than-light transmission of information, and the collapse of the wave function does not transmit information, there is nothing preventing this collapse from occurring instantaneously.

			>how does one particle know the spin of the other
			
			It "knows" in the sense that they are entangled, i.e. correlated through some interaction.  Effectively, the two particles become part of the same system.
			
			No information can be transmitted across this system, though (e.g. from one particle to the other).  Measuring one particle is a random perturbation that, while affecting the other particle, does so in an uncontrollable manner such that one cannot "force" the other particle into a particular state.  Deterministically altering the entangled state of one particle simply breaks the system such that there is no longer any entanglement.

	In short, reality is not guaranteed. The basic information about the state of everything in universe doesn't necessarily exist until it needs to exist.

	There were a number of theories to explain the apparent unknowability exposed by our tests. Hidden variables. Mechanical predeterminism/predictability of how we would decide to test something apparently random.

	All of these have been proven to not be the answer. Bell proposed a test that would prove that the universe was not making stuff up on the fly, only when needed. But it still looked like the information was not determined until needed.

	Many scientists proposed ever more complex ways that the universe could have figured this out ahead of time. Possible avenues of information being shared.

	Kaiser and Zeilinger finally created a test that they believe removes all of the loopholes. They based the initial conditions on observations of stars so distant their light had never interacted, and performed the tests so fast that the test itself was the first contact between information from these two points. And they still found the same result. The universe appears to be making it up on the fly, and the effects are non-local.

	edit: By non-local I mean that quantum entanglement changes are determined faster than the speed of light. The universe appears to instantaneously be in the new observed state even when there is no possible way for that information or any information that might be relevant to have travelled between them at any point in their history.

			That would imply that information was time travelling, which could be an explanation, albeit an incredibly complicated one, because if information was time travelling then it could have time travelled the shorter distance between the entangled photons in the experiment.
			
			I honestly have no idea where this leads, how research shakes out now. I don't believe that causality has been proven to be broken by this. (which time travelling information would do). There are a lot of new articles being published though with theories and some of them will describe experiments we can do.

	Quantum mechanics is an inherently statistical theory. When you observe a quantum object, the theory tells you the probability of obtaining a result, but there is always an element of randomness to it (e.g. the cat has a chance of being alive and a chance of being dead).

	This has led some people to wonder if quantum mechanics is an incomplete theory, a statistical tool that fails to discover the "real" properties of objects. If it is, there has to be some hidden information that it just can’t access. (Was the cat "really" alive or dead before I observed it? Or was it really neither and did it only gain a definite state due to the observation?)

	The experiments showing Bell’s inequalities to be true proved that there cannot be locally hidden information, meaning that there is no such thing as a "true" hidden property of the particle that you discover with a measurement. Reality is inherently random, and the measurement forces the particle to adopt a state that it did not have in any sense prior to the measurement. (Yes, the cat was in fact neither alive nor dead, it’s not that we just couldn’t know.)

	Edit: The cat is kind of a nonsense example because yes, the cat would know. It’s not a quantum object, and it’s properties have been defined through interaction with other things (the air around it, the box, etc.). But it’s a good proxy to talk about particle spins, for instance.

	Edit 2: In this context, "measurement" really means any exchange in information, meaning anytime the measured object interacts with something else.

			Let me see if this analogy helps. I have two marbles, one white and one black. I shake them in my hands to confuse their identities. Then you take one without seeing it and I take the other without seeing it. Later, when you look at your marble and see it’s white, you know that mine is black. No information passed between the marbles, we just know that if one is black the other is white. You could consider those properties ‘entangled’, revealing one also determines the other. Now, marbles are a macro scale object. Even if you didn’t see it, your marble was white all along. Looking at it didn’t matter. For a long time, that’s what we thought of quantum particles as well. We might not know the property of a particle until we measure it, but it still had that property and measuring it just reveals it. Turns out, that isn’t so. A quantum marble is neither black nor white until something ‘measures’ it, which means it interacts with something that needs to know if it’s black or white. Only at that point, is it determined which it is and, even though we separated the marbles hours ago, for a quantum marble it can always be either until measured. It’s not just a case of our not knowing, it really exists as a ‘superposition’ of both black and white up until it needs to be one or the other.
			
			Let’s go a little further. I gave you a quantum marble and kept the other one. If one is black, the other must be white. They also have other properties, like both being round and smooth, etc, which are identical. These are quantum marbles, so they both exist as a superposition of black and white right now. You go down the street and come to a door that will let anyone with a marble through. You pass through because you have a marble, but that doesn’t ‘collapse’ the marble into one color. You come to another door that will let anyone through with a square marble. You cannot go through, your marble is round. This does not measure if the marble is black or white, so it’s still in a superposition. You come to a final door that let’s through only people holding a black marble. You then have to reveal your marble and either it is black or white. There’s a 50% chance it will be black and you can pass through. This is how an object is said to be observed or measured. When you reveal your marble like this, we also know what color my marble is, even though nobody looked at it and nothing measured it. How does my marble know when your marble collapses into being black or white? That’s the question that’s being answered. One idea was that your marble, when measured, sends a signal back to my marble. This has been shown to not be true.

			This really only applies at the quantum scale. Colour is a macroscopic property, and so is everything about the cat as you conceive it.
			
			But an electron flying through the air has no defined spin. If you observe it’s spin along some axis, it will resolve as being either up or down. If you observe it along some other axis later, it will either be up or down along that axis, and will stop having a definite spin along the other. If you observe it along the first axis again, it might have changed. All of this occurs randomly, and is not indicative of any hidden properties.

					This is where you start moving into quantum interpretation, which is something that scientists love arguing about - even though it's really more a matter of philosophy, at least with our current knowledge of the world.
					
					The Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics says that all particles really are just probability clouds. That probability cloud might look in a certain way depending on its environment. An electron that is bound in an atom will remain bound there until it is kicked away, but its actual position around the atom is best described as a probability cloud that is denser in some places and less dense in others. According to the Copenhagen Interpretation, this probability cloud *is* the particle. It is not merely a descriptor of where the true particle is located, because there is no true particle beyond the probability cloud. If the probability cloud then interacts strongly with something else, it will 'collapse', meaning that it suddenly becomes sharp and well-defined at a single spot with a single momentum - the cloud becomes a point, which will then immediately start spreading out again as a cloud, until you measure it next time. The collapse is truly random, but obviously you have a much higher chance to measure the particle in a spot where the probability cloud is denser.
					
					The Copenhagen Interpretation is not the only interpretation, and there are many scientists that dislike it. However, this proof that the universe is not locally real does strengthen the Copenhagen Interpretation somewhat, but I don't have enough expertise to say how much exactly. There's also also the possiblity of a superdeterministic universe, where everything is predetermined - this would be impossible to prove, but also impossible to disprove.

						Great. Now you've opened up a whole new "avenue" of thought for me on this already mind-warping topic. Bravo, you.

					It might seem glib but: because that's the way reality works.
					
					It seems we've finally locked down a sense of understanding reality - it's probability based, not deterministic rules based.
					
					That's a staggering insight.
					
					There's often a notion that if we knew the location and behaviour of every particle at the big bang, we could predict every part of the future, behaviour, action etc etc. This is 'deterministic', the notion that every particle starts and moves according to a set of unbreakable rules. Know the particles and rules, know the future.
					
					We are now beginning to understand and disprove this idea. The universe is probability based. This is beautiful because it returns the idea of free will and brings us to exist in an unordered, random universe where the future is yet to be determined.

			We interact with water and create a ripple and waves. There are properties of the waves we can measure. But before we created the wave, there were no such thing as hidden properties that we couldn't see. Only when the wave manifested, did such properties arise

	[This article does a great job of explaining it](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-universe-is-not-locally-real-and-the-physics-nobel-prize-winners-proved-it/). 

	“One of the more unsettling discoveries in the past half century is that the universe is not locally real. “Real,” meaning that objects have definite properties independent of observation—an apple can be red even when no one is looking; “local” means objects can only be influenced by their surroundings, and that any influence cannot travel faster than light. Investigations at the frontiers of quantum physics have found that these things cannot both be true. Instead, the evidence shows objects are not influenced solely by their surroundings and they may also lack definite properties prior to measurement”

		This analogy is close but NOT it. Essentially what you stated there was hidden variable theory - that when something is not in your field of view (i.e. you haven't measured it yet) the underlying information (hidden variable) of the object still exists. Quantum mechanics says that object exists in a "superposition" of all of the possible states until the moment that object is observed. 
		
		To tweak your analogy a bit, it would be like in the game when you turn around there is a 50% chance an enemy is there and kills you and 50% chance they show mercy and you survive. The code waits until you turn around (measure it's value) and then generates a random number between 1-100 where if it's less than 50 you die. Before you turned around, that enemy was considering both killing you and showing you mercy, but they didn't decide until you turned around.

			So the universe is shaking dice with infinite sides waiting for you to view it before it rolls.

			* 🟦 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 27 _(2022-10-07 18:26:36)_

				Yes, but it’s also acting in a way that represents the results of every one of those infinite rolls, simultaneously, until you observe the dice.

	I am still trying to wrap my head around this. Does this analogy work?

	Take a box that is completely dark and put a ball in it. The ball is rolling around all the time.

	Then, using a flash, take a picture. We now ‘know’ where the ball is, but only at the moment we observed it, not where it is all the time?

	* 🟨 **[Korochun](https://www.reddit.com/user/Korochun)** ⬆️ 36 _(2022-10-07 11:22:17)_

		That's kinda right, except the ball in your analogy is a real object that continuously exists. To make it more accurate, imagine a box that may contain a ball at any part of it (and occasionally even outside of it), but the ball doesn't actually exist at any specific point inside at any given time. Instead, it's just a cloud of possible locations that resolves to a single location at the moment of interaction.
