"What were the people of Gaza supposed to do?
I'm going to give you a frank personal admission, and I'm not proud of it, but I want to place this current situation in context.
I first became involved in the Israel-Palestine conflict in June 1982, when Israel invaded Lebanon.
I ended up writing my doctoral dissertation on a topic related to the Israel-Palestine conflict, and then I ended up devoting the whole of my identity.
Without life to that conflict, 40 years, and come 2020, even I gave up.
I started to write about other subjects. I thought the situation was hopeless.
There was a lot of guilt stirred up inside me, because I realized I was abandoning a people trapped in a concentration camp.
Now, I don't want to be emotive. I don't want to be dramatic. However, it behooves me to say, both my parents were in concentration camps during World War II.
My mother was in my Donna concentration camp, my father was in Auschwitz concentration camp, and I was riddled with guilt that people facing circumstances like my parents and I had abandoned them.
So, if even I had abandoned them, not making any claims to Sainthood, but simply the fact that I invested 40 years of my life in that conflict, and finally had to resign myself to the fact that nothing could be done.
So, does it really surprise you? Is it really a shock that a couple of days ago, the people of Gaza, most of whom, let's bear it in mind, most of whom were born in that concentration camp.
They were born into it. Does it really shock you that they would do something desperate to break free of that concentration camp?
At all there, criticize whatever tactics they employ. I am not approving it, but I am not disapproving it, because I don't know what I would do.
If I had been born into a concentration camp and spent 20 years of my life there."
