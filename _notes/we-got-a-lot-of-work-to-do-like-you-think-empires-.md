## We got a lot of work to do. Like You think empires are dismantled politely? By a bunch of people focusing on their careers? By people obeying, complying and using the channels offered to them by the same systems oppressing them? You think people in Palestine have to fight but you don’t? We just living trapped in a mass illusion that is only possible because we have a lil privilege. You ain’t free, I ain’t free and our freedom is only going to come from being in community, building, fighting, taking risks. It is risky. But what is the alternative exactly? Just staying on this lonely, isolated, deeply depraved path to nowhere and then we die having done nothing, lived nothing?
