	The Selfish Gene was referenced at least two times. I read this book. However it is made obsolete by a monster of intellectual work:

	The Structure of Evolutionary Theory (2002) is Harvard paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould's technical book on macroevolution and the historical development of evolutionary theory.[1] The book was twenty years in the making,[2] published just two months before Gould's death.[3] Aimed primarily at professionals,[4] the volume is divided into two parts. The first is a historical study of classical evolutionary thought, drawing extensively upon primary documents; the second is a constructive critique of the modern synthesis, and presents a case for an interpretation of biological evolution based largely on hierarchical selection, and the theory of punctuated equilibrium (developed by Niles Eldredge and Gould in 1972).[5]

	(Wikipedia article intro)

	This book is gigantic and brings some key concepts along with observations that are mind blowing. A must read.
