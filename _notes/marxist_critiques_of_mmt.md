	There are legitimate criticisms of some of the more prominent MMT-informed policy proposals thus far in relation to their lack of ecological or planetary system boundary awareness or their inherent capitalist structures, but most of the points you've written here are strawmen arguments and the paper you link itself seems to disagree on some fundamental factual findings concerning the history of money and credit without a thorough evidence-based analysis of why.

	1. The most you can assert here is that MMT shows that no currency sovereign is restricted in its spending in purely *financial* terms as the state issued currency is a public tool that can be created nominally at will.

	The second sentence is slightly strange since a large part of why capitalism can be so damaging is that it inherently seeks out system outcomes that are highly unequal in their wealth and income distribution. The entire point of government intervention is to correct these inherent flaws to provide social protection and, as is often advocated for through an MMT lens, full employment to correct the many social ills this causes.

	2. The "value" of money here can mean various things.  A) the exchange rate with respect to other currencies, B) what you have to give up in order to receive that currency (i.e. how many hours of labour or amount of commodity or service you have to provide to receive a unit of the currency), and C) the value imbued on it by the imposition of coercive taxation by the state. The paper linked seems to fundamentally reject this third notion without good reasoning why.

	MMT explains that since a state's currency is a public monopoly (bank credit money being a highly regulated, tethered proxy for the state currency), the state sets the "price" of the currency by establishing that which you must do to get it. The standard ubiquitous commodity is labour. The state decides how many hours of labour you must do for them to get a certain amount of their currency. The price of all other commodities then tends to reflect in relative terms to this labour wage rate.

	The key point here is that the **absolute** price level is a function of what the currency issuer pays. If the government suddenly offered a public sector wage structure starting at £1M per hour of labour along with a commensurate rise in tax liabilities (as income taxes are a %, this automatically happens), then the price of all other goods and services would rise with it until inflation has adjusted the price level upwards to meet the state's settings.

	3. MMT-informed policies do not simply advocate for Keynsian aggregate demand management to achieve full employment. Instead, MMT allows you to recognise that a state that issues its own currency faces **zero** nominal financial constraints in directly hiring all excess labour supply. If there are people able and looking for paid work in the state's currency (which a sufficiently wide tax liability would ensure), then that state can always hire them.

	4. I kind of agree with point 4, here. Yes, many JG proposals involve paying a de facto minimum wage to all JG workers in the programme. This does not automatically affect capital accumulation of wage structures elsewhere in the private sector. But what it does do is economically enforce not just a wage floor, below which private companies would find it impossible to hire at, but also a conditions floor (eg. Paid holiday, sick leave, etc). Legislation would still need to enforce many of these things because you don't want a system that allows companies to remove these core benefits by simply paying you more as despite that looking like a consensual exchange in a labour market, we know power structures can be inherently exploitative in aggregate.

	5. I don't understand this point. There are economists who, in good faith, argue that a JG could still well lead to inflation, but you can't say MMT doesn't at least offer a theoretical explanation. A JG acts as a price **anchor** by A) fixing the JG wage at a particular value and allowing all other labour and commodity rates to adjust relative to this, and B) providing a powerful automatic fiscal stabiliser.

	For point B, as private business falters and layoffs occur, government fiscal spending expands as the newly unemployed fill the ranks of the JG programme (which needs to be designed and administered to flexibly and dynamically expand and contract at will) creating a fiscal stimulus to prop up aggregate demand to promote sales and production. On the flip side, as the economy runs hot and private enterprise hires as many people it can to fulfil orders, government spending automatically contracts as JG wage outlays fall. This, along with increased taxes from higher spending, acts as a fiscal brake and prevents demand-side inflationary pressures.

	Now, as we've become accustomed, cost-push inflation is often the cause of a rise in prices as key commodities and sectors see bottlenecks in supply or shocks. This would still require careful policy responses to alleviate. But MMT recognises this as opposed to a mainstream that wants to hike interest rates in response to a rise in the price of oil and gas....  

	6. There is a wide body of MMT-informed literature that considers its implications for non-US sovereigns as well as nation states all along the spectrum of monetary sovereignty. There's nothing special about the US in this regard other than the international demand for dollar savings being fairly high.  MMT addresses the constraints facing nations that have sacrificed their domestic fiscal space in some way (eg. via currency pegging or foreign-denominated debt, etc). So I would say that MMT absolutely does "account for the realities of smaller economies" since MMT is just an accurate description of money and government and banking operations in the modern world.

	>1\. MMT boils down to justifying unrestricted government spending to sustain full employment, without addressing the underlying causes of capitalist crises and unemployment.

	No, that isn't what it justifies. MMT does not solve political problems. MMT is just a lens to help understand your constraints as a government.

	>2\. MMT wrongly claims that the state can determine the value of money through money issuance, when in reality the value of money stems from the capitalist production process which the state does not control.

	The state makes plenty of things and doesn't plenty of services. This is a nonsense critique.

	>3\. The MMT view that government spending can achieve full employment ignores that unemployment arises from lack of profitability and investment in the capitalist sector, not just lack of demand.

	Where does MMT say that the government money must only be spent on demand focused items. What a weird strawman. 

	>4\. MMT's main policy of a job guarantee program acts merely as a backstop to capitalism by hiring the unemployed at minimum wages, without challenging the wage structure under capitalism.

	JG is not MMTs policy, it's a policy that some in MMT think is appropriate. Also, again this is a political problem the critiquer needs to come up with a solution instead of fogging up the the MMT lense.

	>5\. MMT cannot explain or overcome the tendency towards inflation once full employment is reached, falling back on traditional Keynesian macro management tools like raising taxes/rates.

	This is very much a this happened before so it'll happen again. Perhaps you should highlight what the enrionment is like for this tendancy. Then looks at possible political solutions proposed. 0% interest rates, job guarnatee... fixing banking rules. A lot of independent solutions have been proposed by MMTers, you don't just say MMT doesn't fix this.

	>6\. MMT is focused on advanced capitalist countries like the U.S. and does not account for the realities of smaller economies where printing money can lead to currency crises.

	This isn't true. Money printing is not causing the currency crisis in those countries. They're political crisis. Argentina is a great example. The biggest issue the country had is that the people in exports were selling their pesos immediately for dollars. This caused massive inflation. The printing followed that. The state was unwilling to take on the exporters. That critique classically gets culture -> politics -> economy backwards.

	A lot of those critiques are of the "why doesn't MMT fix/address life, the universe, and everything" variety. A good starting point is to recognize the proper scope of what MMT *claims* to be and do. It's a macroeconomic framework for achieving full employment with price stability. That's it.

	With that in mind, some points raised in the OP that fall outside the scope of MMT such as "addressing the underlying causes of capitalist crises and unemployment" and "challenging the wage structure under capitalism". This may come as disappointing news but MMT is not the revolution, marxist or otherwise. On a more mundane level, it's also not a substitute for the difficult and ongoing work of doing politics.

	Of the critiques that are inside the scope of MMT, one stands out as the easiest to strike from the list as it boils down to a simple misunderstanding: 

	>MMT wrongly claims that the state can determine the value of money through money issuance, when in reality the value of money stems from the capitalist production process which the state does not control.

	Yes, the value does come from real production. What the state does is establish a link between the currency it issues and the production process to lay claim on real output from it. The state-issued currency being a tool, as Bill Mitchell puts it, to move resources from the private sphere to the public sphere, for public purpose.

	"MMT is focused on advanced capitalist countries like the U.S. and does not account for the realities of smaller economies where printing money can lead to currency crises."

	Given Marxists still operate in a fixed exchange rate commodity money world view it's hardly surprising they can't get their head around this one. 

	What they miss is the effect of a static tax base on how a floating rate currency behaves. The idea that the tax base is static and the spending moves automatically is one of those MMT points that probably isn't highlighted quite as much as it ought to be. 

	The mental model of "printing money" needs to have two extra components to be a complete view rather than an emotional pejorative catastrophisation. Firstly taxation "shreds money" and secondly saving is "money put in a drawer for safekeeping". 

	What Marxists particularly hate is the "money put in a drawer for safekeeping" and the obvious lack of any effect on inflation that has. It's cognitive dissonance for Marxists since that drawer resolves the capital accumulation problem Marxists like to bang on about endlessly.

	>no.3 unemployment arises from lack of profitability and investment in the capitalist sector, not just lack of demand.

	How do you explain the decoupling of productivity &amp; earned wages(even nominal ones)? Wages/emoluments are costs ... where do savings from cutting or stagnating them go?

	Author/critic has only read Capital Vol 1 and doesn't know of conversion of "surplus" value into profits?

	1 no it doesnt. Who advocates this? Why do mmters focus on crisis precention so much then (e.g debt to gdp analysis)

	2 good luck doing capitalism without money

	3 they do understand investments role in employment

	4 do generally agree but it also sets the minimum wage at whatever level

	5 inflation isnt al bad - if youre not degrowth then u need it for your core policy aim of growth. Also post key esianism and keynesianism arent the same, mmt is pk.

	6 its most useful / innvoative stuff is about these countries but applies to all countries

	Strawmen generally, use quotes or references cause this isn’t indicative of the school of thought. Its major issue for me is that degrowth requires a system which it does not analyse - socialism; not that mmters woudnt be likely the best designers of sociaist banking systems though. While mmters do offer policy advice which generaly i dont like, you dont have to be pro capitalist to have their descriptive side - eg michael hudson
