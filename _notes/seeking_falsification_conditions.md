## Seeking falsification conditions

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ezraklein/comments/1b4qkp2/seeking_falsification_conditions/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ezraklein/comments/1b4qkp2/seeking_falsification_conditions/)

> Biden just [confused](https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/02/joe-biden-confuses-gaza-with-ukraine-in-airdrop-announcement) Ukraine for Gaza twice in the same press conference. For the people who still think he’s the best Dems can offer in 2024, what are your falsification conditions for that claim? What evidence would you have to see to make you change your mind?
> 
> Presumably the answer is not “nothing” (in which case you would have a dogma). Presumably if Biden was in a coma you’d cease to think he was the best candidate to run against Trump. How about if he was consistently polling at 25%? How about 35% + he can’t get through a press conference without confusing one war for another? Oh wait, that last one is the actual world! You see what I’m getting at.
> 
> EDIT: Should have made this clearer, but I am not asking about falsification conditions for “I like Biden”. I like Biden too, not on everything, but on balance I like the guy, and I think he’s up to the job. What I’m asking for are falsification conditions for “Biden is the Democrat with the best odds for beating Trump”, which, you’ll notice, is actually rather orthogonal to the question of whether I like him. You might think that people SHOULDN’T dislike Biden, but that’s irrelevant when trying to figure out whether they DO. You have to work with the electorate you’ve got, not the electorate you think you should have.
> 
> So, again, what are your falsification conditions for “Biden is the Democrat with the best odds for beating Trump” REGARDLESS of whether you think those odds are being determined “fairly”. That doesn’t matter. Maybe it “should”, but it doesn’t.

	The real answer is “are the elites that I trust still supporting him” (eg if Josh Barro and Michael Bennet turn against Biden, I’d probably change my mind).

	But as far as which datapoints I would argue with someone about, idk much would change it. Dems have done well in elections and special elections. Biden overperforms his polls in the primary and Trump underperforms his polls in the primary. There are plausible rebuttals of that, but there’s enough evidence to make the argument “the polls are off, so showing he’s losing in the polls isn’t convincing enough for swapping in Kamala Harris to be worth the risk.” Like I’ve seen polls where Biden is winning youth by like 5 points instead of 30, and I just don’t believe that. I think young voters want to signal dissatisfaction by lying to pollsters about who they’ll eventually end up voting for in November.

	It’s not an ironclad argument by any means. But Harris would very likely be his replacement, and she seems to have a lower chance of winning than Biden. Her style of politics went nowhere in 2019 when she ran for President, and she hasn’t done much to pivot towards a different approach.

My parents are closer to Biden’s age than mine and both of them are furious at feeling they’re complicit in a genocide by virtue of being American, and furious in general about Dems hawkishness and this forever war situation we’re in.  I don’t think either of them will be voting for Biden (probably Cornell West, if he hangs in the race long enough). My home state went 56% for Trump in 2020, so you could knock me over with a feather if it makes a difference to the election results.  But I’m sure they aren’t the only boomers who are beyond disgusted with Biden’s policy decisions.

			It’s not “code” for anything. I was just referring to the goal of trying to win over the median progressive org staffer instead of the median general election voter. 
			
			Many politicians do it, and they empirically arent as good at winning close elections as politicians that choose to cater to some of the views of people whose votes they’re trying to win. To be clear, I’m not saying “only white guys are electable” if that’s what you’re trying to read in to that. Katie Porter for a while now has wanted to restore SALT deductions to help rich people in her district (because there are lots of rich voters in her district), and she flipped a district from red to blue in 2018 (in part by convincing Republicans to vote for her). You don’t have to cater across the board, you can pick and choose. But plenty of politicians reject that and lean more into a “base mobilization” strategy (which went very poorly for Harris when she ran in 2019 for Prez)

	Mine would be that voters register their concern by choosing someone else in actual elections. The Michigan result is a light yellow flag, but by no means a panic inducer. Putting polls and gaffes above election results mixes up signal and noise.

		>The Michigan result is a light yellow flag, but by no means a panic inducer.
		
		Agreed. Even with a strong grass roots movement to vote uncommitted that included elected members of Congress loudly doing so he still got 81% of the vote. And I think the message was received by his administration based on some of the recent policy moves.
		
		*Meanwhile* in the same primary Trump once again showed he is struggling to solidify Republican support. He only pulled in 68% of the vote with 30% of Republican voters against him. 
		
		But we're not talking about that, we're talking about a old man with a known speech impediment making inconsequential gaffes.

			I don't think people realize the people in Michigan that were willing to vote uncommitted at a primary are willing to actually not vote in the general. 
			
			From their pov, they have family dying back home and trump would do the same so there's no point in voting for Biden since he creates the same results as trump. And the suffering they would go through at home with trump in power is small relative to what people back home are going through. 
			
			And trump is a wild card. If he thinks Israel is asking too much he might be petty in a childish way and stop sending money. Especially considering how petty he was that they didn't stand with him and his false election claims.

				>people in Michigan that were willing to vote uncommitted at a primary are willing to actually not vote in a primary. 
				
				Did you mean "not vote in the general" here? If so I think I agree but I'd also wonder how many of them wouldn't have voted the general and only participated this time to send the message. Put another way, is the uncommitted vote an actual representation of people who would vote for Biden but are now uncommitted or are they people who just took this as an opportunity to signal their displeasure with the situation.
				
				If you actually meant primary then I don't understand that point, can you explain it further
				
				>And trump is a wild card.
				
				This is true and a something I hadn't thought about. My only disagreement is while Trump is definitely unpredictable in a lot of areas there are spaces where he doesn't waiver. One is Russia/Putin, he doesn't disparage either of them. Another is the evangelical view of Israel, he doesn't care about Jewish people or Israel but he steadfastly supports the evangelical goal of quickening Armageddon through Israel. I don't think there's a world where Trump is seen trying to reign in Bibi/Israel.
				
				>voting for Biden since he creates the same results as trump
				
				I understand this sentiment and I get why they feel that way. I legitimately don't have any counter-argument. If your single issue is "stop Israel from killing my family" then there is effectively no difference between Biden and Trump. Neither of them are willing to do the big problematic things it would take to make that happen, each for their own political reasons. I don't think there's a good answer for those people.

			* 🟦 **[major-major_major](https://www.reddit.com/user/major-major_major)** ⬆️ 6 _(2024-03-02 18:56:38)_

				Trump has always benefited from people's willingness to imagine that he's going to do what they want. 
				
				
				If you're right, and there are substantial numbers of people who are willing to imagine that Trump will be no worse, and possibly better, on this issue, then I don't see any way for Dems to hold Michigan. Which is extremely depressing

			It would be more worrying if the organized movement had been like 15-20%. Without an organized movement 11% of MI voted uncommitted in 2012, so 13.5% isn’t so scary. 
			
			Biden should still get his awful un ambassador to stop vetoing all attempts at accountability and start changing policy towards Israel, but the uncommitted vote wasn’t about his age. It was about policy. 
			
			My dream is that he just finds himself a tall handsome white male running mate. That would solve a lot of the age handwringing. And black folks &amp; women just want to win. As long as Kamala isn’t humiliated, we’ll be alright.

					I’m in WA state also voting uncommitted and I hope people will continue to do so. But the numbers out of MI are not terribly higher than the last time an incumbent ran without a strong challenger. 
					
					Which isn’t really Biden’s fault. No one excommunicated Phillips from the party for running.  ( though offering to be Haley’s unity ticket VP should)

			Fair question, I hadn’t thought about that in depth. I hereby change the flag color to solid yellow, but I’d need more than one primary to go orange. Also, showing my cards, I would take a long time and/or a major crisis to get to red because I think a brokered convention would divide the fuck out of the party base, and there’s no strong alternative candidate waiting in the wings. Biden looking less and less like a strong candidate doesn’t necessarily make replacing him a good idea.

	If mixing up names of two things I am deeply involved in and talking about daily is a sign of dementia, I have dementia at the ripe old age of 28. This happens all the time for younger people and nobody bats an eye because everyone knows it happens. 

	Everybody understood what he meant just like they did when he said Mexico instead of Egypt. This is stupid. We are being force fed a diet of people pouring over Biden’s every word trying to find an instance of a guy with a stutter tripping up. Is this just going to be politics coverage from now until Election Day? No actual critiques of what he is materially doing, just armchair physicians diagnosing Biden because he has one mix up in speeches where he gets deep into policy for 30 minutes. 

	This is exhausting and idiotic. Political media is desperate to make this another “but Hilary’s emails!” because they have a pathological need to do horse race coverage.

			There is a baseline concern about age from voters, but it’s clearly tempered by a whole host of other factors. We had *plenty* of young options in the 2020 primary. The last two people standing were Biden and a guy even older than him who had recently had a heart attack on the campaign trail. The opposition will be a guy just slightly younger than Biden. I just don’t buy that age is the number one issue of Biden’s campaign and I think voters come home in November.  I don’t think polling is equipped to handle people’s complex feelings on the issue.
			
			I think the media plays a role in making this a self fulfilling prophecy. We had the entire NYT Opinion section talking about Biden being an old guy and wall to wall coverage on cable news. This creates a feedback loop where people read about how people are concerned about his age, which makes them concerned, which makes the media report on  people being concerned. Again - the HRC emails playbook.

						A couple of potential problems with that theory, although I hope you're right about it being a viable strategy for Biden:
						
						-Media tends to respond that kind of pressure by retreating from substantive coverage to horserace/gamesmanship, 'he said / she said'. That doesn't help Biden, the surface-level campaigning is where his greatest weakness lies (as opposed to his largely impressive domestic policy achievements).
						
						-Right wing critiques of the media feed into their personal and professional insecurities (out of touch, elitist) while left wing critiques drive a sense of righteousness and defensiveness.
						
						-Republicans have the advantage of having a voting base who largely doesn't care what the NYT says about their candidate. That's not true of the Democrats.

					Two points - one, I am concerned, but not enough to make me replace Biden via a smoke filled room at the convention. I am 100 percent convinced that any candidate would receive the same treatment, just swap in age for Gavin and Panera Bread, or whatever. The media has to make it a horse race even when it is clear that one candidate is vastly unqualified for the Presidency. 
					
					Two, I actually don’t think Biden’s age is as damaging as HRC’s emails and I don’t think he has the baggage HRC does. For all I complain about the emails, I do think it was at least moderately newsworthy, and HRC had 30 years of being painted as a supervillain which Biden has not had. Biden is also a man - as a side bar, I think Gretchen and Kamala would lose because being a woman is still an anchor around your neck for the Presidential race. I just don’t think age is an incredibly effective attack when the majority of voters are 50+. 
					
					An anecdote: I saw a TikTok of Biden talking about the death of his wife &amp; daughter. It was touching and emotional. To my surprise, the comment section was full of people saying, “I disagree with him on everything but he is a good person.” You simply didn’t have that with HRC in 2016.

						Yeah, TikTok has been a great idea and I hope he does more of it. 
						
						I hope you’re right about age not being as bad as emails 2.0. The fact that there had been a decades long industry of hating the Clintons that many people had already spent an entire career getting rich from was definitely a factor. 
						
						Like, I’m trying to be optimistic about this. It seems like the campaign’s strategy (eg TikTok) is to try to address it rather than to pretend not to see it, which is reassuring. I’d be even more alarmed if they were just ignoring it wholesale. Currently, I’m cautiously optimistic they’ll be successful.

					Yeah, there is a huge confusion of the descriptive for the normative here. I actually LIKE Biden! Don’t like him on Israel or immigration, but on balance I like him a lot, and I think other people should too. But the question is whether they DO. And increasingly they don’t, whether because of the age thing or because he’s getting rolled by Netanyahu. Whether you think that’s legitimate is just irrelevant. The question is whether he can win given the electorate as it is, not as you think it should be.

					You’ll get it with Whitmer and Newsom and you’ll suuuuuuuure as shit get it with Harris- they’ll talk about the French Laundry until they’re blue in the face and then Oh wow! Lookie here!

			I have seen absolutely nothing to suggest that his age has any serious salience with voters. Have you? How many people who would otherwise vote for Biden based on his record and general demeanor are not going to vote for him strictly due to his age? 
			
			That’s the only question that matters and while shitloads of people pretend to know (and claim it’s must be very high) I’ve seen nothing that actually confirms that. 
			
			A majority of Dem voters think Biden is too old… and then they go out and vote for him at clips of 80-95% in every state in the primary anyway. 
			
			If people are really saying “Biden’s too old in a vacuum and shouldn’t be president in a vacuum … but I won’t actually vote for someone else if I think they kinda suck” then it doesn’t mean anything

				The point is comparing Biden now to how he used to be, and the difference is not trivial. 
				
				He was always known for a certain kind of gaffe, like the Bushisms of GWB. People understood those gaffes and Bushisms were about individual differences and personal qualities and not signs of cognitive decline. 
				
				This is different. Biden didn’t used to make these errors, now he makes them routinely. The argument that sometimes other people make them too isn’t convincing because Biden has been in the public eye his entire life and he didn’t use to do this, at least not nearly as frequently. How you think I would act on camera is irrelevant since we have a long record of how Biden acts on camera and we can see for ourselves how he has changed. 
				
				Add it to the other obvious signs of aging and people will be and are concerned. You’re not going to convince hardly anyone by trying to assert that Biden hasn’t changed or that this is normal for people who aren’t elderly.

					I want to be clear - I would take the former over a guy like Obama, who was well spoken but got nothing done, any day.

They’ll read the vibe and act on it without facts.

	OP, forget it. The majority of responses to EK’s essay have both missed where he is coming from (Biden is a great president but an extremely weak general election candidate, which may be what matters most rn), and refused to engage with his proposal (lower name recognition candidates still have time to make their case and grow in nationwide popularity, IF Biden bows down in an orderly fashion and not too late). 

	You’ll hear over and over arguments that miss the point:

	- “Biden is a great president so he will be re-elected” -> favorability polls tend to say that the country doesn’t agree he is a great president. It’s a shame but it’s a fact as of March 2024. The campaign HAS to change that, and it’s a tough challenge. 

	- “If another candidate could beat Biden they would have seized their chance” or its reformulation “If Biden is so weak and another Dem think they can more easily beat Trump, why is no one running against Biden?” -> If Biden doesn’t bow down, going against him amounts to rebelling against the party and mounting an insurgent campaign, at the risk of fracturing the party. It is so not at all the same endeavor for an alternative candidate than what EK is proposing, yet tons of reactions on here miss this distinction entirely. 

	- “the convention would be undemocratic, people would not accept the candidate” -> greatly dispatched by EK in his AMA, but I’ll go even further than him: who the hell picked Biden for 2024? the 2020 South Carolina primary election voters? Wow, such democracy. Much representative. 

	- “the convention would be a mess” / “the new ticket would not gain traction” -> both of these ARE valid fears. EK is just seeing more upside with this path than downside in the path of sticking with Biden. That’s HIS opinion, you can disagree with that risk assessment without equating that with “duh EK is a moron” or “his arguments are invalid”

	But the real kicker IMO is the sheer number of folks on here who do not see a problem with attacking/dismissing anyone who voice concern over Biden’s age and pretty much demand that anyone who wants to see trump defeated just shut the hell up and toe the line. We are in March, people. And this is r/ezraklein. If we can’t debate amongst people who will overwhelmingly vote for the Dem ticket in November about what other strategies could improve our chances to not lose the country to an authoritarian regime, then I’m not sure we deserve to see this country saved.

Everyone else has just kindly been told to roll with him, and now we’re also asked to politely look away and shut up when he mixes up countries, wars, years, and heads of state. EK’s sin is to have the gall to remind us 9 months ahead of the general (i.e. 2-3 times the time it takes for any campaign in any other country) that maybe we don’t have to hitch our wagon to that horse.

Then show me the historical data suggesting any of it is plausible. 

	There exists a national infrastructure to support Biden's reelection campaign. There exists a flush war chest with $100M for that infrastructure to operate. There are only two candidates on the planet who can make use of it: Biden, and Harris. 

	 So either make the affirmative case for why Harris would be the better candidate against Trump this fall, or make the affirmative case for how literally anybody else could get a functioning national campaign up and running in time to meaningfully make an impact on election day.

	Everything you say may be perfectly true, but I’m perfectly  content to have Biden as the Democrat Party’s candidate!

* 🟩 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-03-05 20:53:02)_

	It is too late at this point.   Biden should have announced he wasn't running again at least 6 months ago to allow for a legitimate primary and I believe they would have found the Trump killer that would be a great president.   

	However, primaries are too far along so there isn't any point putting energy into thinking about it.   If Biden loses there will be finger pointing for years.

	* 🟨 **[FreeSkyFerreira](https://www.reddit.com/user/FreeSkyFerreira)** ⬆️ 6 _(2024-03-02 12:01:51)_

		It’s the fact that his speech is slower, more labored, along with more frequent and more baffling gaffes. Just watch interviews with Biden in 2016 vs. a press conference with him nowadays and the decline is quite clear.

		* 🟧 **[slightlyrabidpossum](https://www.reddit.com/user/slightlyrabidpossum)** ⬆️ 0 _(2024-03-02 12:11:37)_

			Of course he's visibly aged, I don't know who's seriously denying that. Slow or labored speech is different than mixing up words due to general mental confusion.
			
			Is there evidence that the gaffes are more frequent and baffling? Historically, Biden has made tons of nonsensical comments.

			* 🟦 **[FreeSkyFerreira](https://www.reddit.com/user/FreeSkyFerreira)** ⬆️ 4 _(2024-03-02 12:28:20)_

				Yes, he’s making enough gaffes that aides are withholding Biden from the public. He’s done less interviews than any modern president. I have serious doubts about whether he can do what’s necessary for his re-election campaign.

				* 🟪 **[slightlyrabidpossum](https://www.reddit.com/user/slightlyrabidpossum)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-03-02 18:59:28)_

					I have doubts about that, too. I'm just far more concerned about his ability to project power and vitality than I am about any word mix-ups.
					
					Those aren't new for him, but many of the ways that he's visibly slowed are. I haven't heard any reports that would make me worry about his decision-making capabilities in office, but the race is a show. 
					
					Even with the gaffe risks, they need to have Biden out much more than they do. Being this cautious just furthers the perception that he isn't capable of running against Trump. I genuinely don't understand his PR.

		Yes, but trump gets graded on a different curve by the electorate. He's always sounded demented, so people ignore his deterioration.

		* 🟧 **[squidinink](https://www.reddit.com/user/squidinink)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-03-04 16:42:06)_

			Yes, he absolutely does. As the article I reference says, Trump's brain is malfunctioning in a way that makes him hyper energetic, and because of that, he's assumed to be more capable than Biden. The fact that the media NEVER mentions or discusses this is infuriating to no end.

* 🟩 **[Pretty-Scientist-807](https://www.reddit.com/user/Pretty-Scientist-807)** ⬆️ 0 _(2024-03-02 14:08:03)_

	It’s not up to us to offer up falsification for your question. The reality is that primary season is well underway and there is not a single credible Democratic alternative to Biden. 

	The only question is Biden or Trump. There isn’t a credible alternative to either whether we like it or not.

	It's not that I think Biden is an amazing candidate - it's that I'm very skeptical that an attempt to transition out of the Biden candidacy leads to significantly better odds of preventing a second Trump term.

	This isn't a situation like with the Republicans, where there's a clear first choice alternate with excellent general election polling. If there was an equivalent to Haley on the Dem side I'd be all for Biden stepping aside. But the obvious candidates have polling just as bad as Biden's, and the options with a smaller national profile are unlikely to want to push their chips in for a Hail Mary in 2024 as opposed to 2028.

	If someone sees an alternate path I'm missing I'm all ears. But I think unfortunately sticking with Biden is the best of a set of bad options.

* 🟩 **[Salmon3000](https://www.reddit.com/user/Salmon3000)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-03-02 15:29:59)_

	The best possible candidate is a Joe Biden who stops Bibi from slaughtering more Palestinians. 

	Sadly, that's not gonna happen. Biden is an unpopular incumbent and he's likely to loose. The only hope we have is that Trump is on the other side and might be able to help Biden a bit.

	Go ahead, say falsification conditions one more time…
