## You need to create an educational simulation. What are the most popular tools to use?

Powered by AI and the LinkedIn community

Educational simulations are interactive and immersive learning experiences that mimic real-world scenarios or phenomena. They can help learners develop skills, knowledge, and attitudes that are difficult to acquire through traditional methods. But how do you create an educational simulation that is engaging, effective, and accessible? In this article, you will learn about some of the most popular tools to use for creating educational simulations, and what factors to consider when choosing them.

-   Unity is one of the most popular simulation development platforms that can be used to create immersive educational simulations. Simulations are used for learning, healing, therapies, & and coaching. It supports 2D, 3D, Augmented Reality, and Virtual reality simulations, making it diverse for various educational purposes. Unreal Engine is another one. With the Cospaces Edu platform users can create interactive 3D simulations and VR experiences and that too without the need for coding. Popular among educators for creating immersive learning environments. Simulink is a graphical programming environment for modeling, and analyzing multidomain dynamical systems, commonly used in engineering and science education for system-level simulations.

-   The education landscape is brimming with innovative tools, each promising to enhance learning. However, choosing the right one can feel like navigating a labyrinth. The key lies in aligning the tool with your specific pedagogical approach and the needs of your learners. While a flashy simulation might be tempting, its true value hinges on seamless integration into your teaching methods. Remember, the most effective tool is the one that empowers you to guide your learners on a journey of discovery, not replace your expertise.
    
-   Educational simulation is a prime example of seamlessly integrating technology in education. As an educator focused mostly on STEM, I find tools like CoSpaces and Assemblr Edu for simulations involving the use of Mixed Reality; TinkerCAD and MATLAB for design simulations; PencilCode and Thunkable for code based simulations. The list grows with new tools getting added everyday and more exposure to the tech landscape for educators.
    
-   Let's focus on creating compact groups among students. I propose four techniques, each with its advantages and disadvantages. 1. "Team building" simulations encourage student collaboration and communication to achieve a common goal. 2. "Decision-making" simulations: they serve to develop critical thinking and the ability to make decisions in complex situations. 3. "Negotiation" simulations: negotiation and persuasive communication skills are developed. 4. Role-playing simulations: they enhance empathy and understanding of different perspectives.

    Thank you for inviting me to participate in this forum. First, studies on educational technology are integrated research between the theories of education and digital technology, or computer sciences. It is necessary for educators and researchers to adapt the theories based on education, such as student-centred learning, self-esteem, the 4 C skills (communication, critical thinking, collaboration, and creativity), and the outcome of student performance or learning effectiveness. Technological innovations in education are based on the TAM model (perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness of AI and devices). Student satisfaction could be considered the mediator. Teachers need to use technological innovations in classes based on research.
    
-   The list of tech tools is growing at a rapid pace, while the fundamentals to integrate the simulation/tech stay the same; -identify the capability of the tool -establish its relevance to the concept taught -ascertain the learning curve required -chalk out a comprehensive activity.
    

-   One of the emerging trends in using simulation as a learning way is not giving the right or wrong answers. As in real life, there are no black-and-white options, so the learner is given a set of choices, and then their choice will impact the further scenario. The desired result should however be known to them, to achieve it they can make any choice but they have to bear the consequences in mind. In most cases, the learner is put in real-life scenarios, like on the job, on the call, or in the meeting scenarios. This is a very helpful and emerging learning methodology.
    
-   Realistic Scenarios: Create scenarios that mimic real-world situations. Engagement: Keep learners engaged through interactivity and challenges. Feedback: Provide immediate and constructive feedback. Adaptability: Allow for multiple paths and outcomes based on learners' choices. Progress Tracking: Implement mechanisms to track learner progress. Accessibility: Ensure the simulation is accessible to all learners. Collaboration: Incorporate collaborative elements for group learning.
    

-   Simulations example tools such as Articulate Rise 360, iSpring Suite, or Adobe Captivate are suitable for basic simulations like branching scenarios or game-like experiences. I like H5P interactive video feature, I usually use it for language classes. It is a powerful tool for creating interactive video-based simulations with scenarios, questions, and feedback.
    
-   PhET Interactive Simulations offers a wide range of science and math simulations, from quantum phenomena to algebra basics, suitable for different grade levels. Another example is SimCity, which can be used in urban planning and environmental science classes to simulate city management and its impact on the environment.
    

-   Business simulation game is useful in the disciplines of commerce and business administration. Such games simulate real-world business scenarios, allowing students to make decisions as if they were running their own company. Students can experiment with different strategies, analyze market trends, manage finances, and make strategic decisions, all within a safe and controlled environment. This immersive experience helps students develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making skills while gaining a deeper understanding of business concepts and practices.
    
-   Cost: Evaluate the budget for developing and maintaining the simulation. Technology Updates: Ensure the simulation remains compatible with evolving technology. Feedback and Iteration: Collect feedback from learners and educators to improve the simulation. Integration: Consider how the simulation will be integrated into the larger educational program. Assessment: Develop clear assessment criteria aligned with learning objectives. Content Relevance: Keep the simulation's content up-to-date and relevant to educational goals.
    
-   You don't always need fancy tech to make a useful simulation. Look for simple solutions that may not be as beautiful as the pricey toys. A lot of universities have great student-built resources ready to use for the public, so take the time to look around before you go for the big names.
