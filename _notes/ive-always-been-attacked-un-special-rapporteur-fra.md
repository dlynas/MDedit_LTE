"It's been a difficult time. I've always been attacked since the very beginning of my mandate.
I don't say that it's been a pleasant journey, but I can tell you, it's much more, I mean,
most of the pain comes from where I have to observe and monitor and investigate day by day.
I do receive threats, nothing that so far I have considered needing extra precautions.
Pressure, yes, and it doesn't change. Either my commitment or the results of my work, I think."
