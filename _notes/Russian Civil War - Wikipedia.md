The **Russian Civil War**<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-9">[a]</a></sup> was a multi-party [civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war "Civil war") in the former [Russian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire "Russian Empire") sparked by the overthrowing of the social-democratic [Russian Provisional Government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Provisional_Government "Russian Provisional Government") in the [October Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_Revolution "October Revolution"), as many factions vied to determine Russia's political future. It resulted in the formation of the [Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic "Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic") and later the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") in most of its territory. Its finale marked the end of the [Russian Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution "Russian Revolution"), which was one of the [key events of the 20th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_events_of_the_20th_century "Key events of the 20th century").

The [Russian monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Russian_monarchs "List of Russian monarchs") ended with the abdication of Tsar [Nicholas II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_II "Nicholas II") during the [February Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_Revolution "February Revolution"), and Russia was in a state of political flux. A tense summer culminated in the [October Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_Revolution "October Revolution"), where the [Bolsheviks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsheviks "Bolsheviks") overthrew the [provisional government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Provisional_Government "Russian Provisional Government") of the new [Russian Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Republic "Russian Republic"). Bolshevik seizure of power was not universally accepted, and the country descended into civil war. The two largest combatants were the [Red Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army "Red Army"), fighting for the establishment of a [Bolshevik-led](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union "Communist Party of the Soviet Union") [socialist state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_state "Socialist state") headed by [Vladimir Lenin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin "Vladimir Lenin"), and the loosely allied forces known as the [White Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_movement "White movement"), which functioned as a political [big tent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_tent "Big tent") for [right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics "Right-wing politics")\- and [left-wing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics "Left-wing politics") opposition to Bolshevik rule. In addition, rival militant socialists, notably the [Ukrainian anarchists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism_in_Ukraine "Anarchism in Ukraine") of the [Makhnovshchina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makhnovshchina "Makhnovshchina") and [Left Socialist-Revolutionaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_Socialist-Revolutionaries "Left Socialist-Revolutionaries"), were involved in conflict against the Bolsheviks. They, as well as non-ideological [green armies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_armies "Green armies"), opposed the Bolsheviks, the Whites and the foreign interventionists.<sup id="cite_ref-britannica_10-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-britannica-10">[9]</a></sup> Thirteen foreign nations intervened against the Red Army, notably the [Allied intervention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_intervention_in_the_Russian_Civil_War "Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War"), whose primary goal was re-establishing the [Eastern Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_I) "Eastern Front (World War I)") of [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I"). Three foreign nations of the [Central Powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Powers "Central Powers") also intervened, rivaling the Allied intervention with the main goal of retaining the territory they had received in the [Treaty of Brest-Litovsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Brest-Litovsk "Treaty of Brest-Litovsk") with Soviet Russia.

The Bolsheviks initially consolidated control over most of the former empire. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was an emergency peace with the [German Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Empire "German Empire"), who had captured vast swathes of the Russian territory during the chaos of the revolution. In May 1918, [the Czechoslovak Legion in Russia revolted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolt_of_the_Czechoslovak_Legion "Revolt of the Czechoslovak Legion") in Siberia. In reaction, the Allies began their [North Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Russia_intervention "North Russia intervention") and [Siberian interventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberian_intervention "Siberian intervention"). That, combined with the creation of the [Provisional All-Russian Government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_All-Russian_Government "Provisional All-Russian Government"), saw the reduction of Bolshevik-controlled territory to most of [European Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Russia "European Russia") and parts of [Central Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia "Central Asia").

## Background\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russian_Civil_War&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Background")\]

### World War I\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russian_Civil_War&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: World War I")\]

The Russian Empire fought in World War I from 1914 alongside France and the United Kingdom ([Triple Entente](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Entente "Triple Entente")) against Germany, Austria-Hungary and Ottoman Empire ([Central Powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Powers "Central Powers")).

### February Revolution\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russian_Civil_War&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: February Revolution")\]

The February Revolution of 1917 resulted in the abdication of Emperor [Nicholas II of Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_II_of_Russia "Nicholas II of Russia"). As a result, the social-democratic [Russian Provisional Government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Provisional_Government "Russian Provisional Government") was established, and [soviets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_(council) "Soviet (council)"), elected councils of workers, soldiers, and peasants, were organized throughout the country, leading to a situation of [dual power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_power "Dual power"). The [Russian Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Republic "Russian Republic") was proclaimed in September of the same year.

### October Revolution\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russian_Civil_War&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: October Revolution")\]

The Provisional Government, led by [Socialist Revolutionary Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Revolutionary_Party "Socialist Revolutionary Party") politician [Alexander Kerensky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Kerensky "Alexander Kerensky"), was unable to solve the most pressing issues of the country, most importantly to end the war with the Central Powers. A [failed military coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kornilov_affair "Kornilov affair") by General [Lavr Kornilov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavr_Kornilov "Lavr Kornilov") in September 1917 led to a surge in support for the [Bolsheviks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsheviks "Bolsheviks"), who [took control of the soviets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolshevization_of_the_Soviets "Bolshevization of the Soviets"), which until then had been controlled by the Socialist Revolutionaries. Promising an end to the war and "all power to the Soviets", the Bolsheviks then ended dual power by overthrowing the Provisional Government in late October, on the eve of the [Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_All-Russian_Congress_of_Soviets_of_Workers%27_and_Soldiers%27_Deputies "Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies"), in what would be the second Revolution of 1917. Despite the Bolsheviks' seizure of power, they lost to the Socialist Revolutionary Party in the [1917 Russian Constituent Assembly election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1917_Russian_Constituent_Assembly_election "1917 Russian Constituent Assembly election"), and the Constituent Assembly was dissolved by the Bolsheviks in retaliation. The Bolsheviks soon lost the support of other far-left allies, such as the [Left Socialist-Revolutionaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_Socialist-Revolutionaries "Left Socialist-Revolutionaries"), after their acceptance of the terms of the [Treaty of Brest-Litovsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Brest-Litovsk "Treaty of Brest-Litovsk") presented by the German Empire.<sup id="cite_ref-Stone-2011_17-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-Stone-2011-17">[16]</a></sup> Conversely, a number of prominent members of the [Left Socialist Revolutionaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_Socialist_Revolutionaries "Left Socialist Revolutionaries") had assumed positions in Lenin's government and lead commissariats in several areas. This included agriculture ([Kolegaev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Kolegayev "Andrei Kolegayev")), property ([Karelin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Karelin "Vladimir Karelin")), justice ([Steinberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Steinberg "Isaac Steinberg")), post offices and telegraphs ([Proshian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosh_Proshian "Prosh Proshian")) and local government (Trutovsky).<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-18">[17]</a></sup> The Bolsheviks also reserved a number of vacant seats in the Soviets and [Central Executive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Russian_Central_Executive_Committee "All-Russian Central Executive Committee") for the [Menshevik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menshevik "Menshevik") and [Left Socialist Revolutionaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_Socialist_Revolutionaries "Left Socialist Revolutionaries") parties in proportion to their vote share at the Congress.<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-19">[18]</a></sup> The dissolution of the Constituent Assembly was also approved by the Left Socialist Revolutionaries and [anarchists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchists "Anarchists"), both groups were in favour of a more [radical democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_democracy "Radical democracy").<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-20">[19]</a></sup>

### Formation of the Red Army\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russian_Civil_War&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Formation of the Red Army")\]

From mid-1917 onwards, the [Russian Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Army_(1917) "Russian Army (1917)"), the successor-organisation of the old [Imperial Russian Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Russian_Army "Imperial Russian Army"), started to disintegrate;<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-21">[20]</a></sup> the Bolsheviks used the volunteer-based [Red Guards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Guards_(Russia) "Red Guards (Russia)") as their main military force, augmented by an armed military component of the [Cheka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheka "Cheka") (the Bolshevik state [secret police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_Soviet_secret_police_agencies "Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies")). In January 1918, after significant Bolshevik reverses in combat, the future [Russian People's Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Commissar_of_Military_and_Naval_Affairs_of_the_Russian_SFSR "People's Commissar of Military and Naval Affairs of the Russian SFSR") [Leon Trotsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Trotsky "Leon Trotsky") headed the reorganization of the Red Guards into a _Workers' and Peasants' Red Army_ in order to create a more effective fighting force. The Bolsheviks appointed [political commissars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_commissars "Political commissars") to each unit of the Red Army to maintain morale and to ensure loyalty.

In June 1918, when it had become apparent that a revolutionary army composed solely of workers would not suffice, Trotsky instituted mandatory [conscription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_the_Soviet_Union "Conscription in the Soviet Union") of the rural peasantry into the Red Army.<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-22">[21]</a></sup> The Bolsheviks overcame opposition of rural Russians to Red Army conscription units by taking hostages and shooting them when necessary in order to force compliance.<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-23">[22]</a></sup> The forced conscription drive had mixed results, successfully creating a larger army than the Whites, but with members indifferent towards [communist ideology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism "Communism").<sup id="cite_ref-Stone-2011_17-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-Stone-2011-17">[16]</a></sup>

The Red Army also utilized former Tsarist officers as "military specialists" (_voenspetsy_);<sup id="cite_ref-Overy_2004_24-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-Overy_2004-24">[23]</a></sup> sometimes their families were taken hostage in order to ensure their loyalty.<sup id="cite_ref-Williams,_Beryl_1921_25-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-Williams,_Beryl_1921-25">[24]</a></sup> At the start of the civil war, former Tsarist officers formed three-quarters of the Red Army officer-corps.<sup id="cite_ref-Williams,_Beryl_1921_25-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-Williams,_Beryl_1921-25">[24]</a></sup> By its end, 83% of all Red Army divisional and corps commanders were ex-Tsarist soldiers.<sup id="cite_ref-Overy_2004_24-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-Overy_2004-24">[23]</a></sup>

The movement's military arm was the [White Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Army "White Army") (Бѣлая армія / Белая армия, _Belaya armiya_), also known as the White Guard (Бѣлая гвардія / Белая гвардия, _Belaya gvardiya_) or White Guardsmen (Бѣлогвардейцы / Белогвардейцы, _Belogvardeytsi_).

When the White Army was created, the structure of the [Russian Army of the Provisional Government period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Army_(1917) "Russian Army (1917)") was used, while almost every individual formation had its own characteristics. The military art of the White Army was based on the experience of World War I, which, however, left a strong imprint on the specifics of the Civil War.<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-27">[25]</a></sup>

During the Russian Civil War, the White movement functioned as a [big tent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_tent "Big tent") political movement representing an array of political opinions in Russia united in their opposition to the Bolsheviks—from the republican-minded liberals and Kerenskyite social-democrats on the left through monarchists and supporters of a united multinational Russia to the ultra-nationalist [Black Hundreds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hundreds "Black Hundreds") on the right.

#### Dissolution of the Constituent Assembly, early Constituent Assembly rebellions\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russian_Civil_War&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Dissolution of the Constituent Assembly, early Constituent Assembly rebellions")\]

The [Russian Constituent Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Constituent_Assembly "Russian Constituent Assembly") had been a demand of the Bolsheviks against the Provisional Government, which kept delaying it. After the October Revolution the elections were run by the body appointed by the previous Provisional Government. It was based on universal suffrage but used party lists from before the Left-Right SR split. The anti-Bolshevik Right SRs [won the elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1917_Russian_Constituent_Assembly_election "1917 Russian Constituent Assembly election") with the majority of the seats,<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTECarr1985111–112_28-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTECarr1985111%E2%80%93112-28">[26]</a></sup> after which Lenin's _Theses on the Constituent Assembly_ argued in _[Pravda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pravda "Pravda")_ that formal democracy was impossible because of class conflicts, conflicts with Ukraine and the Kadet-Kaledin uprising. He argued the Constituent Assembly must unconditionally accept sovereignty of the soviet government or it would be dealt with "by revolutionary means".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTECarr1985113–115_29-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTECarr1985113%E2%80%93115-29">[27]</a></sup>

They decided to start an uprising against the Bolsheviks with the goal of reconvening the Russian Constituent Assembly.<sup id="cite_ref-WS_36-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-WS-36">[34]</a></sup> While preparations were under way, the [Czechoslovak Legions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovak_Legion "Czechoslovak Legion") overthrew Bolshevik rule in [Siberia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia "Siberia"), the [Urals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ural_Mountains "Ural Mountains") and the [Volga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volga_River "Volga River") region in late May-early June 1918 and the center of SR activity shifted there. On June 8, 1918, five Constituent Assembly members formed the All-Russian [Committee of Members of the Constituent Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_of_Members_of_the_Constituent_Assembly "Committee of Members of the Constituent Assembly") (_Komuch_) in [Samara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samara "Samara") and declared it the new supreme authority in the country.<sup id="cite_ref-komuch_39-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-komuch-39">[37]</a></sup> The Social Revolutionary [Provisional Government of Autonomous Siberia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Siberian_Government_(Vladivostok) "Provisional Siberian Government (Vladivostok)") came to power on 29 June 1918, after the uprising in [Vladivostok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladivostok "Vladivostok").

#### Exclusion of Mensheviks and SRs\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russian_Civil_War&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Exclusion of Mensheviks and SRs")\]

At the [5th All-Russia Congress of Soviets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5th_All-Russia_Congress_of_Soviets "5th All-Russia Congress of Soviets") of July 4, 1918, the [Left Socialist-Revolutionaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_Socialist-Revolutionaries "Left Socialist-Revolutionaries") had 352 delegates compared to 745 Bolsheviks out of 1132 total. The Left SRs raised disagreements on the suppression of rival parties, the death penalty, and mainly, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. The Bolsheviks excluded the Right SRs and Mensheviks from the government on 14 June for associating with counterrevolutionaries and seeking to "organize armed attacks against the workers and peasants" (though Mensheviks had not supported them), while the Left SRs advocated forming a government of all socialist parties. The Left SRs agreed with extrajudicial execution of political opponents to stop the counterrevolution, but opposed having the government legally pronouncing death sentences, an unusual position that is best understood within the context of the group's terrorist past. The Left SRs strongly opposed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and opposed Trotsky's insistence that no one try to attack German troops in Ukraine.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTECarr1985161–164_40-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTECarr1985161%E2%80%93164-40">[38]</a></sup>

According to historian [Marcel Liebman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Liebman "Marcel Liebman"), Lenin's wartime measures such as banning opposition parties was prompted by the fact that several political parties either [took up arms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_uprisings_against_the_Bolsheviks "Left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks") against the new [Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic "Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic"), or participated in sabotage, collaboration with the deposed Tsarists, or made [assassination attempts against Lenin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_attempts_on_Vladimir_Lenin "Assassination attempts on Vladimir Lenin") and other Bolshevik leaders.<sup id="cite_ref-Leninism_Under_Lenin_41-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-Leninism_Under_Lenin-41">[39]</a></sup> Liebman noted that opposition parties such as the Cadets and [Mensheviks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mensheviks "Mensheviks") who were democratically elected to the Soviets in some areas, then proceeded to use their mandate to welcome in Tsarist and [foreign capitalist military forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_intervention_in_the_Russian_Civil_War "Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War").<sup id="cite_ref-Leninism_Under_Lenin_41-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-Leninism_Under_Lenin-41">[39]</a></sup> [In one incident in Baku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/26_Baku_Commissars "26 Baku Commissars"), the British military, once invited in, proceeded to execute members of the Bolshevik Party who had peacefully stood down from the Soviet when they failed to win the elections. As a result, the Bolsheviks banned each opposition party when it turned against the Soviet government. In some cases, bans were lifted. This banning of parties did not have the same repressive character as later bans enforced under the [Stalinist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalinist "Stalinist") regime.<sup id="cite_ref-Leninism_Under_Lenin_41-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-Leninism_Under_Lenin-41">[39]</a></sup>

#### Repression\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russian_Civil_War&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Repression")\]

In December 1917, [Felix Dzerzhinsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Dzerzhinsky "Felix Dzerzhinsky") was appointed to the duty of rooting out [counter-revolutionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-revolutionary "Counter-revolutionary") threats to the [Soviet government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_Soviet_Union "Government of the Soviet Union"). He was the director of the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission (aka [Cheka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheka "Cheka")), a predecessor of the KGB that served as the [secret police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_police "Secret police") for the Soviets.<sup id="cite_ref-Bird-2018_42-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-Bird-2018-42">[40]</a></sup>

From early 1918, the Bolsheviks started physical elimination of opposition, other socialist and revolutionary fractions. [Anarchists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism "Anarchism") were among the first:

> Of all the revolutionary elements in Russia it is the Anarchists who now suffer the most ruthless and systematic persecution. Their suppression by the Bolsheviki began already in 1918, when — in the month of April of that year — the Communist Government attacked, without provocation or warning, the Anarchist Club of Moscow and by the use of machine guns and artillery "liquidated" the whole organisation. It was the beginning of Anarchist hounding, but it was sporadic in character, breaking out now and then, quite planless, and frequently self-contradictory.

On 11 August 1918, prior to the events that would officially catalyze the [Red Terror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Terror "Red Terror"), [Vladimir Lenin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin "Vladimir Lenin") had [sent telegrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenin%27s_Hanging_Order "Lenin's Hanging Order") "to introduce mass terror" in [Nizhny Novgorod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nizhny_Novgorod "Nizhny Novgorod") in response to a suspected civilian uprising there, and to "crush" landowners in [Penza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penza "Penza") who resisted, sometimes violently, the requisitioning of their grain by military detachments:<sup id="cite_ref-43"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-43">[41]</a></sup>

> Comrades! The [kulak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kulak "Kulak") uprising in your five districts must be crushed without pity ... You must make example of these people.
> 
> (1) Hang (I mean hang publicly, so that people see it) at least 100 kulaks, rich bastards, and known bloodsuckers.
> 
> (2) Publish their names.
> 
> (3) Seize all their grain.
> 
> (4) Single out the hostages per my instructions in yesterday's telegram.
> 
> Do all this so that for miles (versts) around people see it all, understand it, tremble, and tell themselves that we are killing the bloodthirsty kulaks and that we will continue to do so ...
> 
> Yours, Lenin.
> 
> P.S. Find tougher people.

In a mid-August 1920 letter, having received information that in Estonia and Latvia, with which Soviet Russia had concluded peace treaties, volunteers were being enrolled in anti-Bolshevik detachments, Lenin wrote to E. M. Sklyansky, deputy chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic:<sup id="cite_ref-litvinalkbterror_44-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-litvinalkbterror-44">[42]</a></sup>

> Great plan! Finish it with Dzerzhinsky. While pretending to be the "greens" (we will blame them later), we will advance by 10–20 miles (versts) and hang kulaks, priests, landowners. Prize: 100.000 rubles for each hanged man.

Vladimir Pchelin's depiction of the assassination attempt on Lenin

On August 30, the SR [Fanny Kaplan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanny_Kaplan "Fanny Kaplan") unsuccessfully [attempted to assassinate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_attempts_on_Vladimir_Lenin "Assassination attempts on Vladimir Lenin") Lenin,<sup id="cite_ref-:11_46-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-:11-46">[44]</a></sup> who sought to eliminate political dissent, opposition, and any other threat to Bolshevik power.<sup id="cite_ref-47"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-47">[45]</a></sup> As a result of the failed attempt on Lenin's life, he began to crack down on his political enemies in an event known as the [Red Terror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Terror "Red Terror"). More broadly, the term is usually applied to Bolshevik political repression throughout the Civil War (1917–1922),<sup id="cite_ref-48"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-48">[46]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-49"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-49">[47]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Bird-2018_42-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-Bird-2018-42">[40]</a></sup>

During interrogation by the [Cheka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheka "Cheka"), she made the following statement:

> My name is Fanya Kaplan. Today I shot Lenin. I did it on my own. I will not say from whom I obtained my revolver. I will give no details. I had resolved to kill Lenin long ago. I consider him a traitor to the Revolution. I was exiled to Akatui for participating in an assassination attempt against a Tsarist official in Kiev. I spent 11 years at hard labour. After the Revolution, I was freed. I favoured the [Constituent Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Constituent_Assembly "Russian Constituent Assembly") and am still for it.<sup id="cite_ref-spartacus_50-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-spartacus-50">[48]</a></sup>

Kaplan referenced the Bolsheviks' growing authoritarianism, citing their forcible shutdown of the Constituent Assembly in January 1918, the [elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1917_Russian_Constituent_Assembly_election "1917 Russian Constituent Assembly election") to which they had lost. When it became clear that Kaplan would not implicate any accomplices, she was executed in [Alexander Garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Garden "Alexander Garden"). The order was carried out by the commander of the Kremlin, the former Baltic sailor P. D. Malkov and a group of Latvian Bolsheviks<sup id="cite_ref-51"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-51">[49]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This citation requires a reference to the specific page or range of pages in which the material appears.

#### Revolts against grain requisitioning\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russian_Civil_War&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Revolts against grain requisitioning")\]

Protests against grain requisitioning of the peasantry were a major component of the [Tambov Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tambov_Rebellion "Tambov Rebellion") and similar uprisings; Lenin's [New Economic Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Economic_Policy "New Economic Policy") was introduced as a concession.

The policies of "food dictatorship" proclaimed by the Bolsheviks in May 1918 sparked violent resistance in numerous districts of [European Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Russia "European Russia"): revolts and clashes between the peasants and the [Red Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army "Red Army") were reported in [Voronezh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronezh "Voronezh"), [Tambov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tambov "Tambov"), [Penza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penza "Penza"), [Saratov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratov "Saratov") and in the districts of [Kostroma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kostroma_Oblast "Kostroma Oblast"), [Moscow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Oblast "Moscow Oblast"), [Novgorod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novgorod_Oblast "Novgorod Oblast"), [Petrograd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leningrad_Oblast "Leningrad Oblast"), [Pskov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pskov_Oblast "Pskov Oblast") and [Smolensk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smolensk_Oblast "Smolensk Oblast"). The revolts were bloodily crushed by the Bolsheviks: in the Voronezh Oblast, the Red Guards killed sixteen peasants during the pacification of the village, while another village was shelled with artillery in order to force the peasants to surrender and in the Novgorod Oblast the rebelling peasants were dispersed with machine-gun fire from a train sent by a detachment of Latvian Red Army soldiers.<sup id="cite_ref-55"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-55">[53]</a></sup> While the Bolsheviks immediately denounced the rebellion as orchestrated by the SRs, there is actually no evidence that they were involved into peasant violence, which they deemed as counterproductive.<sup id="cite_ref-56"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-56">[54]</a></sup>

### Allied intervention\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russian_Civil_War&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Allied intervention")\]

The Western Allies armed and supported opponents of the Bolsheviks. They were worried about a possible Russo-German alliance, the prospect of the Bolsheviks making good on their threats to default on Imperial Russia's massive [foreign debts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_debt "External debt") and the possibility that Communist revolutionary ideas would spread (a concern shared by many Central Powers). Hence, many of the countries expressed their support for the Whites, including the provision of troops and supplies. [Winston Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill "Winston Churchill") declared that Bolshevism must be "strangled in its cradle".<sup id="cite_ref-57"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-57">[55]</a></sup> The British and French had supported [Russia during World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia_during_World_War_I "Russia during World War I") on a massive scale with war materials.

After the treaty, it looked like much of that material would fall into the hands of the Germans. To meet that danger, the [Allies intervened](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_intervention_in_the_Russian_Civil_War "Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War") with Great Britain and France sending troops into Russian ports. There were violent clashes with the Bolsheviks. Britain intervened in support of the White forces to defeat the Bolsheviks and prevent the spread of communism across Europe.<sup id="cite_ref-58"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-58">[56]</a></sup>

## Geography and chronology\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russian_Civil_War&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Geography and chronology")\]

In the European part of Russia the war was fought across three main fronts: the eastern, the southern and the northwestern. It can also be roughly split into the following periods.

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Volunteer_Army_infantry_company.jpg/220px-Volunteer_Army_infantry_company.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Volunteer_Army_infantry_company.jpg)

Anti-Bolshevik [Volunteer Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteer_Army "Volunteer Army") in South Russia, January 1918

The first period lasted from the Revolution until the Armistice, or roughly March 1917 to November 1918. Already on the date of the Revolution, [Cossack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cossack "Cossack") General [Alexey Kaledin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexey_Kaledin "Alexey Kaledin") refused to recognize it and assumed full governmental authority in the [Don](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_River,_Russia "Don River, Russia") region,<sup id="cite_ref-64"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-64">[62]</a></sup> where the [Volunteer Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteer_Army "Volunteer Army") began amassing support. The signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk also resulted in direct Allied intervention in Russia and the arming of military forces opposed to the Bolshevik government. There were also many German commanders who offered support against the Bolsheviks, fearing a confrontation with them was impending as well.

During the first period, the Bolsheviks took control of [Central Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia "Central Asia") out of the hands of the Provisional Government and White Army, setting up a base for the Communist Party in the [Steppe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Steppe "Eurasian Steppe") and [Turkestan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Turkestan "Russian Turkestan"), where nearly two million Russian settlers were located.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEWheeler1964103_65-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWheeler1964103-65">[63]</a></sup>

Most of the fighting in the first period was sporadic, involved only small groups and had a fluid and rapidly shifting strategic situation. Among the antagonists were the Czechoslovak Legion,<sup id="cite_ref-66"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-66">[64]</a></sup> the Poles of the [4th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4th_Rifle_Division_(Poland) "4th Rifle Division (Poland)") and [5th Rifle Divisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5th_Rifle_Division_(Poland) "5th Rifle Division (Poland)") and the pro-Bolshevik Red [Latvian riflemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvian_riflemen "Latvian riflemen").

The second period of the war lasted from January to November 1919. At first the White armies' advances from the south (under Denikin), the east (under Kolchak) and the northwest (under Yudenich) were successful, forcing the Red Army and its allies back on all three fronts. In July 1919 the Red Army suffered another reverse after a mass defection of units in the Crimea to the anarchist Insurgent Army under Nestor Makhno, enabling anarchist forces to consolidate power in Ukraine. Leon Trotsky soon reformed the Red Army, concluding the first of two military alliances with the anarchists. In June the Red Army first checked Kolchak's advance. After a series of engagements, assisted by an Insurgent Army offensive against White supply lines, the Red Army defeated Denikin's and Yudenich's armies in October and November.

The third period of the war was the extended siege of the last White forces in the [Crimea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea "Crimea") in 1920. General [Wrangel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyotr_Nikolayevich_Wrangel "Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel") had gathered the remnants of Denikin's armies, occupying much of the Crimea. An attempted invasion of southern Ukraine was rebuffed by the Insurgent Army under Makhno's command. Pursued into Crimea by Makhno's troops, Wrangel went over to the defensive in the Crimea. After an abortive move north against the Red Army, Wrangel's troops were forced south by Red Army and Insurgent Army forces; Wrangel and the remains of his army were evacuated to [Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul "Istanbul") in November 1920.

European theatre of the Russian Civil War

In the October Revolution, the Bolshevik Party directed the Red Guard (armed groups of workers and Imperial army deserters) to seize control of [Petrograd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrograd "Petrograd") and immediately began the armed takeover of cities and villages throughout the former Russian Empire. In January 1918 the Bolsheviks dissolved the [Russian Constituent Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Constituent_Assembly "Russian Constituent Assembly") and proclaimed the Soviets (workers' councils) as the new government of Russia.

### Initial anti-Bolshevik uprisings\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russian_Civil_War&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Initial anti-Bolshevik uprisings")\]

The first attempt to regain power from the Bolsheviks was made by the Kerensky-Krasnov uprising in October 1917. It was supported by the Junker Mutiny in Petrograd but was quickly put down by the Red Guard, notably including the Latvian Rifle Division.

The initial groups that fought against the Communists were local Cossack armies that had declared their loyalty to the Provisional Government. Kaledin of the [Don Cossacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Cossacks "Don Cossacks") and General [Grigory Semenov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigory_Mikhailovich_Semenov "Grigory Mikhailovich Semenov") of the [Siberian Cossacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberian_Cossacks "Siberian Cossacks") were prominent among them. The leading Tsarist officers of the Imperial Russian Army also started to resist. In November, General [Mikhail Alekseev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Vasilevich_Alekseev "Mikhail Vasilevich Alekseev"), the Tsar's Chief of Staff during the First World War, began to organize the Volunteer Army in [Novocherkassk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novocherkassk "Novocherkassk"). Volunteers of the small army were mostly officers of the old Russian army, military cadets and students. In December 1917, Alekseev was joined by General Lavr Kornilov, Denikin and other Tsarist officers who had escaped from the jail, where they had been imprisoned following the abortive Kornilov affair just before the Revolution.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMawdsley200727_67-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMawdsley200727-67">[65]</a></sup> On 9 December, the [Military Revolutionary Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Revolutionary_Committee "Military Revolutionary Committee") in [Rostov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rostov-on-Don "Rostov-on-Don") rebelled, with the Bolsheviks controlling the city for five days until the Alekseev Organization supported Kaledin in recapturing the city. According to [Peter Kenez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kenez "Peter Kenez"), "The operation, begun on December 9, can be regarded as the beginning of the Civil War."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKenez2004a64–67_68-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKenez2004a64%E2%80%9367-68">[66]</a></sup>

Having stated in the November 1917 "[Declaration of Rights of Nations of Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_Rights_of_Peoples_of_Russia "Declaration of Rights of Peoples of Russia")" that any nation under imperial Russian rule should be immediately given the power of self-determination, the Bolsheviks had begun to usurp the power of the Provisional Government in the territories of Central Asia soon after the establishment of the Turkestan Committee in Tashkent.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTECoatesCoates195172_69-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTECoatesCoates195172-69">[67]</a></sup> In April 1917 the Provisional Government set up the committee, which was mostly made up of former Tsarist officials.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEWheeler1964104_70-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWheeler1964104-70">[68]</a></sup> The Bolsheviks attempted to take control of the Committee in Tashkent on 12 September 1917 but it was unsuccessful, and many leaders were arrested. However, because the Committee lacked representation of the native population and poor Russian settlers, they had to release the Bolshevik prisoners almost immediately because of a public outcry, and a successful takeover of that government body took place two months later in November.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTECoatesCoates195170_71-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTECoatesCoates195170-71">[69]</a></sup> The Leagues of Mohammedam Working People (which Russian settlers and natives who had been sent to work behind the lines for the Tsarist government in 1916 formed in March 1917) had led numerous strikes in the industrial centers throughout September 1917.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTECoatesCoates195168–69_72-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTECoatesCoates195168%E2%80%9369-72">[70]</a></sup> However, after the Bolshevik destruction of the Provisional Government in [Tashkent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tashkent "Tashkent"), Muslim elites formed an autonomous government in Turkestan, commonly called the "Kokand autonomy" (or simply [Kokand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokand "Kokand")).<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTECoatesCoates195174_73-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTECoatesCoates195174-73">[71]</a></sup> The White Russians supported that government body, which lasted several months because of Bolshevik troop isolation from Moscow.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAllworth1967226_74-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAllworth1967226-74">[72]</a></sup> In January 1918 the Soviet forces, under Lt.

With the help of the [Kiev Arsenal Uprising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiev_Arsenal_January_Uprising "Kiev Arsenal January Uprising"), the Bolsheviks [captured the city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kiev_(1918) "Battle of Kiev (1918)") on 26 January.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMawdsley200735_75-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMawdsley200735-75">[73]</a></sup>

### Peace with the Central Powers\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russian_Civil_War&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Peace with the Central Powers")\]

Soviet delegation with [Trotsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Trotsky "Leon Trotsky") greeted by German officers at Brest-Litovsk, 8 January 1918

The Bolsheviks decided to immediately make peace with the Central Powers, as they had promised the Russian people before the Revolution.<sup id="cite_ref-76"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-76">[74]</a></sup> [Vladimir Lenin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin "Vladimir Lenin")'s political enemies attributed that decision to his sponsorship by the Foreign Office of [Wilhelm II, German Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_II,_German_Emperor "Wilhelm II, German Emperor"), offered to Lenin in hope that, with a revolution, Russia would withdraw from [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I"). That suspicion was bolstered by the German Foreign Ministry's sponsorship of Lenin's return to Petrograd.<sup id="cite_ref-77"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-77">[75]</a></sup> However, after the military fiasco of the summer offensive (June 1917) by the Russian Provisional Government had devastated the structure of the Russian Army, it became crucial that Lenin realize the promised peace.<sup id="cite_ref-78"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-78">[76]</a></sup> Even before the failed summer offensive the Russian population was very skeptical about the continuation of the war. Western socialists had promptly arrived from France and from the UK to convince the Russians to continue the fight, but could not change the new pacifist mood of Russia.<sup id="cite_ref-79"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-79">[77]</a></sup>

On 16 December 1917 an armistice was signed between Russia and the Central Powers in [Brest-Litovsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brest-Litovsk "Brest-Litovsk") and peace talks began.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMawdsley200742_80-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMawdsley200742-80">[78]</a></sup> As a condition for peace, the proposed treaty by the Central Powers conceded huge portions of the former Russian Empire to the German Empire and the Ottoman Empire, greatly upsetting [nationalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalist "Nationalist") and [conservatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism "Conservatism"). Leon Trotsky, representing the Bolsheviks, refused at first to sign the treaty while continuing to observe a unilateral cease-fire, following the policy of "No war, no peace".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESmithTucker2014554–555_81-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTESmithTucker2014554%E2%80%93555-81">[79]</a></sup>

Therefore, on 18 February 1918, the Germans began [Operation Faustschlag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Faustschlag "Operation Faustschlag") on the Eastern Front, encountering virtually no resistance in a campaign that lasted 11 days.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESmithTucker2014554–555_81-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTESmithTucker2014554%E2%80%93555-81">[79]</a></sup> Signing a formal peace treaty was the only option in the eyes of the Bolsheviks because the Russian Army was demobilized, and the newly formed Red Guard could not stop the advance. They also understood that the impending counter-revolutionary resistance was more dangerous than the concessions of the treaty, which Lenin viewed as temporary in the light of aspirations for a [world revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_revolution "World revolution"). The Soviets acceded to a peace treaty, and the formal agreement, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, was ratified on 3 March. The Soviets viewed the treaty as merely a necessary and expedient means to end the war.

Under Soviet pressure, the Volunteer Army embarked on the epic Ice March from [Yekaterinodar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krasnodar "Krasnodar") to [Kuban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuban "Kuban") on 22 February 1918, where they joined with the Kuban Cossacks to mount an abortive assault on Yekaterinodar.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMawdsley200729_86-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMawdsley200729-86">[84]</a></sup> The Soviets recaptured Rostov on the next day.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMawdsley200729_86-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMawdsley200729-86">[84]</a></sup> Kornilov was killed in the fighting on 13 April, and Denikin took over command.

The Baku Soviet Commune was established on 13 April. Germany landed its Caucasus Expedition troops in [Poti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poti "Poti") on 8 June. The Ottoman [Army of Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_of_Islam_(Ottoman_Empire) "Army of Islam (Ottoman Empire)") (in coalition with [Azerbaijan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan_Democratic_Republic "Azerbaijan Democratic Republic")) drove them out of Baku on 26 July 1918. Subsequently, the [Dashanaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Revolutionary_Federation "Armenian Revolutionary Federation"), Right SRs and [Mensheviks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menshevik "Menshevik") started negotiations with Gen. [Dunsterville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Dunsterville "Lionel Dunsterville"), the commander of the British troops in [Persia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persia "Persia"). The Bolsheviks and their [Left SR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_SR "Left SR") allies were opposed to it, but on 25 July the majority of the Soviets voted to call in the British and the Bolsheviks resigned. The Baku Soviet Commune ended its existence and was replaced by the Central Caspian Dictatorship.

In June 1918 the Volunteer Army, numbering some 9,000 men, started its [Second Kuban campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Kuban_campaign "Second Kuban campaign"), capturing Yekaterinodar on 16 August, followed by [Armavir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armavir,_Russia "Armavir, Russia") and [Stavropol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stavropol "Stavropol"). By early 1919, they controlled the [Northern Caucasus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Caucasus "Northern Caucasus").<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKenez2004a166–174,_182,_189–190_88-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKenez2004a166%E2%80%93174,_182,_189%E2%80%93190-88">[86]</a></sup>

On 8 October, Alekseev died. On 8 January 1919, Denikin became the Supreme Commander of the [Armed Forces of South Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_South_Russia "Armed Forces of South Russia"), uniting the Volunteer Army with [Pyotr Krasnov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyotr_Krasnov "Pyotr Krasnov")'s [Don Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Army "Don Army"). [Pyotr Wrangel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyotr_Wrangel "Pyotr Wrangel") became Denikin's Chief of Staff.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKenez2004a195,_204,_267–270_89-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKenez2004a195,_204,_267%E2%80%93270-89">[87]</a></sup>

### Eastern Russia, Siberia and the Far East (1918)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russian_Civil_War&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Eastern Russia, Siberia and the Far East (1918)")\]

The revolt of the Czechoslovak Legion broke out in May 1918, and proceeded to occupy the [Trans-Siberian Railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Siberian_Railway "Trans-Siberian Railway") from [Ufa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ufa "Ufa") to [Vladivostok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladivostok "Vladivostok"). Uprisings overthrew other Bolshevik towns. On 7 July, the western portion of the legion declared itself to be a new eastern front, anticipating allied intervention. According to [William Henry Chamberlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Henry_Chamberlin "William Henry Chamberlin"), "Two governments emerged as a result of the first successes of the Czechs: the [West Siberian Commissariat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Siberian_Government_(Omsk) "Provisional Siberian Government (Omsk)") and the Government of the [Committee of Members of the Constituent Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_of_Members_of_the_Constituent_Assembly "Committee of Members of the Constituent Assembly") in Samara." On 17 July, shortly before the fall of [Yekaterinburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yekaterinburg "Yekaterinburg"), the former tsar and his family were [murdered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_of_the_Romanov_family "Execution of the Romanov family").<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEChamberlin19356–12,_91_91-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChamberlin19356%E2%80%9312,_91-91">[89]</a></sup>

By July the authority of the Komuch extended over much of the area controlled by the Czechoslovak Legion. The Komuch pursued an ambivalent social policy, combining democratic and socialist measures, such as the institution of an [eight-hour working day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_hour_day "Eight hour day"), with "restorative" actions, such as returning both factories and land to their former owners. After the fall of [Kazan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazan "Kazan"), Vladimir Lenin called for the dispatch of Petrograd workers to the Kazan Front: "We must send down the _maximum_ number of Petrograd workers: (1) a few dozen 'leaders' like [Kayurov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benyamin_Kayurov "Benyamin Kayurov"); (2) a few thousand militants 'from the ranks'".

After a series of reverses at the front, the Bolsheviks' War Commissar, Trotsky, instituted increasingly harsh measures in order to prevent unauthorised withdrawals, desertions, and mutinies in the Red Army. In the field, the Cheka Special Investigations Forces (termed the _Special Punitive Department of the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission for Combat of Counter-Revolution and Sabotage_ or _Special Punitive Brigades_) followed the Red Army, conducting field tribunals and summary executions of soldiers and officers who deserted, retreated from their positions, or failed to display sufficient offensive zeal.<sup id="cite_ref-93"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-93">[91]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDaniels199370_94-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDaniels199370-94">[92]</a></sup> The Cheka Special Investigations Forces were also charged with the detection of sabotage and counter-revolutionary activity by Red Army soldiers and commanders.

By the fall of 1918, anti-Bolshevik White forces in the east included the People's Army ([Komuch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komuch "Komuch")), the Siberian Army (of the Siberian Provisional Government) and insurgent Cossack units of Orenburg, the Urals, Siberia, Semirechye, Baikal, and Amur and Ussuri Cossacks, nominally under the orders of Gen. V.G. Boldyrev, Commander-in-Chief, appointed by the Ufa Directorate.

On the Volga, Col. [Kappel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Kappel "Vladimir Kappel")'s White detachment captured Kazan on 7 August, but Red Forces recaptured the city on 8 September 1918 following a counteroffensive. On the 11th [Simbirsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simbirsk "Simbirsk") fell, and on 8 October [Samara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samara,_Russia "Samara, Russia"). The Whites fell back eastwards to Ufa and Orenburg.

In Omsk, the Russian Provisional Government quickly came under the influence and later the dominance of its new War Minister, the rear-admiral [Kolchak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Vasilevich_Kolchak "Aleksandr Vasilevich Kolchak"). On 18 November, a [coup d'état](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolchak_Coup "Kolchak Coup") established Kolchak as supreme leader. Two members of the Directory were arrested, and subsequently deported, while Kolchak was proclaimed "Supreme Ruler", and "Commander-in-Chief of all Land and Naval Forces of Russia."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEChamberlin1935177–178_98-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChamberlin1935177%E2%80%93178-98">[96]</a></sup> By mid-December 1918, the White armies had to leave Ufa, but they balanced that failure with a successful drive towards [Perm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perm,_Russia "Perm, Russia"), which they took on 24 December.

#### Barrier troops\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russian_Civil_War&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Barrier troops")\]

In the Red Army, the concept of barrier troops first arose in August 1918 with the formation of the заградительные отряды (_zagraditelnye otriady_), translated as "blocking troops" or "anti-retreat detachments" ([Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language "Russian language"): заградотряды, заградительные отряды, отряды заграждения).<sup id="cite_ref-volko_99-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-volko-99">[97]</a></sup> The barrier troops comprised personnel drawn from the Cheka punitive detachments or from regular Red Army infantry regiments.

The first use of the barrier troops by the Red Army occurred in the late summer and fall of 1918 in the [Eastern front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_(RSFSR) "Eastern Front (RSFSR)") during the Russian Civil War, when Leon Trotsky authorized [Mikhail Tukhachevsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Tukhachevsky "Mikhail Tukhachevsky"), the commander of the [1st Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_Army_(RSFSR) "1st Army (RSFSR)"), to station blocking detachments behind unreliable Red Army infantry regiments in the 1st Red Army, with orders to shoot if front-line troops either deserted or retreated without permission.<sup id="cite_ref-volko_99-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-volko-99">[97]</a></sup>

In December 1918, Trotsky ordered that detachments of additional barrier troops be raised for attachment to each infantry formation in the Red Army. On December 18 he cabled:

> How do things stand with the blocking units? As far as I am aware they have not been included in our establishment and it appears they have no personnel. It is absolutely essential that we have at least an embryonic network of blocking units and that we work out a procedure for bringing them up to strength and deploying them.<sup id="cite_ref-volko_99-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-volko-99">[97]</a></sup>

In 1919, 616 "hardcore" deserters of the total 837,000 draft dodgers and deserters were executed following Trotsky's dracionan measures.<sup id="cite_ref-100"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-100">[98]</a></sup> According to Figes, "a majority of deserters (most registered as "weak-willed") were handed back to the military authorities, and formed into units for transfer to one of the rear armies or directly to the front". Even those registered as "malicious" deserters were returned to the ranks when the demand for reinforcements became desperate". Forges also noted that the Red Army instituted [amnesty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty "Amnesty") weeks to prohibit punitive measures against desertion which encouraged the voluntary return of 98,000-132,000 deserters to the army.<sup id="cite_ref-101"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-101">[99]</a></sup>

The barrier troops were also used to enforce Bolshevik control over food supplies in areas controlled by the Red Army as part of Lenin's [war communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_communism "War communism") policies, a role which soon earned them the hatred of the Russian civilian population.<sup id="cite_ref-102"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-102">[100]</a></sup> These policies in part led to the [Russian famine of 1921–1922](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_famine_of_1921%E2%80%931922 "Russian famine of 1921–1922"), which killed about five million people.<sup id="cite_ref-103"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-103">[101]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMawdsley2007[httpsarchiveorgdetailsrussiancivilwar00evanpage287_287]_104-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMawdsley2007[httpsarchiveorgdetailsrussiancivilwar00evanpage287_287]-104">[102]</a></sup> However, the famine was preceded by bad [harvests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvests "Harvests"), harsh winter, [drought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought "Drought") especially in the [Volga Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volga_region "Volga region") which was exacerbated by a range of factors including the war, the presence of the White Army and the methods of war communism.<sup id="cite_ref-105"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-105">[103]</a></sup> The outbreaks of diseases such as [cholera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera "Cholera") and [typhus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhus "Typhus") were also contributing factors to the famine casualties.<sup id="cite_ref-106"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-106">[104]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-107"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-107">[105]</a></sup>

### Central Asia (1918)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russian_Civil_War&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Central Asia (1918)")\]

In February 1918, the Red Army overthrew the White Russian-supported Kokand Autonomy of Turkestan.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERakowska-Harmstone197019_108-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTERakowska-Harmstone197019-108">[106]</a></sup> Although that move seemed to solidify Bolshevik power in Central Asia, more troubles soon arose for the Red Army as the Allied Forces began to intervene. British support of the White Army provided the greatest threat to the Red Army in Central Asia during 1918. Britain sent three prominent military leaders to the area. One was Lieutenant Colonel [Frederick Marshman Baile](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Frederick_Marshman_Baile&action=edit&redlink=1 "Frederick Marshman Baile (page does not exist)"), who recorded a mission to Tashkent, from where the Bolsheviks forced him to flee. Another was General [Wilfrid Malleson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilfrid_Malleson "Wilfrid Malleson"), leading the [Malleson Mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleson_Mission "Malleson Mission"), who assisted the Mensheviks in Ashkhabad (now the capital of Turkmenistan) with a small Anglo-Indian force. However, he failed to gain control of Tashkent, Bukhara and Khiva. The third was Major General Dunsterville, who was driven out by the Bolsheviks of Central Asia only a month after his arrival in August 1918.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTECoatesCoates195175_109-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTECoatesCoates195175-109">[107]</a></sup> Despite setbacks as a result of British invasions during 1918, the Bolsheviks continued to make progress in bringing the Central Asian population under their influence. The first regional congress of the Russian Communist Party convened in the city of Tashkent in June 1918 in order to build support for a local Bolshevik Party.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAllworth1967232_110-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAllworth1967232-110">[108]</a></sup>

### Left SR Uprising\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russian_Civil_War&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Left SR Uprising")\]

On 6 July 1918, two [Left Socialist-Revolutionaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_Socialist-Revolutionaries "Left Socialist-Revolutionaries") and Cheka employees, [Yakov Blumkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakov_Blumkin "Yakov Blumkin") and Nikolai Andreyev, assassinated the German ambassador, Count [Mirbach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Mirbach "Wilhelm Mirbach"). In Moscow a [Left SR uprising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_SR_uprising "Left SR uprising") was put down by the Bolsheviks, mass arrests of Socialist-Revolutionaries followed, and executions became more frequent. Chamberlin noted, "The time of relative leniency toward former fellow-revolutionists was over. The Left Socialist Revolutionaries, of course, were no longer tolerated as members of the Soviets; from this time the Soviet regime became a pure and undiluted dictatorship of the Communist Party." Similarly, [Boris Savinkov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Savinkov "Boris Savinkov")'s surprise attacks were suppressed, with many of the conspirators being executed, as "Mass Red Terror" became a reality.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEChamberlin193550–59_111-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChamberlin193550%E2%80%9359-111">[109]</a></sup>

### Estonia, Latvia and Petrograd\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russian_Civil_War&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Estonia, Latvia and Petrograd")\]

Estonia [cleared its territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonian_War_of_Independence "Estonian War of Independence") of the Red Army by January 1919.<sup id="cite_ref-112"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-112">[110]</a></sup> [Baltic German volunteers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltische_Landeswehr "Baltische Landeswehr") captured [Riga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riga "Riga") from the Red [Latvian Riflemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvian_Riflemen "Latvian Riflemen") on 22 May, but the Estonian 3rd Division [defeated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_C%C4%93sis_(1919) "Battle of Cēsis (1919)") the Baltic Germans a month later, aiding the establishment of the [Republic of Latvia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Latvia "Republic of Latvia").<sup id="cite_ref-axishistory_113-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-axishistory-113">[111]</a></sup>

General [Nikolai Yudenich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Yudenich "Nikolai Yudenich")

That rendered possible another threat to the Red Army, from General Yudenich, who had spent the summer organizing the Northwestern Army in Estonia with local and British support. In October 1919, he tried to capture Petrograd in a sudden assault with a force of around 20,000 men. The attack was well-executed, using night attacks and lightning cavalry maneuvers to turn the flanks of the defending Red Army. Yudenich also had six British tanks, which caused panic whenever they appeared. The Allies gave large quantities of aid to Yudenich, but he complained of receiving insufficient support.

By 19 October, Yudenich's troops had reached the outskirts of the city. Some members of the Bolshevik central committee in Moscow were willing to give up Petrograd, but Trotsky refused to accept the loss of the city and personally organized its defenses. Trotsky himself declared, "It is impossible for a little army of 15,000 ex-officers to master a working-class capital of 700,000 inhabitants." He settled on a strategy of urban defense, proclaiming that the city would "defend itself on its own ground" and that the White Army would be lost in a labyrinth of fortified streets and there "meet its grave".<sup id="cite_ref-114"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-114">[112]</a></sup>

Trotsky armed all available workers, men and women, and ordered the transfer of military forces from Moscow. Within a few weeks, the Red Army defending Petrograd had tripled in size and outnumbered Yudenich three to one. Yudenich, short of supplies, then decided to call off the siege of the city and withdrew. He repeatedly asked permission to withdraw his army across the border to Estonia. However, units retreating across the border were disarmed and interned by orders of the Estonian government, which had entered into peace negotiations with the Soviet Government on 16 September and had been informed by the Soviet authorities of their 6 November decision that if the White Army was allowed to retreat into Estonia, it would be pursued across the border by the Reds.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERosenthal2006516_115-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTERosenthal2006516-115">[113]</a></sup> In fact, the Reds attacked Estonian army positions and fighting continued until a ceasefire went into effect on 3 January 1920. After the [Treaty of Tartu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Tartu_(Russian%E2%80%93Estonian) "Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Estonian)"), most of Yudenich's soldiers went into exile. Former Imperial Russian and then Finnish General [Mannerheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannerheim "Mannerheim") planned an intervention to help the Whites in Russia capture Petrograd. However, he did not gain the necessary support for the endeavour. Lenin considered it "completely certain, that the slightest aid from Finland would have determined the fate of \[the city\]".

### Northern Russia (1919)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russian_Civil_War&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Northern Russia (1919)")\]

The British occupied [Murmansk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murmansk "Murmansk") and seized [Arkhangelsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkhangelsk "Arkhangelsk") alongside United States forces. With the retreat of Kolchak in Siberia, they pulled their troops out of the cities before the winter trapped them in the port. The remaining White forces under [Yevgeny Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yevgeny_Miller "Yevgeny Miller") evacuated the region in February 1920.<sup id="cite_ref-116"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-116">[114]</a></sup>

At the beginning of March 1919, the general offensive of the Whites on the eastern front began. Ufa was retaken on 13 March; by mid-April, the White Army stopped at the [Glazov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glazov "Glazov")–[Chistopol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chistopol "Chistopol")–[Bugulma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugulma "Bugulma")–[Buguruslan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buguruslan "Buguruslan")–Sharlyk line. Reds started their [counteroffensive against Kolchak's forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_counteroffensive "Eastern Front counteroffensive") at the end of April. The Red 5th Army, led by the capable commander [Tukhachevsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tukhachevsky "Tukhachevsky"), captured [Elabuga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elabuga "Elabuga") on 26 May, [Sarapul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarapul "Sarapul") on 2 June and [Izevsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izevsk "Izevsk") on the 7th and continued to push forward. Both sides had victories and losses, but by the middle of summer the Red Army was larger than the White Army and had managed to recapture territory previously lost.<sup id="cite_ref-117"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-117">[115]</a></sup>

Following the abortive offensive at Chelyabinsk, the White armies withdrew beyond the [Tobol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobol "Tobol"). In September 1919 a White offensive was launched against the Tobol Front, the last attempt to change the course of events. However, on 14 October the Reds counterattacked, and thus began the uninterrupted [retreat of the Whites to the east](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Siberian_Ice_March "Great Siberian Ice March"). On 14 November 1919 the Red Army captured Omsk.<sup id="cite_ref-118"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-118">[116]</a></sup> Adm. Kolchak lost control of his government shortly after the defeat; White Army forces in Siberia had essentially ceased to exist by December. Retreat of the eastern front by White armies lasted three months, until mid-February 1920, when the survivors, after crossing Lake Baikal, reached the [Chita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chita,_Zabaykalsky_Krai "Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai") area and joined [Ataman Semenov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataman_Semenov "Ataman Semenov")'s forces.

The Cossacks had been unable to organise and capitalise on their successes at the end of 1918. By 1919 they had begun to run short of supplies. Consequently, when the Soviet Russian counteroffensive began in January 1919 under the Bolshevik commander [Antonov-Ovseenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Antonov-Ovseenko "Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko"), the Cossack forces rapidly fell apart.

Denikin's military strength continued to grow in 1919, with significant munitions supplied by the British. In January, Denikin's Armed Forces of South Russia (AFSR) completed the elimination of Red forces in the northern Caucasus and moved north, in an effort to [protect the Don district](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_for_the_Donbas_(1919) "Battle for the Donbas (1919)").<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKenez2004b20–35_120-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKenez2004b20%E2%80%9335-120">[118]</a></sup>

On 18 December 1918, French forces landed in [Odessa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odessa "Odessa") and Crimea, but evacuated Odessa on 6 April 1919, and the Crimea by the end of the month. According to Chamberlin, "France gave far less practical aid to the Whites than did England; its sole independent venture in intervention, at Odessa, ended in a complete fiasco."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEChamberlin1935151,_165–167_121-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChamberlin1935151,_165%E2%80%93167-121">[119]</a></sup>

Denikin then reorganized the Armed Forces of South Russia under the leadership of [Vladimir May-Mayevsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_May-Mayevsky "Vladimir May-Mayevsky"), [Vladimir Sidorin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Sidorin "Vladimir Sidorin"), and [Pyotr Wrangel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyotr_Wrangel "Pyotr Wrangel").

Denikin's forces constituted a real threat and for a time threatened to reach Moscow. The Red Army, stretched thin by fighting on all fronts, was forced out of Kiev on 30 August. [Kursk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk "Kursk") and [Orel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oryol "Oryol") were taken, on 20 September and 14 October, respectively.

[Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_the_Whites_with_the_Red_Wedge "Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge"), a famous Bolshevik [Constructivist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(art) "Constructivism (art)") propaganda poster by [El Lissitzky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Lissitzky "El Lissitzky"), which abstractly represents the defeat of the Whites by the Red Army

Kenez states, "In October Denikin ruled more than forty million people and controlled the economically most valuable parts of the Russian Empire." Yet, "The White armies, which had fought victoriously during the summer and early fall, fell back in disorder in November and December." Denikin's front line was overstretched, while his reserves dealt with Makhno's anarchists in the rear. Between September and October, the Reds mobilized one hundred thousand new soldiers and adopted the Trotsky-[Vatsetis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jukums_V%C4%81cietis "Jukums Vācietis") strategy with the Ninth and Tenth armies forming V. I. Shorin's Southeastern Front between Tsaritsyn and Bobrov, while the Eighth, Twelfth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth armies formed [A.I. Egorov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Yegorov_(soldier) "Alexander Yegorov (soldier)")'s Southern Front between Zhitomir and Bobrov. [Sergey Kamenev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Kamenev "Sergey Kamenev") was in overall command of the two fronts. On Denikin's left was [Abram Dragomirov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abram_Dragomirov "Abram Dragomirov"), while in his center was [Vladimir May-Mayevsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_May-Mayevsky "Vladimir May-Mayevsky")'s Volunteer Army, [Vladimir Sidorin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Sidorin "Vladimir Sidorin")'s Don Cossacks were further east, with [Pyotr Wrangel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyotr_Wrangel "Pyotr Wrangel")'s Caucasian army at Tsaritsyn, and an additional was in the Northern Caucasus attempting to capture Astrakhan. On 20 October, May–Mayevsky was forced to evacuate Orel during the [Orel-Kursk operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orel-Kursk_operation "Orel-Kursk operation"). On 24 October, [Semyon Budyonny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semyon_Budyonny "Semyon Budyonny") captured Voronezh, and Kursk on 15 November, during the [Voronezh-Kastornoye operation (1919)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronezh-Kastornoye_operation_(1919) "Voronezh-Kastornoye operation (1919)"). On 6 January, the Reds reached the Black Sea at Mariupol and Taganrog, and on 9 January, they reached Rostov. According to Kenez, "The Whites had now lost all the territories which they had captured in 1919, and held approximately the same area in which they had started two years before."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKenez2004b213–223_129-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKenez2004b213%E2%80%93223-129">[127]</a></sup>

### Central Asia (1919)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russian_Civil_War&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Central Asia (1919)")\]

By February 1919 the British government had pulled its military forces out of Central Asia.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAllworth1967231_130-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAllworth1967231-130">[128]</a></sup> Despite the success for the Red Army, the White Army's assaults in European Russia and other areas broke communication between Moscow and Tashkent. For a time, Central Asia was completely cut off from Red Army forces in Siberia.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTECoatesCoates195176_131-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTECoatesCoates195176-131">[129]</a></sup> Although the communication failure weakened the Red Army, the Bolsheviks continued their efforts to gain support for the Bolshevik Party in Central Asia by holding a second regional conference in March. During the conference, a regional bureau of Muslim organisations of the Russian Bolshevik Party was formed. The Bolshevik Party continued to try to gain support among the native population by giving it the impression of better representation for the Central Asian population and throughout the end of the year could maintain harmony with the Central Asian people.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAllworth1967232–233_132-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAllworth1967232%E2%80%93233-132">[130]</a></sup>

Communication difficulties with Red Army forces in Siberia and European Russia ceased to be a problem by mid-November 1919. Red Army successes north of Central Asia caused communication with Moscow to be re-established and the Bolsheviks to claim victory over the White Army in Turkestan.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTECoatesCoates195176_131-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTECoatesCoates195176-131">[129]</a></sup>

In the Ural-Guryev operation of 1919–1920, the Red [Turkestan Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkestan_Front "Turkestan Front") defeated the [Ural Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ural_Army "Ural Army"). During winter 1920, [Ural Cossacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ural_Cossacks "Ural Cossacks") and their families, totaling about 15,000 people, headed south along the eastern coast of the Caspian Sea towards [Fort Alexandrovsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort-Shevchenko "Fort-Shevchenko"). Only a few hundred of them reached Persia in June 1920.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESmele2016139_133-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTESmele2016139-133">[131]</a></sup> The [Orenburg Independent Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orenburg_Independent_Army "Orenburg Independent Army") was formed from [Orenburg Cossacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orenburg_Cossacks "Orenburg Cossacks") and other troops who rebelled against the Bolsheviks. During the winter 1919–20, the Orenburg Army retreated to [Semirechye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semirechye "Semirechye") in what is known as the [Starving March](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starving_March "Starving March"), as half of the participants perished.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESmele20151082–1083_134-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTESmele20151082%E2%80%931083-134">[132]</a></sup> In March 1920 her remnants crossed the border into the Northwestern region of China.

At the beginning of 1920, Denikin was reduced to defending Novorossia, the Crimean peninsula, and the Northern Caucasus. On 26 January, the Caucasian army retreated beyond the [Manych](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manych "Manych"). On 7 February, the Reds occupied Odessa, but then [Makhno's anarchists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makhnovshchina "Makhnovshchina") started fighting the Fourteenth Red Army. On 20 February, Denikin succeeded in recapturing Rostov, his last victory, before giving it up soon after.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKenez2004b236–239_136-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKenez2004b236%E2%80%93239-136">[133]</a></sup>

By the beginning of 1920, the main body of the Armed Forces of South Russia was rapidly retreating towards the Don, to Rostov. Denikin hoped to hold the crossings of the Don, then rest and reform his troops, but the White Army was not able to hold the Don area, and at the end of February 1920 started a retreat across Kuban towards [Novorossiysk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novorossiysk "Novorossiysk"). Slipshod [evacuation of Novorossiysk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evacuation_of_Novorossiysk_(1920) "Evacuation of Novorossiysk (1920)") proved to be a dark event for the White Army. Russian and Allied ships evacuated about 40,000 of Denikin's men from Novorossiysk to the Crimea, without horses or any heavy equipment, while about 20,000 men were left behind and either dispersed or were captured by the Red Army. Following the disastrous Novorossiysk evacuation, Denikin stepped down and the military council elected Wrangel as the new Commander-in-Chief of the White Army. He was able to restore order to the dispirited troops and reshape an army that could fight as a regular force again. It remained an organized force in the Crimea throughout 1920.<sup id="cite_ref-137"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-137">[134]</a></sup>

After Moscow's Bolshevik government signed a [military and political alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starobilsk_agreement "Starobilsk agreement") with [Nestor Makhno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestor_Makhno "Nestor Makhno") and the [Ukrainian anarchists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_anarchists "Ukrainian anarchists"), the [Insurgent Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Insurgent_Army_of_Ukraine "Revolutionary Insurgent Army of Ukraine") attacked and defeated several regiments of Wrangel's troops in southern Ukraine, forcing him to retreat before he could capture that year's grain harvest.<sup id="cite_ref-138"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-138">[135]</a></sup>

Stymied in his efforts to consolidate his hold, Wrangel then attacked north in an attempt to take advantage of recent Red Army defeats at the close of the [Polish–Soviet War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Soviet_War "Polish–Soviet War") of 1919–1920. The Red Army eventually halted the offensive, and Wrangel's troops had to retreat to [Crimea in November 1920](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Perekop_(1920) "Siege of Perekop (1920)"), pursued by both the Red and Black cavalry and infantry.

After the defeat of Wrangel, the Red Army immediately repudiated its 1920 treaty of alliance with Nestor Makhno and attacked the anarchist Insurgent Army; the [campaign to liquidate Makhno and the Ukrainian anarchists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolshevik%E2%80%93Makhnovist_conflict#Second_phase_(November_1920%E2%80%93August_1921) "Bolshevik–Makhnovist conflict") began with an attempted assassination of Makhno by Cheka agents. Anger at continued repression by the Bolshevik Communist government and at its liberal use of the Cheka to put down anarchist elements led to a [naval mutiny at Kronstadt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronstadt_rebellion "Kronstadt rebellion") in March 1921, followed by peasant revolts – all of which were put down by the Bolsheviks. The outset of the year was marked by strikes and demonstrations – in both Moscow and Petrograd, as well as the countryside – due to discontent with the results of policies that made up [war communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_communism "War communism").<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDaniels1951241_139-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDaniels1951241-139">[136]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAvrich200441_140-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAvrich200441-140">[137]</a></sup> The Bolsheviks, in response to the protests, enacted martial law and sent the Red Army to disperse the workers.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEChamberlin1987440_141-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChamberlin1987440-141">[138]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEFiges1997760_142-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFiges1997760-142">[139]</a></sup> This was followed up by mass arrests executed by the [Cheka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheka "Cheka").<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAvrich200452_143-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAvrich200452-143">[140]</a></sup> Repression and minor concessions only temporarily quelled the discontent as Petrograd protests continued that year in March.

In Siberia, Admiral Kolchak's army had disintegrated. He himself gave up command after the loss of Omsk and designated Gen. [Grigory Semyonov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigory_Mikhaylovich_Semyonov "Grigory Mikhaylovich Semyonov") as the new leader of the White Army in Siberia. Not long afterward, Kolchak was arrested by the disaffected Czechoslovak Legion as he traveled towards [Irkutsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irkutsk "Irkutsk") without the protection of the army and was turned over to the socialist [Political Centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_Centre_(Russia) "Political Centre (Russia)") in Irkutsk. Six days later, the regime was replaced by a Bolshevik-dominated Military-Revolutionary Committee.

Remnants of Kolchak's army reached [Transbaikalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transbaikalia "Transbaikalia") and joined Semyonov's troops, forming the Far Eastern army. With the support of the Japanese army, it was able to hold Chita, but after the withdrawal of Japanese soldiers from Transbaikalia, Semenov's position became untenable and in November 1920 he was driven by the Red Army from Transbaikalia and took refuge in China. The Japanese, who had plans to annex the [Amur Krai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amur_Krai "Amur Krai"), finally pulled their troops out as Bolshevik forces gradually asserted control over the Russian Far East.

However, the perceived threat of continued popular discontent, combined with the failure of socialist revolutions in other countries—most notably the [German Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Revolution "German Revolution")—contributed to the continued militarization of Soviet society.

In Central Asia, Red Army troops continued to face resistance into 1923, where _[basmachi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basmachi_Revolt "Basmachi Revolt")_ (armed bands of Islamic guerrillas) had formed to fight the Bolshevik takeover. The Soviets engaged non-Russian peoples in Central Asia, like [Magaza Masanchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magaza_Masanchi "Magaza Masanchi"), commander of the Dungan Cavalry Regiment, to fight against the Basmachis. The Communist Party did not completely dismantle the group until 1934.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEWheeler1964107_153-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWheeler1964107-153">[149]</a></sup>

General [Anatoly Pepelyayev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoly_Pepelyayev "Anatoly Pepelyayev") [continued armed resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakut_Revolt "Yakut Revolt") in the [Ayano-Maysky District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayano-Maysky_District "Ayano-Maysky District") until June 1923. The regions of [Kamchatka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamchatka "Kamchatka") and Northern [Sakhalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakhalin "Sakhalin") remained under Japanese occupation until their [treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet%E2%80%93Japanese_Basic_Convention "Soviet–Japanese Basic Convention") with the Soviet Union in 1925, when their forces were finally withdrawn.

Street children during the Russian Civil War

The results of the civil war were momentous. Soviet demographer Boris Urlanis estimated that 300,000 men were killed in action during the Civil War and Polish-Soviet War – 125,000 in the Red Army, 175,500 White armies and Poles – and the total number of military personnel from both sides dead from disease as 450,000.<sup id="cite_ref-154"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-154">[150]</a></sup> Boris Sennikov estimated the total losses among the population of [Tambov region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tambov_Oblast "Tambov Oblast") in 1920 to 1922 resulting from the war, executions, and imprisonment in concentration camps as approximately 240,000.<sup id="cite_ref-155"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-155">[151]</a></sup> By 1922, there were at least 7,000,000 [street children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_children "Street children") in Russia as a result of nearly ten years of devastation from World War I and the civil war.<sup id="cite_ref-156"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-156">[152]</a></sup>

At the end of the Civil War the Russian SFSR was exhausted and near ruin. The droughts of 1920 and 1921, as well as the [Russian famine of 1921](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_famine_of_1921 "Russian famine of 1921"), worsened the disaster still further, killing roughly 5 million people. Disease had reached pandemic proportions, with 3,000,000 dying of [typhus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhus "Typhus") throughout the war. Millions more also died of widespread starvation, wholesale massacres by both sides and [pogroms against Jews in Ukraine and southern Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogroms_of_the_Russian_Civil_War "Pogroms of the Russian Civil War").

### Economic Impact\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russian_Civil_War&action=edit&section=37 "Edit section: Economic Impact")\]

The civil war had a devastating impact on the Russian economy. A [black market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_market "Black market") emerged in Russia, despite the threat of [martial law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_law "Martial law") against profiteering. The [ruble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_ruble "Russian ruble") collapsed, with barter increasingly replacing money as a medium of exchange<sup id="cite_ref-DaviesHarrison1993_178-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-DaviesHarrison1993-178">[173]</a></sup> and, by 1921, heavy industry output had fallen to 20% of 1913 levels. 90% of wages were paid with goods rather than money.<sup id="cite_ref-179"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-179">[174]</a></sup> 70% of locomotives were in need of repair,<sup id="cite_ref-180"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-180">[175]</a></sup> and food requisitioning, combined with the effects of seven years of war and a severe drought, contributed to a famine that caused between 3 and 10 million deaths.<sup id="cite_ref-181"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-181">[176]</a></sup> Coal production decreased from 27.5 million tons (1913) to 7 million tons (1920), while overall factory production also declined from 10,000 million roubles to 1,000 million roubles. According to the noted historian David Christian, the grain harvest was also slashed from 80.1 million tons (1913) to 46.5 million tons (1920).<sup id="cite_ref-182"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-182">[177]</a></sup>

War communism saved the Soviet government during the Civil War, but much of the Russian economy had ground to a standstill. Some peasants responded to [food requisitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodrazvyorstka "Prodrazvyorstka") by refusing to till the land. By 1921, cultivated land had shrunk to 62% of the pre-war area, and the harvest yield was only about 37% of normal. The number of horses declined from 35 million in 1916 to 24 million in 1920 and cattle from 58 to 37 million. The exchange rate with the US dollar declined from two [roubles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roubles "Roubles") in 1914 to 1,200 Rbls in 1920. Although Russia experienced extremely rapid economic growth<sup id="cite_ref-183"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-183">[178]</a></sup> in the 1930s, the combined effect of World War I and the Civil War left a lasting scar on Russian society and had permanent effects on the development of the Soviet Union.

### Political impact\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russian_Civil_War&action=edit&section=38 "Edit section: Political impact")\]

The complete failure of the [Communist International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_International "Communist International")\-inspired revolutions was a sobering experience in Moscow, and the Bolsheviks moved from [world revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_revolution "World revolution") to [socialism in one country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism_in_one_country "Socialism in one country"), the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Soviet_Socialist_Republics "United Soviet Socialist Republics").<sup id="cite_ref-184"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-184">[179]</a></sup>

The [Treaty of Rapallo (1922)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Rapallo_(1922) "Treaty of Rapallo (1922)") was an agreement signed on 16 April 1922 between the [Weimar Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic "Weimar Republic") and Soviet Union, under which both renounced all territorial and financial claims against each other and opened friendly diplomatic relations.<sup id="cite_ref-Mueller_185-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War#cite_note-Mueller-185">[180]</a></sup>

He summarized the outcome of the Bolshevik massacre as follows: 28 bishops, 1219 clergy, 6000 professors and teachers, 9000 doctors, 54,000 officers, 260,000 soldiers, 70,000 policemen, 12,950 landowners, 355,250 professionals, 193,290 workers, 815,000 peasants. The author did not provide the sources of that data. Needless to say that the precise counts seem \[too\] fictional, but the author's \[characterisation\] of terror in Russia in general matches reality." The note is somewhat abbreviated in the 1925 English edition indicated in the bibliography: in particular, there is no mention of the imaginative nature of the data (p. 111, note n. 1).
