## The curriculum since birth has been grind culture, therefore, we keep this energy going in our expectations of ourselves and each other. In how we run our businesses, our families, our relationships. If you could see my email inbox you would be shook with how people engage with me (extractive and urgent for no reason). We must examine how we move and how to embody a message of care and slowing down. The brainwashing is real. 

The shift will happen slowly. Begin to open up to the ways you keep this machine-level pace going. We Will Rest!
