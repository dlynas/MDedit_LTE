The **Federal Reserve System** (often shortened to the **Federal Reserve**, or simply **the Fed**) is the [central banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank "Central bank") system of the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States"). It was created on December 23, 1913, with the enactment of the [Federal Reserve Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Act "Federal Reserve Act"), after a series of [financial panics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_panic "Financial panic") (particularly the [panic of 1907](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1907 "Panic of 1907")) led to the desire for central control of the monetary system in order to alleviate financial crises.<sup id="cite_ref-need_11-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-need-11">[list 1]</a></sup> Over the years, events such as the [Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression "Great Depression") in the 1930s and the [Great Recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession "Great Recession") during the 2000s have led to the expansion of the roles and responsibilities of the Federal Reserve System.<sup id="cite_ref-initial_6-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-initial-6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-12">[11]</a></sup>

[Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Congress "U.S. Congress") established three key objectives for [monetary policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy "Monetary policy") in the Federal Reserve Act: maximizing employment, stabilizing prices, and moderating long-term interest rates.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-13">[12]</a></sup> The first two objectives are sometimes referred to as the Federal Reserve's dual mandate.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-14">[13]</a></sup> Its duties have expanded over the years, and currently also include supervising and [regulating banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_regulation "Bank regulation"), maintaining the stability of the financial system, and providing financial services to [depository institutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depository_institution "Depository institution"), the U.S. government, and foreign official institutions.<sup id="cite_ref-mission_15-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-mission-15">[14]</a></sup> The Fed also conducts research into the economy and provides numerous publications, such as the [Beige Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beige_Book "Beige Book") and the [FRED database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FRED_database "FRED database").

The Federal Reserve System is composed of several layers. It is governed by the presidentially-appointed [board of governors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Board_of_Governors "Federal Reserve Board of Governors") or Federal Reserve Board (FRB). Twelve regional [Federal Reserve Banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank "Federal Reserve Bank"), located in cities throughout the nation, regulate and oversee privately-owned commercial banks.<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-16">[15]</a></sup> Nationally chartered commercial banks are required to hold stock in, and can elect some board members of, the Federal Reserve Bank of their region.

The [Federal Open Market Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee "Federal Open Market Committee") (FOMC) sets monetary policy by adjusting the target for the [federal funds rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate "Federal funds rate"), which influences [market interest rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_interest_rate "Market interest rate") generally and via the [monetary transmission mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_transmission_mechanism "Monetary transmission mechanism") in turn US economic activity. The FOMC consists of all seven members of the board of governors and the twelve regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents, though only five bank presidents vote at a time—the president of the [New York Fed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_New_York "Federal Reserve Bank of New York") and four others who rotate through one-year voting terms. There are also various advisory councils.<sup id="cite_ref-pubpriv_22-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-pubpriv-22">[list 2]</a></sup> It has a structure unique among central banks, and is also unusual in that the [United States Department of the Treasury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury "United States Department of the Treasury"), an entity outside of the central bank, prints the [currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency "Currency") used.<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-23">[21]</a></sup>

The federal government sets the salaries of the board's seven governors, and it receives all the system's annual profits, after dividends on member banks' capital investments are paid, and an account surplus is maintained. In 2015, the Federal Reserve earned a net income of $100.2 billion and transferred $97.7 billion to the U.S. Treasury,<sup id="cite_ref-frs_bog_net_income_press_lease_24-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-frs_bog_net_income_press_lease-24">[22]</a></sup> and 2020 earnings were approximately $88.6 billion with remittances to the U.S. Treasury of $86.9 billion.<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-25">[23]</a></sup> Although an instrument of the U.S. government, the Federal Reserve System considers itself "an independent central bank because its monetary policy decisions do not have to be approved by the president or by anyone else in the executive or legislative branches of government, it does not receive funding appropriated by Congress, and the terms of the members of the board of governors span multiple presidential and congressional terms."<sup id="cite_ref-auto_26-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-auto-26">[24]</a></sup>

## Purpose\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Purpose")\]

The primary declared motivation for creating the Federal Reserve System was to address [banking panics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_run "Bank run").<sup id="cite_ref-initial_6-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-initial-6">[6]</a></sup> Other purposes are stated in the [Federal Reserve Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Act "Federal Reserve Act"), such as "to furnish an elastic currency, to afford means of rediscounting [commercial paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_paper "Commercial paper"), to establish a more effective supervision of banking in the United States, and for other purposes".<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-27">[25]</a></sup> Before the founding of the Federal Reserve System, the United States underwent several financial crises. A particularly severe crisis in 1907 led Congress to enact the Federal Reserve Act in 1913. Today the Federal Reserve System has responsibilities in addition to stabilizing the financial system.<sup id="cite_ref-BoG_2006_pp=1_28-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-BoG_2006_pp=1-28">[26]</a></sup>

Current functions of the Federal Reserve System include:<sup id="cite_ref-mission_15-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-mission-15">[14]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-BoG_2006_pp=1_28-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-BoG_2006_pp=1-28">[26]</a></sup>

### Addressing the problem of bank panics\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Addressing the problem of bank panics")\]

Banking institutions in the United States are required to hold reserves—amounts of currency and deposits in other banks—equal to only a fraction of the amount of the bank's deposit liabilities owed to customers. This practice is called [fractional-reserve banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking "Fractional-reserve banking"). As a result, banks usually invest the majority of the funds received from depositors. On rare occasions, too many of the bank's customers will withdraw their savings and the bank will need help from another institution to continue operating; this is called a [bank run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_run "Bank run"). Bank runs can lead to a multitude of social and economic problems. The Federal Reserve System was designed as an attempt to prevent or minimize the occurrence of bank runs, and possibly act as a [lender of last resort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lender_of_last_resort "Lender of last resort") when a bank run does occur. Many economists, following [Nobel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nobel_Memorial_Prize_laureates_in_Economics "List of Nobel Memorial Prize laureates in Economics") laureate [Milton Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman "Milton Friedman"), believe that the Federal Reserve inappropriately refused to lend money to small banks during the bank runs of 1929; Friedman argued that this contributed to the [Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression "Great Depression").<sup id="cite_ref-Federal_Reserve_Board_30-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-Federal_Reserve_Board-30">[28]</a></sup>

#### Check clearing system\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Check clearing system")\]

Because some banks refused to [clear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearing_(finance) "Clearing (finance)") checks from certain other banks during times of economic uncertainty, a check-clearing system was created in the Federal Reserve System. It is briefly described in _The Federal Reserve System—Purposes and Functions_ as follows:<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-31">[29]</a></sup>

> By creating the Federal Reserve System, Congress intended to eliminate the severe financial crises that had periodically swept the nation, especially the sort of financial panic that occurred in 1907. During that episode, payments were disrupted throughout the country because many banks and clearinghouses refused to clear checks drawn on certain other banks, a practice that contributed to the failure of otherwise solvent banks. To address these problems, Congress gave the Federal Reserve System the authority to establish a nationwide check-clearing system. The System, then, was to provide not only an elastic currency—that is, a currency that would expand or shrink in amount as economic conditions warranted—but also an efficient and equitable check-collection system.

#### Lender of last resort\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Lender of last resort")\]

In the United States, the Federal Reserve serves as the [lender of last resort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lender_of_last_resort "Lender of last resort") to those institutions that cannot obtain credit elsewhere and the collapse of which would have serious implications for the economy. It took over this role from the private sector "clearing houses" which operated during the [Free Banking Era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_central_banking_in_the_United_States#1837%E2%80%931862:_%22Free_Banking%22_Era "History of central banking in the United States"); whether public or private, the availability of liquidity was intended to prevent bank runs.<sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-32">[30]</a></sup>

#### Fluctuations\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Fluctuations")\]

Through its [discount window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discount_window "Discount window") and credit operations, Reserve Banks provide liquidity to banks to meet short-term needs stemming from seasonal fluctuations in deposits or unexpected withdrawals. Longer-term liquidity may also be provided in exceptional circumstances. The rate the Fed charges banks for these loans is called the discount rate (officially the primary credit rate).

By making these loans, the Fed serves as a buffer against unexpected day-to-day fluctuations in reserve demand and supply. This contributes to the effective functioning of the banking system, alleviates pressure in the reserves market and reduces the extent of unexpected movements in the interest rates.<sup id="cite_ref-dfeverydayecon_33-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-dfeverydayecon-33">[31]</a></sup> For example, on September 16, 2008, the Federal Reserve Board authorized an $85 billion loan to stave off the bankruptcy of international insurance giant [American International Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_International_Group "American International Group") (AIG).<sup id="cite_ref-Federal_Reserve-AIG_Press_Release-2008-09-16_34-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-Federal_Reserve-AIG_Press_Release-2008-09-16-34">[32]</a></sup>

### Central bank\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Central bank")\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/US_one_dollar_bill%2C_obverse%2C_series_2009.jpg/220px-US_one_dollar_bill%2C_obverse%2C_series_2009.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:US_one_dollar_bill,_obverse,_series_2009.jpg)

Obverse of a Federal Reserve [$1 note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_one-dollar_bill "United States one-dollar bill") issued in 2009

In its role as the [central bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank "Central bank") of the United States, the Fed serves as a banker's bank and as the government's bank. As the banker's bank, it helps to assure the safety and efficiency of the payments system. As the government's bank or fiscal agent, the Fed processes a variety of financial transactions involving trillions of dollars. Just as an individual might keep an account at a bank, the [U.S. Treasury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury "United States Department of the Treasury") keeps a checking account with the Federal Reserve, through which incoming federal tax deposits and outgoing government payments are handled. As part of this service relationship, the Fed sells and redeems [U.S. government securities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasury_security "Treasury security") such as savings bonds and Treasury bills, notes and bonds. It also issues the nation's [coin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coins_of_the_United_States_dollar "Coins of the United States dollar") and [paper currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_note "Federal Reserve note"). The U.S. Treasury, through its [Bureau of the Mint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Mint "United States Mint") and [Bureau of Engraving and Printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Engraving_and_Printing "Bureau of Engraving and Printing"), actually produces the nation's cash supply and, in effect, sells the paper currency to the Federal Reserve Banks at manufacturing cost, and the coins at face value. The Federal Reserve Banks then distribute it to other financial institutions in various ways.<sup id="cite_ref-Fed_currency_35-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-Fed_currency-35">[33]</a></sup> During the [Fiscal Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_Year "Fiscal Year") 2020, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing delivered 57.95 billion notes at an average cost of 7.4 cents per note.<sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-36">[34]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-37">[35]</a></sup>

#### Federal funds\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Federal funds")\]

Federal funds are the reserve balances (also called [Federal Reserve Deposits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Deposits "Federal Reserve Deposits")) that private banks keep at their local Federal Reserve Bank.<sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-38">[36]</a></sup> These balances are the namesake reserves of the Federal Reserve System. The purpose of keeping funds at a Federal Reserve Bank is to have a mechanism for private banks to lend funds to one another. This market for funds plays an important role in the Federal Reserve System as it is the basis for its monetary policy work. Monetary policy is put into effect partly by influencing how much interest the private banks charge each other for the lending of these funds.

Federal reserve accounts contain federal reserve credit, which can be converted into [federal reserve notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_reserve_note "Federal reserve note"). Private banks maintain their [bank reserves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_reserves "Bank reserves") in federal reserve accounts.

### Bank regulation\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Bank regulation")\]

The Federal Reserve regulates private banks. The system was designed out of a compromise between the competing philosophies of privatization and government regulation. In 2006 [Donald L. Kohn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_L._Kohn "Donald L. Kohn"), vice chairman of the board of governors, summarized the history of this compromise:<sup id="cite_ref-39"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-39">[37]</a></sup>

> Agrarian and progressive interests, led by William Jennings Bryan, favored a central bank under public, rather than banker, control. But the vast majority of the nation's bankers, concerned about government intervention in the banking business, opposed a central bank structure directed by political appointees. The legislation that Congress ultimately adopted in 1913 reflected a hard-fought battle to balance these two competing views and created the hybrid public-private, centralized-decentralized structure that we have today.

The balance between private interests and government can also be seen in the structure of the system. Private banks elect members of the board of directors at their regional Federal Reserve Bank while the members of the board of governors are selected by the [president of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States "President of the United States") and confirmed by the [Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate "United States Senate").

#### Government regulation and supervision\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Government regulation and supervision")\]

[Ben Bernanke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Bernanke "Ben Bernanke") (lower right), former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, at a [House Financial Services Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Financial_Services_Committee "House Financial Services Committee") hearing on February 10, 2009. Members of the board frequently testify before congressional committees such as this one. The Senate equivalent of the House Financial Services Committee is the [Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_Committee_on_Banking,_Housing,_and_Urban_Affairs "Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs").

The Federal Banking Agency Audit Act, enacted in 1978 as Public Law 95-320 and 31 U.S.C. section 714 establish that the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Reserve banks may be audited by the [Government Accountability Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Accountability_Office "Government Accountability Office") (GAO).<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-40">[38]</a></sup>

The GAO has authority to audit check-processing, currency storage and shipments, and some regulatory and bank examination functions, however, there are restrictions to what the GAO may audit. Under the Federal Banking Agency Audit Act, 31 U.S.C. section 714(b), audits of the Federal Reserve Board and Federal Reserve banks do not include (1) transactions for or with a foreign central bank or government or non-private international financing organization; (2) deliberations, decisions, or actions on monetary policy matters; (3) transactions made under the direction of the Federal Open Market Committee; or (4) a part of a discussion or communication among or between members of the board of governors and officers and employees of the Federal Reserve System related to items (1), (2), or (3). See Federal Reserve System Audits: Restrictions on GAO's Access (GAO/T-GGD-94-44), statement of Charles A. Bowsher.<sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-41">[39]</a></sup>

The board of governors in the Federal Reserve System has a number of supervisory and regulatory responsibilities in the U.S. banking system, but not complete responsibility. A general description of the types of regulation and supervision involved in the U.S. banking system is given by the Federal Reserve:<sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-42">[40]</a></sup>

> The Board also plays a major role in the supervision and regulation of the U.S. banking system. It has supervisory responsibilities for state-chartered banks<sup id="cite_ref-43"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-43">[41]</a></sup> that are members of the Federal Reserve System, [bank holding companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_holding_company "Bank holding company") (companies that control banks), the foreign activities of member banks, the U.S. activities of foreign banks, and [Edge Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_Act "Edge Act") and "agreement corporations" (limited-purpose institutions that engage in a foreign banking business). The Board and, under delegated authority, the Federal Reserve Banks, supervise approximately 900 state member banks and 5,000 bank holding companies. Other federal agencies also serve as the primary federal supervisors of commercial banks; the [Office of the Comptroller of the Currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_the_Comptroller_of_the_Currency "Office of the Comptroller of the Currency") supervises national banks, and the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Deposit_Insurance_Corporation "Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation") supervises [state banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_bank_(United_States) "State bank (United States)") that are not members of the Federal Reserve System.
> 
> Some regulations issued by the Board apply to the entire banking industry, whereas others apply only to member banks, that is, [state banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_bank_(United_States) "State bank (United States)") that have chosen to join the Federal Reserve System and national banks, which by law must be members of the System. The Board also issues regulations to carry out major federal laws governing [consumer credit protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_protection "Consumer protection"), such as the [Truth in Lending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_in_Lending_Act "Truth in Lending Act"), [Equal Credit Opportunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Credit_Opportunity_Act "Equal Credit Opportunity Act"), and [Home Mortgage Disclosure Acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act "Home Mortgage Disclosure Act"). Many of these consumer protection regulations apply to various lenders outside the banking industry as well as to banks.
> 
> Members of the Board of Governors are in continual contact with other policy makers in government. They frequently testify before [congressional committees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_committee "Congressional committee") on the economy, [monetary policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy "Monetary policy"), [banking supervision and regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_regulation "Bank regulation"), [consumer credit protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_protection "Consumer protection"), [financial markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market "Financial market"), and other matters.
> 
> The Board has regular contact with members of the President's [Council of Economic Advisers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Economic_Advisers "Council of Economic Advisers") and other key economic officials. The Chair also meets from time to time with the [President of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States "President of the United States") and has regular meetings with the [Secretary of the Treasury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_the_Treasury "Secretary of the Treasury"). The Chair has formal responsibilities in the international arena as well.

##### Regulatory and oversight responsibilities\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Regulatory and oversight responsibilities")\]

The board of directors of each Federal Reserve Bank District also has regulatory and supervisory responsibilities. If the board of directors of a district bank has judged that a member bank is performing or behaving poorly, it will report this to the board of governors. This policy is described in law:

> Each Federal reserve bank shall keep itself informed of the general character and amount of the loans and investments of its member banks with a view to ascertaining whether undue use is being made of bank credit for the speculative carrying of or trading in securities, real estate, or commodities, or for any other purpose inconsistent with the maintenance of sound credit conditions; and, in determining whether to grant or refuse advances, rediscounts, or other credit accommodations, the Federal reserve bank shall give consideration to such information. The chairman of the Federal reserve bank shall report to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System any such undue use of bank credit by any member bank, together with his recommendation. Whenever, in the judgment of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, any member bank is making such undue use of bank credit, the Board may, in its discretion, after reasonable notice and an opportunity for a hearing, suspend such bank from the use of the credit facilities of the Federal Reserve System and may terminate such suspension or may renew it from time to time.<sup id="cite_ref-44"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-44">[42]</a></sup>

### National payments system\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: National payments system")\]

The Federal Reserve plays a role in the U.S. payments system. The twelve Federal Reserve Banks provide banking services to depository institutions and to the federal government. For depository institutions, they maintain accounts and provide various payment services, including collecting checks, electronically transferring funds, and distributing and receiving currency and coin. For the federal government, the Reserve Banks act as fiscal agents, paying Treasury checks; processing electronic payments; and issuing, transferring, and redeeming U.S. government securities.<sup id="cite_ref-45"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-45">[43]</a></sup>

In the [Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depository_Institutions_Deregulation_and_Monetary_Control_Act "Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act") of 1980, Congress reaffirmed that the Federal Reserve should promote an efficient nationwide payments system. The act subjects all depository institutions, not just member commercial banks, to reserve requirements and grants them equal access to Reserve Bank payment services. The Federal Reserve plays a role in the nation's retail and wholesale payments systems by providing financial services to depository institutions. Retail payments are generally for relatively small-dollar amounts and often involve a depository institution's retail clients—individuals and smaller businesses. The Reserve Banks' retail services include distributing currency and coin, collecting checks, electronically transferring funds through [FedACH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedACH "FedACH") (the Federal Reserve's [automated clearing house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_clearing_house "Automated clearing house") system), and beginning in 2023, facilitating [instant payments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_payment "Instant payment") using the [FedNow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedNow "FedNow") service. By contrast, wholesale payments are generally for large-dollar amounts and often involve a depository institution's large corporate customers or counterparties, including other financial institutions. The Reserve Banks' wholesale services include electronically transferring funds through the [Fedwire Funds Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedwire "Fedwire") and transferring securities issued by the U.S. government, its agencies, and certain other entities through the Fedwire Securities Service.

Organization of the Federal Reserve System

The Federal Reserve System has a "unique structure that is both public and private"<sup id="cite_ref-46"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-46">[44]</a></sup> and is described as "[independent within the government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_agencies_of_the_United_States_government "Independent agencies of the United States government")" rather than "[independent of government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatization "Privatization")".<sup id="cite_ref-auto_26-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-auto-26">[24]</a></sup> The System does not require public funding, and derives its authority and purpose from the [Federal Reserve Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Act "Federal Reserve Act"), which was passed by Congress in 1913 and is subject to Congressional modification or repeal.<sup id="cite_ref-FRBPhilPubPriv_47-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-FRBPhilPubPriv-47">[45]</a></sup> The four main components of the Federal Reserve System are (1) the board of governors, (2) the Federal Open Market Committee, (3) the twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks, and (4) the member banks throughout the country.

### Federal Open Market Committee\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Federal Open Market Committee")\]

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) consists of 12 members, seven from the board of governors and 5 of the regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents. The FOMC oversees and sets policy on [open market operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_market_operations "Open market operations"), the principal tool of national monetary policy. These operations affect the amount of Federal Reserve balances available to depository institutions, thereby influencing overall monetary and credit conditions. The FOMC also directs operations undertaken by the Federal Reserve in foreign exchange markets. The FOMC must reach consensus on all decisions. The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is a permanent member of the FOMC; the presidents of the other banks rotate membership at two- and three-year intervals. All Regional Reserve Bank presidents contribute to the committee's assessment of the economy and of policy options, but only the five presidents who are then members of the FOMC vote on policy decisions. The FOMC determines its own internal organization and, by tradition, elects the chair of the board of governors as its chair and the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as its vice chair. Formal meetings typically are held eight times each year in Washington, D.C. Nonvoting Reserve Bank presidents also participate in Committee deliberations and discussion. The FOMC generally meets eight times a year in telephone consultations and other meetings are held when needed.<sup id="cite_ref-69"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-69">[67]</a></sup>

There is very strong consensus among economists against politicising the FOMC.<sup id="cite_ref-igmchicago.org_70-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-igmchicago.org-70">[68]</a></sup>

### Federal Advisory Council\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Federal Advisory Council")\]

The Federal Advisory Council, composed of twelve representatives of the banking industry, advises the board on all matters within its jurisdiction.

The 12 Reserve Banks buildings in 1936

There are 12 Federal Reserve Banks, each of which is responsible for member banks located in its district. They are located in [Boston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_Boston "Federal Reserve Bank of Boston"), [New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_New_York "Federal Reserve Bank of New York"), [Philadelphia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_Philadelphia "Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia"), [Cleveland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_Cleveland "Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland"), [Richmond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_Richmond "Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond"), [Atlanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_Atlanta "Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta"), [Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_Chicago "Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago"), [St. Louis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_St._Louis "Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis"), [Minneapolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_Minneapolis "Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis"), [Kansas City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_Kansas_City "Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City"), [Dallas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_Dallas "Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas"), and [San Francisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_San_Francisco "Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco"). The size of each district was set based upon the population distribution of the United States when the Federal Reserve Act was passed.

The charter and organization of each Federal Reserve Bank is established by law and cannot be altered by the member banks. Member banks do, however, elect six of the nine members of the Federal Reserve Banks' boards of directors.<sup id="cite_ref-dfeverydayecon_33-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-dfeverydayecon-33">[31]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-R000107_71-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-R000107-71">[69]</a></sup>

Each regional Bank has a president, who is the chief executive officer of their Bank. Each regional Reserve Bank's president is nominated by their Bank's board of directors, but the nomination is contingent upon approval by the board of governors. Presidents serve five-year terms and may be reappointed.<sup id="cite_ref-FRB_pres_72-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-FRB_pres-72">[70]</a></sup>

Each regional Bank's board consists of nine members. Members are broken down into three classes: A, B, and C. There are three board members in each class. Class A members are chosen by the regional Bank's shareholders, and are intended to represent member banks' interests. Member banks are divided into three categories: large, medium, and small. Each category elects one of the three class A board members. Class B board members are also nominated by the region's member banks, but class B board members are supposed to represent the interests of the public. Lastly, class C board members are appointed by the board of governors, and are also intended to represent the interests of the public.<sup id="cite_ref-73"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-73">[71]</a></sup>

#### Legal status of regional Federal Reserve Banks\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Legal status of regional Federal Reserve Banks")\]

The Federal Reserve Banks have an intermediate legal status, with some features of private corporations and some features of public federal agencies. The United States has an interest in the Federal Reserve Banks as tax-exempt federally created instrumentalities whose profits belong to the federal government, but this interest is not proprietary.<sup id="cite_ref-Scott_8th_Cir._2005_74-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-Scott_8th_Cir._2005-74">[72]</a></sup> In _Lewis v. United States_,<sup id="cite_ref-Lewis-vs-U.S._75-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-Lewis-vs-U.S.-75">[73]</a></sup> the [United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Ninth_Circuit "United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit") stated that: "The Reserve Banks are not federal instrumentalities for purposes of the FTCA \[the [Federal Tort Claims Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Tort_Claims_Act "Federal Tort Claims Act")\], but are independent, privately owned and locally controlled corporations." The opinion went on to say, however, that: "The Reserve Banks have properly been held to be federal instrumentalities for some purposes." Another relevant decision is _Scott v. Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City_,<sup id="cite_ref-Scott_8th_Cir._2005_74-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-Scott_8th_Cir._2005-74">[72]</a></sup> in which the distinction is made between Federal Reserve Banks, which are federally created instrumentalities, and the board of governors, which is a federal agency.

Regarding the structural relationship between the twelve Federal Reserve banks and the various commercial (member) banks, political science professor Michael D. Reagan has written:<sup id="cite_ref-76"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-76">[74]</a></sup>

> ... the "ownership" of the Reserve Banks by the commercial banks is symbolic; they do not exercise the proprietary control associated with the concept of ownership nor share, beyond the statutory dividend, in Reserve Bank "profits." ... Bank ownership and election at the base are therefore devoid of substantive significance, despite the superficial appearance of private bank control that the formal arrangement creates.

### Member banks\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Member banks")\]

A member bank is a private institution and owns stock in its regional Federal Reserve Bank. All nationally chartered banks hold stock in one of the Federal Reserve Banks. State chartered banks may choose to be members (and hold stock in their regional Federal Reserve bank) upon meeting certain standards.

The amount of stock a member bank must own is equal to 3% of its combined capital and surplus.<sup id="cite_ref-77"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-77">[75]</a></sup> However, holding stock in a Federal Reserve bank is not like owning stock in a publicly traded company. These stocks cannot be sold or traded, and member banks do not control the Federal Reserve Bank as a result of owning this stock. From their Regional Bank, member banks with $10 billion or less in assets receive a dividend of 6%, while member banks with more than $10 billion in assets receive the lesser of 6% or the current 10-year Treasury auction rate.<sup id="cite_ref-78"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-78">[76]</a></sup> The remainder of the regional Federal Reserve Banks' profits is given over to the [United States Treasury Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_Department "United States Treasury Department"). In 2015, the Federal Reserve Banks made a profit of $100.2 billion and distributed $2.5 billion in dividends to member banks as well as returning $97.7 billion to the U.S. Treasury.<sup id="cite_ref-frs_bog_net_income_press_lease_24-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-frs_bog_net_income_press_lease-24">[22]</a></sup>

About 38% of U.S. banks are members of their regional Federal Reserve Bank.<sup id="cite_ref-auto_26-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-auto-26">[24]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-79"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-79">[77]</a></sup>

### Accountability\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Accountability")\]

An external auditor selected by the audit committee of the Federal Reserve System regularly audits the Board of Governors and the Federal Reserve Banks. The GAO will audit some activities of the Board of Governors. These audits do not cover "most of the Fed's monetary policy actions or decisions, including discount window lending (direct loans to financial institutions), open-market operations and any other transactions made under the direction of the Federal Open Market Committee" ...\[nor may the GAO audit\] "dealings with foreign governments and other central banks."<sup id="cite_ref-80"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-80">[78]</a></sup>

## Monetary policy\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Monetary policy")\]

The term "[monetary policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy "Monetary policy")" refers to the actions undertaken by a central bank, such as the Federal Reserve, to influence economic activity (the [overall demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregate_demand "Aggregate demand") for goods and services) to help promote national economic goals. The [Federal Reserve Act of 1913](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Act_of_1913 "Federal Reserve Act of 1913") gave the Federal Reserve authority to set monetary policy in the United States. The Fed's mandate for monetary policy is commonly known as the dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and stable prices, the latter being interpreted as a stable inflation rate of 2 percent per year on average. The Fed's monetary policy influences economic activity by influencing the general level of [interest rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate "Interest rate") in the economy, which again via the [monetary transmission mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_transmission_mechanism "Monetary transmission mechanism") affects households' and firms' demand for goods and services and in turn employment and inflation.<sup id="cite_ref-goals_of_MP_29-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-goals_of_MP-29">[27]</a></sup>

### Interbank lending\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Interbank lending")\]

The Federal Reserve sets monetary policy by influencing the [federal funds rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate "Federal funds rate"), which is the rate of interbank lending of [reserve balances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Deposits "Federal Reserve Deposits"). The rate that banks charge each other for these loans is determined in the [interbank market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interbank_lending_market "Interbank lending market"), and the Federal Reserve influences this rate through the "tools" of monetary policy described in the [_Tools_ section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System#Monetary_policy "Federal Reserve System") below. The federal funds rate is a short-term interest rate that the FOMC focuses on, which affects the longer-term interest rates throughout the economy. The Federal Reserve explained the implementation of its monetary policy in 2021:

> The FOMC has the ability to influence the federal funds rate–and thus the cost of short-term interbank credit–by changing the rate of interest the Fed pays on reserve balances that banks hold at the Fed. A bank is unlikely to lend to another bank (or to any of its customers) at an interest rate lower than the rate that the bank can earn on reserve balances held at the Fed. And because overall reserve balances are currently abundant, if a bank wants to borrow reserve balances, it likely will be able to do so without having to pay a rate much above the rate of interest paid by the Fed.<sup id="cite_ref-goals_of_MP_29-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-goals_of_MP-29">[27]</a></sup>

Changes in the target for the federal funds rate affect overall financial conditions through various channels, including subsequent changes in the market interest rates that commercial banks and other lenders charge on short-term and longer-term loans, and changes in [asset prices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_price "Asset price") and in currency [exchange rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate "Exchange rate"), which again affects [private consumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_consumption "Private consumption"), [investment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment "Investment") and [net export](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_export "Net export"). By easening or tightening the stance of monetary policy, i.e. lowering or raising its target for the federal funds rate, the Fed can either spur or restrain growth in the overall US demand for goods and services.<sup id="cite_ref-goals_of_MP_29-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-goals_of_MP-29">[27]</a></sup>

### Tools\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Tools")\]

There are four main tools of monetary policy that the Federal Reserve uses to implement its monetary policy:<sup id="cite_ref-Fed_86-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-Fed-86">[84]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-87"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-87">[85]</a></sup>

#### Federal funds rate\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Federal funds rate")\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Federal_funds_rate_history_and_recessions.png/610px-Federal_funds_rate_history_and_recessions.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Federal_funds_rate_history_and_recessions.png)

The Federal Reserve System implements [monetary policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy "Monetary policy") largely by targeting the [federal funds rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate "Federal funds rate"). This is the [interest rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate "Interest rate") that banks charge each other for overnight loans of [federal funds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds "Federal funds"), which are the reserves held by banks at the Fed. This rate is actually determined by the market and is not explicitly mandated by the Fed. The Fed therefore tries to align the effective federal funds rate with the targeted rate, mainly by adjusting its IORB rate.<sup id="cite_ref-RIP_MM_90-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-RIP_MM-90">[88]</a></sup> The Federal Reserve System usually adjusts the federal funds rate target by 0.25% or 0.50% at a time.

#### Interest on reserve balances\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Interest on reserve balances")\]

The interest on reserve balances (IORB) is the interest that the Fed pays on funds held by commercial banks in their reserve balance accounts at the individual Federal Reserve System banks. It is an administrated interest rate (i.e. set directly by the Fed as opposed to a [market interest rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_interest_rate "Market interest rate") which is determined by the forces of supply and demand).<sup id="cite_ref-RIP_MM_90-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-RIP_MM-90">[88]</a></sup> As banks are unlikely to lend their reserves in the FFR market for less than they get paid by the Fed, the IORB guides the effective FFR and is used as the primary tool of the Fed's monetary policy.<sup id="cite_ref-new_tools_91-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-new_tools-91">[89]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-RIP_MM_90-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-RIP_MM-90">[88]</a></sup>

#### Open market operations\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Open market operations")\]

Open market operations are done through the sale and purchase of [United States Treasury security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security "United States Treasury security"), sometimes called "Treasury bills" or more informally "T-bills" or "Treasuries". The Federal Reserve buys Treasury bills from its primary dealers, which have accounts at depository institutions.<sup id="cite_ref-FRB_of_NY_92-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-FRB_of_NY-92">[90]</a></sup>

The Federal Reserve's objective for open market operations has varied over the years. During the 1980s, the focus gradually shifted toward attaining a specified level of the [federal funds rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate "Federal funds rate") (the rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans of federal funds, which are the reserves held by banks at the Fed), a process that was largely complete by the end of the decade.<sup id="cite_ref-93"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-93">[91]</a></sup>

Until the [2007–2008 financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%E2%80%932008_financial_crisis "2007–2008 financial crisis"), the Fed used open market operations as its primary tool to adjust the supply of reserve balances in order to keep the federal funds rate around the Fed's target.<sup id="cite_ref-94"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-94">[92]</a></sup> This regime is also known as a limited reserves regime.<sup id="cite_ref-new_tools_91-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-new_tools-91">[89]</a></sup> After the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has adopted a so-called ample reserves regime where open market operations leading to modest changes in the supply of reserves are no longer effective in influencing the FFR. Instead the Fed uses its administered rates, in particular the IORB rate, to influence the FFR.<sup id="cite_ref-new_tools_91-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-new_tools-91">[89]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-RIP_MM_90-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-RIP_MM-90">[88]</a></sup> However, open market operations are still an important maintenance tool in the overall framework of the conduct of monetary policy as they are used for ensuring that reserves remain ample.<sup id="cite_ref-new_tools_91-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-new_tools-91">[89]</a></sup>

##### Repurchase agreements\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Repurchase agreements")\]

To smooth temporary or cyclical changes in the money supply, the desk engages in [repurchase agreements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repurchase_agreement "Repurchase agreement") (repos) with its primary dealers. Repos are essentially secured, short-term lending by the Fed. On the day of the transaction, the Fed deposits money in a [primary dealer's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_dealers "Primary dealers") reserve account, and receives the promised securities as [collateral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_(finance) "Collateral (finance)"). When the transaction matures, the process unwinds: the Fed returns the collateral and charges the [primary dealer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_dealer "Primary dealer")'s reserve account for the principal and accrued interest. The term of the repo (the time between settlement and maturity) can vary from 1 day (called an overnight repo) to 65 days.<sup id="cite_ref-95"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-95">[93]</a></sup>

#### Discount window and discount rate\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=29 "Edit section: Discount window and discount rate")\]

The Federal Reserve System also directly sets the **discount rate**, which is the interest rate for "discount window lending", overnight loans that member banks borrow directly from the Fed. This rate is generally set at a rate close to 100 [basis points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point "Basis point") above the target federal funds rate. The idea is to encourage banks to seek alternative funding before using the "discount rate" option.<sup id="cite_ref-96"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-96">[94]</a></sup> The equivalent operation by the [European Central Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank "European Central Bank") is referred to as the "[marginal lending facility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_lending_facility "Marginal lending facility")".<sup id="cite_ref-97"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-97">[95]</a></sup>

Both the discount rate and the federal funds rate influence the [prime rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_rate "Prime rate"), which is usually about 3 percentage points higher than the federal funds rate.

#### Term Deposit facility\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=30 "Edit section: Term Deposit facility")\]

The Term Deposit facility is a program through which the Federal Reserve Banks offer interest-bearing [term deposits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_deposit "Time deposit") to eligible institutions.<sup id="cite_ref-98"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-98">[96]</a></sup> It is intended to facilitate the implementation of monetary policy by providing a tool by which the Federal Reserve can manage the aggregate quantity of reserve balances held by depository institutions. Funds placed in term deposits are removed from the accounts of participating institutions for the life of the term deposit and thus drain reserve balances from the banking system. The program was announced December 9, 2009, and approved April 30, 2010, with an effective date of June 4, 2010.<sup id="cite_ref-99"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-99">[97]</a></sup> Fed Chair Ben S. Bernanke, testifying before the House Committee on Financial Services, stated that the Term Deposit Facility would be used to reverse the expansion of credit during the Great Recession, by drawing funds out of the money markets into the Federal Reserve Banks.<sup id="cite_ref-100"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-100">[98]</a></sup> It would therefore result in increased market interest rates, acting as a brake on economic activity and inflation.<sup id="cite_ref-101"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-101">[99]</a></sup> The Federal Reserve authorized up to five "small-value offerings" in 2010 as a pilot program.<sup id="cite_ref-102"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-102">[100]</a></sup> After three of the offering auctions were successfully completed, it was announced that small-value auctions would continue on an ongoing basis.<sup id="cite_ref-103"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-103">[101]</a></sup>

#### Quantitative Easing (QE) policy\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=31 "Edit section: Quantitative Easing (QE) policy")\]

A little-used tool of the Federal Reserve is the quantitative easing policy.<sup id="cite_ref-104"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-104">[102]</a></sup> Under that policy, the Federal Reserve buys back corporate bonds and mortgage backed securities held by banks or other financial institutions. This in effect puts money back into the financial institutions and allows them to make loans and conduct normal business. The bursting of the [United States housing bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_housing_bubble "United States housing bubble") prompted the Fed to buy mortgage-backed securities for the first time in November 2008. Over six weeks, a total of $1.25 trillion were purchased in order to stabilize the housing market, about one-fifth of all U.S. government-backed mortgages.<sup id="cite_ref-105"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-105">[103]</a></sup>

#### Expired policy tools\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=32 "Edit section: Expired policy tools")\]

##### Reserve requirements\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=33 "Edit section: Reserve requirements")\]

An instrument of monetary policy adjustment historically employed by the Federal Reserve System was the fractional [reserve requirement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_requirement "Reserve requirement"), also known as the required reserve ratio.<sup id="cite_ref-106"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-106">[104]</a></sup> The required reserve ratio set the balance that the Federal Reserve System required a depository institution to hold in the Federal Reserve Banks.<sup id="cite_ref-BoG_2005_pp=27_107-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-BoG_2005_pp=27-107">[105]</a></sup> The required reserve ratio was set by the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System.<sup id="cite_ref-108"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-108">[106]</a></sup> The reserve requirements have changed over time and some history of these changes is published by the Federal Reserve.<sup id="cite_ref-hist_resreq_109-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-hist_resreq-109">[107]</a></sup>

As a response to the financial crisis of 2008, the Federal Reserve started making interest payments on depository institutions' required and excess reserve balances. The payment of interest on excess reserves gave the central bank greater opportunity to address credit market conditions while maintaining the federal funds rate close to the target rate set by the FOMC.<sup id="cite_ref-110"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-110">[108]</a></sup> The reserve requirement did not play a significant role in the post-2008 interest-on-excess-reserves regime,<sup id="cite_ref-fed-zero-rr-pr_111-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-fed-zero-rr-pr-111">[109]</a></sup> and in March 2020, the reserve ratio was set to zero for all banks, which meant that no bank was required to hold any reserves, and hence the reserve requirement effectively ceased to exist.<sup id="cite_ref-fed-zero-rr_1-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-fed-zero-rr-1">[1]</a></sup>

##### Temporary policy tools during the financial crisis\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=34 "Edit section: Temporary policy tools during the financial crisis")\]

In order to address problems related to the [subprime mortgage crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis "Subprime mortgage crisis") and [United States housing bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_housing_bubble "United States housing bubble"), several new tools were created. The first new tool, called the [Term auction facility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_auction_facility "Term auction facility"), was added on December 12, 2007. It was announced as a temporary tool,<sup id="cite_ref-taffaq_112-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-taffaq-112">[110]</a></sup> but remained in place for a prolonged period of time.<sup id="cite_ref-113"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-113">[111]</a></sup> Creation of the second new tool, called the [Term Securities Lending Facility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_Securities_Lending_Facility "Term Securities Lending Facility"), was announced on March 11, 2008.<sup id="cite_ref-tslfannounce_114-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-tslfannounce-114">[112]</a></sup> The main difference between these two facilities was that the Term auction Facility was used to inject cash into the banking system whereas the Term securities Lending Facility was used to inject [treasury securities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasury_security "Treasury security") into the banking system.<sup id="cite_ref-115"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-115">[113]</a></sup> Creation of the third tool, called the [Primary Dealer Credit Facility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_Dealer_Credit_Facility "Primary Dealer Credit Facility") (PDCF), was announced on March 16, 2008.<sup id="cite_ref-116"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-116">[114]</a></sup> The PDCF was a fundamental change in Federal Reserve policy because it enabled the Fed to lend directly to [primary dealers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_dealer "Primary dealer"), which was previously against Fed policy.<sup id="cite_ref-117"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-117">[115]</a></sup> The differences between these three facilities was described by the Federal Reserve:<sup id="cite_ref-pdcffaq_118-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-pdcffaq-118">[116]</a></sup>

> The Term auction Facility program offers term funding to depository institutions via a bi-weekly auction, for fixed amounts of credit. The Term securities Lending Facility will be an auction for a fixed amount of lending of Treasury general collateral in exchange for OMO-eligible and AAA/Aaa rated private-label residential mortgage-backed securities. The Primary Dealer Credit Facility now allows eligible primary dealers to borrow at the existing Discount Rate for up to 120 days.

Some measures taken by the Federal Reserve to address the financial crisis had not been used since the [Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression "Great Depression").<sup id="cite_ref-119"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-119">[117]</a></sup>

##### Term auction facility\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=35 "Edit section: Term auction facility")\]

The Term auction Facility was a program in which the Federal Reserve auctioned term funds to depository institutions.<sup id="cite_ref-taffaq_112-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-taffaq-112">[110]</a></sup> The creation of this facility was announced by the Federal Reserve on December 12, 2007, and was done in conjunction with the [Bank of Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Canada "Bank of Canada"), the [Bank of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England "Bank of England"), the [European Central Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank "European Central Bank"), and the [Swiss National Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_National_Bank "Swiss National Bank") to address elevated pressures in short-term funding markets.<sup id="cite_ref-taf_120-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-taf-120">[118]</a></sup> The reason it was created was that banks were not lending funds to one another and banks in need of funds were refusing to go to the discount window. Banks were not lending money to each other because there was a fear that the loans would not be paid back. Banks refused to go to the discount window because it was usually associated with the stigma of bank failure.<sup id="cite_ref-121"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-121">[119]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-122"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-122">[120]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-123"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-123">[121]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-124"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-124">[122]</a></sup> Under the Term auction Facility, the identity of the banks in need of funds was protected in order to avoid the stigma of bank failure.<sup id="cite_ref-mwtaf_125-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-mwtaf-125">[123]</a></sup> [Foreign exchange swap lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank_liquidity_swap "Central bank liquidity swap") with the [European Central Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank "European Central Bank") and [Swiss National Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_National_Bank "Swiss National Bank") were opened so the banks in Europe could have access to [U.S. dollars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._dollar "U.S. dollar").<sup id="cite_ref-mwtaf_125-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-mwtaf-125">[123]</a></sup> The final Term Auction Facility auction was carried out on March 8, 2010.<sup id="cite_ref-126"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-126">[124]</a></sup>

##### Term securities lending facility\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=36 "Edit section: Term securities lending facility")\]

The Term securities Lending Facility was a 28-day facility that offered Treasury general collateral to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's primary dealers in exchange for other program-eligible collateral. It was intended to promote liquidity in the financing markets for Treasury and other collateral and thus to foster the functioning of financial markets more generally.<sup id="cite_ref-tslffaq_127-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-tslffaq-127">[125]</a></sup> Like the Term auction Facility, the TSLF was done in conjunction with the [Bank of Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Canada "Bank of Canada"), the [Bank of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England "Bank of England"), the [European Central Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank "European Central Bank"), and the [Swiss National Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_National_Bank "Swiss National Bank"). The resource allowed dealers to switch debt that was less liquid for U.S. government securities that were easily tradable. The currency swap lines with the [European Central Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank "European Central Bank") and [Swiss National Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_National_Bank "Swiss National Bank") were increased. The TSLF was closed on February 1, 2010.<sup id="cite_ref-128"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-128">[126]</a></sup>

##### Primary dealer credit facility\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=37 "Edit section: Primary dealer credit facility")\]

The Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) was an overnight loan facility that provided funding to primary dealers in exchange for a specified range of eligible collateral and was intended to foster the functioning of financial markets more generally.<sup id="cite_ref-pdcffaq_118-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-pdcffaq-118">[116]</a></sup> It ceased extending credit on March 31, 2021.<sup id="cite_ref-129"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-129">[127]</a></sup>

##### Asset Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=38 "Edit section: Asset Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility")\]

The Asset Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (ABCPMMMFLF) was also called the AMLF. The Facility began operations on September 22, 2008, and was closed on February 1, 2010.<sup id="cite_ref-130"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-130">[128]</a></sup>

All U.S. depository institutions, bank holding companies (parent companies or U.S. broker-dealer affiliates), or U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks were eligible to borrow under this facility pursuant to the discretion of the FRBB.

Collateral eligible for pledge under the Facility was required to meet the following criteria:

-   was purchased by Borrower on or after September 19, 2008, from a registered investment company that held itself out as a money market mutual fund;
-   was purchased by Borrower at the Fund's acquisition cost as adjusted for amortization of premium or accretion of discount on the ABCP through the date of its purchase by Borrower;
-   was rated at the time pledged to FRBB, not lower than A1, F1, or P1 by at least two major rating agencies or, if rated by only one major rating agency, the ABCP must have been rated within the top rating category by that agency;
-   was issued by an entity organized under the laws of the United States or a political subdivision thereof under a program that was in existence on September 18, 2008; and
-   had stated maturity that did not exceed 120 days if the Borrower was a bank or 270 days for non-bank Borrowers.

##### Commercial Paper Funding Facility\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=39 "Edit section: Commercial Paper Funding Facility")\]

On October 7, 2008, the Federal Reserve further expanded the collateral it would loan against to include commercial paper using the [Commercial Paper Funding Facility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Paper_Funding_Facility "Commercial Paper Funding Facility") (CPFF). The action made the Fed a crucial source of credit for non-financial businesses in addition to commercial banks and investment firms. Fed officials said they would buy as much of the debt as necessary to get the market functioning again. They refused to say how much that might be, but they noted that around $1.3 trillion worth of commercial paper would qualify. There was $1.61 trillion in outstanding commercial paper, seasonally adjusted, on the market as of 1 October 2008, according to the most recent data from the Fed. That was down from $1.70 trillion in the previous week. Since the summer of 2007, the market had shrunk from more than $2.2 trillion.<sup id="cite_ref-131"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-131">[129]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-132"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-132">[130]</a></sup> This program lent out a total $738 billion before it was closed. Forty-five out of 81 of the companies participating in this program were foreign firms. Research shows that [Troubled Asset Relief Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troubled_Asset_Relief_Program "Troubled Asset Relief Program") (TARP) recipients were twice as likely to participate in the program than other commercial paper issuers who did not take advantage of the TARP bailout. The Fed incurred no losses from the CPFF.<sup id="cite_ref-133"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-133">[131]</a></sup>

### Central banking in the United States, 1791–1913\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=41 "Edit section: Central banking in the United States, 1791–1913")\]

The first attempt at a national currency was during the [American Revolutionary War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War "American Revolutionary War"). In 1775, the Continental Congress, as well as the states, began issuing paper currency, calling the bills "[Continentals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_American_currency "Early American currency")".<sup id="cite_ref-135"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-135">[133]</a></sup> The Continentals were backed only by future tax revenue, and were used to help finance the Revolutionary War. Overprinting, as well as British counterfeiting, caused the value of the Continental to diminish quickly. This experience with paper money led the United States to strip the power to issue Bills of Credit (paper money) from a draft of the new Constitution on August 16, 1787,<sup id="cite_ref-136"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-136">[134]</a></sup> as well as banning such issuance by the various states, and limiting the states' ability to make anything but gold or silver coin legal tender on August 28.<sup id="cite_ref-137"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-137">[135]</a></sup>

In 1791, the government granted the [First Bank of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Bank_of_the_United_States "First Bank of the United States") a charter to operate as the U.S. central bank until 1811.<sup id="cite_ref-A_Brief_History_of_Our_Nation's_Paper_Money_138-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-A_Brief_History_of_Our_Nation's_Paper_Money-138">[136]</a></sup> The First Bank of the United States came to an end under [President Madison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison "James Madison") when Congress refused to renew its charter. The [Second Bank of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Bank_of_the_United_States "Second Bank of the United States") was established in 1816, and lost its authority to be the central bank of the U.S. twenty years later under [President Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jackson "Andrew Jackson") when its charter expired. Both banks were based upon the Bank of England.<sup id="cite_ref-139"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-139">[137]</a></sup> Ultimately, a third national bank, known as the Federal Reserve, was established in 1913 and still exists to this day.

#### First Central Bank, 1791 and Second Central Bank, 1816\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=42 "Edit section: First Central Bank, 1791 and Second Central Bank, 1816")\]

The first U.S. institution with central banking responsibilities was the [First Bank of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Bank_of_the_United_States "First Bank of the United States"), chartered by Congress and signed into law by President [George Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington "George Washington") on February 25, 1791, at the urging of [Alexander Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton "Alexander Hamilton"). This was done despite strong opposition from [Thomas Jefferson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson "Thomas Jefferson") and [James Madison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison "James Madison"), among numerous others. The charter was for twenty years and expired in 1811 under President Madison, when Congress refused to renew it.<sup id="cite_ref-boshistory_140-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-boshistory-140">[138]</a></sup>

In 1816, however, Madison revived it in the form of the [Second Bank of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Bank_of_the_United_States "Second Bank of the United States"). Years later, early renewal of the bank's charter became the primary issue in the reelection of President [Andrew Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jackson "Andrew Jackson"). After Jackson, who was opposed to the central bank, was reelected, he pulled the government's funds out of the bank. Jackson was the only President to completely pay off the national debt<sup id="cite_ref-141"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-141">[139]</a></sup> but his efforts to close the bank contributed to the [Panic of 1837](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1837 "Panic of 1837").

The main motivation for the third central banking system came from the [Panic of 1907](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1907 "Panic of 1907"), which caused a renewed desire among legislators, economists, and bankers for an overhaul of the monetary system.<sup id="cite_ref-FDS-H-04_8-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-FDS-H-04-8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FDS-H-05_9-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-FDS-H-05-9">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FDS-H-06_10-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-FDS-H-06-10">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-herrickpanic_142-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-herrickpanic-142">[140]</a></sup> During the last quarter of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, the United States economy went through a series of [financial panics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_panics "Financial panics").<sup id="cite_ref-EFlaherty_143-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-EFlaherty-143">[141]</a></sup> According to many economists, the previous national banking system had two main weaknesses: an [inelastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(economics) "Elasticity (economics)") currency and a lack of liquidity.<sup id="cite_ref-EFlaherty_143-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-EFlaherty-143">[141]</a></sup> In 1908, Congress enacted the [Aldrich–Vreeland Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldrich%E2%80%93Vreeland_Act "Aldrich–Vreeland Act"), which provided for an emergency currency and established the [National Monetary Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Monetary_Commission "National Monetary Commission") to study banking and currency reform.<sup id="cite_ref-mnwarburg_144-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-mnwarburg-144">[142]</a></sup> The National Monetary Commission returned with recommendations which were repeatedly rejected by Congress.

##### Federal Reserve Act, 1913\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=44 "Edit section: Federal Reserve Act, 1913")\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Fed_Reserve.JPG/300px-Fed_Reserve.JPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fed_Reserve.JPG)

Newspaper clipping, December 24, 1913

The head of the bipartisan National Monetary Commission was financial expert and Senate [Republican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States) "Republican Party (United States)") leader [Nelson Aldrich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Aldrich "Nelson Aldrich"). Aldrich set up two commissions – one to study the American monetary system in depth and the other, headed by Aldrich himself, to study the European central banking systems and report on them.<sup id="cite_ref-mnwarburg_144-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-mnwarburg-144">[142]</a></sup>

In early November 1910, Aldrich met with five well known members of the New York banking community to devise a central banking bill. [Paul Warburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Warburg "Paul Warburg"), an attendee of the meeting and longtime advocate of central banking in the U.S., later wrote that Aldrich was "bewildered at all that he had absorbed abroad and he was faced with the difficult task of writing a highly technical bill while being harassed by the daily grind of his parliamentary duties".<sup id="cite_ref-Warburg_document_148-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-Warburg_document-148">[146]</a></sup> After ten days of deliberation, the bill, which would later be referred to as the "Aldrich Plan", was agreed upon. It had several key components, including a central bank with a Washington-based headquarters and fifteen branches located throughout the U.S. in geographically strategic locations, and a uniform elastic currency based on gold and commercial paper. Aldrich believed a central banking system with no political involvement was best, but was convinced by Warburg that a plan with no public control was not politically feasible.<sup id="cite_ref-Warburg_document_148-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-Warburg_document-148">[146]</a></sup> The compromise involved representation of the public sector on the board of directors.<sup id="cite_ref-ecresearch_149-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-ecresearch-149">[147]</a></sup>

Aldrich's bill met much opposition from politicians. Critics charged Aldrich of being biased due to his close ties to wealthy bankers such as [J. P. Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Morgan "J. P. Morgan") and [John D. Rockefeller Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Rockefeller_Jr. "John D. Rockefeller Jr."), Aldrich's son-in-law. Most Republicans favored the Aldrich Plan,<sup id="cite_ref-ecresearch_149-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-ecresearch-149">[147]</a></sup> but it lacked enough support in Congress to pass because rural and western states viewed it as favoring the "eastern establishment".<sup id="cite_ref-mnglass_5-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-mnglass-5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-150"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-150">[148]</a></sup> In contrast, progressive Democrats favored a reserve system owned and operated by the government; they believed that public ownership of the central bank would end Wall Street's control of the American currency supply.<sup id="cite_ref-ecresearch_149-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-ecresearch-149">[147]</a></sup> Conservative Democrats fought for a privately owned, yet decentralized, reserve system, which would still be free of Wall Street's control.<sup id="cite_ref-ecresearch_149-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-ecresearch-149">[147]</a></sup>

The original Aldrich Plan was dealt a fatal blow in 1912, when Democrats won the White House and Congress.<sup id="cite_ref-Warburg_document_148-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-Warburg_document-148">[146]</a></sup> Nonetheless, President [Woodrow Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson "Woodrow Wilson") believed that the Aldrich plan would suffice with a few modifications. The plan became the basis for the Federal Reserve Act, which was proposed by Senator [Robert Owen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_L._Owen "Robert L. Owen") in May 1913. The primary difference between the two bills was the transfer of control of the board of directors (called the Federal Open Market Committee in the Federal Reserve Act) to the government.<sup id="cite_ref-mnglass_5-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-mnglass-5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-boshistory_140-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-boshistory-140">[138]</a></sup> The bill passed Congress on December 23, 1913,<sup id="cite_ref-151"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-151">[149]</a></sup> on a mostly partisan basis, with most Democrats voting "yea" and most Republicans voting "nay".<sup id="cite_ref-boshistory_140-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-boshistory-140">[138]</a></sup>

## Measurement of economic variables\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=46 "Edit section: Measurement of economic variables")\]

The Federal Reserve records and publishes large amounts of data. A few websites where data is published are at the board of governors' Economic Data and Research page,<sup id="cite_ref-153"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-153">[151]</a></sup> the board of governors' statistical releases and historical data page,<sup id="cite_ref-154"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-154">[152]</a></sup> and at the St. Louis Fed's FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) page.<sup id="cite_ref-155"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-155">[153]</a></sup> The [Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee "Federal Open Market Committee") examines many economic indicators prior to determining monetary policy.<sup id="cite_ref-eco_ind_156-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-eco_ind-156">[154]</a></sup>

Some criticism involves economic data compiled by the Fed. The Fed sponsors much of the monetary economics research in the U.S., and [Lawrence H. White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_H._White "Lawrence H. White") objects that this makes it less likely for researchers to publish findings challenging the status quo.<sup id="cite_ref-157"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-157">[155]</a></sup>

Total Net Worth—Balance Sheet of Households and Nonprofit Organizations 1949–2012

The net worth of households and nonprofit organizations in the United States is published by the Federal Reserve in a report titled _Flow of Funds_.<sup id="cite_ref-158"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-158">[156]</a></sup> At the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2012, this value was $64.8 trillion. At the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, this value was $95.5 trillion.<sup id="cite_ref-159"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-159">[157]</a></sup>

### Money supply\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=48 "Edit section: Money supply")\]

The most common measures are named M0 (narrowest), M1, M2, and M3. In the United States they are defined by the Federal Reserve as follows:

| Measure | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| M0 | The total of all physical [currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency "Currency"), plus accounts at the central bank that can be exchanged for physical currency. |
| M1 | M0 + those portions of M0 held as reserves or vault cash + the amount in [demand accounts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_account "Demand account") ("checking" or "current" accounts). |
| M2 | M1 + most [savings accounts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_account "Savings account"), [money market accounts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_market_account "Money market account"), and small denomination time deposits ([certificates of deposit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_of_deposit "Certificate of deposit") of under $100,000). |
| M3 | M2 + all other CDs, deposits of [eurodollars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurodollars "Eurodollars") and [repurchase agreements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repurchase_agreement "Repurchase agreement"). |

### Personal consumption expenditures price index\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=49 "Edit section: Personal consumption expenditures price index")\]

The [Personal consumption expenditures price index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_consumption_expenditures_price_index "Personal consumption expenditures price index"), also referred to as simply the PCE price index, is used as one measure of the value of money. It is a United States-wide indicator of the average increase in prices for all domestic personal consumption. Using a variety of data including [United States Consumer Price Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Consumer_Price_Index "United States Consumer Price Index") and [U.S. Producer Price Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Producer_Price_Index "U.S. Producer Price Index") prices, it is derived from the largest component of the [gross domestic product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product "Gross domestic product") in the BEA's [National Income and Product Accounts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Income_and_Product_Accounts "National Income and Product Accounts"), personal consumption expenditures.

One of the Fed's main roles is to maintain price stability, which means that the Fed's ability to keep a low inflation rate is a long-term measure of their success.<sup id="cite_ref-161"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-161">[159]</a></sup> Although the Fed is not required to maintain inflation within a specific range, their long run target for the growth of the PCE price index is between 1.5 and 2 percent.<sup id="cite_ref-162"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-162">[160]</a></sup> There has been debate among policy makers as to whether the Federal Reserve should have a specific [inflation targeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting "Inflation targeting") policy.<sup id="cite_ref-163"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-163">[161]</a></sup>

#### Inflation and the economy\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=50 "Edit section: Inflation and the economy")\]

Most [mainstream economists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream_economists "Mainstream economists") favor a low, steady rate of inflation.<sup id="cite_ref-econjournalwatch.org_164-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-econjournalwatch.org-164">[162]</a></sup> [Chief economist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_economist "Chief economist"), and advisor to the Federal Reserve, the [Congressional Budget Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office "Congressional Budget Office") and the [Council of Economic Advisers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Economic_Advisers "Council of Economic Advisers"),<sup id="cite_ref-165"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-165">[163]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-166"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-166">[164]</a></sup> [Diane C. Swonk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_C._Swonk "Diane C. Swonk") observed, in 2022, that "From the Fed's perspective, you have to remember inflation is kind of like cancer. If you don't deal with it now with something that may be painful, you could have something that metastasized and becomes much more chronic later on."<sup id="cite_ref-167"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-167">[165]</a></sup>

Low (as opposed to zero or [negative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflation "Deflation")) inflation may reduce the severity of economic [recessions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession "Recession") by enabling the labor market to adjust more quickly in a downturn, and reduce the risk that a [liquidity trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity_trap "Liquidity trap") prevents [monetary policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy "Monetary policy") from stabilizing the economy.<sup id="cite_ref-168"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-168">[166]</a></sup> The task of keeping the rate of inflation low and stable is usually given to [monetary authorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_authority "Monetary authority").

### Unemployment rate\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=51 "Edit section: Unemployment rate")\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/US_Seasonal_Unemployment.svg/300px-US_Seasonal_Unemployment.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:US_Seasonal_Unemployment.svg)

United States unemployment rates 1975–2010 showing variance between the fifty states

One of the stated goals of monetary policy is maximum employment. The unemployment rate statistics are collected by the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics "Bureau of Labor Statistics"), and like the PCE price index are used as a barometer of the nation's economic health.

## Budget\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve&action=edit&section=52 "Edit section: Budget")\]

The Federal Reserve is self-funded. Over 90 percent of Fed revenues come from open market operations, specifically the interest on the portfolio of Treasury securities as well as "capital gains/losses" that may arise from the buying/selling of the securities and their derivatives as part of Open Market Operations. The balance of revenues come from sales of financial services (check and electronic payment processing) and discount window loans.<sup id="cite_ref-169"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-169">[167]</a></sup> The board of governors (Federal Reserve Board) creates a budget report once per year for Congress. There are two reports with budget information. The one that lists the complete balance statements with income and expenses, as well as the net profit or loss, is the large report simply titled, "Annual Report". It also includes data about employment throughout the system. The other report, which explains in more detail the expenses of the different aspects of the whole system, is called "Annual Report: Budget Review". These detailed comprehensive reports can be found at the board of governors' website under the section "Reports to Congress"<sup id="cite_ref-budget_170-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-budget-170">[168]</a></sup>

The Federal Reserve has been [remitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remitting "Remitting") interest that it has been receiving back to the [United States Treasury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury "United States Treasury"). Most of the assets the Fed holds are [U.S. Treasury bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security "United States Treasury security") and [mortgage-backed securities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage-backed_securities "Mortgage-backed securities") that it has been purchasing as part of [quantitative easing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing "Quantitative easing") since the [2007–2008 financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%E2%80%932008_financial_crisis "2007–2008 financial crisis"). In 2022 the Fed started [quantitative tightening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_tightening "Quantitative tightening") (QT) and selling these assets and taking a loss on them in the [secondary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_market "Secondary market") [bond market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_market "Bond market"). As a result, the nearly $100 billion that it was remitting annually to the Treasury, is expected to be discontinued during QT.<sup id="cite_ref-171"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-171">[169]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-172"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-172">[170]</a></sup>

In 2023, the Federal Reserve reported a net negative income of $114.3 billion.<sup id="cite_ref-173"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-173">[171]</a></sup> This triggered the creation of a deferred asset liability on the Federal Reserve balance sheet booked as "Interest on Federal Reserve notes due to U.S. Treasury" totaling $133.3 billion.<sup id="cite_ref-174"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-174">[172]</a></sup> The deferred asset is the amount of net excess revenues the Federal Reserve must realize before remittances can continue.

One of the keys to understanding the Federal Reserve is the Federal Reserve balance sheet (or [balance statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet "Balance sheet")). In accordance with Section 11 of the [Federal Reserve Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Act "Federal Reserve Act"), the [board of governors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_governors "Board of governors") of the Federal Reserve System publishes once each week the "Consolidated Statement of Condition of All Federal Reserve Banks" showing the condition of each Federal Reserve bank and a consolidated statement for all Federal Reserve banks. The board of governors requires that excess earnings of the Reserve Banks be transferred to the Treasury as interest on Federal Reserve notes.<sup id="cite_ref-177"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#cite_note-177">[175]</a></sup>

At times, these crises led to 'panics,' in which people raced to their banks to withdraw their deposits. A particularly severe panic in 1907 resulted in bank runs that wreaked havoc on the fragile banking system and ultimately led Congress in 1913 to write the Federal Reserve Act. Initially created to address these banking panics, the Federal Reserve is now charged with a number of broader responsibilities, including fostering a sound banking system and a healthy economy."

Before its introduction, banks either had to raise money in the open market or use the so-called "discount window" for emergencies. However, last year many banks refused to use the discount window, even though they found it hard to raise funds in the market, because it was associated with the stigma of bank failure

Bloomberg. January 4, 2008. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System established the temporary Term Auction Facility, dubbed TAF, in December to provide cash after interest-rate cuts failed to break banks' reluctance to lend amid concern about losses related to subprime mortgage securities. The program will make funding from the Fed available beyond the 20 authorized primary dealers that trade with the central bank

The Fed's discount window, for instance, through which it lends direct to banks, has barely been approached, despite the soaring spreads in the interbank market. The quarter-point cuts in its federal funds rate and discount rate on December 11 were followed by a steep sell-off in the stockmarket...The hope is that by extending the maturity of central-bank money, broadening the range of collateral against which banks can borrow and shifting from direct lending to an auction, the central bankers will bring down spreads in the one- and three-month [money markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_market "Money market"). There will be no net addition of liquidity. What the central bankers add at longer-term maturities, they will take out in the overnight market. But there are risks. The first is that, for all the fanfare, the central banks' plan will make little difference. After all, it does nothing to remove the fundamental reason why investors are worried about lending to banks. This is the uncertainty about potential losses from subprime mortgages and the products based on them, and – given that uncertainty – the banks' own desire to hoard capital against the chance that they will have to strengthen their balance sheets.
