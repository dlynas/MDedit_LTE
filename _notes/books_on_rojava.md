	* [Stalinist caterpillar to libertarian butterfly?](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/alex-de-jong-stalinist-caterpillar-into-libertarian-butterfly) by Alex de Jong is a pretty concise history of the PKK and the ideological development that led to what it is today.

	* [Democratic Confederalism](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/abdullah-ocalan-democratic-confederalism) by Abdullah √ñcalan ([Audiobook](https://invidio.us/watch?v=i1tM_G-R0mI)) provides you with the theory that was used in the construction of the federation.

	* [Jineologi](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/marcel-cartier-jineoloji) by Marcel Cartier talks about the women's liberation movement in Rojava and the feminist science behind it.

	* [Make Rojava Green Again](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/internationalist-commune-make-rojava-green-again) by the Internationalist Commune looks into the ecological revolution that's being spearheaded in Rojava.

	* Basically everything that [Zaher Baher](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/category/author/zaher-baher) has written on the subject, especially [Confederalism, Democratic Confederalism and Rojava](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/zaher-baher-confederalism-democratic-confederalism-and-rojava), [The Experiments of Rojava and Northern Kurdistan](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/zaher-baher-the-experiments-of-rojava-and-northern-kurdistan-turkey-for-launching-the-social-re) and [Our attitude towards Rojava must be critical solidarity](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/zaher-baher-our-attitude-towards-rojava-must-be-critical-solidarity), as they provide a critical anarchist lens through which to view the project.
