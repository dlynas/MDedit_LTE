## Conversation

My post about talking to an Israeli mother went viral yesterday with all the major propagandists for Israel up in arms because I didn’t show enough “empathy” for an Israeli-American mother whose family in Israel is “fine” as she herself put it. They were shocked that I dared to even mention the word “Gaza” to someone from Israel. Now I’m being told that I was “virtue-signaling” and I’m a “raging anti-Semite” and my family is getting death threats but I won’t ask you to “empathize” with that. What I would like is for you to empathize with a mother who is frustrated to see every last one of her neighbors cheer on a total genocide with flags and fundraisers for the perpetrators. And how presumptuous of these people, mothers no less, to presume that all the bad stuff is happening to the Israeli-American woman’s family. My family lives in a place that Israel has bombed every day since October 7. I know people who lost their entire families to a push of a button, I see babies with no legs, I see Israeli troops dancing on the ruins of exploded buildings and leveled towns. But thanks for your sanctimony, genocide supporters. There is a paradigm shift about Palestine going on in the United States and that is why Israel’s propagandists are furious. You can blame modern technology for the fact that everyone in the world can see your war crimes on their phones. Everyone in the world can see the mother in Gaza cry over the baby she wasn’t able to have for years and years and then you murdered him. Everyone can see the fertility clinics Israel purposely destroyed even though it recognizes the sanctity of such places - it is the only country in the world to fully subsidize IVF and Israeli women undergo more IVF than women from any other country. Everyone can see the people young and old dying of severe malnutrition or dehydration or disease exacerbated by malnutrition and dehydration. And everyone - everyone - can see all the parents trying to pry their children, alive or dead, out from under the rubble of buildings you bombed for no reason other than the fact that you are out for blood. Your genocide is on full display so instead of searching for content on Twitter by mothers who dare to mention Gaza, I suggest you turn your attention to the collective punishment and war crimes Israel is committing as I write this - war crimes which you and your political leaders and all Western media will one day be held accountable for.



"There is a paradigm shift about Palestine going on in the United States and that is why Israel’s propagandists are furious." That's how it feels to me, too.

Hear, hear. I'm so sorry about the bullying you've experienced (even though you're not asking for sympathy about that). I guess if a person is taught that Palestinians are inferior, and that somehow even a baby is dangerous (for the future?) their agony doesn't matter. Bizarre.

Just tell them that Israel has normalized collective punishment 

Wow, just a disconnect from reality many people have. Thank you for sharing this. I do hope that some people who really need your message read it earnestly.

What paradigm shift? American support for Israel is at an all time high since the start of the war. Including 72% of GenZ, who, in November, answered the same question 50/50. (Harvard Harris Poll, Late February)

Then use your voice to tell Hamas to release the hostages, to stop stealing aid, to stop using hospitals as bases for Hamas fighters, but most of all to tell Hamas to quit hating Jews just for being Jews.

The greatest kindness we can do them is to render them unable to avoid facing the truth.

"Israel has bombed every day since October 7"? What happened on October 7 that got the Israelis riled up?

No, all we asked is that you treat a woman in the US like an equal person and not harass them about politics and immediately leap into asking them about a conflict thousands of miles away simply because of their national origin or foreign citizenship. It’s discriminatory to judge
