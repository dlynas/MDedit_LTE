		For the entire 20th century, the Electoral College was a non-issue, which is why nobody thought to change it. 
		
		Since then, people believe that Republicans have an inherent advantage from it, which is why Republicans don't want to change it and Democrats do.
		
		(This is not necessarily the case. The EC amplified Obamas wins and Kerry was a few thousand votes in Ohio from winning the EC in 2004, despite losing the popular vote.)

			Actually, yes they did. With the support of current and former presidents, the House passed an amendment 338 to 70 to abolish the electoral college in 1969. But Strom Thurmond and other southern senators filibustered it in the Senate.
			
			The South killed another great plan even when 80% of the US wanted to get rid of it.

				I run the middle but if you do away with the EC conservatives will lose their minds due to the fact it was intended to keep large population centers from simply walking all over rural voters. Although data is not necessarily backing up its effectiveness at this.

							NYC : 8.6M
							LA : 4.1M
							Chicago : 2.7M
							Houston : 2.4M
							Phoenix : 1.7M
							
							The total population of the five largest cities in the US is just under 20 million people (data from 2020). In 2020 we had 331 million people in the US.
							
							So 6% of the population lives in the 5 largest cities. Not enough to overwhelm a presidential election by any margin

									This is so far from fact though. This paints my (native not current) county of Cumberland NJ as a Metro area and is the sticks of NJ... votes overwhelmingly red in every election. It may be a "Metro statistical area" for Philly when looking at economics, but it is rural in blood. This map tells us nothing about voting demographics for the outlined regions and is simply a boogeyman. If you'd like some real stats on this subject I recommend [This (Bloomberg article breaking down voting demographics for Metro Areas in the 2020 election)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-12-04/how-metro-areas-voted-in-the-2020-election)
									
									Republicans (the politicians, not the voters) are afraid of fair elections. They've told us as much with their actions throughout history, especially recent (Jan. 6th 2021).
									
									I'll end with this; If the voting discrepancy gave Republicans the edge in the elections, it would've been changed a decade ago.

									Ok so moving the goal posts then the discussion gets closer. It's not the major cities, it's the metropolitan areas (that's probably a miscommunication, no worries. But not what was originally said). But then we look not at the 5 largest but the 25 (that's the goalpost moving here). And those 25 make up 100M people. Now we're at nearly a third of the population. Still not enough to "overwhelm" an election. 
									
									I grew up in a small conservative town. I very much understand the conservative fear. I also now live in one of those large cities and will argue that this country is not two worlds but likely over a dozen. Life here is so different from growing up. That is so different from visiting family in suburbs. Which is so different from visiting other cities etc.
									
									But the thing to me is that there is this great fear of the "Tyranny of the Majority" by people in rural communities. The perception (as you confirmed with your first comment and I also had growing up) is that just a handful of cities would overwhelm any say we in small towns would ever have so we need drastic protection measures. But as we've seen from this conversation, the numbers don't check out.
									
									If the 25 largest metropolitan areas all banded together and voted the exact same way (they don't and never will), then they would get 2/3 of the way to just deciding the result of the popular vote. Hardly an overwhelming force and just goes to show how perception and fears are often not well supported.

							Those are two separate issues.
							
							You mentioned that large population centers walk all over rural areas. This is why we have civil rights.  Those exist to protect minorities. That is the protection of minorities enshrined in the Bill of Rights. Additionally, popular presidential vote is way more diffused than people think.  There were more votes for Trump in California than Texas, but all 55 EC votes went for Biden. The states' allocation of electoral votes hides the minority support in these large states and population centers.
							
							Second, the Senate rules absolutely allow for minority protests and protections. Cloture takes 60 votes to end any debate in the Senate that a Senator wants to keep going (aka filibuster), which means there needs to be more than a majority to stop it. One Alabama senator stopped military promotions of flag officers for 10 months. One. That had more to do with promotions without a vote, but unanimous consent was still a requirement.
							
							So, yes, the Senate has nothing to do with the vote for president, but rural areas are not without political power.
							
							Edit: One more point, when the Senate is in control of the Republicans, you have to go back over 20 years to find that a Republican-led Senate represented over 50% of the US population. They already have minority control within reach. 50 Republicans represent only 43% of Americans today.

			You're not entirely wrong about why going to a popular vote is more popular amongst Democrats than Republicans but I do think that "the person who gets more votes wins" is obviously axiomatically necessary enough for a just political system that we can say that Democrats are correct on this particular issue even if it's also self serving. 
			
			Once you discard "all peoples votes are equal" and "whoever gets more votes wins" basically anything is now on the table to keep power.  At that point you've already rejected the entire basis of rule by the people and of the people.

				> Once you discard "all peoples votes are equal" and "whoever gets more votes wins" basically anything is now on the table to keep power. At that point you've already rejected the entire basis of rule by the people and of the people.
				
				Not necessarily.
				
				The original setup of Congress was to prevent the tyranny of the majority from stomping over the wills of the minority. As a compromise, Congress was set up with two houses with different compositions. The House was based around population, biased towards the largest states, while the Senate treated all states as equal no matter their size. The intent was any measure needed a majority of the population and a majority of the states to pass, making it difficult for regional factions to dominate the government.
				
				This doesn’t work so well with massive political parties spanning continents, but the intent was to reinforce rule by and of the people without squashing minority factions.
				
				The Electoral College simply reflects the Congressional makeup. The only significant requirement in the Constitution is that each state gets a number of electors based on how many Senators and Representatives they have, preserving the population/state balance. There is no Constitutional requirement on how the states choose their electors or electoral votes: you could grab X random people off the street and be find Constitutionally. Over time most states have chosen a winner-take-all system that makes it very difficult for third parties to get traction, or in other words preserves the power of those two continent-spanning parties.

						> Except EC does not represent congress
						
						I didn’t say the Electoral College represents Congress. I said each state has a number of electors equal to the number of Senators and Representatives.
						
						Quoting the Constitution (because it’s also relevant for the rest of your comment):
						
						>Each state shall appoint, in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a number of electors, equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States, shall be appointed an elector.
						
						Those are the only rules.
						
						>Your whole concept of “tyranny of the majority” is on full display when dealing with the electoral college since most states give all their votes to whoever won the popular vote in their state.
						
						>That alone causes the “swing” in the graph the OP shows more than anything else.
						
						First off, it’s not **MY** concept, it’s a well-established concept widely discussed in political theory. The concept is discussed in great detail in the Federalist Papers, which cite the particular makeup of the US government to attempt to limit its effects.
						
						But more importantly, the winner-take-all method of assigning EC votes does demonstrate tyranny of the majority more clearly when focusing solely on the Electoral College. I addressed my comment more broadly to show how a pure representative democracy can trample on minorities, and how to protect rule of and by the people we must add checks that move us away from a pure representative democracy.
						
						I’m honestly surprised this is gotten so much controversy or that people are arguing that pure representative democracy is better. Do people not recall how racism was entrenched in American law by nobody-doubts-it majorities, who then enacted laws to ensure they remained the majority in government? Are Republicans in Texas not the clear majority, and as such enacted abortion laws most find draconian? A pure democracy without any checks and balances lets certain majorities those run rampant and trample on the minorities far more easily, whether that’s on the national or local level, and as such preserving everyone’s rights requires some checks on pure democracy.
						
						>Also, when talking about the issues with the EC we should keep in mind that at the time it was written each state (even the large ones ) had 1/13th representation in the senate. Now the large states have 1/50th so the problem is worse
						
						Compared to winner-take-all’s problems, this is peanuts. A few years ago I ran the math on a couple proportional voting methods and every method I tested aligned the winner of the popular vote with the proportional Electoral College. The fact people harp on that as the most severe issue tells me that they don’t understand the core problem, and I’m glad you at least have your priorities right.

							You realize this post is strictly talking about presidential elections? The concept of the “tyrannical majority” of the popular vote determining the president making all choices for government is a very large mental stretch. Congress is already a check against the president wielding too much power. I don’t see why every states executive branch is determined by a popular vote but the us president is not.
							
							I honestly don’t see the US democracy surviving long term if we repeatedly have presidents who lose the popular vote. The system is broken at that point and would need a major overhaul to better represent current demographics.
							
							But the main point of this graph is to illustrate how the EC skews the perception of what an overwhelming victory is. That also seems like a fundamental problem with the system. 
							
							The US has one of the oldest constitutions in the world. People should understand that there are problems with its implementation that didn’t exist when it was written and we should strive to adapt it if we want to see the constitution live on. We have mechanisms to fix those problems so it is possible as long as people don’t fixate that we can’t adapt a vision of people who lived 200 years ago to modern day times

								>You realize this post is strictly talking about presidential elections?
								
								I did, but decided to broaden the discussion on a particular tangent. There are times when you need to zoom out to understand the complete context of a topic.
								
								>The concept of the “tyrannical majority” of the popular vote determining the president making all choices for government is a very large mental stretch. 
								
								That it is, and I’m wondering where you got it from. I certainly did not make that argument, and I’m not sure where you could even infer it from my comments.
								
								>I don’t see why every states executive branch is determined by a popular vote but the us president is not.
								
								A couple reasons:
								
								1. Back when the Constitution was written a national popular vote was not practical. It would be a couple decades before it was the common way of choosing electors.
								
								2. The United States of America is a bunch of States that are United, especially back in the 1790s and most of the 1800s. The Electoral College balanced the power of the states and the population within them.
								
								>I honestly don’t see the US democracy surviving long term if we repeatedly have presidents who lose the popular vote. The system is broken at that point and would need a major overhaul to better represent current demographics.
								
								That is a symptom of a far larger problem, namely the entire political system is intentionally designed to prevent third parties from becoming significant.
								
								Look at things more broadly. The Democrats and Republicans each have two rather powerful wings, one that is more moderate and another that is more liberal/conservative. In some areas, like Alaska, they are almost indistinguishable and get along very well, and in others the battles between the two are extremely toxic. In other nations, or even the US of yesteryear, these would be different parties, which in parliamentary systems would form coalition governments. In the first half of the 1800s we cycled through a few different dominant parties, some lasting only a couple election cycles. But the Republicans and Democrats have structured the system to make it difficult for third parties to grow. After Perot’s upset in the 1992 election they tightened the rules around getting into the debates to essentially prohibit any third candidate from reaching the main debate stage.
								
								The changes we need are far more significant than merely Electoral College reform. I’d personally start with increasing the number of elections using a proportional system, such as a ranked voting system.
								
								>People should understand that there are problems with its implementation that didn’t exist when it was written and we should strive to adapt it if we want to see the constitution live on. 
								
								While certainly true, this isn’t a problem with the Constitution itself. The Constitution doesn’t require states to use winner-take-all, the states have chosen that to consolidate power in the two parties. That could be fixed by an amendment mandating a specific system or abolishing the Electoral College, but an amendment isn’t required to fix the core issues.

					The Senate gets to place the entire judiciary, heads of government offices, and military promotions. House does not. Senators are elected directly by people for the last 100 years, all the Senate system has done is make some peoples votes count as half people. By 2040 30% of the population will control 70% of the senate. Its ridiculous.
					
					All the Senate is leading to is tyranny by the minority.

Having the house of representatives actually adjust its member numbers based on population again, 5. Having a petition based system for public elections (rather than funding from private money, PACs, or business. It’s based on government stipends based on the number of signatures collected for a particular candidate). 6. Capping the total amount of campaign funding based on position being run for adjusted for inflation over time. 7. Establishing protections against any discriminatory practices against any particular group of people and no harm can be done to any particular group.

It's not uncommon for Senators to work out a bill, and then have a cooperative House member introduce the bill there  simply to meet the technical requirements for funding bills.

						You can disagree with it but the founders were very much scared of tyranny of the majority. Specifically 51% having complete control over 49%. Madison specifically talks about this in Federalist 51, and describes how the government is set up to avoid it. Again I’m not trying to put your opinion down just saying that the intention from many of the founders undoubtably was to avoid tyranny of the majority.
						
						Edit: to add to this the founders (specifically Madison and Hamilton) were also extremely scared of pure democracy. They didn’t want the people to be able to vote on everything, because they didn’t want the government to be subject to the fast changing ideas of the people. That’s why the Senate is staggered and never switches all at once.

							You're just describing how the system works right now. If they've got the White House and majorities in both chambers of Congress, they could pass such laws if they wanted to.
							
							This isn't an argument between majority rule vs minority rights, it's an argument between rule by a majority of people vs rule by a majority of arbitrarily-established political entities. A majority of senators and electors can tyrannize the minority, despite that minority representing a majority of the actual people of the country.

					The easiest fix without blowing it up is to award 2 EC votes per state to the winner of the national popular vote. This gives a +100 to the national popular vote winner but doesn't automatically make them the winner of the election if, for example CA, TX, FL and NY go on a bender for 1 candidate but the other 46 states really like the other guy.

						The easiest way to fix is rarely the best.
						
						The best way to fix the Electoral College is to abolish the winner-take-all nature on a state level and assign those votes proportionally. There are a few different ways to do that, but to put in simply the 2000 Florida recount should not have decided the fate of 25 Electoral Votes, but which candidate got 13 and which got 12.

				If no candidate gets a majority of Electoral College votes, then the election is decided by The House of Representatives. The House holds votes until one candidate gets a majority. So the parties are basically forced to form a coalition government in that scenario.

		Future president Andrew Jackson actually won a solid plurality of electoral votes and popular vote, but not enough to win outright. The election went to the house to decide per the 12th amendment. Each state had one vote, and John Quincy Adams in what was called the ‘corrupt bargain’, won this vote. Some state delegations even voting against the wishes of their state in the initial election. 
		
		It was widely believed at the time that then house speaker Clay (who become Adams’ secretary of state) swung the vote in the house for Adams against Jackson. Jackson would win a resounding victory against Adams in 1828. 
		
		Incidentally this ended the ‘era of good feelings’ and the previous 1820 election was actually the last uncontested election in history!

				At the moment, yes, because Republicans are over represented. But in principle, no. Winner-takes-all electoral votes always allow minority rule, because you can lose some states in a landslide and just barely win some others.
				
				(The same is true for the House, Senate, UK Parliament, etc. - when seats are assigned up front and elected independently, a party that has 51% support in 51% of districts will control the legislature, even if they have zero votes in all the others. Having each seat represent the same number of people reduces the degree to which this can happen, but as long as there's more than one seat in play you'll always have the possibility of winning more elections with fewer total votes.)

	Conservatives will defend the EC because they perceive it gives them an advantage. Most people hate the two party system though, including most conservatives, and the Electoral College makes 3rd parties impossible.

	Even if a 3rd party candidate did well in the popular vote, they have no chance of getting 270 electoral votes in a 3 way race. Whoever controls the most House delegations would pick the president in that case.

	So if you want 3rd parties to be able to compete for the presidency, you HAVE to support removing the electoral college.

	Good read on the origins of the Electoral College:

	“The populations in the North and South were approximately equal, but roughly one-third of those living in the South were held in bondage. Because of its considerable, nonvoting slave population, that region would have less clout under a popular-vote system. The ultimate solution was an indirect method of choosing the president”

	Sadly no one wants to have a serious conversation about it.

	The centrists are convinced it's too hard to do. There are plenty of reforms like removing the first past the post winners take all aspects using proportional shares or the interstate compact that won't involve an act of Congress. They just keep hand waving it away.

	Republicans see it as the only way they'll win anymore. Democrats want to keep the peace and have the illusion they won fair and square. Meanwhile the results get more lopsided every election and fewer swing states are deciding the results.

	If Trump wins the next election, it'll be because of the disparities between the electoral college. And the sad part is all of the fear mongering about getting more voters to vote will be completely nullified and just convince more people voting is meaningless.

					But that doesn't fix the problem. The winner of each state, no matter what the percentage is, gets 100% of the votes. Changing the proportions and stacking the more populous states still ignores the votes of the losers in the state, which is why the results are so lopsided. Both California and Texas have a substantial amount of Democrat and Republicans that are disenfranchised every election. Same with black voters in the South. This idea sounds as bad as the GOP proposal to split California into 3 states, where two of them are GOP strongholds.

						What’s more disenfranchising than a presidential election is that the House of Representatives was created to be the voice of the people. The cap has made Wyoming have a disproportionately loud voice in the house compared to the more popular states like California. 
						
						Yeah, twice in the last century when the popular vote was pretty close the EC went a different way than the popular vote. But every 2 years for the last 100 years the populous regions have been incrementally losing power to the less populated parts of the country.

							I completely agree with that, but I don't see how that solves or at least mitigates the problem with first past the post voting disparities. Unless you coupled this solution with either eliminating first past the post or just making the popular vote default through something like the interstate compact, this will only make the problem worse.

							* ⬛️ **[rex_lauandi](https://www.reddit.com/user/rex_lauandi)** ⬆️ 1 _(2023-12-15 06:57:20)_

								Changing first past the post is an ideological shift that the entire country has to adopt. Fixing the HoR is just a common sense law that needs to be passed. I’d be all in favor of ranked choice, for example, but it’s useless in the Presidential election if we’re still only having two major parties. 
								
								Ranked choice would be a GREAT option for the primary elections (for all positions). The President is an important role with a fair amount of power, but also for the individual voter, pretty much every other election we vote in more directly relates to us. We need to shift ideology that Presidential elections are the most important to the less important that our state and local elections.

It’s not like the smaller European countries would tolerate populations of big countries like Germany, Italy and France dictating everything but would just leave. Countries do have their own national identities and agendas and people in those countries that are smaller don’t want it only interests of certain areas be most prominent.
				
				The issue is that US states have become more administrative regions these days than true areas of common identity and agenda. They aren’t even allowed to leave no matter what after Civil War, so removing electoral collage would not result in mass exodus of smaller states from the union and more issues with political parties. But the states identity is still strong enough that people in those states would be upset.

	The Electoral College was in part a way to mitigate the consequences of voter fraud (remember this was the 18th century). Winning states and being awarded electoral votes isolates any one state's popular vote from any other states popular vote. A state with very loose voter registration laws or corrupt officials stuffing ballots would allow excess fraudulent ballots to spill across state lines and wash out legitimate election tabulations in other states. Under an electoral college, a massive ballot box stuffing scheme, even if uncovered, is at least isolated to the results of one state and can be quarantined from the rest of the election. Therefore less likely to taint the results in other states with accusations that the result had been changed by fraud.

	Interesting that the effect seems to have narrowed starting in 2000

		Because there haven't been any big landslide wins since Reagan.

	The EC is built with the structure of the United States in mind. The people are members of the states and the states are members of the union. You only get to vote directly in state elections as you are a member of the state and not a member of the union. The states are the ones that get to vote at the federal level as they are the members of the union. This is true for all of our government. 

	Most people think of their congressmen as representing their district at the federal level, which seems to contradict my statement: “you only vote at the state level and the states vote at the federal level.” But this perspective abstracts the state away. The federal government gives states a number of representatives (votes) they get to send to congress and get to vote on federal happenings. The states then choose these representatives based on separating their state into these districts. You are really voting for who should your state send to represent the state in the federal legislature. Or more specifically who should the state send to represent the people in this specific district of our state. 

	When viewed this way, you see why the EC exists and why that is a good thing. You are not a member of the union, you do not get to vote at a federal level. You are a member of your state, you get to vote on things at the state level (or below). 

	There is no such thing as a nation wide popular vote. (Especially when different states employ different methods and have different people on the ballot) It doesn’t make sense to even talk about. You do not vote for the president. You vote how your state should vote for the president. A tiny distinction but an important one that respects the structure of the union.
