## Do you know the name of the most powerful company in the world? #WarIsNotGreen #DivestFromWar

![[3098445189391219028.mp4]]

"Do you know the name of the world's most powerful company?
BlackRock is an asset manager.
And that means that it makes its profits
by buying tons and tons of stock
in publicly traded companies using other people's money.
BlackRock has over $9 trillion in assets.
To put this into perspective,
there are only two entities in the world
that have more financial power than BlackRock,
the United States and China.
Oh, if money is power,
which in our current exploitative system it is,
then BlackRock is the most powerful company on the planet.
And what does it choose to do with all this power?
Not good stuff.
Actually, it's no exaggeration to say
that BlackRock profits directly
off of creating the conditions for mass death.
And I'm sorry to be dramatic,
but it's just the facts.
BlackRock is a top shareholder in companies
like Lockheed Martin and Boeing,
whose primary business is to create
the technology used for war crimes.
Actually, out of the entire financial sector,
BlackRock offers the largest investment package
for defense and aerospace companies.
But wait, there's more.
Because of funding endless wars
and genocide, weren't enough,
BlackRock is also the asset management company
most invested in fossil fuels, especially in coal.
The dirtiest form of energy we have
in fact, BlackRock in 2023 has $110 billion
to haulers and still invested in coal.
That's $110 billion too many dollars if you ask me.
And if you didn't know,
these investments in the military
and the climate crisis are hardly distinct.
In fact, our Pentagon is the planet's
biggest consumer of oil.
That means that when it comes to the Pentagon,
BlackRock is responsible for making more deadly
as a war machine and as a consumer of fossil fuels.
It is the industry leader in finance
and continues to set a catastrophic pace
for our militarization and fossil fuel extraction.
So here's the gist.
BlackRock effectively has supreme power
over the flow of money on this planet.
We cannot turn the ship around until BlackRock
divests from the war machine
and divests from fossil fuels
and stops making a killing off of killing."
