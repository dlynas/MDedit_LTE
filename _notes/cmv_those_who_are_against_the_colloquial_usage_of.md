## CMV: Those who are against the colloquial usage of "retarded" have no moral right to colloquially use "dumb," "mad," or "lame."

Gay marriage was too, but there was not a great enough push for that to be made legal until many decades later. Are morals then dictated by who has strong enough of a voice? Are the minority or those with no voice to be disregarded?

	Hi, historical linguist here. Yes, words and their meanings do change. I do understand your point that mute, mad, lame have all been stripped on their offensive meaning and that you believe that retarded has as well. And to be fair, it might have for you. But language change is not a solitary process. Language is a social tool used by, shared by, and shaped by all of its speakers. 

	The word retarded grew to incredible levels of offensive and taboo in the early 2000s. The folks for whom it became taboo are in their 30s-40s and their younger siblings are in their 20s. This  became a formative taboo for them when they were children. They will likely hold onto that for a good, long time. 

	The thing with mute, dumb, mad, and lame is that they are all much older, and their phases of being taboos was much further in the past. There's a natural cycle for these things:

	word with specific meaning > negative connotation of meaning > used as a slur/in an incredible hateful way > word becomes taboo > enough time has passed that the term loses it's taboo and either returns to the specific meaning or because of slur and taboo stages, has changed in meaning enough that it has adopted a new form, such as being a general marker of negativity (e.g. dumb and lame). 

	I think you're right that it is moving towards being like those words -- but it's a strongly engrained taboo. That takes a serious amount of time to change. It might not be until millennials and zoomers are quite old, or are gone, that this term stops being a taboo.

		I hesitate to disagree with a historical linguist about historical linguistic trends, but I don't know that this particular word is as simple as other slurs in terms of offensive staying power. 
		
		I'm the prime demographic for the age bracket you just mentioned, and I'll point out that I'm not some backwoods yokel, MAGA person, or other assorted anti-political-correctness reactive archetype. I grew up in a large metro area, traveled away to go to college, traveled again for law school, and have since moved states a few more times for work. I've been a lot of places, met a lot of people, and I'm fairly well educated with a broad social group that leans solidly left. 
		
		Other slurs, for example racial slurs, have incredible levels of taboo such that even saying them in private with your friends will get you ostracized. This is because the offensiveness of those words has genuinely permiated throughout most of society. 
		
		"Retard," on the other hand, doesn't really work the same way. Not in my experience.
		
		You say that aversion to the word became a formative taboo for my age bracket, but to be perfectly honest I don't know anybody - not a single person - who is actually offended by it in private. Unlike other slurs, you're free to use it openly when in private with your friends. You just can't say it *in public* for fear of outside groups hearing you.
		
		In my experience, the aversion to the word surged like a lightning bolt out of progressive academic circles - and there was a strange social phenomenon where the rest of society simply capitulated in public, but didn't actually convert in private. They said the prayers and sang along in church, and then went home and promptly ignored scripture.
		
		I don't believe that (the vast majority of) my generation *actually* has a formative taboo to the word. I think that a minority of people have that taboo, and for whatever historical sociological reason had outsized influence that caused the word to become unacceptable in public only.
		
		I genuinely believe that if progressive academic circles lose their social footing as a dominant ostracizing force, the word would come back into public vogue quite quickly.
		
		I wouldn't say the same about almost any other slur.

			I appreciate you sharing your perspective on this, but I'm curious, did you grow up around people who would have been labeled "mentally retarded", such as those with Downs syndrome? I feel that in my experience the main push hasn't been from any academic setting, but from people who knew other people who had been called this word being intolerant of its use, privately and publicly. I'm sure there is a large proportion of the public that would love to bring it back, just like there is likely a lot of people who would like to bring back "gay" as meaning "uncool" or "stupid", but I don't think I've ever seen evidence that either of these were pushed from progressive bastions, I've only ever seen it come from my peers calling each other out for it.

				>did you grow up around people who would have been labeled "mentally retarded", such as those with Downs syndrome? 
				
				In my immediate family? No.
				
				But in my immediate social circle, like in my classes at school? Yes. There was almost always somebody with developmental disabilities in every one of my grades throughout the years. I don't remember all of the names, but I'll always remember Miguel, who sat next to me in 6th grade. Super tall guy. Wasn't great at discussion, but he loved Pokémon like me. 
				
				Further, I have a friend who went on to become a special education teacher with many developmental disabilities in her class - and I'll pause there to bring her into the discussion in my next paragraph down.
				
				>I feel that in my experience the main push hasn't been from any academic setting, but from people who knew other people who had been called this word being intolerant of its use, privately and publicly. 
				
				I don't think that's a universal trend - in fact, I'd point you to the (in)famous (now defunct, but commonly mirrored) "tardblog," where a special education teacher wrote about her class experiences. If you put aside what is now a highly offensive title for a moment, and actually read the blog, you'll see that she had a deep love for the kids in her care, but she simply didn't take issue with the word. 
				
				And now to bring my friend back into this - the one who went on to become a special education teacher - she loved that blog, and is in fact the one who introduced me to it. And loves her special education kids, too. But she uses the word plainly when in private with friends, because it's simply not the horrible slur to her that it is to some people.
				
				I think the social phenomenon I mentioned before has impacted the people who work and live with the developmentally disabled just as much as it's impacted the rest of society. They're forced to pretend in public as well, but (in my personal experience, anyway) they go home and use the word in private also.
				
				>I'm sure there is a large proportion of the public that would love to bring it back,
				
				I don't think that's right.
				
				I don't think there are very many people who "would love to bring it back" in the sense that they long to hear it said again. That's not it.
				
				I suspect most people who use the word in private don't really think about it in terms of "bringing it back" because, to them, it never really left. They've still been using it all this time, just not in public.
				
				Which goes back to what I said about this one being different from all the rest of the slurs.
				
				The vast majority of people (angry racist grandpa aside) aren't using racial slurs, even in private. The same goes for things like the "f-word" for gay people - it's simply not used, even in private.
				
				But "retard?" It's used frequently in private. By people across all walks of life, from blue collar to white collar to actual special education teachers.
				
				It's the one slur that's not actually treated as a slur in private, but simply hidden to avoid being ostracized by a small minority who has social control of that discussion.

			I completely agree with your analysis.  In fact, I'm apart of the "progressive academic circles" and I have no personal qualms with using the word.  I've just been taught not to use the word in public.  Its to the point where when I'm at work around my coworkers, I would never say it.  But you can take myself and those exact same coworkers over my house on a Sunday and we watch the last play of that Cowboys/Niners game and we all say, "that was the most retarded play I've ever seen" and literally no one has an issue.  
			
			Its really one of those weird things in which we are being told "you can't say that word because its offensive" yet no one is actually offended by it.

			Hi there, 
			
			That's fair to say -- but I don't think that makes it any less of a taboo. I think that just represents what a taboo means in this modern, interconnected age. I am happy to admit that I'm wrong if shown otherwise -- but I know a lot of slurs, racial and otherwise, are tolerated within private friend groups quite a bit, especially if they are bound together in some way (either family, work, or something like that) will tolerate these things for fear of causing tension in a relationship they cannot necessarily get out of. 
			
			But, I am also within the target demographic that I described. I'm split between small town and then going and joining the academy as a linguist. Even in my small town though, the word retarded has become taboo'd.

				>Hi there,

				That's fair.
				
				I guess my point is less about whether it's a "taboo" and more about who actually holds the taboo.
				
				In the most egregious cases of racial slurs, the taboo is held by most people - in the sense that they, personally, don't want to say the word.
				
				In the case here, (I'm arguing that) the taboo is held by a minority and the rest of society is simply respecting that taboo - not actually holding the taboo.
				
				The key functional difference being that if the social dynamic changes such that the minority no longer has sociopolitical control of that discussion, the rest of society will not continue to respect the taboo.

					I see what you are saying. Thank you for clarifying your position. I agree that this might happen. But I guess I wonder if there really is that sociopolitical control, as you put it, or if that is just a result of folks as a whole being more opposed to it. I don't know if there have been large-scale studies on this or not. But what I will say is that with the world of the right calling out anything and everything about being 'too PC', that they are also not really using the term in public to me suggest that it is more widespread of a taboo that it feels like you believe it is. 
					
					But, not worth squabbling about. I think that we more or less agree but we are coming at the situation from slightly different perspectives/foci.

			* 🟦 **[Jmufranco](https://www.reddit.com/user/Jmufranco)** ⬆️ 2 _(2023-01-25 20:42:43)_

				I’m going to drill into a minor point here - “I don’t think that makes it any less of a taboo.”
				
				I think part of this discussion is driven by the fact that whether something is “taboo” isn’t binary. As you have identified, different sects may view something as taboo, whereas others do not. I’ll refer to this as the “breadth” factor, i.e., how widespread the belief is that a given term is taboo. The other factor as to whether something is taboo is the what I will refer to as the “gravity” factor, i.e., how objectively/subjectively wrong it is to use a given term. For instance, I don’t think it’s at all controversial to note that the public reaction to a white, non-disabled person referring to a black person with a physical disability as the “n” word would be way stronger in magnitude than if he called that individual a “cripple.” Hell, the fact that I feel comfortable writing “cripple” in this hypothetical and only “n” word shows my subjective belief as to which word is “more” taboo than the other. 
				
				To bring this back full circle, I think the fact that your friend group is willing to say “retarded” in familial, private contexts **is** evidence that that word is less taboo than racial epithets. Or at least to the extent that your friend group is a reasonably accurate representation of your community, however you may define that.

			As a millennial (who used the word a lot as a kid), I have started having an internal *ick* reaction to the word over the past like... 5 years? Not as visceral as the n-word, but it's moving in that direction for me. So things can change, even for real, not just for appearances

		Thank you so much for this.  36 years ago I started my career as a community social worker as we placed the residents into group homes from the institution.  "Mentally Retarded" was in the name of all these facilities and was a professional term at the time.  Old records reflected the use of "imbecile " as a level of retardation. Nurses notes from what was then 60 years ago made comments of a resident "being a cute little pinhead" while another noted a shift with "the little floppy babies" so it seemed to me we had made Some progress from those days.  The residents themselves would use "low grade" to insult a peer or to themselves as "high grade/functioning" to brag. There will always be terms used in derogatory fashion. I struggle with keeping up with currently appropriate terms to discuss where I've worked without insulting anyone.

	My grandmother cared for 6 mentally disabled adults in her home for decades.  I grew up around these folks and I cared about them as much as my grandma did.  They were a part of the family.  It would be super offensive if someone were to call one of her residents retarded.  It would also be offensive if someone used the term derogitorily referring to a mentally healthy person.  

	However, there needs to be a term to describe people who willfully suspend their own education, intelligence and enlightenment.  Just calling them a retard to liken them to disabled folks is inaccurate and degrading.  I am not opposed to the term "self retarded" though.  It accurately portrays the situation and does not liken them to truly disabled folks.  

	What I don't know is, if society in general has the ability to understand the nuance, adopt it widely, and shun those who abuse or misuse it.  Or, maybe I'm a jerk and this is a bad suggestion.  Anyhow, I hope this helps you with your personal frustration.

		While I understand that sentiment, any of the words I listed can be weaponized. I went to school with a mute kid. I would not dare to call him dumb or throw that word around. 
		
		I do agree with your point that the misuse of the word when regarding to the preventably uneducated is inaccurate and degrading though. Perhaps your rationally pessimistic view on societal capabilities provides reason enough to "ban" the word altogether. !delta
		
		Out of curiosity, what are your views on non-malicious usages of the word, such as silly or ridiculous? For example, when someone does something ridiculously silly, theaction may be described with that word. Would you also be against people referring to them with that word when they make a stupid mistake if they had no malicious intent towards the mentally disabled?

		* 🟧 **[CatchingRays](https://www.reddit.com/user/CatchingRays)** ⬆️ 23 _(2023-01-25 00:35:40)_

			So more family history.  My shitty dad and a shitty cousin both used that word all the time.  Both derogitorily and silly.  Can you really separate them?  Wouldn't you have to look over your shoulder to use it?  If you lived around mentally disabled folks, could you or would you even risk it?  The population as a percentage might be really really really small so it seems like NO risk of offending someone to most people.  But you also have sensitive caretakers, and sensitive family members.  These folks aren't distinguishable from you or me, but for them, the word may be just as painful.  So, back to the level of risk. I know you  asked me directly how I feel about that particular use, but it's not just me that WE have to worry about.  
			
			A comedian on stage with altruistic, non malicious intent should be able to use it to make a good pro-disabled point.  2 close friends in a field away from everyone else might be comfortable enough to not draw offense from it (unless one is afflicted or affected by true mental disability).  But carelessly?  In public?  I personally do think it's too risky to be considered good taste.  Mostly because I don't trust the general public to be careful enough with it.  On the other hand, we don't get good at something unless we practice.

		I think most offense does not solely come from a place of logic and reasoning, since all people are inherently biased against certain words or insults. Regardless of whether the use of the r-word towards a disabled person is in an insulting manner or out of legitimate use, when a wide demographic of people are repeatedly exposed to a word in a primarily insulting manner, they are hurt by it no matter the context. I think its unfair to brute force an offensive word into wide acceptance at the expense of disabled people who have to deal with hearing it when most of the time words naturally change their meaning in the long term anyway.

	You say that what you are annoyed by is the "hypocrisy" behind avoiding some words but not others. Your assumption here seems to be that _everyone_ who avoids  "retarded" does so because "oh no, PC culture made me do it because it might offend some hypothetical person" (or because of some other external black-and-white morality which reduces words to "potentially offensive" or "safe to use"), and thus if one believes in the boogeyman that PC culture has become, one should stop using all of the other words too.

	I am telling you that, as far as I am aware, that is not the motivation of most people. Instead, they use an internal morality which distinguishes between those words. I am not avoiding "retarded" because the "woke left" or the "though police" told me to do it. I am avoiding it because saying it makes me feel like an asshole, and saying for instance "lame" does not. Where is the hypocrisy in that? 

	Now I don't agree with the holier-than-thou attitude that some leftist people have, where they treat you like the devil because you use a word they don't like^1 . I think that the way to go about it is with empathy, and by explaining _why_ we find certain terms offensive and not others, rather than just claiming it is a "morally superior choice". 

	At the end of the day, I didn't have a problem with "retarded" 10 years ago. But that's because I didn't have an opinion on the matter other than the default opinion of "I say what I want lol". It took conscious time and effort to educate myself and change that opinion, and I can't blame someone for not being offered the chances to reflect on it. 

	Because I acknowledge that (IMO) it does take a specific set of circumstances to change such a view. As humans we are empathetic creatures, but even so, it's difficult to have empathy for abstract, hypothetical people. But if, say, I had a good friend with a disability who told me that me using the word "retarded" really hurt them, while me using, say, "lame", had no effect, then yeah, I would argue that there's again no hypocrisy in just avoiding  one of the words.

	As a last thing I want to commend you for this post. Since the internet is basically an echo chamber, the arguments inevitably get reduced to "but muh freedom of speech!" and respectively "it's the only moral choice and if you don't do it you're Hitler". Which is why it's important to have places like this where more nuanced conversations can be had. And while I disagree with your perspective, I am grateful that you did bring it up so that you can see the other perspectives, rather than letting it stew, and potentially lead you to a bad place (psychologically, not morally).

	^1 the two disclaimers here are that 1) while I _have_ seen people like that online, I haven't met anyone like that IRL (i dont live in the US tho), so idk to what extent that is a real thing rather than a strawman used by conservatives to show how our "freedom of speech" is "dying", and 2) there are limits to this - if you, say, unironically throw the n-word around, then yeah, you're out of my friends book just like that

		There are certainly people irl who butt into convos and say not to use "retard." I bet using the word "dumb" would make a mute person feel insecure and/or bad. I knew a mute person and would never use that word around them. 
		
		The equation of an inability to speak with stupidity is no new thing. It has always been done. It is still mean. What are they going to do about it though? It is not like they can easily communicate their anguish without being labeled as "mad," and gain the reputation of being the crazy dumb person.

			Those arguments express the view that we should also stop using words such as "lame" and "dumb". I can't say that I completely disagree with this view.
			
			However, in your original post, you say that your issue is with people who use only some of the words, but not others, because that is hypocritical. It is *that* view that I am challenging. In particular, I fail to see why it is at all hypocritical.
			
			Sure, you could say that stopping at that specific point is _arbitrary_, that we should go further or less far than that, but that doesn't explain what exactly is hypocritical about it. The people you describe don't hold you to a different standard than themselves -- they're okay with _you_ saying "lame" and "dumb" as well. There is nothing inherently hypocritical about treating two different words differently. 
			
			Now if your question is really why do they stop there (which doesn't have anything to do with hypocrisy), I can't give you a unified answer, because each person draws their line of what is acceptable and what isn't differently. What I will say is that, in this context, no matter where you draw your own line, surely _one_ of the two camps is worse than the other. In this context, I really struggle to see where you're coming from with this paragraph:
			
			>I could not care less if people either did not care about all the words or if people cared about all the words. As long as there is consistency, all the power to you. It is the hypocrisy that I find to be utterly disgusting.
			
			First of all, you effectively claim that "consistency" and "hypocrisy" are the same thing, which really, they're not. Second, you talk about consistency as if it is automatically a good thing. What stops me from making the argument: 
			
			"I despise the legal system. It punishes some crimes with a $100 fine, and others with the death penalty. It should strive to be consistent -- it should either give every criminal the fine, or every criminal the death penalty. I am okay with people supporting either of those two options, as long as it's not something in between."?

	Let me try and change your mind on this: You seem to be set on "how meanings have changed" and how the word "retarded" has changed. A counterpoint would be that the word doesn't matter (no matter the word) and that it all depends on context.

	So I don't think it's necessarily wrong to say "retarded" if you're using it the way most people do which is just a synonym for "dumb." But it would be wrong to call a disabled person or refer to disabled people as "retards."

	Another example would be the N word. I know this probably sounds controversial, but think about it. Is the N word *really* bad, or is the context in which it's used bad? So, for instance, if one of the white actors in *12 Years a Slave* says the N word, did that actor do something wrong? I don't think so because of the context. Similarly, is it any better to call a black person a "monkey" (which isn't a slur) than the N word? Both of them convey literally the same racist message, though one is labeled a slur and one isn't; it entirely depends on the context as "monkey," in and of itself, is not a slur.

	So is it ok to say "retard?" I suppose it depends on the context. Are you using it as a pejorative to refer to people with mental/physical disabilities? Then, no, it is not. Are you using it as a synonym for "dumb; idiotic?" Then, yes, it is..

	"That's lame/dumb/mad" and "That's retarded" are not comparable. Hearing the former, one does not think of lame/dumb/mad people and how being lame/dumb/mad is undesirable. This is not the case with the latter. The word "idiotic" has the same meaning as "retarded" without the offensive evocation of developmentally disabled people. I think you can generalise this using the concept of the "dead metaphor" - a dead metaphor no longer invokes the original meaning. If I call you laconic, few people will think I mean you are from Sparta. If I call something "fishy", maybe you are dimly aware that there is a reason for that (old fish smell suspicious). If I call you "a spastic" the image of someone with cerebral palsy is likely to be invoked.

		I suppose it would depend from place to place. Some do not know the meanings of the words I listed.
		
		However, "mad" is still fairly commonly used with its original meaning. If you exclaim to someone "you're mad!" you are calling them crazy, even if driven there by anger. 
		
		If someone has trouble speaking, they might be called dumb. People may think they are stupid because they have trouble speaking, when in reality they may be very intelligent but with a speech issue. It is just as mean.

			I agree that it changes from place to place. Dumb, for instance to me means mute, and I would usually not use it to mean stupid. And I agree that mad still *also* has the meaning of insane, but my point is that if I say you are (e.g.) mad to go out in that weather, there is no comparable invocation of the image of (e.g.) "the madman" involved in either your mind or mine. So all your point means is that we have to acknowledge that dead metaphors can exist even while the literal meaning continues to apply in appropriate cases (as in if I ask my friend "did you actually go mad" when he was in the psych ward). That's the crux of my argument - that dead metaphors are - by definition - no longer offensive.

	I used to regularly say retarded as an insult and was one of those teens in the 90’s that used to say “that’s gay” when someone wasn’t cool. The reason I stopped was because while I was saying those things as a youth I didn’t see them as being to mean what their actual definitions, but as I got older I realized that didn’t matter. What mattered was that if I was saying “that’s gay” to a classmate and there was a gay person in the room (we now know there were probably way more than we thought at the time), that person was going to get upset and might feel worse about something they were already struggling with. 

	I stopped saying “retard” after I dated a girl who’s brother was autistic with mental retardation. I had a convo with her mother once where she used to tell me how it broke her heart when she heard people casually use that word, and that it was usually not when her son was around. She was reminded every time that the world was probably laughing at people like her son in a regular basis and that he would never have a “normal” life. So the point is, if you can avoid using a word that is going to ruin someone’s day, why not just grow up and do that.

	I agree that there are similar issues to consider related to the r-slur and other ablest language. However, I imagine that many people who prefer that other do not use the r-slur have concerns other than consistency-- like, "Who around me is hurt by this language and how hurt do they feel by it?" or "How have I seen people use this term and to what extent was it being used with the intention of being an ablest slur?"

	As someone with a sister who has Down syndrome and has been the target of the r-slur in a way that was 100% clearly being used as a slur (she has also very clearly explained to many people why their casual usage of the r-slur is shitty), I am definitely more aware of the r-slur in the context of ableism than I am around other potentially ablest language. I can imagine other situations where other forms of ablest language would feel particularly salient and important to be attuned to based on the context and/or company involved. (You yourself mentioned in the comments that attending school with a peer who was mute impacted the salience of some terms in your understanding of ablest language.)

	>It is the hypocrisy that I find to be utterly disgusting.

	Personally, I would definitely find someone who avoids slurs that they know to be particularly harmful to their community but does not always consistently avoid all forms of ableist language to be far less "disgusting" than someone who uses all forms of slurs with complete disregard to who in their community might find that harmful. However, this is based in personal values, not objective reality about what is 'better'. Nevertheless, I think it is important to point out that this is related to personal values because it is likely that there are other people's values who also differ from yours. 

	Consider, further, Kantian/deontological ethics vs. consequentialism. I feel like you are making a fairly Kantian/deontological argument here-- if there is a fundamental insult in the use of ablest language/a slur, we all have a categorical imperative to not use any of them (and if there is not, there is thusly no categorical imperative). But there are certainly many people who read Kant and still wander back into something more aligned with consequentialism-- in this case, assessing to what extent the language causes harm and determining what is ethical based on the likelihood of harm. I would never argue with a deontologist and try to talk them into being a consequentialist-- that seems fairly likely to be fruitless, lol. But I do think it's reasonable to expect a deontologist to be open to the fact that there are other schools of thought on ethics that are valid and worthy of consideration.

Perhaps the the net happiness of using the word "dumb" by many outweighs the anguish of those who are mute. Just because the mute may not be great in number, does not mean they are lesser beings. Utilitarianism would be cruel.
		
		In addition, with Kant, the limits are on the situations where an exception maybe made for morality. Why would using "dumb" ever be moral? It could only ever be at BEST neutral. There is not much gained from its usage.

	What more right do you have to say "these terms are all equally offensive" than others have to say that they are not? I already see the nuance you're missing in that "lame" for instance is a word I've only heard used about horses that can't walk and more offensive terms in that category exist. Mad's alternate definition of 'angry' isn't really an insult, dumb's usage for someone who is mute is a bit of a secondary definition these days, honestly the only time I've heard it to describe a mute person is in the phrase "Hellen Keller was deaf, dumb, and blind!" It's like how we know mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell. 

	Anyway, that you consider these things equally offensive is an opinion of yours that others are not required to share in order to have their "moral rights." Their morals are their own as are their judgments on the relative offense generated by words. Changing your view is going to require you to be able to admit that your rationale for declaring that they should be treated equally is only subjectively better in your mind than my rationale for distinction. It is as a matter of fact, your opinion only that your conclusion is more rational. I'm not declaring mine to be more objectively rational either, just that it makes more sense to me as proof that the appeal of the argument itself is subjective.

		Retards colloquial origin stems from it's adoption as a clinical term from the original Latin meaning, to delay or hold back, Retarded Mental Development. Or in other words delayed or held back mental development. Prior to the 60's words like idiot, cretin, moron, and imbecile we're all considered genuine, non insulting ways to refer to a mentally disabled person. Around that decade people decided those words were negative so retard became the socially acceptable way to refer to a mentally disabled person because of it's clinical use. 
		
		So where are we now? Now it's offensive! So what'll happen next? If I had to guess, once the word has gone through a sufficient period of shaming people are going to say disabled is offensive and some new clinical term will become the polite term, based on what's going around I'd predict "neurodivergent" (which isn't technically an official word) or something similar is going to be after disabled as the new PC way to refer to someone of hindered intelligence. And on and on it'll go people getting outraged about a word every couple decades or so, it's a cycle fueled by the Tom Sawyer effect. The more negative you make the word out to be the worse it becomes.

				That's true, and that's kinda the point. Much like the previous words mentioned (idiot, moron, etc.), retard was created to be a more polite way to refer to such people. The problem is that people are going to be ableist regardless of what the word du jour is, and so every time a new word is created, it *will* eventually gain negative associations, because people feel negatively about disabled people in general. Even innocuous phrases like "special needs" became insulting (mostly in the form of 'special') before too long. And so the new word picks up all the same taboos as the old word and we need an even newer one, because the taboos were never about the word itself to begin with.

				I find it hard to believe that you are in any way mentally challenged if you're able to articulate your ideas like that. I used to have a step brother with special X which is a protein mutation in the brain, he can never live on his own or even express his ideas at  even a moderate level. I've seen a trend of people my age and slightly younger playing off as if they have a learning disability when they don't, ADD is not disabled, I'm ADD and dyslexic and it's an inconvenience at worst. If you believe it's debilitating then you will behave that way because your beliefs shape your behavior. So if you're comparing yourself to someone with special X or similar severe genetic abnormalities I'd say you're making yourself a victim and it's far more offensive than any word or slur I could use innocuously.
				
				That being said no I don't think it nice to bully anyone. But go back to what I said because you're missing the point. When you fight against something and make it out to be horrible then it will be, when you normalize something you take away its bite and the discomfort it causes. Such has been the case for many words that once held a similar status, it's cyclical. 
				
				What I'm saying is that words are tools to convey ideas and aren't good or bad. The way we use them and how we behave as a culture is the real issue. The words I gave examples of before have no other meaning than a stupid person yet those are more acceptable? Even though Retard was the word we adopted to replace those words. So the issue of bullying and using language abusively is entirely a cultural issue and should be treated that way instead demonizing words, does that makes sense?
				
				Furthermore if you're using neurodivergent to describe a person who is mentally challenged that is also not correct because that's not what it means. it refers to any neurological function that is different form the norm. Just as the word retard means to delay or hold back. The way we use retard is the exact same way we use "slow" as an insult. 
				
				I would bet that in a few decades or so society is gonna come down on calling people disabled. You can easily twist it to make it seem offensive. For example, how can you call someone disabled? Should they and everyone else ascribe the belief that they are incapable of anything in general? Because that's not true either, there are mentally challenged people with wonderful unique abilities. So therefore the term disabled is ascribing them the connotation of being useless. And if you think I'm an ableist that's so fat off point too I have friends with high functioning autism clinically diagnosed that struggle to do certain things sure but I acknowledge how amazing they are at whatever their unique talents are.   And I'm not neurotypical myself but I'm not disabled. I don't even see my friends who are labeled as disabled, as disabled. You could say I'm retarded though and it wouldnt even be an insult or offensive I'm just held back from where I want to be in life, technically retarded. 
				
				Don't twist my words I'm not saying bullying is okay I'm just saying you're fighting the wrong battle.

	There is a reason for that specific word becoming socially unacceptable while the others remain socially acceptable, and that is because words like dumb, mad and lame just aren’t used in those contexts, at least not anymore. The only time I’ve ever seen “lame” or “dumb” refer someone who is disabled is when I was forced to read the King James version of the Bible as a child, which is written in an older English dialect. I’ve never heard anyone use those words, at least not in normal modern conversation patterns, when referring to someone who is physically disabled or someone who is mute. Now dumb has morphed into a word that simply means stupid or unintelligent, which is obviously sad given the older meaning of it but like I said before NOBODY is still referring to people who don’t speak as dumb. Same thing with lame, nobody uses that word in that context anymore. Mad is similar, but is still used as it’s older connotation in Europe. Here in the States you might not be able to actually find many people who are even aware that it used to also mean insane. The R word on the other hand is different, it is still very much used to refer to disabled individuals while simultaneously having a very negative connotation as an insult for someone/something that is unintelligent or ridiculous. It is possible for words to have multiple meanings simultaneously, and unfortunately the meanings that words take on are subject to the evolution of culture as well. The R word used to be used to refer to people who were developmentally disabled, it was even used clinically, but then people began using it for humor, and finally as an insult. It does not matter what the old definition used to be, because now when people hear the word they only think of the prejudicial insult connotation, which is directly weaponizing the suffering that disabled people endure for the sole purpose of insult or negative description. This meaning of the word is also extremely emotionally charged, and that will make it the first meaning to appear in a given person’s mind when hearing it, after all it is simply more interesting than the other older clinical definition. This is just another word that has become associated with the worst meaning that it has, which is something that you can only really blame on those prejudiced individuals that gave it the negative connotation in the first place.

		Before the 1960's words like moron, idiot, cretin, and imbecile we're considered genuine, non-offensive ways to describe a person with disabilities. Around that decade people began to grow concerned with the negative connotations and replaced them with the word retard, which literally means to delay or hold back. Now the exact same thing is happening with the word retard.  
		
		The way I see it, fighting these things only makes them worse, and it's cyclical. Whatever we replace retard is one day gonna end up in the same boat and we may find retard not as offensive anymore. Debates like these are nonsense while our world is burning.

				My question is whether or not this particular change occured just randomly/naturally or due to some kind of activism against it. Ie did people start finding the word offensive naturally just due to the way it sounds, due to how people started to use it (culture), or because either a group or individual started the idea that the word was somehow bad. I wasn't alive at that time and don't have a whole lot of detailed info on the subject so I don't really know. 
				
				My perspective is that further stigmatizing the word also stigmatizes the condition, having to dress it down and making it almost impossible to refer to in any commonplace terms seems more harmful than helpful to me especially if the trend I described persists.
				
				The best analogy I can make is flimsy at best, but here goes. In meditation when dealing with anxiety or intrusive thoughts the way to overcome them isn't to fight them and make them go away, it's to accept them and actively and consciously reduce their effect on your state of mind. That's psychology in action and it works tremendously. I said before in either my first reply to you or another comment but it's the Tom Sawyer effect, ascribing labelling something as bad that was not inherently bad and then tabooing it will create a divisive environment for discussion and further instill belief that there's a problem with the word not the way we as a society treat each other. Words are just tools to convey ideas they're neither good nor bad. 
				
				That being said I believe in about 10-30 years maybe even more we'll forget all about the outrage we have about the word retard, and possibly decide that now disabled is offensive and must use some new term. It's a cycle of misdirected outrage. You could easily start that conversation today by marketing the idea that it's some how offensive, like people labeled as disabled are not able to do things? That's not true though there are autistic and other disabled that have incredible talent. There now we cant use that word.
				
				So I think the best way to fight an offensive word isn't to delete the word but normalize the correct or less offensive meaning. Because you can keep deleting words all you want but if we still have a society that tolerates bullying people there's always gonna be a new world and a new way to hurt people. My evidence for this are those old words that used to be polite words to describe the condition (idiot, imbecile, moron, etc.) Those are now normalized and  acceptable alternatives to refer to stupidity, those words have no other meaning than a stupid person so why is retard so hated when it's real meaning just means stop or delay? Time and normalization.
				
				TLDR, the bigger reaction you make about the word the more uncomfortable people are likely to feel, normalizing the word would be more effective in taking away it's edge barring some kind of massive shift in societal values.

					Thanks for your thoughtful response. :) I think that's an interesting comparison with intrusive thoughts. But I think I disagree...I think that comparison implies that using the r word leads to erasure of people with mental disabilities. But that isn't the case. I don't think the r word should be banned or that mental disabilities shouldn't be talked about.
					
					Words are powerful and have great potential to cause harm, alienation...but also to spread love and feelings of inclusion. I try to aim for the latter.
					
					If you were a person with a mental disability who had been called the r word several times in their life, how do you think you would feel if you heard someone use that word in an "innocent" way? I think it would be perfectly understandable if that hurt and offended you.

						I think you misunderstood then. I'm not talking about erasure, I'm talking about exposure. You said it yourself if they've been exposed to only people using the word abusively then yes it will upset them. But I'm talking about societal level exposure to normalize a word that isn't in and of itself a bad word, just the way we use it and we ourselves behave. 
						
						Like you said words have alot of potential to create different feelings and describe things differently. Which is why having  a variety of words to describe the same thing, in this case stupidity, for which there are already multiple words who's only meaning is "a stupid person", whereas retard does not even refer to a stupid person just the state of being held back. It was actually the word adopted to replace other once innocuous words. So what I'm saying is the behavior of society to find words and use them abusively is something that exist because a cultural flaw.  To fight against these kinds of things it doesn't help to go after a word because that will only create space for a new word to arise.
						
						But you can go to different regions and words hold different meanings. So my stance is that further demonizing words only gives them the power that makes them so hurtful.
						
						Call someone an idiot these days and it almost means nothing, calling someone an imbecile is almost a classy way to call someone an idiot where it was quite recently considered too negative to use.

		But “retard” isn’t used in a medical context anymore either. In fact they stopped using it because the public was using it as an insult, so it’s kind of circular logic. So why is it treated different than the others? It seems like the exact same situation.  A word that used to mean something specific but that was adopted by the general public for humorous use.

	It's not a "magic exception"... its meaning just hasn't finished changing as much as the other examples you give have. 

	You would agree, I hope, that these meaning changes happen over time, and some words complete those changes *way* faster than others. Look how fast "gay" stopped meaning "happy" for example. 

	By comparison, people *still* argue about "literally" even though that ship sailed a century ago.

	"Retarded" just still has strong connotations of being both a slur for mentally disabled people, and a mild insult towards others. It hasn't finished. 

	Don't be so surprised by this. It is the *norm*, not some weird exception. Language/idiom/connotation almost *never* changes all the same all at once, in lockstep.

		I would like to expand on this. I work in the dd field. Most of the names of organizations have changed, and people don't usually say this word, unlessthey are older. But. Every person on my caseload with an intellectual disability has mild, moderate, or severe "mental retardation" on their diagnosis list. They didn't stop giving that as the official diagnosis until (i think) the 90s. There are still a few forms with this word listed. At my last job,  my title was QIDP, which stands for qualified intellectual disability professional. On my paychecks, it was listed as QMRP. You can guess what the MR stands for. The clients know that this word was originally meant to describe them and that it is also an insult. My state had a board of "MR/DD" until 2009, when they finally dropped the MR.

		>By comparison, people still argue about "literally" even though that ship sailed a century ago.
		
		It hasnt. The reason littetally is used colloquially is because of the literal definition of the word "litterally." When you use it colloquially, it's hyperbole. It means that something so close to reality that it becomes (metaphorically) real. You would not be able to use the word "literally" in the way that you do if its definition wasn't still taking a word or phrase for its true meaning. 
		
		It's an expression, not an alternate definition. Much like how a ton still means 1000 kg. And how freezing means turning water into ice, or also the temperature at which water turns into ice. Their definitions haven't changed. We just use it in a metaphorical and hyperbolic sense to express ourselves better.

							Definitions depend on context. When I tell you that someone is a little blue, but will cheer up later, that doesn't mean they have blue skin. Expecting one definition to apply in all situations is not how words work. In your example you are putting the intensifier definition of literally in a place where, pragmatically, the first definition applies.
							
							It's a bit like saying "He was feeling blue, but he'll feel red later", or, conversely, "The sky was blue, but maybe it'll cheer up later". If you have the pragmatics/context clues of one definition but also are trying to indicate it should mean another definition, you end up with nonsense. And indeed, exploiting this duality, and ambiguity that can entail, is how a lot of wordplay work, when done artfully.
							
							Your sentences are like my "blue" sentences; they mix up semantics and pragmatics of 2 different definitions of a word, in a way that doesn't fully make sense for either; that's why it doesn't work, not because of any deficit with either definition l. Hope that helps.
							
							Also, while we're here, "figuratively" is a bit of a red herring. When literally is used as an intensifier, the word "figuratively" doesn't fit there, it's more like "completely", "really", "truly", or even "just" etc.
							
							Like if someone says "I literally **died** when he told me that!!" it doesn't mean "I figuratively died when he told me that!!", because no one would ever say that sentence! "I figuratively died!" is not something an English speaker needs to say; that's already clear from the pragmatics of "I died" in that context. Linguistically speaking, anyone who complains about literally being used to mean "figuratively", "doesn't know what the fuck they're talking about".
							
							
							Agree or disagree with that kind of use of "literally" as an intensifier (personally, don't actually particularly like it, but meh), saying it means "figuratively" just isn't an actual explanation of how it's being used at all. A better gloss would be "I just **died** when he told me that!!", or "I completely died when he told me that!", or, "I really died when he told me that!!".
							
							
							"Really" is the funniest one, because it's _literally_ the most common intensifier in English, and it _literally_ has the same original etymology as literally, it didn't use to mean "very" at all, just "in reality", i.e., _literally_

			Words’ definitions are based on the way they’re used and interpreted. The definition of literally has been removed from its original meaning, so it’s naturally going to have another definition that fits the way people interpret that. Same for “a ton” or “freezing” in your example.
			
			Another example is the word awesome. Originally, it’s definition was completely awe-filling. So amazing that you are filled with awe. The word has since changed usage and now doesn’t have the same gravitas as it once was, but if I called my pet awesome, and you and I and everyone else understood what I meant with this new definition, you can’t really come along and say that it’s wrong, just because it doesn’t fit the old definition. Same goes for literally.
			
			Language is descriptive. Grammar rules and dictionary definitions are taught in order to sound a certain way, but so long as everyone generally understands a certain thing, it doesn’t really matter. There’s no right or wrongs. Weird, maybe. Tone might change based on context. But nothing in language is explicitly incorrect.

				TLDR at the bottom
				
				You didn't understand what i said. Let me rephrase/repeat the most important part. The "new definition" of the word "literally" isn't a definition. It's an acknowledgment that it is used for the sake of hyperbole. Its hyperbolic use is entirely and utterley reliant on its "original" definition. If, to simplify for this example, the word "literal" was synonymous with the word "real" or "actual," you are not giving it a new definition by saying, "I am literally dying of laughter." You would still be using its original definition. Only you would be saying a falsehood for the sake of exaggerating to show strong emotions. That's called hyperbole, not a definition. You would be saying, "I am actually dying because I am laughing so much. My dying of laughter is for real." The use of the word, as you can see, is entirely reliant on its "original" definition, because you are expressing that you are laughing so hard, you feel as if you might actually die for real due to laughter. Even though you know it's not true, you're expressing yourself. You're saying that you're feeling about something feels so close to reality, that it might as well be reality. 
				
				If the word "literally" had actually gained a new definition, that's not at all what you would be expressing. You'd be expressing something different that would be entirely reliant on a completely different definition. Let's say, because people often say this, that the term "literally" is synonymous with the term figuratively as its new definition. Now, by saying," I am literally dying of laughter," you are no longer expressing any strong emotions. It would be the exact same thing as saying, "I am dying of laughter," like we used to say, except with a reassurance not to worry because I am now letting you know that I am speaking in metaphor. You would no longer be able to say, " I am actually dying of laughter."  Instead, you would be saying," I am not dying of laughter"  or "I am comparing my laughter to the feeling of dying. " No one would say that because we already know how metaphors work, so there's no point in saying so. Especially that, if by doing so, you would be removing any emotion. There is no new information or emotion being communicated or related to in any way, so our subconscious would never want to communicate in that way, and neither would our conscious mind.
				
				  You would also be able to say such things as, "metaphors and hyperbole are examples of literal phrases in texts. When the sun smiles at you, the smile is a literal smile used to express how you feel good and comfortable in the suns warm rays." Because none of that makes sense, and because in these sentences, I am clearly not using any form of hyperbole to express any stron emotions, you can see that it is incorrect to say that "literally" has a new definition that isnt the original definition "of in accordance with, involving, or being the primary or strict meaning of the word or words."
				
				Also, to drive my point further home, when I say, "The sun is smiling down on us," I am not giving the word "smile" a new definition. Im saying a falsehood for the sake of expressing my emotions through a metaphor. When I say, "The apple doesn't fall too far from the tree," I am not saying that apple now also means that the son and tree now also means father. Im comparing the notion that sons tend to eventually act like their fathers to an apple tree. And, more accurately to our current discussion about hyperbole, when I say, "Im going to smash my alarm clock into a million pieces," Im not changing the definition of the word "million." When i say a million, im talking about the same million as everyone else, no alternate definition. 
				
				TLDR All this to say, using a word as a metaphor or hyperbole doesn't magically change its definition, and so you can "literally" (hyperbole in order signify strong emotions) eat dog doo doo. ((Im just joking, i thought it was a fitting thing to say because of the context))

				Definitions are descriptions, not usecase. A metaphor or hyperbole can not be definitions. When a specific instance of hyperbole or metaphor is used often enough or becomes "official," that is called a turn of phrase, expression, or idiom. When a word is used to describe something that is not within the scope of its original definition, that is slang. And when slang becomes popular enough, it may become an official definition. 
				
				Hyperbole can not be a definition because it still uses the original definition. If i say that im going to smash my alarm clock into a million pieces, i am not changing the definition of a million. I still mean a million as in 1,000,000 or 10^7. I am simply exaggerating to express emotions, but a million still means a million. Just because that phrase, "smash into a million pieces," is common, it does not change the definition. Instead, it becomes an idiom, expression, or turn of phrase

		Took the words and the example I was going to use right out of my mouth. It's the fact that words like "gay" and "retard" have been used exclusively as a derogatory slur against groups of people that makes them wrong to use as put-downs or insults. No one bats an eye at being called dumb, but calling someone a retard is immediately going to invoke a very specific example. Your buddy does something outlandish and you say "that's silly"; no one is going to think twice about it, but if you tell your buddy "you're gay" for doing that thing then just like retard it's going to invoke very specific and directed imagery.

		I'd go as far as to say that the R-Word *was* well on it's way to almost becoming a generic insult like "idiot" and "moron" had become (which used to also be more technical terms then slurs for the disabled), untill there was a big push to discourage the r-word's use in the early 2010s.
		
		I'm jewish, LGBT, etc, but I really think that if you want to actually permanantly or signficantly reduce a slur or symbol's ability to harm, you have to let it become a generic term and lose it's taboo nature. If it stays taboo, people with bad intentions can always abuse it

		I don't think it has much to do with that at all, and I think the man who tries to find consistency behind morality and social mores is a fool indeed. The only reason a man becomes offended or considers something immoral is because he has seen enough others become offended by it before.

			Except we're at the phase where that doesn't seem to be happening very much. 
			
			That's a good thing. It means the disapproval people are pouring on that word is *working*. 
			
			The point isn't to remove stigma from a particular word. As you point out that just shifts things to another word. 
			
			The point is to shame people into not slurring mentally disabled people *at all*. 
			
			If you think we're there already, great... I think it's somewhat close. At the moment, though, social disapproval even for a *mild* insult about that is in my mind still important. 
			
			But regardless: OP's view is just wrong. They may become the same, sure. But today they aren't. Trying to create a false equivalence doesn't really help anything.

		Because there is meaning lost when it comes to literally. We have no replacement for that. Retarded shifting to be less accepted is just replaced by another word that means the same. Dumb or slow or mentally impaired or whathaveyou. It's like a conveyor belt, the next word just slides into usage. And then the next one after that, and so on. Literally doesn't have that. It's a word that has its meaning changed, but nothing replaced that now signifies the concept that literally uses to signify. That concept still exists.

			Absolutely, I have a speech disorder (appraxia I think is how it's spelled?) And if someone were to call me dumb in that way, I would call it a slur, I don't really like calling people dumb either, because it's insulting intelligence. I think of lame more of a "joke" to make with close friends or family that are 100% okay with the word, and if they are not, that's totally fine. 
			
			I agree with you OP, on some things, I see lame as something when people refer more to other animals, like a horse. "That horses leg is lame." Whereas in internet culture it's "changed" to mean something like a meme. 
			
			I'm very tired of arguing with the bigots on here (not you, but so far I've been called the r-word around four times. After openly admitting it's been used as a slur against me, so they know it's a slur.) So personally you've changed MY view.

					Yes, exactly, it took time for that meaning to change. But I would disagree with your assessment of the usage of "retarded" which hasn't had time to go through that same change and is still used in a terribly derogatory way. Some people who don't understand the hurtfulness of the word may not see a problem with using it in everyday speech, but once you've seen it used to degrade and dehumanize people, it's hard to say it's still ok to use *sometimes* because "the meaning has changed". I would say that for many people and in many cases, the meaning hasn't changed enough to be able to use it without being hurtful.

						Anything can be used to degrade anyone, and any can take offense and anything, my issue is with the whole notion of policing language. Your sentiment seems to be to stop people saying mean things to people, but its easy to be mean and degrading without using specific slurs. 
						
						You ban or make saying "retard" frowned upon, it doesn't stop the actual issue of people being assholes. They'll just come up with new word, and in 20 years you'll wanna ban those too. Non of this stops the root cause of people being dicks. Words are just short hand for a larger thing we're trying to express, if you don't like "retard" be mad at its meaning, not the random assortment of letters that we've decided in English equals this sentiment you don't like. If someone calls a disabled person a retard be mad that them for insulting a disabled person (assuming its purely *because* they're disabled). Don't be upset at someone calling an idiot like Trump or Andrew Tate a retard, because you know their sentiment is that their views are so stupid there must be something wrong with them, that isn't inherently insulting to disabled people, its saying "you're so stupid you're brain must be broken" we just condense that down to the general colloquial use of "retard". 
						
						Language is so cool, I hate how this thread is just people blowing a fuse that someone types "retard".

	The difference is that retard(ed) is still being actively used to attack people with mental disabilities, while words like stupid, idiot, moron, dumb etc. have moved pretty much entirely into the social sphere.

	If you look them up, most dictionaries will actually list the old medical connotations of words like idiot, stupid etc. as **obsolete/dated/archaic/old-fashioned** etc., because lexicographers have found that those are not commonly used to insult people with mental disabilities anymore.

	Example for the word "idiot":

	* *informal* a stupid person

	* *archaic* a person of low intelligence

	This change may over time also be *observed* for the word retard(ed), but such changes typically only happen organically, not by fiat.

				I believe the commenter above is correct that the *vast* majority of its modern usage is not in a directed hate-speech type of context that you’re describing. The word itself is powerless for most people and I’d bet well over 95% of its usage is
				simply referring to trivial mistakes made by people regardless of their clinical mental abilities. 
				
				I disagree that the “meaning of those other words has changed and the r-word has not”. They’ve all evolved to colloquially mean roughly the same thing - a mild insult on intelligence.
				
				- “Dumb” evolved from specifically referring to mutism, which (due to the inability to communicate) was viewed as a lack of intelligence, and is now softened to just reference general unintelligence. 
				- “Idiot” referred to severe intellectual disability, which has now been softened to colloquially reference general unintelligence.
				- “Moron” was a mild clinical intellectual disability, now softened to colloquially reference general unintelligence. 
				- “Imbecile” was a clinical reference to someone with a low IQ for their age, now softened to colloquially reference general unintelligence. 
				- “Retarded” was a clinical delay intellectual development, now softened to colloquially reference general unintelligence.
				
				I don’t perceive any one of them as being “worse” or currently used more clinically or hatefully than the others. In any teenager’s vocabulary on the school ground, their virtually all synonymous and lack significant power as insults given their over-usage for trivial matters.
				
				We’re on a path where the so called politically correct replacement terms, such as “mentally challenged”, “intellectually disability”, eventually “neurodivergent”, etc. carry more “clinical” definitional power, and thus will have more power than the softened colloquial usage of the other terms for those who choose to leverage them hatefully. They will most likely all go through the same language evolution: clinical term -> misuse to derogatorily mock affected individuals -> misuse to playfully mock every day mistakes -> no term to differentiate the joke from the clinical definition -> new clinical term -> repeat.
				
				The sad reality is that regardless of the word used, horrible people sometimes say horrible things to hurt others. You aren’t made that someone used the “r-word” directed at you, you’re rightfully mad that their insulting you in the first place. Society needs to continue to look down on these assholes for their actions and hope that culture and morality can help reduce the problem. Banning language will always be ineffective and if anything, gives more power to the term in the hands of those who will misuse it.

		How people use the word in colloquially is basically what OP was saying it's a hyperbolic word for calling someone stupid, and based on it's literal definition, it makes sense.

Retarded also isn't used as a medical definition or even a commonplace word for severe learning issues. In fact I'd say that it has made even more of a transition from those words because many people probably don't even realise it used to he a medical word, whereas lame, dumb, etc are all commonplace enough to be understood by everyone as having those meanings. In every one of those cases, the definition as stupid originated as an abuse of a medical term to call something 'stupid' or 'pathetic'. OP is right, there is a double standard going on.

This obviously only worked for a while and now “retarded” is itself considered a derogatory term. It seems any word that basically means “low intelligence” is fated to be thought of as derogatory eventually. So it’s only a matter of time before politically correct terms like “mentally handicapped” will come to be derogatory themselves.

	> Dumb refers to those who are mute. Mad refers to those driven insane. Lame refers to the physically disabled.

	They do not anymore.  Nobody would call a mute person "dumb" anymore, and nobody would call a real human person with mental illness "mad" anymore.  "Lame", maybe, but it's a neutral term.

	> Such has been the case with"retarded" as well.

	No, it has not.  "Retarded" is a term that specifically -- and *only* -- describes people with mental disabilities.  The word *does* have other definitions, but if I say that you're retarded, I'm directly comparing you to a person with mental disabilities.  That's not at all true of those other words.  If I call you dumb, for example, I'm not saying that you're as terrible as a mute person; I'm saying that you are making unintelligent decisions, with the implicit understanding that you're not *actually* of low intelligence.  If I call you retarded, I'm insulting the mentally disabled as a class; if I call you dumb, I'm only insulting *you*.

	Note that this is not dependent on intention, really.  It doesn't matter if I call you retarded but mean no disrespect to people with mental disabilities; that word when used as an insult still refers specifically to them.  A similar word is "negro", which in Portuguese and Spanish just means the color black but in English refers specifically to Black people.  I can't use the word as the color in English because it's tied to the people it refers to, now in a pejorative way (even though it used to be a respectful term, similar to "retarded").  But "dumb" and "mad" have lost their pejorative associations with people with disabilities, to the point that it would just be confusing, not insulting, to refer to them that way.  "Lame" I think is borderline, but nobody really says that people with physical disabilities are "lame" anymore, and even when they do, it's a neutral word rather than a pejorative one.

	So, to summarize: "retarded" is an insult *to mentally disabled people*; "dumb" and "mad" don't actually describe people with disabilities anymore at all; "lame" is not an insult to physically disabled people and isn't really used anymore anyway.

	I think your method of determining hypocrisy here was too reductive.  You're seeing situations that are similar in some ways but have important differences and not noting those differences.  Just something to think about for next time.

	Seeing as people tend discover the original meanings of dumb, mad, and lame well after using them I think it's pretty clear they are different. If someone calls someone dumb they aren't saying they can't speak. When you call someone retarded you are likening them to mentally handicapped people that is a what people hear.

	Look -

	I grew up and we said “f*ggot” as an insult as preteens and teens. 

	We also called stuff we thought was not cool, “gay”

	The first had a much stronger connotation. 

	Even my most red GOP friends stopped saying the first a decade ago. It’s just a realization of well, other people are uncomfortable and the connotation has shifted. 

	The use of things being “gay” is also considered wrong these days, but it’s so much milder I still see it used a lot here in MO. Not saying it’s right, but words aren’t black and white. Language isn’t black and white and ALL communication is both subjective and CONTEXT like body language, setting, and a million other factors matter. 

	I’m sure you could find something in Bernie Sanders past that looks racist and would get a someone else “cancelled”. But he’s got literal decades of history fighting for civil rights, and that context matters. You can’t just compare two things this way when the reality is tens of millions of Americans still say retarded in certain company. However most would never say it around a disabled person. Again not saying it’s right, just stating that’s the reality. And the reality matters more than your theoretical black and white false logical language argument.

	>Forbidding the usage of one arguably offensive term while using others reeks of hypocrisy.

	I care for 2 special needs adults. Here is the main difference that I see in "retarded" vs "dumb": the 2 people I care for weren't bullied with the term "dumb". They, themselves, will call things dumb, like a sweater they don't like, etc. "Retard" or "retarded" was a term that they received with hostility throughout their life. So that word cuts a lot deeper. Its also a word that hurts their parents and loved ones, because of the derogatory connotation. So being a part of that world, I've made it a habit to not say it.

	It’s a matter of impact, not a purely academic exercise in linguistics. Most of us will live our entire lives without ever meeting someone who is offended by the mere use of the words dumb, mad, or lame. On the other hand, many of us will encounter someone who is hurt by the use of the word retarded. So people may refrain from using that word as a kindness to the people who would be hurt by it.

	My little brother is disabled.  He's mute, and has physical disabilities but the majority of his disability is mental. There's lots of things in life he's not aware of what they mean.  He knows what retarded means, because that word has been hurled against him by all manor of bullies and assholes his whole life. 

	> Such has been the case with"retarded" as well.

	You're wrong, the reason you are wrong is because my little brother, who has the mental ability of a 3 year old, knows what it means even if you don't.  He knows it means he's different, he knows people are talking about him.  He knows that when people call him that, they are trying to be mean.  He knows and it breaks his hart when he hears it, I can see it on his face even when the word is not directed at him. When someone does direct it at him, it crushes his soul in a way that... it just breaks my hart. 

	So what I would say to you is this.  People use the word retarded as a slur, they use it in anger, they use it to hate.  People don't generally use dumb, mad or mute in that way.  YOU might not use retarded in that way, but lots of people still do.  Because other people use the word as a weapon of hate, it means you should not use the word at all. 

	When I was a young man (late 90s early 2000s), we used to use the word "gay" to mean something was stupid, wrong or lame.  I'm a straight white male, even back then I had gay friends and in general had no problem with gay people.  The use of the word "gay" in that way was just part of the language that my peers used.   

	One day a gay person told me it bothered them.  I didn't stop right away but over time, as I actually sought about it I eventually just decided that even though I didn't MEAN it in a bad way, people would hear it in a bad way.  SO I stopped saying things like "that's so gay" to mean something was bad.  Turns out, I had other words that I could use, I didn't need gay just like you don't need retarded.  You could use other words, you just don't want to. 

	SO you might argue that people "should" not be offended by the use of the word retarded.  I can 100% tell you that I am offended by your use of that word.  My little brother does not really understand the concept of being offended, but it 100% makes him feel badly every single time he hears it.

	Literally all of the examples of colloquial uses for those other words are so different that they would no longer apply to the original "groups" 

	No one would call Mute people "dumb" or say that an INSANE person is simply "mad" or say that disabled people are lame.

	But retarded means the SAME THING IT ALWAYS HAS! People still use the word "retard" for people with mental retardation, there's virtually no difference in the usage of calling your friend retard and calling a retarded person a retard.

	Mute people are not dumb in the sense that they are not smart.

	Insane people are not mad in the sense that they are angry.

	Disabled people are not lame in the sense that they are not cool.

	Your examples are literally NOT WHAT THEY MEANT. That's why it's not the same. It's not that complex.

	Now allow me to step off MY high horse and admit, I still use the word retard sometimes, not as a serious insult, only around specific friends, and I have not done a thorough job to remove it off my vocabulary because, well, I've never said it around someone who might be hurt by it. So I'm not one of those "hypocrites" I say every single word you listed, and even I can tell the difference. Just say you're not willing to change your vocabulary.

	I am strongly against using the "retarded" word. In many parts of the world - English speaking - use the word to imply mental state (as if speaking in medical terms). It becomes a label. I recall when I was a kid- my grandfather had taken me his friend's house who son's house- who had some delayed development. I recall my grandfather telling me not to drink the water in the "retards" house- as if it was something contagious.

	I agree with you on the word dumb. As for mad and lame, to me it seems that their no implied "medical label", unlike the word "retard".

	Has the meaning of r******* changed, though? Dumb used to mean people who are mute, now it means foolish/unreasonable/pointless/etc. Mad used to mean unstable or psychotic and now it means “angry” or “very”. Lame used to mean unable to walk and now it means boring/uncool. R******* used to mean developmentally/intellectually disable and now it means ..... nonsensical/foolish/a bunch of things that imply a lack of intellect/discernment/rationality. It hasn’t changed that much, the implication is that someone is acting as a developmentally disabled person might. It came into use as a direct comparison to developmentally disabled people and then stopped being clinically appropriate terminology for those people and kept being used with a very similar implication. It’s just more derogatory than the examples you gave.

	Not to compare it to the N-word because they are not the same, but “retarded” has also historically been wielded as a tool for hurting and discriminating against a specific group of people. In this case, people without the ability to stand up for themselves. 

	“Dumb” or “idiotic” don’t hold the same historical and prejudicial baggage as “retarded.”

	I get why particularly people who have close family who are developmentally disabled would feel very uncomfortable with people using that word. Because they’ve seen it used to hurt people who can’t defend themselves. 

	Not all words in a culture are equal. I know you’d like to see them that way, but they are not.

	Just on your last point. Morality isn’t something we change or make- it’s discovered. . 

	Torturing was **always wrong**, we just didn’t discover that until an unfortunate amount of time passed. . 

	So gay marriage was always morally correct— we just didn’t discover this until much later (relative to interracial marriage). 

	So no- morals are not set by those with the loudest megaphones, but they often are discovered by hearing those voices. .

	To continue to use a word that causes offence to people is stupid. If someone tells me that the word magenta causes them offence, then I'll do my best to avoid that word around them. It doesn't matter that I don't understand/agree. It's an easy concession that hurts noone.

	It's a weird hill to die on with near zero implications on your part to adjust your language. We're lucky to have evolved to the point of having a huge lexicon with near unlimited ways to express ourselves, to bed yourself into one word is dumb, mad, and lame.
