this also feels very eastern vs western too, lot of desi etiquette would qualify as ‘guess culture’ whereas i would describe white american culture as ‘ask culture’

yeah I was definitely thinking of like diaspora interactions where these dynamics play out, thought this was a good qualification like there’s definitely levels to the Askers lol

lol i have to tell ppl directly sometimes when i notice this "just ask me i will tell you no if it makes me uncomfortable/i cant do that for you"

guessing is the correct culture highly dislike when people dare to inconvenience anyone at all in any way due to not guessing the circumstances right

hah! this says a lot. i literally got fired once for treating "non contractually obligated" activity as truly optional

Whoa. This is super interesting. Never heard of this but I think I’m solidly guess.

I just go with Guess Culture because I'm an awkward piece of shit.
