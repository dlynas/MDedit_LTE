## Is dualism essentially debunked?

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/neuroscience/comments/cu2wa5/is_dualism_essentially_debunked/](https://www.reddit.com/r/neuroscience/comments/cu2wa5/is_dualism_essentially_debunked/)

> Dualism was a prominent idea of describing how the mind worked before we had access to the tools available to learn more about the brain. With our current understanding of the brain, isn't it safe to say dualism is debunked, or, at least not useful anymore?
> 
> For one, we can see now using EEG how certain groups of neurons activate when thinking and performing other tasks like visualising objects. We also know from advancements in physics that conservation of energy and other laws don't allow physical objects to be affected by essentially nothing, energy must be conserved. There's also other logical things like, if the mind was non-physical, how can we see, say, a banana, when we visualise it in our heads? How can we see a non-physical thing? 
> 
> After all this, even if dualism is true, it would have to take the form of neurons to even have any effect on the physical body, making it essentially materialistic. Note that I mean no offence to anyone who believes in substance dualism when I say any of this. What do you guys think of dualism, is it essentially debunked?

	It is, and will continue to be a textbook option to a philosophical question, but it seems less popular than it used to.

	And it's probably hard to find any believers in a neuroscience forum :)

		Not debunked, simply unfavorable then. The explanatory gap between neural correlates and subjective experience still remains without an answer.

	In general, I would say as we learn more about the brain, the more it limits what the "non-physical" aspect of dualism can reasonably be. In general, you tend to see people arguing that experience itself is "non-physical" (and rarely anything more than that). One argument for this is that it seems reasonable that biological/cognitive mechanisms of the brain could be carried out without the associated experience (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie). Arguments like this are probably not possible to debunk with empirical evidence and are purely philosophical rather than a real neuroscience question. In terms of your actual points: 

	1) correlation between neuronal activity and thoughts does not imply they are the same. 

	2) The conservation of energy (and most similar physics arguments) depend on the specific types of dualism. Some (admittedly weird and slightly terrifying) ones believe that experience is non-physical but does not causally affect physical things. Under this view, your experience of the color red is separate from your brain processing that it is seeing red and anything your body does in response to seeing red is a causal affect of your brain's processing (which is purely physical) rather than your non-physical experience of red. Other dualistic views have various ways of dealing with these problems that tend to focus on weird quantum randomness (I'm really not a fan of these ones) or other physics-related arguments. Or they just bite the bullet, or argue physics is incomplete or not causally closed (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_closure)

	3) I don't really get what you're trying to say with the banana thing. When you picture a banana there is no physical banana materializing. While it is pretty safe to say that the mechanism by which your brain generates this visualization is purely physical, the question is whether your experience of seeing the banana is physical. 

	Basically the arguments for dualism tend to be impossible to confirm or deny with empirical evidence and are therefore outside the realm of neuroscience

	I wouldn't describe it as "debunked", but in my experience, dualism as a theory does not have much credibility and most neuroscientists are not dualists. However, the distinction between mind and brain is still very popular, and I think that makes sense. The concept of the mind seems useful, but I don't see how dualism was ever useful.

			Mind and brain can have different meanings but still not be separate. Like [u/thumbsquare](https://www.reddit.com/user/thumbsquare) mentioned, it's popular to describe the mind as the product of higher brain functions or the higher brain functions themselves, which is neither the same thing as a brain nor is it separate from the brain.

			* üü¶ **[ohnodingbat](https://www.reddit.com/user/ohnodingbat)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 1 _(2019-08-23 08:06:14)_

				My understanding, originating in [this](https://plato.stanford.ed[u/entries](https://www.reddit.com/user/entries)/dualism/ ,) was/is that in dualism the mind is what enables the notion of "self" (or soul in religious conceptions)... the dualism of perceiver and perceived is more central in eastern philosophies, as is the self as a construct but ... I lost my train of thought.. anyway, in this context, dualism arises from and rests in the splitting of brain and derivative product X, where X is the "mind" or "higher brain functions" or "intelligence" etc. We don't have to go as far as /[u/thumbsquare](https://www.reddit.com/user/thumbsquare) 's cockroach - which is a product of perception, in the same way as the body is a 3D model created in the brain - and perception is predicated on perceiver and perceived.... ao whichever route you take, you arrive at (or start from)  a brain/not-brain split .... not sure why you phrased it as "not entirely "debunked"", but that is fairly accurate even if you take out the "entirely" IMO; until someone squares the circle of brain/not-brain....dualism is alive and well? That (self-contained) perception-complex is also what makes possible Musk's question: "What's outside the simulation?". There's an infinite regression built into dualism...

					I didn't say  "not entirely "debunked"", I said I wouldn't describe dualism as debunked, and that's because it seems to be unfalsifiable. But like I said before, mind and brain can have different meanings and yet it can still not be separate from the brain. People who aren't dualists also describe the notion of "self" as being a part of the mind, that's not what makes someone a dualist. Thinking that the mind and brain are both distinct, valid terms does not imply that the mind can exist independent of a brain (i.e. that it is separate from a brain, as in dualism).

					* üü• **[ohnodingbat](https://www.reddit.com/user/ohnodingbat)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 1 _(2019-08-23 10:56:21)_

						Sorry, you said "I wouldn't describe it as "debunked"" - which I read and recollected as 'not entirely debunked'.

	It's not experimentally testable, so it isn't debunked. 

	> if the mind was non-physical, how can we see, say, a banana, when we visualise it in our heads? 

	There are huge fundamental disagreements about this within science.  Staunch physicalists wind up being forced to claim the problem is an illusion, whereas everyone else has lots of theories but no way to test them.

		I don't see why there's any disagreements with the whole imagining an image in our mind thing. 
		
		Everything we see is really an image being processed inside our brain. When you see a banana, the eye receives the light, the light is converted to an electrical signal which is sent to the brain, where the brain interprets the image. When we visualise the banana in our mind, the same neurons that interpreted the real experience fire again, but it's less clear due to the banana not actually being in front of you.

			What's unclear is why you have to live through it -- why you have experience at all.  Nothing about physics says we have to experience things.

				I suppose it's just because life at one point started, and when life starts, it doesn't want to stop, meaning it will evolve to adapt to whatever it can, thus why we are here, experiencing the world.

						I think Tononi's IIT would disagree with you, and say they just have a really low experience. Although he would say the same thing for a rock (albeit way smaller), so it's not an argument regarding life.

					You might want to be careful with that kind of sentences, cause life doesn't "want" things. Life just is, by definition, a system that reproduce thanks to a given code, with the said code that can be modify. By definition, once you start reproducing, the code that is the best to do that will overwhelm the others, hence evolution and adaptation. You only need to be locally better than others, that's all, and there is not the slightest proof it requires to develop consciousness.

					What they mean is that there are no currently known neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) and there probably never will be, because experience is a fundamentally different beast from our current understanding of physics and will probably have to be added in as a separate thing at some point if we really want to have a unified theory

* üü© **[Filostrato](https://www.reddit.com/user/Filostrato)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 15 _(2019-08-22 16:20:08)_

	Dualism hasn't been a meaningful notion for a long time, ever since Newton exorcised the machine rather than the ghost, as Chomsky humorously points out; there simply is no clear notion of "physical" other than what we have described and understand. All we have to work with is mind, and there is no matter as such at all, as was recognized by all the great physicists who developed the field of quantum physics in the early 20th century. Thus the universe is essentially idealistic, or mental if you will, not materialistic.

	Yes. It's incoherent and contradicts (or fails to predict) almost everything we know about the brain. But don't take my word for it...

	It never ceases to amaze me that all the richness of our mental life, all our feelings, our emotions, our thoughts, our ambitions, our love life, our religious sentiments, and even what each of us regards as our own intimate, private self, is simply the activity of these little specks of jelly in our head, our brain. There is nothing else. -*V.S. Ramacahndran*

	All mental processes, even the most complex psychological processes, derive from operations of the brain. *‚ÄìEric Kandel*

	Modern neuroscience has shown that there is no user. "The soul" is, in fact, the information-processing activity of the brain. New imaging techniques have tied every thought and emotion to neural activity. And any change to the brain‚Äîfrom strokes, drugs, electricity or surgery‚Äîwill literally change your mind.  *‚ÄìSteven Pinker*

	There's a scientific consensus that hard-core dualism, which says that people can think without using their brain or that memories will survive the death of your body, is just flat mistaken. Your mental life is a product of your brain. *‚ÄìPaul Bloom*

	There is something approaching a consensus among philosophers and cognitive scientists: no immaterial mind/soul makes any sense at all.  *‚ÄìDaniel Dennett*

	There is no reason, none, to think there could be such a thing. It is so conceptually puffed up that it‚Äôs incredible, incoherent. -*Owen Flanagan*

	That depends on how you conceive of ‚Äúdualism‚Äù and if you see it as a metaphysical ontology or merely an epistemic tool. 

	It‚Äôs still a useful concept in the same way a software/hardware division is useful. 

	It defines the basic difference between psychiatry and psychology. 

	It‚Äôs implied to a large degree when scientists talk about the ‚Äúneural correlates of consciousness.‚Äù

	In short, it allows us to study and create hypotheses around the qualia without regards to its neural substrates.

	Dualism and free will and the homunculus of control are all very unpopular in neuroscience circles when they get mentioned at conferences. The bigger debate is how organic chemistry gives rise to the experience of the mind without it being dualism since it is clearly happening but no one knows why. I've also met physical scientists who just deny the mind is worth studying and only the brain is worthy of scientific discussion

* üü© **[Involution88](https://www.reddit.com/user/Involution88)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 2 _(2019-08-22 21:28:45)_

	Dualism has not been debunked nor would it be any time soon, even though it is unpopular and frequently inappropriate.  

	1. Brain is not synonymous with mind. Mind (the things brains do) is more of a functional type term while brain (what brains, even dead ones) are is more of a natural kind type term.

	2. It is arguable and defensible that the mind has properties which the brain, in and of itself, may not have. Systemic properties may exist.

	3. It is arguable that a mind of a "real" person which is experiencing the "real world" and the mind of a simulated person which is experiencing a simulated world may be identical. (which is also an argument against dualism to some extent) Meatbags may be electrons wizzing around on a silicon circuit board.

	While there isn't really much evidence for dualism, it can't really be "debunked" in the same way you can't really prove that we're not living in a simulation. You can't prove that our actual "minds" are not actually outside this reality, while our brains merely mirror what those minds actually do. You can't prove that that's the case either, but to say that it's debunked is philosophical malpractice.

* üü© **[Shotanat](https://www.reddit.com/user/Shotanat)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 1 _(2019-08-23 03:01:07)_

	I was just like to argue in a couple of points :

	1) We can't see neurons (or group of them) with EEG, we have a far crappier spatial resolution, and that's quite important. You can only have access to sources of activity. And even if fMRI is way better regarding spatial precision, it's still not on a neuronal scale. On the opposite, things like Utah array can study neurons, but it's difficult to record the whole brain at the same time. Hence, the whole path from substrat to function is still unclear, and is not a proof of exclusion of dualism. 

	2) True, energy is conserved, but what if the action from the mind was energy free ? That's especially interesting if the effect of the mind is only in a "mind space" instead of a materialistic one. 

	3) For the banana, same thing as before in the mind space. Just because you have banana's neurons (or banana networks) that activate when there is one/you have to represent one doesn't mean you will experience the concept of a banana. One can argue the experience itself is in the mind space, operated by the mind. 

	That's the entire hard problem of consciousness, so I wouldn't say it's really over, but mostly that it transformed.

* üü© **[phoenixloop](https://www.reddit.com/user/phoenixloop)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 1 _(2019-08-23 11:24:54)_

	I think there's definitely a brain/body dualism in which the hard boundary between the two are fuzzy. I've started to come to this through things like the gut-brain axis, and the notion that there isn't a 1:1 innervation between neurons and bodily cells.  There's lots going on in the body that the brain either has to infer or is blind to, which can impact cognition and consciousness.

	That said, it does need to be pointed out that lots of terms in the dualism conversation are fuzzy -- any discussion needs to clearly delineate what mind, body, brain, etc are in operational instead of philosophical terms.

* üü© **[TheMushiMan](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheMushiMan)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 1 _(2019-08-25 12:55:18)_

	This really seems like a wanna-be atheist post. Advances in neuroscience have nothing to do with 'debunking' dualism. If anything, we have only discovered how complex the brain is and how less we know about the phenomenon of 'mind' at all.
