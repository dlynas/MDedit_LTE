	There's essentially a redefinition of "value" that happens in the early 20th century. Before that shift, it's primarily about differences in equilibrium prices between different commodities, why do normal cars cost more than normal shoes, that kind of thing. That's where the labor theory of value makes sense.

	After the shift, economists seem to use it to mean how different individual buyers rate appropriate prices, so one person might be willing to buy a pair of shoes for $200, while another night think they're only worth $75, because they *value* the shoes differently.

	As for why the shift happens, well, it's because of Marxism. Even if you ignore the ethical claims about who should get the surplus value from manufacturing commodities, Marxist theory makes a bunch of empirical claims about how capitalist economies function, and a lot of those are unpalatable if you're a fan of the capitalist system. 

	So you switch definitions so that the Marxist theory becomes incomprehensible: obviously people don't decide on whether to buy something by estimating labor costs, they buy things based on how much they want them and how high they're priced. It's extremely useful for making Marxist analysis seem silly, and it takes way more effort and time for a Marxist to explain what's going on, and everyone stops paying attention because it's complicated and boring.

	The ramifications of switching from a concrete measure to a vibes-based one are obvious, and the last 100+ years of economics has consisted of them making predictions that are completely wrong and just trucking along regardless, because its purpose is more for propaganda than for accurate prediction.

		I think Simon Clarke has a good book on showing the historical trajectory in which neoclassical economics wasn't strictly just an ideological move but it certainly had the function.

		"*It was the early marginalists‚Äô desire to shrink the field of economics to theories of consumer preferences in their relation to price that excluded all sorts of important questions from the new ‚Äúsciences‚Äù, questions that had previously been a part of political economy. Issues of social power, the molding of the individual by society, class, etc were excluded and taken up by the emerging field of sociology. Clarke‚Äôs book is about this process by which the unrealistic and obnoxious abstractions of marginalist thinkers bifurcated political economy into economics and sociology rendering both disciplines full of theoretical problems and lacking in the analytical tools to explain the real contradictions of capitalism.*
		
		*...*
		
		*Despite their similarities, marginalism‚Äôs subjective approach to value came as a response to some inadequacies in classical economics. In classical political economy prices were only theorized after a consideration of distribution. Once the contribution of land, labor and capital were analyzed independently price was just the adding of up of these sums. Thus we can only understand markets and prices through an understanding of class, leaving the way open for more radical interpretations of the theory that might question this distribution. (2)*
		
		*Marginalism responded by developing a theory of price that directly related price to the subjective valuations of individuals contemplating objects. All social phenomena were abstracted away. This narrowed scope achieved three things: 1. Class and distribution were spirited away, allowing marginalists to claim that such questions were outside the sphere of economics; 2. The obviously political nature of distribution could be reduced to purely technical explanations (marginal productivity, etc) thereby allowing marginalists to claim that they were engaged in pure, non-partisan theory; 3. It provided a naturalistic justification of capitalism.*
		
		*Clarke argues that the early founders of marginalism were not wholly ideologically motivated by the need to establish a new theory of capitalist apologetics, but that by the 1890‚Äôs the marginalist ‚Äòrevolution‚Äô had taken on a deep apologetic nature, playing a central role in the worker movements of the late 1800‚Äôs in debates between reformist and revolutionary factions. Also, this was a time of rapidly growing social movements for reform. Marginalists wanted to develop some science of economics that could measure the effects of state intervention on the economy. This brought together people of different political persuasions to the marginalist project.*"

		Additionally, it doesn't matter how much you "value" a good if you literally do not have the means to access it, no matter how vital it might be to your survival. Therefore, the way a capitalist conceptualizes "value" is irrational.

		* üüß **[AlchemistAnalyst](https://www.reddit.com/user/AlchemistAnalyst)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 1 _(2024-03-10 09:41:08)_

			It is plainly obvious that a supplier must exist for a good to be brought to the market. Similarly, there must exist someone who seeks to exchange for said good for it to be brought to market. 
			
			Both marginal utility and the LTV begin with these assumptions since there is no point in discussing the economy of commodities that can not be circulated. The difference is how they explain the ratios in which goods are exchanged. Your critique is not a sensible one.

			* üü¶ **[ComradeSasquatch](https://www.reddit.com/user/ComradeSasquatch)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 1 _(2024-03-11 15:29:35)_

				My critique is that what they call "value" is simply how much someone desires a good, not what human need it fulfills. Desire is not a rational metric to determine how to equitably distribute goods to people. It does, however, function rather well if the sellers are using emotionally manipulative marketing to generate artificial demand for a good. The more desire you can generate in the market, the more "value" your product has, but it's all just a scam.

				* üü™ **[AlchemistAnalyst](https://www.reddit.com/user/AlchemistAnalyst)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 1 _(2024-03-11 15:54:04)_

					> Desire is not a rational metric to determine how to equitably distribute goods to people.
					
					Of course it isn't. No one ever said it was. The theory of marginal utility is supposed to be *descriptive,* not prescriptive. It is supposed to explain why prices in a capitalist system are what they are. 
					
					I mean, you can teach an entire course on marginal utility theory without ever using the word "value" if you really wanted to. You just use consumer preference curves and derive the demand curve from them. At some level, this is a sensible thing to do. Consumers have some idea of product ratios. For example, I know that you'd have to give me at least two bottles of cheap dish soap before I give you my Dawn Platinum. 
					
					But orthodox economics takes this to the extreme and demands that *all* consumers have personal exchange ratios for *all* possible pairs of commodities, and that these ratios determine prices and not the other way around. This is clearly not the case, and of course when you create a theory centered on the idea of the infallibility of the consumer, you get the conclusion that one should not impede the consumer-supplier relation by government policy.
					
					There are several reasons to criticize orthodox economic theory, but a critique has to be coherent. You clearly don't know the first thing about economics and are just rattling off some lazy, one-sentence, pedestrian critique with no thought or understanding behind it. It makes us all look stuck in an echo chamber.

		I don't necessarily disagree with your assessment, but I also don't think it is entirely fair. Or perhaps, rather than "fair", we might say that our own biases and preferences--perhaps feelings of embattlement--are seeping into it.
		
		Another set of concerns that map alongside precisely what you're discussing (historically, I mean) are a shift away from structural analyses towards individualist ones. It is important to note that the labor theory of value that Marx develops is cribbed almost verbatim from Adam Smith. It is not a "Marxist concept", but an intrinsically "capitalist one". And intentionally so. When Marx develops the labor theory of value to critique capitalism he is "using the master's tools to dismantle the master's house", so to speak.
		
		However, around the early 20th century, other analysts in the social sciences, including the non-economic social sciences, were developing theories of value that were more individualist. It is important to note that there was a great deal of intermingling among the social sciences during this period, in part because disciplinary boundaries hadn't quite rigidified yet and in part because some of these disciplines were still only just emerging. Sociology, for example, was only just beginning to exist, and early sociologists were often trained as economists, or historians, or political scientists, etc. This is much the same as for Marx, whose work sits at the intersection of so many disciplines precisely because of his broadly liberal education in history, economics, philosophy, political science, and so on.
		
		In any case, we can look, for example, to Georg Simmel's theory of value for precisely the kind of discussion that the poster above provides. For Simmel, value does inhere in the object nor in the process of its creation, but rather is entirely contingent upon what any particular individual is willing to exchange in a given moment. That means the value of one's labor is contingent, just as the value of a commodity is contingent, just as the value of one's leisure time is contingent. These determinations are made and remade each new time that we come to make exchanges and it is at least points that we (re)affirm the value of some thing.
		
		This is, of course, vastly different from the labor theory of value for several reasons. We might attribute malintent holistically, certainly, but we might also look to the more likely and, indeed, problematic reason: an individualistic theory of socially-derived value is more coherent within a field of economics that is interested in market forces. Such a maneuver is also consistent with a Marxian approach to understanding the role that ideology plays vis-a-vis "base", and moreso if one is a fan of a Gramscian "hegemony" approach.
		
		We don't need mustache-twirling villains who are looking to make Marxian/Marxist analysis look silly, nor do we need to suggest that it is about distracting potential audiences from Marxian/Marxist analyses. Rather, it is part of a broader pattern of divergent analytic frameworks--one structural, one individualist--that have come to be prioritized in different arenas. Of course, the latter is suited to capitalism and allows people to play the role of "useful goon" at best and mustache-twirling villain at worst...

							Well basically the idea is that the more time someone spends on a good or service the more of their year it takes up and thus a larger portion of their yearly costs will have to be covered by the sale of the good. If you didn‚Äôt make enough to support yourself for a year from a year‚Äôs labor you‚Äôd stop doing that labor through choice or death.

	The practical reason is that the current economic tradition has its lineage in Jevons, Walras, Menger, and the marginalize revolution. Subjective value is the presupposition of just about every higher-order thought of neoclassical economics. They feel the need to investigate its validity as much as physicists feel the need to prove gravity exists: they‚Äôre so confident, they treat every heterodox view as pseudoscience.

	The more esoteric reason is that Marx‚Äôs political-economy is deeply historicist, and contemporary economics is not. You can‚Äôt read *Capital* as an economist, a historian, or a philosopher; you must read it as an economist, a historian, and a philosopher‚Äîthat‚Äôs not how modern academia works. Modern academia is sequestered, specific, and, most of all, pragmatic. Thus, the major critique of Marx‚Äôs economic theories always comes on the point of ‚Äúpredictability.‚Äù Marx was not Milton Friedman. His purpose was not to develop a mechanism by which we could predict with 95% ‚Äúaccuracy‚Äù a proportional range within which a country‚Äôs GDP would grow. His purpose was to understand present-day society dialectically, and in order to do that, you have to be willing to confront gravity.

	Adam Smith read every philosopher from Thales to his time. Today‚Äôs economists say, in full seriousness, that if it wasn‚Äôt written in the last 20 years, it must be outdated.

			But omit the relationship of the means of production being altered and the fact that profits will now leave the country. That the bulk of the profit is being extracted away from the local economy.
			
			But more importantly in the imperialist system, which we live in, the goods that are produced are also taken to the imperial countries. Therefore the workers get paid peanuts and the capitalist system extracts the material goods and profits. Therefore leaving the colonial country to misery it the name of profit.

Further, Pareto Optimum never interrogates what actually is "fair", how goods are made, and the relationship between price and viability of a market.

	LTF focuses on the relationship between capitalist and the worker from the perspective of the worker, not the capitalist. This is it's great crime. If you focus on the employment relationship from the perspective of the worker, Marx's critique is totally devastating to capitalism. If you center the capitalist's perspective, none of that makes sense, because it contradicts your first principle.

	Marx was proposing a radical reorientation of the entire field, and adding insult to injury, he built his system and got the LTV from the great theorists of capitalism, Smith, Ricardo, Bentham, etc.

	In other words, Marx deconstructed capitalism using it's own founders and from inside capitalism's own assumptions, and this was outrageous. It made his critique that much more powerful. Something had to be done, so the field of political economy (which included economics, sociology, political science) was reorganized so that economics was separated from the rest and complicated maths became the centerpiece and obsession of the field.

	Well first of all, mainstream economics is essentially mental gymnastics propagated to reinforce the current system. While there are truths, there are also assumptions and oversights that limit the predictive power of the field. As such, mainstream economics does not offer much predictive power on exchange value, especially on a macroeconomic scale. 

	Secondly, the LTV is used. A version of it is very prevalent in manufacturing and management in the form of Juran's theory on quality control. 

	This theory states that value comes from the ability of the product meet customer requirements, and that labour must be directed to provide this quality. This is essentially an expansion of Marx's statement that value comes from labour as long as labour is able to fulfill needs. Through this understanding, labour can be directed to maximize the value it produces.

	Well, mainstream economists are paid to legitimize the capitalist system. If you want to become an economics professor, being a Marxist is a problem, f. e. because of the gatekeepers in the scientific community.

	But there is also a scientific critique of "Das Kapital" and marxist value theory. If you want to educate yourself about this topic, "Money and Totality" (by Fred Moseley) or "Reclaiming Marx's Capital" (by Andrew Kliman) are good starting points.

	It is. They just don't call it that because of the change in terms others have mentioned. Look at any modern economic theory of how mass production costs work and you'll see the exact scenario Marx discusses play out.  Fixed cost trend to 0 and the costs of producing an item ( read, it's value) trend to the variable costs of labor and materials. The only stipulation you're missing is Marx is discussing items which are beneficial to society, thus the labor is socially neccessary.  

	It's the exact same semantics manipulation that economists use to argue that it's good actually for businesses to intentionally restrict how much they produce to keep prices up when Marx uses this fact as a criticism.

	because according to them its irrelevant "why" things have the value they have, its only relevant what people are willing to pay for them.  marx is trying to understand capitalism as an economic system in the whole; bourgeois economists are only trying to understand facets of capitalism, they are purposefully trying to avoid going deeper into the beast

	Mainstream economists were shown to be mistaken back in the 1960s by Piero Sraffa, Joan Robinson, and others in the Cambridge Capital Controversy. Mainstream economists have no explanation of returns to capital. They ignore this demonstration too.

	If they took it seriously, they would re-evaluate Marx and classical political economy. As I understand it, the ‚Äòleading‚Äô departments of economics in the USA do not teach the history of their subject.

	There's a lot too it but at the core is the systemic problems with the feild of academic economics. They (publishers of the big five journals) need to ignore it to justify their salaries, so it's broadly rejected to maintain the status quo.

		I actually watched that and there's at least three really major misunderstandings of Marx in it.
		
		-wages are not a measure of socially necessary labour time(32:00). socially necessary labour time would be measured with a stopwatch and a spreadsheet by observation of the production process
		
		-labour is not the only source of value (33:00). it's literally the second sentence of his third most influential work. "labour is not the source of all wealth. nature os surely as much a source of use values" *crit. of Gotha*
		
		-(43:00) it is specifically the divergence of the rate of profit in different industries driving the direction of investments that creates the tendency for equalisation of rates of profit (monopolies or natural scarcities excepting). there is no realignment necessary between a "money" rate of profit and a "value" rate of profit. in the general case Marx was specifically describing equilibriums
		
		I'm assuming that there are likely similar misunderstandings of the other economic theories he's dealing with in the video

	I think in a modern world of automation, it might be slightly outdated. I'll give an example.  

	   

	I 3d print little conversion clips to be able to fire 45ACP ammo out of anything chambered in 45LC or (in my case) 455 Webley. If I were to set up a conveyor belt print bed so they print practically infinitely without any human labor, does the only value they have come from the fact that I took the time to design them? Since I can print them infinitely and they are disposable+biodegradeable, if I were to get a few regular customers, does that make the value of my labor in designing them infinite?   

	The scarcity theory of value pushed by capitalists is obviously wrong. The diamond market proves that. They aren't scarce. I've been kicking around an idea I've been calling a Utility Theory of Value but it's a little half baked because there are so many different ways people view utility.  

	For example, natural diamonds are more expensive than artificial ones despite artificial ones being technically superior. Perhaps the reason for that is that some people find utility in being able to say "Oh this is a REAL" diamond". etc.

	Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but it relies on the idea that all (necessary) labor is of equal value and that‚Äôs difficult to reconcile with the reality that in the global economy under capitalism, the reality economists care about interpreting, some labor produces dramatically more value per hour than others. particularly where not easily replaceable skill is involved. Then there‚Äôs automation and technology which allows certain workers to produce more value with less labor than others if it isn‚Äôt shared throughout the industry, which most of the time it isn‚Äôt, either through lack of available capital or in the case where smaller scale operations usually use more rudimentary tech since expensive machines aren‚Äôt economical if you don‚Äôt/can‚Äôt use them enough. Big part of what makes economies of scale more efficient.

	In My last conversation about this someone said it only applies to commodities, which also doesn‚Äôt quite fit reality (Venezuelan oil takes more labor to produce than saudi Arabian despite having more of it, but it creates the same product of the same value with more labor) thus making supply and demand a more relevant and applicable metric for determining value.

			THIS IS ALWAYS THE CASE! ‚ÄúEasily dunked‚Äù is always a tip off that whoever is making the critique has not actually read Marx and is making absurd assumptions about what Marx ‚Äúneglected to consider‚Äù. Thanks for taking the time to go through and point out these flagrant misunderstandings.
