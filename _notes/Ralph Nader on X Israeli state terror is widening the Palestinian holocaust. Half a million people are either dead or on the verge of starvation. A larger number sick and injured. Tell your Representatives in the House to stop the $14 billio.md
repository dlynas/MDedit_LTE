Israeli state terror is widening the Palestinian holocaust. Half a million people are either dead or on the verge of starvation. A larger number sick and injured. Tell your Representatives in the House to stop the $14 billion genocide weapons bill to Israel. 202-224-3121. -R



The sheer gall of Congress, charging the American taxpayers another $14 billion for Netanyahu’s unexplained colossal multi-tiered border security collapse on October 7th. Taxpayers must say no to their Representatives or they’ll remember in November. -R

And you have nothing to say about the funding of Hamas

The 4th of March in Gaza.

So I understand you support Israel's effort (with US, Jordanians) to increase humanitarian airdrops into Gaza?

Quote



An airdrop operation successfully delivered 160 packages of food and medical supplies to residents of southern Gaza and to the Jordanian field hospital in Khan Yunis (Feb. 27). This collaborative effort involved Israel, the UAE, Jordan, Egypt, France, and the USA. #airdropaid

Wow, you are quite sick pathetic to lie like this.

All civilian deaths are tragic. Reporting stats from terrorists is harmful propaganda. Opening the Egyptian border is an easy and practical way to save lives.

and tell Elon Musk to stop shadow banned people who speak up against Israel.

Ralph, I thought you had a higher regard for the truth.

Old dinosaur. Your time has long since passed.
