Bearing witness: in an age of mounting horror, sociologists have a responsibility not only to analyse the social structures underpinning war, but also to share untold stories of those caught up in conflict around the world. Via writing on Gaza, Afghanistan, Kashmir, Armenia, Ukraine, Russia and the US, we focus on anti-war resistance, propaganda’s deadly role in oppression, women’s lives in wartime from conscription to displacement, the impact on workers of militarisation, nuclear power, and more.
