## It’s past midnight, and turnout of students and faculty has filled the entire plaza of Columbia University. Students are continuing to demand that Columbia disclose and divest from all its ties to Israel. An end to US complicity in the genocide of Gaza remains students’ focus, they insist, despite media attempts to divert attention to marginal issues like student safety or free speech.

In the past hour, students have begun dividing themselves into group formations to block NYPD movement into the liberation encampment zone. This remarkable show of people power from students has caused the university administration to postpone their midnight deadline to make a decision on “alternative options”  to clear out the encampment to 8:00 AM.

Students have said they will not be moved, even as the sound of helicopters is heard overhead. Stay tuned for updates.
