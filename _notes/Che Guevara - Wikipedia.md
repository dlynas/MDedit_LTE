As a young medical student, Guevara traveled throughout South America and was radicalized by the poverty, hunger, and disease he witnessed.<sup id="cite_ref-RevMedicine_5-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-RevMedicine-5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAnderson199790–91_6-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAnderson199790%E2%80%9391-6">[6]</a></sup> His burgeoning desire to help overturn what he saw as the capitalist exploitation of Latin America by the United States prompted his involvement in Guatemala's social reforms under President [Jacobo Árbenz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobo_%C3%81rbenz "Jacobo Árbenz"), whose eventual [CIA-assisted overthrow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Guatemalan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat "1954 Guatemalan coup d'état") at the behest of the [United Fruit Company](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Fruit_Company "United Fruit Company") solidified Guevara's political ideology.<sup id="cite_ref-RevMedicine_5-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-RevMedicine-5">[5]</a></sup> Later in Mexico City, Guevara met [Raúl](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra%C3%BAl_Castro "Raúl Castro") and [Fidel Castro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidel_Castro "Fidel Castro"), joined their [26th of July Movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/26th_of_July_Movement "26th of July Movement"), and sailed to Cuba aboard the yacht _[Granma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granma_(yacht) "Granma (yacht)")_ with the intention of overthrowing US-backed dictator [Fulgencio Batista](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulgencio_Batista "Fulgencio Batista").<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> Guevara soon rose to prominence among the [insurgents](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgent "Insurgent"), was promoted to second-in-command, and played a pivotal role in the two-year guerrilla campaign that deposed the Batista regime.<sup id="cite_ref-Castrosbrain1960_8-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-Castrosbrain1960-8">[8]</a></sup>

After the Cuban Revolution, Guevara played key roles in the new government.

His experiences and studying of [Marxism–Leninism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism "Marxism–Leninism") led him to posit that the [Third World](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_World "Third World")'s [underdevelopment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underdevelopment "Underdevelopment") and [dependence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_theory "Dependency theory") was an intrinsic result of [imperialism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism "Imperialism"), [neocolonialism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neocolonialism "Neocolonialism"), and [monopoly capitalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_monopoly_capitalism "State monopoly capitalism"), with the only remedies being [proletarian internationalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proletarian_internationalism "Proletarian internationalism") and [world revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_revolution "World revolution").<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-AfroAsian1965_13-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-AfroAsian1965-13">[13]</a></sup> Guevara left Cuba in 1965 to foment continental revolutions across both Africa and South America,<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> first unsuccessfully [in Congo-Kinshasa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simba_rebellion "Simba rebellion") and later [in Bolivia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivian_Campaign "Bolivian Campaign"), where he was captured by CIA-assisted Bolivian forces and [summarily executed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summarily_executed "Summarily executed").<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>

As a result of his perceived martyrdom, poetic invocations for [class struggle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_struggle "Class struggle"), and desire to create the consciousness of a "new man" driven by moral rather than material incentives,<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> Guevara has evolved into a quintessential icon of various [leftist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leftist "Leftist") movements. In contrast, his critics on the [political right](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_right "Political right") accuse him of promoting authoritarianism and endorsing violence against his political opponents. Despite disagreements on [his legacy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_of_Che_Guevara "Legacy of Che Guevara"), _[Time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine) "Time (magazine)")_ named him one of the [100 most influential people of the 20th century](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_100:_The_Most_Important_People_of_the_Century "Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century"),<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> while an [Alberto Korda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_Korda "Alberto Korda") photograph of him, titled _[Guerrillero Heroico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrillero_Heroico "Guerrillero Heroico")_, was cited by the [Maryland Institute College of Art](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_Institute_College_of_Art "Maryland Institute College of Art") as "the [most famous photograph](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_photographs_considered_the_most_important#1960s "List of photographs considered the most important") in the world".<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup>

In 1948, Guevara entered the [University of Buenos Aires](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Buenos_Aires "University of Buenos Aires") to study medicine. His "hunger to explore the world"<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAnderson199764_43-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAnderson199764-43">[43]</a></sup> led him to intersperse his collegiate pursuits with two long introspective journeys that fundamentally changed the way he viewed himself and the contemporary economic conditions in Latin America. The first expedition, in 1950, was a 4,500-kilometer (2,800 mi) solo trip through the rural provinces of [northern Argentina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_Northwest "Argentine Northwest") on a bicycle on which he had installed a small engine.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAnderson199759–64_44-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAnderson199759%E2%80%9364-44">[44]</a></sup> Guevara then spent six months working as a nurse at sea on Argentina's [merchant marine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_navy "Merchant navy") freighters and oil tankers.<sup id="cite_ref-45"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup> His second expedition, in 1951, was a nine-month, 8,000-kilometer (5,000 mi) continental motorcycle trek through part of South America. For the latter, he took a year off from his studies to embark with his friend, [Alberto Granado](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_Granado "Alberto Granado"), with the final goal of spending a few weeks volunteering at the San Pablo [leper colony](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leper_colony "Leper colony") in Peru, on the banks of the [Amazon River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_River "Amazon River").<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAnderson199783_46-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAnderson199783-46">[46]</a></sup>

By the end of the trip, he came to view Latin America not as a collection of separate nations, but as a single entity requiring a continent-wide liberation strategy. His conception of a borderless, united [Hispanic America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic_America "Hispanic America") sharing a common Latino heritage was a theme that recurred prominently during his later revolutionary activities. Upon returning to Argentina, he completed his studies and received his medical degree in June 1953.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAnderson199798_52-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAnderson199798-52">[52]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-53"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup>

Guevara later remarked that, through his travels in Latin America, he came in "close contact with poverty, hunger and disease" along with the "inability to treat a child because of lack of money" and "stupefaction provoked by the continual hunger and punishment" that leads a father to "accept the loss of a son as an unimportant accident". Guevara cited these experiences as convincing him that to "help these people", he needed to leave the realm of medicine and consider the political arena of [armed struggle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/War "War").<sup id="cite_ref-RevMedicine_5-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-RevMedicine-5">[5]</a></sup>

## Early political activity

### Activism in Guatemala

Ernesto Guevara spent just over nine months in Guatemala. On 7 July 1953, Guevara set out again, this time to Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Panama, [Costa Rica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica "Costa Rica"), [Nicaragua](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua "Nicaragua"), [Honduras](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honduras "Honduras"), and [El Salvador](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Salvador "El Salvador"). On 10 December 1953, before leaving for Guatemala, Guevara sent an update to his aunt Beatriz from [San José, Costa Rica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jos%C3%A9,_Costa_Rica "San José, Costa Rica"). In the letter Guevara speaks of traversing the dominion of the [United Fruit Company](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Fruit_Company "United Fruit Company"), a journey which convinced him that the company's capitalist system was disadvantageous to the average citizen.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAnderson1997126_54-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAnderson1997126-54">[54]</a></sup> He adopted an aggressive tone to frighten his more conservative relatives, and the letter ends with Guevara swearing on an image of the then-recently deceased [Joseph Stalin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin "Joseph Stalin"), not to rest until these "octopuses have been vanquished".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTETaibo199931_55-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTETaibo199931-55">[55]</a></sup> Later that month, Guevara arrived in Guatemala, where President [Jacobo Árbenz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobo_%C3%81rbenz "Jacobo Árbenz") headed a democratically elected government that, through [land reform](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_reform "Land reform") and other initiatives, was attempting to end the _[latifundia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latifundia "Latifundia")_ agricultural system. To accomplish this, President Árbenz had enacted a [major land reform program](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decree_900 "Decree 900"), where all uncultivated portions of large land holdings were to be [appropriated](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalization "Nationalization") and redistributed to landless peasants. The largest land owner, and the one most affected by the reforms, was the United Fruit Company, from which the Árbenz government had already taken more than 225,000 acres (91,000 ha) of uncultivated land.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKellner198931_56-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellner198931-56">[56]</a></sup> Pleased with the direction in which the nation was heading, Guevara decided to make his home in Guatemala to "perfect himself and accomplish whatever may be necessary in order to become a true revolutionary."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKellner198931_56-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellner198931-56">[56]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGuevara_Lynch200026_57-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGuevara_Lynch200026-57">[57]</a></sup>

In [Guatemala City](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala_City "Guatemala City"), Guevara sought out [Hilda Gadea Acosta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilda_Gadea "Hilda Gadea"), a Peruvian economist who was politically well-connected as a member of the left-leaning, [Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana (APRA)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Popular_Revolutionary_Alliance "American Popular Revolutionary Alliance"). She introduced Guevara to a number of high-level officials in the [Árbenz government](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobo_Arbenz_Guzm%C3%A1n#Presidency "Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán"). Guevara then established contact with a group of Cuban exiles linked to [Fidel Castro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidel_Castro "Fidel Castro") through the 26 July 1953 [attack on the Moncada Barracks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_the_Moncada_Barracks "Attack on the Moncada Barracks") in [Santiago de Cuba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_de_Cuba "Santiago de Cuba").

In May 1954, a ship carrying infantry and light artillery weapons was dispatched by communist [Czechoslovakia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovak_Socialist_Republic "Czechoslovak Socialist Republic") for the Árbenz government and arrived in [Puerto Barrios](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Barrios "Puerto Barrios").<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEImmerman1982155–160_62-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEImmerman1982155%E2%80%93160-62">[62]</a></sup> As a result, the United States government—which since 1953 had been tasked by [President Eisenhower](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower "Dwight D.

Guevara was eager to fight on behalf of Árbenz, and joined an armed [militia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia "Militia") organized by the communist youth for that purpose. However, frustrated with that group's inaction, Guevara soon returned to medical duties. Following the coup, he again volunteered to fight, but soon after, Árbenz took refuge in the Mexican embassy and told his foreign supporters to leave the country.

The overthrow of the Árbenz regime and establishment of the right-wing Armas dictatorship cemented Guevara's view of the United States as an [imperialist power](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_imperialism "American imperialism") that opposed and attempted to destroy any government that sought to redress the socioeconomic inequality endemic to Latin America and other developing countries.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKellner198931_56-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellner198931-56">[56]</a></sup> In speaking about the coup, Guevara stated:

Guevara with his first wife [Hilda Gadea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilda_Gadea "Hilda Gadea") at [Chichen Itza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chichen_Itza "Chichen Itza") during their honeymoon trip

Guevara arrived in Mexico City on 21 September 1954, and worked in the allergy section of the [General Hospital](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Hospital_of_Mexico "General Hospital of Mexico") and at the Hospital Infantil de Mexico.<sup id="cite_ref-73"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-73">[73]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-74"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-74">[74]</a></sup> In addition he gave lectures on medicine at the [Faculty of Medicine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNAM_Faculty_of_Medicine "UNAM Faculty of Medicine") in the [National Autonomous University of Mexico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Autonomous_University_of_Mexico "National Autonomous University of Mexico") and worked as a news photographer for _[Latina News Agency](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prensa_Latina "Prensa Latina")_.<sup id="cite_ref-75"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-75">[75]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKellner198933_76-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellner198933-76">[76]</a></sup> His first wife Hilda notes in her memoir _My Life with Che_, that for a while, Guevara considered going to work as a doctor in Africa and that he continued to be deeply troubled by the poverty around him.<sup id="cite_ref-RebelWife_77-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-RebelWife-77">[77]</a></sup> In one instance, Hilda describes Guevara's obsession with an elderly washerwoman whom he was treating, remarking that he saw her as "representative of the most forgotten and exploited class". Hilda later found a poem that Che had dedicated to the old woman, containing "a promise to fight for a better world, for a better life for all the poor and exploited".<sup id="cite_ref-RebelWife_77-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-RebelWife-77">[77]</a></sup>

During this time he renewed his friendship with Ñico López and the other Cuban exiles whom he had met in Guatemala. In June 1955, López introduced him to [Raúl Castro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra%C3%BAl_Castro "Raúl Castro"), who subsequently introduced him to his older brother, [Fidel Castro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidel_Castro "Fidel Castro"), the revolutionary leader who had formed the [26th of July Movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/26th_of_July_Movement "26th of July Movement") and was now plotting to overthrow the dictatorship of [Fulgencio Batista](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulgencio_Batista "Fulgencio Batista"). During a long conversation with Fidel on the night of their first meeting, Guevara concluded that the Cuban's cause was the one for which he had been searching and before daybreak he had signed up as a member of 26 July Movement.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTETaibo199955_78-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTETaibo199955-78">[78]</a></sup> Despite their "contrasting personalities", from this point on Che and Fidel began to foster what dual biographer Simon Reid-Henry deemed a "revolutionary friendship that would change the world", as a result of their coinciding commitment to [anti-imperialism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-imperialism "Anti-imperialism").<sup id="cite_ref-79"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-79">[79]</a></sup>

By this point in Guevara's life, he deemed that US-controlled [conglomerates](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company) "Conglomerate (company)") installed and supported repressive regimes around the world. In this vein, he considered Batista a "[U.S. puppet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppet_state "Puppet state") whose strings needed cutting".<sup id="cite_ref-80"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-80">[80]</a></sup> Although he planned to be the group's [combat medic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_medic "Combat medic"), Guevara participated in the military training with the members of the Movement. The key portion of training involved learning hit and run tactics of [guerrilla warfare](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare "Guerrilla warfare"). Guevara and the others underwent arduous 15-hour marches over mountains, across rivers, and through the dense undergrowth, learning and perfecting the procedures of ambush and quick retreat. From the start Guevara was instructor [Alberto Bayo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_Bayo "Alberto Bayo")'s "prize student" among those in training, scoring the highest on all of the tests given.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKellner198937_81-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellner198937-81">[81]</a></sup> At the end of the course, he was called "the best guerrilla of them all" by General Bayo.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAnderson1997194_82-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAnderson1997194-82">[82]</a></sup>

Guevara then married Hilda in Mexico in September 1955, before embarking on his plan to assist in the liberation of Cuba.<sup id="cite_ref-Memoira_83-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-Memoira-83">[83]</a></sup>

## Cuban Revolution

### Granma invasion

The first step in Castro's revolutionary plan was an assault on Cuba from Mexico via the _[Granma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granma_(yacht) "Granma (yacht)"),_ an old, leaky [cabin cruiser](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabin_cruiser "Cabin cruiser"). They set out for Cuba on 25 November 1956. Attacked by Batista's military soon after landing, many of the 82 men were either killed in the attack or executed upon capture; only 22 found each other afterwards.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAnderson1997213_84-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAnderson1997213-84">[84]</a></sup> During this initial bloody confrontation Guevara laid down his medical supplies and picked up a box of ammunition dropped by a fleeing comrade, proving to be a symbolic moment in Che's life.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAnderson1997211_85-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAnderson1997211-85">[85]</a></sup>

Only a small band of revolutionaries survived to re-group as a bedraggled fighting force deep in the [Sierra Maestra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Maestra "Sierra Maestra") mountains, where they received support from the [urban guerrilla](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_guerrilla_warfare "Urban guerrilla warfare") network of [Frank País](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Pa%C3%ADs "Frank País"), 26 July Movement, and local campesinos. With the group withdrawn to the Sierra, the world wondered whether Castro was alive or dead until early 1957 when an interview by [Herbert Matthews](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Matthews "Herbert Matthews") appeared in _[The New York Times](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")_. The article presented a lasting, almost mythical image for Castro and the guerrillas. Guevara was not present for the interview, but in the coming months he began to realize the importance of the media in their struggle. Meanwhile, as supplies and morale diminished, and with an allergy to mosquito bites which resulted in agonizing walnut-sized [cysts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysts "Cysts") on his body,<sup id="cite_ref-86"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-86">[86]</a></sup> Guevara considered these "the most painful days of the war".<sup id="cite_ref-87"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-87">[87]</a></sup>

During Guevara's time living hidden among the poor [subsistence farmers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsistence_agriculture "Subsistence agriculture") of the Sierra Maestra mountains, he discovered that there were no schools, no electricity, minimal access to healthcare, and more than 40 percent of the adults were [illiterate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy "Literacy").<sup id="cite_ref-LiteracyC_88-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-LiteracyC-88">[88]</a></sup> As the war continued, Guevara became an integral part of the rebel army and "convinced Castro with competence, diplomacy and patience".<sup id="cite_ref-Castrosbrain1960_8-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-Castrosbrain1960-8">[8]</a></sup> Guevara set up factories to make grenades, built ovens to bake bread, and organized schools to teach illiterate campesinos to read and write.<sup id="cite_ref-Castrosbrain1960_8-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-Castrosbrain1960-8">[8]</a></sup> Moreover, Guevara established health clinics, workshops to teach military tactics, and a newspaper to disseminate information.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKellner198945_89-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellner198945-89">[89]</a></sup> The man whom _[Time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine) "Time (magazine)")_ dubbed three years later "Castro's brain" at this point was promoted by [Fidel Castro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidel_Castro "Fidel Castro") to _Comandante_ (commander) of a second army column.<sup id="cite_ref-Castrosbrain1960_8-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-Castrosbrain1960-8">[8]</a></sup>

### Role as commander

As second-in-command, Guevara was a harsh disciplinarian who sometimes shot defectors. Deserters were punished as traitors, and Guevara was known to send squads to track those seeking to abandon their duties.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAnderson1997269–270_90-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAnderson1997269%E2%80%93270-90">[90]</a></sup> As a result, Guevara became feared for his brutality and ruthlessness.<sup id="cite_ref-91"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-91">[91]</a></sup> During the guerrilla campaign, Guevara was also responsible for the [summary executions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summary_execution "Summary execution") of a number of men accused of being [informers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant "Informant"), [deserters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desertion "Desertion"), or [spies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage "Espionage").<sup id="cite_ref-execution-squads_92-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-execution-squads-92">[92]</a></sup> In his diaries, Guevara described the first such execution, of Eutimio Guerra, a peasant who had acted as a guide for the Castrist guerrillas, but admitted treason when it was discovered he accepted the promise of ten thousand pesos for repeatedly giving away the rebels' position for attack by the Cuban air force.<sup id="cite_ref-Lutherpg97-99_93-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-Lutherpg97-99-93">[93]</a></sup> Such information also allowed Batista's army to burn the homes of peasants sympathetic to the revolution.<sup id="cite_ref-Lutherpg97-99_93-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-Lutherpg97-99-93">[93]</a></sup> Upon Guerra's request that they "end his life quickly",<sup id="cite_ref-Lutherpg97-99_93-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-Lutherpg97-99-93">[93]</a></sup> Che stepped forward and shot him in the head, writing "The situation was uncomfortable for the people and for Eutimio so I ended the problem giving him a shot with a .32 pistol in the right side of the brain, with exit orifice in the right temporal \[lobe\]."<sup id="cite_ref-Andersonpg237_94-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-Andersonpg237-94">[94]</a></sup> His scientific notations and matter-of-fact description, suggested to one biographer a "remarkable detachment to violence" by that point in the war.<sup id="cite_ref-Andersonpg237_94-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-Andersonpg237-94">[94]</a></sup> Later, Guevara published a literary account of the incident, titled "Death of a Traitor", where he transfigured Eutimio's betrayal and pre-execution request that the revolution "take care of his children", into a "revolutionary [parable](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable "Parable") about redemption through sacrifice".<sup id="cite_ref-Andersonpg237_94-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-Andersonpg237-94">[94]</a></sup>

Although he maintained a demanding and harsh disposition, Guevara also viewed his role of commander as one of a teacher, entertaining his men during breaks between engagements with readings from the likes of [Robert Louis Stevenson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Louis_Stevenson "Robert Louis Stevenson"), [Miguel de Cervantes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_de_Cervantes "Miguel de Cervantes"), and Spanish [lyric poets](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyric_poetry "Lyric poetry").<sup id="cite_ref-95"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-95">[95]</a></sup> Together with this role, and inspired by [José Martí](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mart%C3%AD "José Martí")'s principle of "literacy without borders", Guevara further ensured that his rebel fighters made daily time to teach the uneducated campesinos with whom they lived and fought to read and write, in what Guevara termed the "battle against ignorance".<sup id="cite_ref-LiteracyC_88-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-LiteracyC-88">[88]</a></sup> Tomás Alba, who fought under Guevara's command, later stated that "Che was loved, in spite of being stern and demanding. We would (have) given our life for him."<sup id="cite_ref-96"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-96">[96]</a></sup>

His commanding officer, [Fidel Castro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidel_Castro "Fidel Castro"), described Guevara as intelligent, daring, and an exemplary leader who "had great moral authority over his troops".<sup id="cite_ref-97"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-97">[97]</a></sup> Castro further remarked that Guevara took too many risks, even having a "tendency toward foolhardiness".<sup id="cite_ref-98"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-98">[98]</a></sup> Guevara's teenage lieutenant, Joel Iglesias, recounts such actions in his diary, noting that Guevara's behavior in combat even brought admiration from the enemy. On one occasion Iglesias recounts the time he had been wounded in battle, stating "Che ran out to me, defying the bullets, threw me over his shoulder, and got me out of there. The guards didn't dare fire at him ... later they told me he made a great impression on them when they saw him run out with his pistol stuck in his belt, ignoring the danger, they didn't dare shoot."<sup id="cite_ref-99"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-99">[99]</a></sup>

Guevara was instrumental in creating the [clandestine radio station](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_radio "Pirate radio") _[Radio Rebelde](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Rebelde "Radio Rebelde")_ (Rebel Radio) in February 1958, which broadcast news to the Cuban people with statements by 26 July movement, and provided [radiotelephone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiotelephone "Radiotelephone") communication between the growing number of rebel columns across the island. Guevara had apparently been inspired to create the station by observing the effectiveness of [CIA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency "Central Intelligence Agency") supplied radio in Guatemala in ousting the government of [Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobo_%C3%81rbenz_Guzm%C3%A1n "Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán").<sup id="cite_ref-radio_100-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-radio-100">[100]</a></sup>

To quell the rebellion, Cuban government troops began executing rebel prisoners on the spot, and regularly rounded up, tortured, and shot civilians as a tactic of intimidation.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKellner19894_101-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellner19894-101">[101]</a></sup> By March 1958, the continued atrocities carried out by Batista's forces led the United States to stop selling arms to the Cuban government.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKellner198945_89-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellner198945-89">[89]</a></sup> Then in late July 1958, Guevara played a critical role in the [Battle of Las Mercedes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Las_Mercedes "Battle of Las Mercedes") by using his column to halt a force of 1,500 men called up by Batista's General Cantillo in a plan to encircle and destroy Castro's forces. Years later, [Major](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_(United_States) "Major (United States)") Larry Bockman of the [United States Marine Corps](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps "United States Marine Corps") analyzed and described Che's tactical appreciation of this battle as "brilliant".<sup id="cite_ref-102"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-102">[102]</a></sup> During this time Guevara also became an "expert" at leading hit-and-run tactics against Batista's army, and then fading back into the countryside before the army could counterattack.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKellner198940_103-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellner198940-103">[103]</a></sup>

### Final offensive

 [](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Che_SClara.jpg)

After the [Battle of Santa Clara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Santa_Clara "Battle of Santa Clara"), 1 January 1959

As the war extended, Guevara led a new column of fighters dispatched westward for the final push towards [Havana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havana "Havana"). Travelling by foot, Guevara embarked on a difficult 7-week march, only travelling at night to avoid an ambush and often not eating for several days.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKellner198947_104-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellner198947-104">[104]</a></sup> In the closing days of December 1958, Guevara's task was to cut the island in half by taking [Las Villas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Villas_(Cuba) "Las Villas (Cuba)") province. In a matter of days he executed a series of "brilliant tactical victories" that gave him control of all but the province's capital city of [Santa Clara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara,_Cuba "Santa Clara, Cuba").<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKellner198947_104-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellner198947-104">[104]</a></sup> Guevara then directed his "suicide squad" in the [attack on Santa Clara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Santa_Clara "Battle of Santa Clara"), which became the final decisive military victory of the revolution.<sup id="cite_ref-105"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-105">[105]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-106"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-106">[106]</a></sup> In the six weeks leading up to the battle, there were times when his men were completely surrounded, outgunned, and overrun. Che's eventual victory despite being outnumbered 10:1 remains in the view of some observers a "remarkable tour de force in modern warfare".<sup id="cite_ref-107"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-107">[107]</a></sup>

Radio Rebelde broadcast the first reports that Guevara's column had [taken Santa Clara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Santa_Clara "Battle of Santa Clara") on New Year's Eve 1958. This contradicted reports by the heavily controlled national news media, which had at one stage reported Guevara's death during the fighting. At 3 am on 1 January 1959, upon learning that his generals were negotiating a separate peace with Guevara, [Fulgencio Batista](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulgencio_Batista "Fulgencio Batista") boarded a plane in Havana and fled for the [Dominican Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Republic "Dominican Republic"), along with an amassed "fortune of more than $300,000,000 through graft and payoffs".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKellner198948_108-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellner198948-108">[108]</a></sup> The following day on 2 January, Guevara entered [Havana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havana "Havana") to take final control of the capital.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKellner198913_109-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellner198913-109">[109]</a></sup> Fidel Castro took six more days to arrive, as he stopped to rally support in several large cities on his way to rolling victoriously into Havana on 8 January 1959. The final death toll from the two years of revolutionary fighting was 2,000 people.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKellner198951_110-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellner198951-110">[110]</a></sup>

### Revolutionary tribunals

In mid-January 1959, Guevara went to live at a summer villa in [Tarará](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarar%C3%A1 "Tarará") to recover from a violent asthma attack.<sup id="cite_ref-111"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-111">[111]</a></sup> While there he started the Tarará Group, a group that debated and formed the new plans for Cuba's social, political, and economic development.<sup id="cite_ref-Castañeda,_p._146_112-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-Casta%C3%B1eda,_p._146-112">[112]</a></sup> In addition, Che began to write his book _[Guerrilla Warfare](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_Warfare_(book) "Guerrilla Warfare (book)")_ while resting at Tarara.<sup id="cite_ref-Castañeda,_p._146_112-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-Casta%C3%B1eda,_p._146-112">[112]</a></sup> In February, the revolutionary government proclaimed Guevara "a Cuban citizen by birth" in recognition of his role in the triumph.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAnderson1997397_113-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAnderson1997397-113">[113]</a></sup> When [Hilda Gadea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilda_Gadea "Hilda Gadea") arrived in Cuba in late January, Guevara told her that he was involved with another woman, and the two agreed on a divorce,<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAnderson1997400–401_114-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAnderson1997400%E2%80%93401-114">[114]</a></sup> which was finalized on 22 May.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAnderson1997424_115-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAnderson1997424-115">[115]</a></sup>

The first major political crisis arose over what to do with the captured Batista officials who had perpetrated the worst of the repression.<sup id="cite_ref-Skidmore273_116-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-Skidmore273-116">[116]</a></sup> During the rebellion against Batista's dictatorship, the general command of the rebel army, led by Fidel Castro, introduced into the territories under its control the 19th-century penal law commonly known as the _Ley de la Sierra_ (Law of the Sierra).<sup id="cite_ref-117"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-117">[117]</a></sup> This law included the death penalty for serious crimes, whether perpetrated by the Batista regime or by supporters of the revolution. In 1959, the revolutionary government extended its application to the whole of the republic and to those it considered war criminals, captured and tried after the revolution. According to the [Cuban Ministry of Justice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Justice_(Cuba) "Ministry of Justice (Cuba)"), this latter extension was supported by the majority of the population, and followed the same procedure as those in the [Nuremberg trials](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_trials "Nuremberg trials") held by the [Allies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II "Allies of World War II") after World War II.<sup id="cite_ref-118"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-118">[118]</a></sup>

Those persons executed by Guevara or on his orders were condemned for the usual crimes punishable by death at times of war or in its aftermath: desertion, treason or crimes such as rape, torture or murder.

Along with ensuring "revolutionary justice", the other key early platform of Guevara was establishing agrarian [land reform](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_reform "Land reform"). Almost immediately after the success of the revolution, on 27 January 1959, Guevara made one of his most significant speeches where he talked about "the social ideas of the rebel army".

The two men quickly bonded, as Sukarno was attracted to Guevara's energy and his relaxed informal approach; moreover they shared revolutionary [leftist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics "Left-wing politics") aspirations against Western [imperialism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism "Imperialism").<sup id="cite_ref-Merdeka_143-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-Merdeka-143">[143]</a></sup> Guevara next spent 12 days in Japan (15–27 July), participating in negotiations aimed at expanding Cuba's trade relations with that country. During the visit he refused to visit and lay a wreath at Japan's [Tomb of the Unknown Soldier](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_the_Unknown_Soldier "Tomb of the Unknown Soldier") commemorating soldiers lost during [World War II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), remarking that the Japanese "imperialists" had "killed millions of Asians".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAnderson1997431_144-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAnderson1997431-144">[144]</a></sup> Instead, Guevara stated that he would visit [Hiroshima](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima "Hiroshima"), where the American military had [detonated](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki") an [atomic bomb](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Boy "Little Boy") 14 years earlier.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAnderson1997431_144-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAnderson1997431-144">[144]</a></sup> Despite his denunciation of [Imperial Japan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Japan "Empire of Japan"), Guevara considered [President Truman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_S._Truman "Harry S.

Upon Guevara's return to Cuba in September 1959, it became evident that Castro now had more political power. The government had begun land seizures in accordance with the agrarian reform law, but was hedging on compensation offers to landowners, instead offering low-interest "bonds", a step which put the United States on alert. At this point the affected wealthy cattlemen of [Camagüey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camag%C3%BCey "Camagüey") mounted a campaign against the land redistributions and enlisted the newly disaffected rebel leader [Huber Matos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huber_Matos "Huber Matos"), who along with the [anti-communist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-communism "Anti-communism") wing of the 26 July Movement, joined them in denouncing "communist encroachment".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAnderson1997435_147-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAnderson1997435-147">[147]</a></sup> During this time Dominican dictator [Rafael Trujillo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Trujillo "Rafael Trujillo") was offering assistance to the "[Anti-Communist Legion of the Caribbean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Communist_Legion_of_the_Caribbean "Anti-Communist Legion of the Caribbean")" which was training in the Dominican Republic. This multi-national force, composed mostly of Spaniards and Cubans, but also of Croatians, Germans, Greeks, and right-wing mercenaries, was plotting to topple Castro's new regime.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAnderson1997435_147-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAnderson1997435-147">[147]</a></sup>

At this stage, Guevara acquired the additional position of Minister of Finance, as well as President of the [National Bank](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bank_of_Cuba "Central Bank of Cuba").<sup id="cite_ref-148"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-148">[148]</a></sup> These appointments, combined with his existing position as Minister of Industries, placed Guevara at the zenith of his power, as the "virtual czar" of the Cuban economy.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKellner198955_149-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellner198955-149">[149]</a></sup> As a consequence of his position at the head of the central bank, it became Guevara's duty to sign the Cuban currency, which per custom bore his signature. Instead of using his full name, he signed the bills solely "_Che_".<sup id="cite_ref-Crompton2009_150-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-Crompton2009-150">[150]</a></sup> It was through this symbolic act, which horrified many in the Cuban financial sector, that Guevara signaled his distaste for money and the class distinctions it brought about.<sup id="cite_ref-Crompton2009_150-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-Crompton2009-150">[150]</a></sup> Guevara's long time friend Ricardo Rojo later remarked that "the day he signed _Che_ on the bills, (he) literally knocked the props from under the widespread belief that money was sacred."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKellner198960_151-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellner198960-151">[151]</a></sup>

International threats were heightened when, on 4 March 1960, two massive explosions ripped through the French freighter _[La Coubre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Coubre_explosion "La Coubre explosion")_, which was carrying [Belgian munitions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FN_FAL "FN FAL") from the port of [Antwerp](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antwerp "Antwerp"), and was docked in [Havana Harbor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havana_Harbor "Havana Harbor"). The blasts killed at least 76 people and injured several hundred, with Guevara personally providing first aid to some of the victims. Fidel Castro immediately accused the CIA of "an act of terrorism" and held a state funeral the following day for the victims of the blast.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTECasey200925_152-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTECasey200925-152">[152]</a></sup> At the memorial service [Alberto Korda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_Korda "Alberto Korda") took the famous photograph of Guevara, now known as _[Guerrillero Heroico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara_(photo) "Che Guevara (photo)")_.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTECasey200925–50_153-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTECasey200925%E2%80%9350-153">[153]</a></sup>

Perceived threats prompted Castro to eliminate more "[counter-revolutionaries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-revolutionary "Counter-revolutionary")" and to utilize Guevara to drastically increase the speed of [land reform](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_reform "Land reform"). To implement this plan, a new government agency, the [National Institute of Agrarian Reform](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instituto_Nacional_de_Reforma_Agraria "Instituto Nacional de Reforma Agraria") (INRA), was established by the Cuban government to administer the new agrarian reform law. INRA quickly became the most important governing body in the nation, with Guevara serving as its head in his capacity as minister of industries.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKellner198958_137-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellner198958-137">[137]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability"><span title="Quotation needed from source to verify.

Along with land reform, Guevara stressed the need for national improvement in [literacy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy "Literacy"). Before 1959 the official literacy rate for Cuba was between 60 and 76%, with educational access in rural areas and a lack of instructors the main determining factors.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKellner198961_155-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellner198961-155">[155]</a></sup> As a result, the Cuban government at Guevara's behest dubbed 1961 the "year of education" and mobilized over 100,000 volunteers into "literacy brigades", who were then sent out into the countryside to construct schools, train new educators, and teach the predominantly illiterate _guajiros_ (peasants) to read and write.<sup id="cite_ref-LiteracyC_88-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-LiteracyC-88">[88]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKellner198961_155-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellner198961-155">[155]</a></sup> Unlike many of Guevara's later economic initiatives, this campaign was "a remarkable success". By the completion of the [Cuban literacy campaign](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_literacy_campaign "Cuban literacy campaign"), 707,212 adults had been taught to read and write, raising the national literacy rate to 96%.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKellner198961_155-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellner198961-155">[155]</a></sup>

Accompanying literacy, Guevara was also concerned with establishing universal access to higher education. To accomplish this the new regime introduced [affirmative action](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_action "Affirmative action") to the universities. While announcing this new commitment, Guevara told the gathered faculty and students at the [University of Las Villas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_%22Marta_Abreu%22_of_Las_Villas "University "Marta Abreu" of Las Villas") that the days when education was "a privilege of the white middle class" had ended. "The University" he said, "must paint itself black, mulatto, worker, and peasant." If it did not, he warned, the people were going to break down its doors "and paint the University the colors they like."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAnderson1997449_156-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAnderson1997449-156">[156]</a></sup>

### Economic reforms and the "New Man"

In September 1960, when Guevara was asked about Cuba's ideology at the First Latin American Congress, he replied, "If I were asked whether our revolution is Communist, I would define it as [Marxist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism "Marxism").

In defending his political stance, Guevara confidently remarked, "There are truths so evident, so much a part of people's knowledge, that it is now useless to discuss them.

> The merit of Marx is that he suddenly produces a qualitative change in the history of social thought. He interprets history, understands its dynamic, predicts the future, but in addition to predicting it (which would satisfy his scientific obligation), he expresses a revolutionary concept: the world must not only be interpreted, it must be transformed. Man ceases to be the slave and tool of his environment and converts himself into the architect of his own destiny.

In an effort to eliminate [social inequalities](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_inequality "Social inequality"), Guevara and Cuba's new leadership had moved to swiftly transform the political and economic base of the country through [nationalizing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalization "Nationalization") factories, banks, and businesses, while attempting to ensure affordable housing, healthcare, and employment for all Cubans.<sup id="cite_ref-Hansing4142_161-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-Hansing4142-161">[161]</a></sup> In order for a genuine transformation of consciousness to take root, it was believed that such structural changes had to be accompanied by a conversion in people's [social relations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation "Social relation") and [values](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(ethics_and_social_sciences)#Value_system "Value (ethics and social sciences)").

He negatively viewed capitalism as a "contest among wolves" where "one can only win at the cost of others" and thus desired to see the creation of a "new man and woman".<sup id="cite_ref-SocialismAndMan_162-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-SocialismAndMan-162">[162]</a></sup> Guevara continually stressed that a socialist economy in itself is not "worth the effort, sacrifice, and risks of war and destruction" if it ends up encouraging "greed and individual ambition at the expense of [collective spirit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_organization#Collectivism_and_individualism "Social organization")".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKellner198962_163-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellner198962-163">[163]</a></sup> A primary goal of Guevara's thus became to reform "individual consciousness" and values to produce better workers and citizens.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKellner198962_163-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellner198962-163">[163]</a></sup> In his view, Cuba's "new man" would be able to overcome the "[egotism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egotism "Egotism")" and "[selfishness](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfishness "Selfishness")" that he loathed and discerned was uniquely characteristic of individuals in capitalist societies.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKellner198962_163-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellner198962-163">[163]</a></sup> To promote this concept of a "new man", the government also created a series of party-dominated institutions and mechanisms on all levels of society, which included organizations such as [labor groups](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_movement "Labour movement"), [youth leagues](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Communist_League_(Cuba) "Young Communist League (Cuba)"), [women's groups](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_of_Cuban_Women "Federation of Cuban Women"), [community centers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_centre "Community centre"), and [houses of culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Culture "Palace of Culture") to promote state-sponsored art, music, and literature. In congruence with this, all educational, mass media, and artistic community based facilities were nationalized and utilized to instill the government's official [socialist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_mode_of_production "Socialist mode of production") ideology.<sup id="cite_ref-Hansing4142_161-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-Hansing4142-161">[161]</a></sup> In describing this new method of "development", Guevara stated:

> There is a great difference between free-enterprise development and revolutionary development. In one of them, wealth is concentrated in the hands of a fortunate few, the friends of the government, the best wheeler-dealers. In the other, wealth is the people's patrimony.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKellner198959_164-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellner198959-164">[164]</a></sup>

A further integral part of fostering a sense of "unity between the individual and the mass", Guevara believed, was volunteer work and will. To display this, Guevara "led by example", working "endlessly at his ministry job, in construction, and even cutting sugar cane" on his day off.<sup id="cite_ref-165"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-165">[165]</a></sup> He was known for working 36 hours at a stretch, calling meetings after midnight, and eating on the run.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKellner198962_163-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellner198962-163">[163]</a></sup> Such behavior was emblematic of Guevara's new program of moral incentives, where each worker was now required to meet a quota and produce a certain quantity of goods. As a replacement for the pay increases abolished by Guevara, workers who exceeded their quota now only received a certificate of commendation, while workers who failed to meet their quotas were given a pay cut.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKellner198962_163-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellner198962-163">[163]</a></sup> Guevara unapologetically defended his personal philosophy towards motivation and work, stating:

> This is not a matter of how many pounds of meat one might be able to eat, or how many times a year someone can go to the beach, or how many ornaments from abroad one might be able to buy with his current salary.

In the face of a loss of commercial connections with Western states, Guevara tried to replace them with closer commercial relationships with [Eastern Bloc](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Bloc "Eastern Bloc") states, visiting a number of Marxist states and signing trade agreements with them. At the end of 1960 he visited [Czechoslovakia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovak_Socialist_Republic "Czechoslovak Socialist Republic"), the [Soviet Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union"), [North Korea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea "North Korea"), [Hungary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_People%27s_Republic "Hungarian People's Republic"), and [East Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany "East Germany") and signed, for instance, a trade agreement in [East Berlin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Berlin "East Berlin") on 17 December 1960.<sup id="cite_ref-167"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-167">[167]</a></sup> Such agreements helped Cuba's economy to a certain degree but also had the disadvantage of a growing economic dependency on the Eastern Bloc. It was also in East Germany where Guevara met [Tamara Bunke](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamara_Bunke "Tamara Bunke") (later known as "Tania"), who was assigned as his interpreter, and who joined him years later, and was killed with him in Bolivia.

According to Douglas Kellner, his programs were unsuccessful,<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKellner198963_168-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellner198963-168">[168]</a></sup> and accompanied a rapid drop in productivity and a rapid rise in absenteeism.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKellner198974_169-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellner198974-169">[169]</a></sup> In a meeting with French economist [René Dumont](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Dumont "René Dumont"), Guevara blamed the inadequacy of the agrarian reform law enacted by the Cuban government in 1959, which turned large plantations into farm [cooperatives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative "Cooperative") or split up land amongst peasants.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTETaibo1999269_170-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTETaibo1999269-170">[170]</a></sup> In Guevara's opinion, this situation continued to promote a "heightened sense of individual ownership" in which workers could not see the positive social benefits of their labor, leading them to instead seek individual material gain as before.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTETaibo1999306_171-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTETaibo1999306-171">[171]</a></sup> Decades later, Che's former deputy Ernesto Betancourt, subsequently the director of the US government-funded [Radio Martí](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_y_Televisi%C3%B3n_Mart%C3%AD "Radio y Televisión Martí") and an early ally turned Castro-critic, accused Guevara of being "ignorant of the most elementary economic principles."<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceB_172-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-ReferenceB-172">[172]</a></sup>

On 17 April 1961, 1,400 US-trained Cuban exiles invaded Cuba during the [Bay of Pigs Invasion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Pigs_Invasion "Bay of Pigs Invasion").

### Great Debate

The era in Cuban history retroactively named the "Great Debate" by historians was defined by public debate about the future of Cuban economic policy that took place from 1962 to 1965. The debate began after Cuba fell into an economic crisis in 1962 after years of internal economic complications, [United States sanctions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_embargo_against_Cuba "United States embargo against Cuba"), and [the flight of professionals from Cuba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_exile "Golden exile"). In 1962 [Fidel Castro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidel_Castro "Fidel Castro") invited Marxist economists around the world to debate two main propositions. One proposition proposed by Che Guevara was that Cuba could bypass any capitalist then "socialist" transition period and immediately become an industrialized "communist" society if "subjective conditions" like public consciousness and vanguard action are perfected. The other proposition held by the [Popular Socialist Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Socialist_Party_(Cuba) "Popular Socialist Party (Cuba)") was that Cuba required a transitionary period as a [mixed economy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_economy "Mixed economy") in which Cuba's sugar economy was maximized for profit before a "communist" society could be established.<sup id="cite_ref-def_186-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-def-186">[186]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-187"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-187">[187]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-188"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-188">[188]</a></sup>

Guevara elaborated in this period that moral incentives should exist as the main motivator to increase workers' production. All profits created by enterprises were to be given to the state budget, and the state budget would cover losses. Institutions that developed socialist consciousness were regarded as the most important element in maintaining a path to socialism rather than materially incentivized increases in production.

In 1966 the Cuban economy was reorganized on moral lines. Cuban propaganda stressed voluntarism and ideological motivations to increase productions.

Countries Che Guevara visited (red) and those in which he participated in armed revolution (green)

### United Nations delegation

In December 1964, Che Guevara had emerged as a "revolutionary statesman of world stature" and thus traveled to New York City as head of the Cuban delegation to speak at the United Nations.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKellner198960_151-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellner198960-151">[151]</a></sup> On 11 December 1964, during Guevara's hour-long, impassioned address at the UN, he criticized the United Nations' inability to confront the "brutal policy of [apartheid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid "Apartheid")" in South Africa, asking "Can the United Nations do nothing to stop this?".<sup id="cite_ref-GuevaraUnitedNations_195-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-GuevaraUnitedNations-195">[195]</a></sup> Guevara then denounced the [United States policy towards their black population](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws "Jim Crow laws"), stating:

> Those who kill their own children and discriminate daily against them because of the color of their skin; those who let the murderers of blacks remain free, protecting them, and furthermore punishing the black population because they demand their legitimate rights as free men—how can those who do this consider themselves guardians of freedom?<sup id="cite_ref-GuevaraUnitedNations_195-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-GuevaraUnitedNations-195">[195]</a></sup>

An indignant Guevara ended his speech by reciting the _Second Declaration of Havana_, decreeing Latin America a "family of 200 million brothers who suffer the same miseries".<sup id="cite_ref-GuevaraUnitedNations_195-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-GuevaraUnitedNations-195">[195]</a></sup> This "epic", Guevara declared, would be written by the "hungry Indian masses, peasants without land, exploited workers, and progressive masses". To Guevara the conflict was a struggle of masses and ideas, which would be carried forth by those "mistreated and scorned by [imperialism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism "Imperialism")" who were previously considered "a weak and submissive flock". With this "flock", Guevara now asserted, "Yankee monopoly capitalism" now terrifyingly saw their "gravediggers".<sup id="cite_ref-GuevaraUnitedNations_195-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-GuevaraUnitedNations-195">[195]</a></sup> It would be during this "hour of vindication", Guevara pronounced, that the "anonymous mass" would begin to write its own history "with its own blood" and reclaim those "rights that were laughed at by one and all for 500 years". Guevara closed his remarks to the General Assembly by hypothesizing that this "wave of anger" would "sweep the lands of Latin America" and that the labor masses who "turn the wheel of history" were now, for the first time, "awakening from the long, brutalizing sleep to which they had been subjected".<sup id="cite_ref-GuevaraUnitedNations_195-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-GuevaraUnitedNations-195">[195]</a></sup>

Afterwards Guevara commented on both incidents, stating that "it is better to be killed by a woman with a knife than by a man with a gun", while adding with a languid wave of his cigar that the explosion had "given the whole thing more flavor".<sup id="cite_ref-NYTDec1964_196-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-NYTDec1964-196">[196]</a></sup>

The latter expressed his admiration, declaring Guevara "one of the most revolutionary men in this country right now" while reading a statement from him to a crowd at the [Audubon Ballroom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audubon_Ballroom "Audubon Ballroom").<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAnderson1997618_199-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAnderson1997618-199">[199]</a></sup>

### World travel

On 17 December, Guevara left New York for Paris, France, and from there embarked on a three-month world tour that included visits to the People's Republic of China, North Korea, the [United Arab Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Republic "United Arab Republic"), Algeria, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, [Dahomey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Dahomey "Republic of Dahomey"), Congo-Brazzaville, and Tanzania, with stops in Ireland and [Prague](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague "Prague"). While in Ireland, Guevara embraced his own Irish heritage, celebrating [Saint Patrick's Day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Patrick%27s_Day "Saint Patrick's Day") in [Limerick](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerick "Limerick").<sup id="cite_ref-200"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-200">[200]</a></sup> He wrote to his father on this visit, humorously stating "I am in this green Ireland of your ancestors. When they found out, the television \[station\] came to ask me about the Lynch genealogy, but in case they were horse thieves or something like that, I didn't say much."<sup id="cite_ref-201"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-201">[201]</a></sup> In 1969 Guevara's father was quoted on his sons Irish lineage: "The first thing to note is that in my son’s veins flowed the blood of the Irish rebels..."<sup id="cite_ref-202"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-202">[202]</a></sup>

During Guevara's time in Algeria he was interviewed by Spanish poet [Juan Goytisolo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Goytisolo "Juan Goytisolo") inside the Cuban embassy. During the interview Guevara noticed a book by openly gay Cuban writer [Virgilio Piñera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgilio_Pi%C3%B1era "Virgilio Piñera") that was sitting on the table next to him. When he noticed it he threw the book against the wall and yelled "how dare you have in our embassy a book by this foul faggot?".<sup id="cite_ref-203"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-203">[203]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-204"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-204">[204]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Entiendes_205-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-Entiendes-205">[205]</a></sup> This moment has been marked as a turn in Goytisolo's personal identity as it influenced him to slowly come out of the closet as gay and begin to sympathize with the LGBT citizens of Cuba.<sup id="cite_ref-206"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-206">[206]</a></sup> This moment has also been marked for its significance in the Cuban government's slow and ultimately final ousting of [Virgilio Piñera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgilio_Pi%C3%B1era "Virgilio Piñera") from official literary discourse in Cuba. Piñera had originally been regarded as an important dramatist of the Cuban Revolution but had later become slowly condemned and [finally arrested](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_Three_Ps "Night of the Three Ps").<sup id="cite_ref-Entiendes_205-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-Entiendes-205">[205]</a></sup>

During this voyage, he wrote a letter to Carlos Quijano, editor of a Uruguayan weekly, which was later retitled _Socialism and Man in Cuba_.<sup id="cite_ref-SocialismAndMan_162-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-SocialismAndMan-162">[162]</a></sup> Outlined in the treatise was Guevara's summons for the creation of a new consciousness, a new status of work, and a new role of the individual. He also laid out the reasoning behind his [anti-capitalist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-capitalism "Anti-capitalism") sentiments, stating:

> The laws of capitalism, blind and invisible to the majority, act upon the individual without his thinking about it. He sees only the vastness of a seemingly infinite horizon before him. That is how it is painted by capitalist propagandists, who purport to draw a lesson from the example of [Rockefeller](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Rockefeller "John D. Rockefeller")—whether or not it is true—about the possibilities of success. The amount of poverty and suffering required for the emergence of [a Rockefeller](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockefeller_family "Rockefeller family"), and the amount of depravity that the accumulation of a fortune of such magnitude entails, are left out of the picture, and it is not always possible to make the people in general see this.<sup id="cite_ref-SocialismAndMan_162-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-SocialismAndMan-162">[162]</a></sup>

Guevara ended the essay by declaring that "the true revolutionary is guided by a great feeling of love" and beckoning on all revolutionaries to "strive every day so that this love of living humanity will be transformed into acts that serve as examples", thus becoming "a moving force".<sup id="cite_ref-SocialismAndMan_162-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-SocialismAndMan-162">[162]</a></sup> The genesis for Guevara's assertions relied on the fact that he believed the example of the Cuban Revolution was "something spiritual that would transcend all borders".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAnderson199737–38_38-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAnderson199737%E2%80%9338-38">[38]</a></sup>

### Visit to Algeria and political turn

In [Algiers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algiers "Algiers"), Algeria, on 24 February 1965, Guevara made what turned out to be his last public appearance on the international stage when he delivered a speech at an economic seminar on Afro-Asian solidarity.<sup id="cite_ref-207"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-207">[207]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-208"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-208">[208]</a></sup> He specified the moral duty of the socialist countries, accusing them of tacit complicity with the exploiting Western countries. He proceeded to outline a number of measures which he said the communist-bloc countries must implement in order to accomplish the defeat of [imperialism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism "Imperialism").<sup id="cite_ref-209"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-209">[209]</a></sup> Having criticized the Soviet Union (the primary financial backer of Cuba) in such a public manner, he returned to Cuba on 14 March to a solemn reception by Fidel and Raúl Castro, Osvaldo Dorticós, and Carlos Rafael Rodríguez at the Havana airport.

As revealed in his last public speech in Algiers, Guevara had come to view the [Northern Hemisphere](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere "Northern Hemisphere"), led by the US in the West and the Soviet Union in the East, as the exploiter of the [Southern Hemisphere](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere "Southern Hemisphere"). He strongly supported communist [North Vietnam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Vietnam "North Vietnam") in the [Vietnam War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War "Vietnam War"), and urged the peoples of other developing countries to take up arms and create "many Vietnams".<sup id="cite_ref-MessTricont1967_210-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-MessTricont1967-210">[210]</a></sup> Che's denunciations of the Soviets made him popular among intellectuals and artists of the Western European left who had lost faith in the Soviet Union, while his condemnation of imperialism and call to revolution inspired young radical students in the United States, who were impatient for societal change.<sup id="cite_ref-Michiko_211-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-Michiko-211">[211]</a></sup>

In Guevara's private writings from this time (since released), he displays his growing criticism of the Soviet political economy, believing that the Soviets had "forgotten [Marx](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx "Karl Marx")".<sup id="cite_ref-Yaffe2006_212-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-Yaffe2006-212">[212]</a></sup> This led Guevara to denounce a range of Soviet practices including what he saw as their attempt to "air-brush the inherent violence of [class struggle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_conflict "Class conflict") integral to [the transition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communization "Communization") from capitalism to socialism", their "dangerous" policy of [peaceful co-existence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaceful_co-existence "Peaceful co-existence") with the United States, their failure to push for a "change in consciousness" towards the idea of work, and their attempt to "[liberalize](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_liberalization "Economic liberalization")" the socialist economy. Guevara wanted the complete elimination of [money](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money "Money"), [interest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest "Interest"), [commodity production](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist_mode_of_production_(Marxist_theory) "Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)"), the [market economy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy "Market economy"), and "[mercantile relationships](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism "Mercantilism")": all conditions that the Soviets argued would only disappear when [world communism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_communism "World communism") was achieved.<sup id="cite_ref-Yaffe2006_212-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-Yaffe2006-212">[212]</a></sup> Disagreeing with this incrementalist approach, Guevara criticized the _Soviet Manual of Political Economy_, correctly predicting that if the Soviet Union did not abolish the [law of value](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_value "Law of value") (as Guevara desired), it would eventually return to capitalism.<sup id="cite_ref-Yaffe2006_212-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-Yaffe2006-212">[212]</a></sup>

Two weeks after his Algiers speech and his return to Cuba, Guevara dropped out of public life and then vanished altogether.<sup id="cite_ref-213"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-213">[213]</a></sup> His whereabouts were a great mystery in Cuba, as he was generally regarded as second in power to Castro himself. His disappearance was variously attributed to the failure of the Cuban industrialization scheme he had advocated while minister of industries, to pressure exerted on Castro by Soviet officials who disapproved of Guevara's pro-[Chinese communist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party "Chinese Communist Party") stance on the [Sino-Soviet split](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Soviet_split "Sino-Soviet split"), and to serious differences between Guevara and the pragmatic Castro regarding Cuba's economic development and ideological line.<sup id="cite_ref-214"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-214">[214]</a></sup> Pressed by international speculation regarding Guevara's fate, Castro stated on 16 June 1965, that the people would be informed when Guevara himself wished to let them know. Still, rumors spread both inside and outside Cuba concerning the missing Guevara's whereabouts.

There are various rumors from retired Cuban officials who were around the Castro brothers that the Castro brothers and Guevara had a strong disagreement after Guevara's Algiers speech. Intelligence files from the [East German](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany "East Germany") embassy in Cuba detail various heated exchanges between Fidel Castro and Che Guevara after Guevara's return from Africa. Whether Castro disagreed with Guevara's criticisms of the Soviet Union or just found them unproductive to express on the world stage remains unclear.<sup id="cite_ref-215"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-215">[215]</a></sup>

On 3 October 1965, Castro publicly revealed an undated letter purportedly written to him by Guevara around seven months earlier which was later titled Che Guevara's "farewell letter". In the letter, Guevara reaffirmed his enduring solidarity with the Cuban Revolution but declared his intention to leave Cuba to fight for the revolutionary cause abroad. Additionally, he resigned from all his positions in the Cuban government and communist party, and renounced his honorary Cuban citizenship.<sup id="cite_ref-216"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-216">[216]</a></sup>

In early 1965, Guevara went to Africa to offer his knowledge and experience as a guerrilla to the ongoing [conflict in the Congo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Crisis "Congo Crisis"). According to Algerian President [Ahmed Ben Bella](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Ben_Bella "Ahmed Ben Bella"), Guevara thought that Africa was imperialism's weak link and so had enormous revolutionary potential.<sup id="cite_ref-218"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-218">[218]</a></sup> Egyptian President [Gamal Abdel Nasser](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser "Gamal Abdel Nasser"), who had fraternal relations with Che since his 1959 visit, saw Guevara's plan to fight in Congo as "unwise" and warned that he would become a "[Tarzan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarzan "Tarzan")" figure, doomed to failure.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAnderson1997624_219-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAnderson1997624-219">[219]</a></sup> Despite the warning, Guevara traveled to Congo using the alias Ramón Benítez.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAnderson1997629_220-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAnderson1997629-220">[220]</a></sup> He led the Cuban operation in support of the leftist [Simba movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simba_rebellion "Simba rebellion"), which had emerged from the ongoing Congo conflict. Guevara, his second-in-command [Víctor Dreke](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%ADctor_Dreke "Víctor Dreke"), and 12 other Cuban expeditionaries arrived in Congo on 24 April 1965, and a contingent of approximately 100 [Afro-Cubans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afro-Cubans "Afro-Cubans") joined them soon afterward.<sup id="cite_ref-221"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-221">[221]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-222"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-222">[222]</a></sup> For a time, they collaborated with guerrilla leader [Laurent-Désiré Kabila](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurent-D%C3%A9sir%C3%A9_Kabila "Laurent-Désiré Kabila"), who had helped supporters of the overthrown prime minister [Patrice Lumumba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_Lumumba "Patrice Lumumba") to lead an unsuccessful revolt months earlier. As an admirer of the late Lumumba, Guevara declared that his "murder should be a lesson for all of us".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKellner198986_223-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellner198986-223">[223]</a></sup> Guevara, with limited knowledge of [Swahili](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swahili_language "Swahili language") and the local languages, was assigned a teenage interpreter, Freddy Ilanga. Over the course of seven months, Ilanga grew to "admire the hard-working Guevara", who "showed the same respect to black people as he did to whites".<sup id="cite_ref-224"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-224">[224]</a></sup> Guevara soon became disillusioned with the poor discipline of Kabila's troops and later dismissed him, stating "nothing leads me to believe he is the man of the hour".<sup id="cite_ref-225"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-225">[225]</a></sup> Regardless, Che still regarded Kabila more favorably than other Simba leaders, several of whom still pretended to lead rebel forces even after they had fled into exile.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEVillafana2017158,_160_226-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEVillafana2017158,_160-226">[226]</a></sup>

As an additional obstacle, the Congolese military (the _[Armée Nationale Congolaise](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm%C3%A9e_Nationale_Congolaise "Armée Nationale Congolaise")_, ANC) was aided by [mercenary troops](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercenaries_and_the_Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo "Mercenaries and the Democratic Republic of the Congo") led by [Mike Hoare](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Mike_Hoare "Mad Mike Hoare") and supported by [anti-Castro Cuban pilots and the CIA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_activities_in_the_Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo "CIA activities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo"). These forces thwarted Guevara's movements from his base camp in the mountains near the village of [Fizi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizi "Fizi") on [Lake Tanganyika](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Tanganyika "Lake Tanganyika") in southeast Congo. They were able to monitor his communications and so pre-empted his attacks and interdicted his supply lines. Although Guevara tried to conceal his presence in Congo, the United States government knew his location and activities.

Standing behind them is Roberto Sánchez ("Lawton" in Cuba and "Changa" in the Congo), 1965.

Guevara's aim was to [export the revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exporting_the_revolution "Exporting the revolution") by instructing local anti-[Mobutu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobutu_Sese_Seko "Mobutu Sese Seko") Simba fighters in Marxist ideology and [foco theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foco "Foco") strategies of [guerrilla warfare](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare "Guerrilla warfare"). In his _Congo Diary_ book, he cites a combination of incompetence, intransigence, and infighting among the Congolese rebels as key reasons for the revolt's failure.<sup id="cite_ref-229"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-229">[229]</a></sup> From September 1965, the ANC and its allies launched [Operation South](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_South "Operation South") to destroy Kabila's forces. With the support of Che and his Cubans, the Simbas put up substantial resistance. Regardless, the rebels were increasingly pushed back, lost their supply routes, and suffered under failing morale.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEVillafana2017153–166_230-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEVillafana2017153%E2%80%93166-230">[230]</a></sup> Guevara himself was almost killed in one clash of the operation.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEVillafana2017164_231-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEVillafana2017164-231">[231]</a></sup> Regardless, he initially wanted to continue some form of guerrilla campaign from the local mountains, but even his Simba allies ultimately told him that the rebellion was defeated.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEVillafana2017166–167_232-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEVillafana2017166%E2%80%93167-232">[232]</a></sup> On 20 November 1965, suffering from [dysentery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysentery "Dysentery") and acute asthma, and disheartened after seven months of defeats and inactivity, Guevara left Congo with the six Cuban survivors of his 12-man column. Guevara stated that he had planned to send the wounded back to Cuba and fight in the Congo alone until his death, as a revolutionary example. But after being urged by his comrades, and two Cuban emissaries personally sent by Castro, at the last moment he reluctantly agreed to leave Africa. During that day and night, Guevara's forces quietly took down their base camp, burned their huts, and destroyed or threw weapons into Lake Tanganyika that they could not take with them, before crossing the border by boat into Tanzania at night and traveling by land to Dar es Salaam. In speaking about his experience in Congo months later, Guevara concluded that he left rather than fight to the death because: "The human element failed. There is no will to fight. The \[rebel\] leaders are corrupt. In a word ... there was nothing to do."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKellner198987_233-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellner198987-233">[233]</a></sup> Guevara also declared that "we can not liberate, all by ourselves, a country that does not want to fight."<sup id="cite_ref-234"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-234">[234]</a></sup> A few weeks later, he wrote the preface to the diary he kept during the Congo venture, that began: "This is the story of a failure."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGuevara20001_235-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGuevara20001-235">[235]</a></sup>

### Flight from the Congo

Following the failure of the rebellion in the Congo, Guevara was reluctant to return to Cuba, because Castro had already made public Guevara's "farewell letter"—a letter intended to only be revealed in the case of his death—wherein he severed all ties in order to devote himself to revolution throughout the world.<sup id="cite_ref-236"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-236">[236]</a></sup> As a result, Guevara spent the next six months living clandestinely at the Cuban embassy in Dar es Salaam and later at a Cuban safehouse in [Ládví](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamenice_(Prague-East_District) "Kamenice (Prague-East District)") near Prague.<sup id="cite_ref-237"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-237">[237]</a></sup> While in Europe, Guevara made a secret visit to former Argentine president [Juan Perón](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Per%C3%B3n "Juan Perón") who lived in exile in [Francoist Spain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francoist_Spain "Francoist Spain") where he confided in Perón about his new plan to formulate a communist revolution to bring all of Latin America under socialist control. Perón warned Guevara that his plans for implementing a communist revolution throughout Latin America, starting with Bolivia, would be suicidal and futile, but Guevara's mind was already made up. Later, Perón remarked that Guevara was "an immature utopian... but one of us. I am happy for it to be so because he is giving the Yankees a real headache."<sup id="cite_ref-ODonnell_238-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-ODonnell-238">[238]</a></sup>

During this time abroad, Guevara compiled his memoirs of the Congo experience and wrote drafts of two more books, one on philosophy and the other on economics. As Guevara prepared for Bolivia, he secretly traveled back to Cuba on 21 July 1966 to visit Castro, as well as to see his wife and to write a last letter to his five children to be read upon his death, which ended with him instructing them:

> Above all, always be capable of feeling deeply any injustice committed against anyone, anywhere in the world. This is the most beautiful quality in a revolutionary.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGuevara2009167_239-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGuevara2009167-239">[239]</a></sup>

### Departure to Bolivia

Guevara's 1966 passport featuring him in disguise with a false name.

In late 1966, Guevara's location was still not public knowledge, although representatives of Mozambique's independence movement, the [FRELIMO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FRELIMO "FRELIMO"), reported that they met with Guevara in [Dar es Salaam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dar_es_Salaam "Dar es Salaam") regarding his offer to aid in their revolutionary project, an offer which they ultimately rejected.<sup id="cite_ref-240"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-240">[240]</a></sup> In a speech at the 1967 [International Workers' Day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Workers%27_Day "International Workers' Day") rally in Havana, the acting minister of the armed forces, Major [Juan Almeida Bosque](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Almeida_Bosque "Juan Almeida Bosque"), announced that Guevara was "serving the revolution somewhere in Latin America".<sup id="cite_ref-241"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-241">[241]</a></sup> In his book _Opération Condor_ published in 2020, French journalist [Pablo Daniel Magee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Daniel_Magee "Pablo Daniel Magee") reconstitutes the first incursion of Che Guevara in [Bolivia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia "Bolivia") on 3 October 1966, based on top-secret documents kept in the [UNESCO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO "UNESCO") protected [Archives of Terror](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archives_of_Terror "Archives of Terror"), in [Paraguay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraguay "Paraguay").

Before he departed for Bolivia, Guevara altered his appearance by shaving off his beard and much of his hair, also dying it grey so that he was unrecognizable as Che Guevara.<sup id="cite_ref-242"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-242">[242]</a></sup> On 3 November 1966, Guevara secretly arrived in [La Paz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Paz "La Paz") on a flight from Montevideo, under the false name Adolfo Mena González, posing as a middle-aged Uruguayan businessman working for the [Organization of American States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization_of_American_States "Organization of American States").<sup id="cite_ref-243"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-243">[243]</a></sup>

Three days after his arrival in Bolivia, Guevara left La Paz for the rural south east region of the country to form his guerrilla army. Guevara's first base camp was located in the [montane dry forest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_and_subtropical_dry_broadleaf_forests "Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests") in the remote Ñancahuazú region. Training at the camp in the Ñancahuazú valley proved to be hazardous, and little was accomplished in way of building a guerrilla army. The Argentine-born [East German](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany "East Germany") operative [Tamara Bunke](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamara_Bunke "Tamara Bunke"), better known by her _[nom de guerre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonym#Military_and_paramilitary_organizations "Pseudonym")_ "Tania", had been installed as Che's primary agent in La Paz.<sup id="cite_ref-#refSelvage1985|Selvage_1985_244-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-#refSelvage1985%7CSelvage_1985-244">[244]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAnderson1997693_245-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAnderson1997693-245">[245]</a></sup>

### Ñancahuazú Guerrilla

 [](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CheinBolivia1.jpg)

Guevara in rural Bolivia, shortly before his death (1967)

Guevara's guerrilla force, numbering about 50 men<sup id="cite_ref-246"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-246">[246]</a></sup> and operating as the ELN (_Ejército de Liberación Nacional de Bolivia_, "National Liberation Army of Bolivia"), was well equipped and scored a number of early successes against Bolivian army regulars [in the difficult terrain of the mountainous Camiri region during the early months of 1967](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_of_Che "Route of Che"). As a result of Guevara's units winning several skirmishes against Bolivian troops in the spring and summer of 1967, the Bolivian government began to overestimate the true size of the guerrilla force.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKellner198997_247-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellner198997-247">[247]</a></sup>

Researchers hypothesize that Guevara's plan for fomenting a revolution in Bolivia failed for an array of reasons:

-   Guevara had expected assistance and cooperation from the local dissidents that he did not receive, nor did he receive support from Bolivia's Communist Party under the leadership of [Mario Monje](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Monje "Mario Monje"), which was oriented toward Moscow rather than Havana. In Guevara's own diary captured after his death, he wrote about the [Communist Party of Bolivia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Bolivia "Communist Party of Bolivia"), which he characterized as "distrustful, disloyal and stupid".<sup id="cite_ref-248"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-248">[248]</a></sup>
-   He had expected to deal only with the Bolivian military, who were poorly trained and equipped, and was unaware that the United States government had sent a team of the [CIA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency "Central Intelligence Agency")'s [Special Activities Division](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Activities_Center "Special Activities Center") commandos and other operatives into Bolivia to aid the anti-insurrection effort. The [Bolivian Army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivian_Army "Bolivian Army") was also trained, advised, and supplied by [US Army Special Forces](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Special_Forces "United States Army Special Forces"), including an elite battalion of [US Rangers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Rangers "United States Army Rangers") trained in [jungle warfare](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungle_warfare "Jungle warfare") that set up camp in La Esperanza, a small settlement close to the location of Guevara's guerrillas.<sup id="cite_ref-249"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-249">[249]</a></sup>
-   He had expected to remain in radio contact with Havana. The two [shortwave radio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortwave_radio "Shortwave radio") transmitters provided to him by Cuba were faulty. Thus, the guerrillas were unable to communicate and be resupplied, leaving them isolated and stranded.<sup id="cite_ref-250"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-250">[250]</a></sup>

In addition, Guevara's known preference for confrontation rather than compromise, which had previously surfaced during his guerrilla warfare campaign in Cuba, contributed to his inability to develop successful working relationships with local rebel leaders in Bolivia, just as it had in the Congo.<sup id="cite_ref-251"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-251">[251]</a></sup> This tendency had existed in Cuba, but had been kept in check by the timely interventions and guidance of Fidel Castro.<sup id="cite_ref-252"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-252">[252]</a></sup>

The result was that Guevara was unable to attract inhabitants of the local area to join his militia during the eleven months he attempted recruitment. Many of the inhabitants willingly informed the Bolivian authorities and military about the guerrillas and their movements in the area. Near the end of the Bolivian venture, Guevara wrote in his diary: "Talking to these peasants is like talking to statues. They do not give us any help. Worse still, many of them are turning into informants."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEWright200086_253-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWright200086-253">[253]</a></sup>

[Félix Rodríguez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9lix_Rodr%C3%ADguez_(soldier) "Félix Rodríguez (soldier)"), a [Cuban exile](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_exile "Cuban exile") turned CIA Special Activities Division operative, advised Bolivian troops during the hunt for Guevara in Bolivia.<sup id="cite_ref-254"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-254">[254]</a></sup> In addition, the 2007 documentary _[My Enemy's Enemy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Enemy%27s_Enemy "My Enemy's Enemy")_ alleges that [Nazi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism "Nazism") war criminal [Klaus Barbie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Barbie#Che_Guevara "Klaus Barbie") advised and possibly helped the CIA orchestrate Guevara's eventual capture.<sup id="cite_ref-ObserverChe_255-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-ObserverChe-255">[255]</a></sup>

### Capture

On 7 October 1967, an informant apprised the Bolivian Special Forces of the location of Guevara's guerrilla encampment in the Yuro ravine.<sup id="cite_ref-256"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-256">[256]</a></sup> On the morning of 8 October, they encircled the area with two companies numbering 180 soldiers and advanced into the ravine triggering a battle where Guevara was wounded and taken prisoner while leading a detachment with [Simeon Cuba Sarabia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simeon_Cuba_Sarabia "Simeon Cuba Sarabia").<sup id="cite_ref-257"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-257">[257]</a></sup> Che's biographer [Jon Lee Anderson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Lee_Anderson "Jon Lee Anderson") reports Bolivian Sergeant Bernardino Huanca's account: that as the Bolivian Rangers approached, a twice-wounded Guevara, his gun rendered useless, threw up his arms in surrender and shouted to the soldiers: "Do not shoot! I am Che Guevara and I am worth more to you alive than dead."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAnderson1997733_258-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAnderson1997733-258">[258]</a></sup>

Guevara was tied up and taken to a dilapidated mud schoolhouse in the nearby village of [La Higuera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Higuera "La Higuera") on the evening of 8 October. For the next half-day, Guevara refused to be interrogated by Bolivian officers and only spoke quietly to Bolivian soldiers. One of those Bolivian soldiers, a helicopter pilot named Jaime Nino de Guzman, describes Che as looking "dreadful". According to Guzman, Guevara was shot through the right calf, his hair was matted with dirt, his clothes were shredded, and his feet were covered in rough leather sheaths. Despite his haggard appearance, he recounts that "Che held his head high, looked everyone straight in the eyes and asked only for something to smoke." De Guzman states that he "took pity" and gave him a small bag of tobacco for his pipe, and that Guevara then smiled and thanked him.<sup id="cite_ref-The_Man_Who_Buried_Che_259-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-The_Man_Who_Buried_Che-259">[259]</a></sup> Later on the night of 8 October, Guevara—despite having his hands tied—kicked a Bolivian army officer, named Captain Espinosa, against a wall after the officer entered the schoolhouse and tried to snatch Guevara's pipe from his mouth as a souvenir while he was still smoking it.<sup id="cite_ref-Michèle_260-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-Mich%C3%A8le-260">[260]</a></sup> In another instance of defiance, Guevara spat in the face of Bolivian Rear Admiral Horacio Ugarteche, who attempted to question Guevara a few hours before his execution.<sup id="cite_ref-Michèle_260-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-Mich%C3%A8le-260">[260]</a></sup>

The following morning on 9 October, Guevara asked to see the school teacher of the village, a 22-year-old woman named Julia Cortez. She later stated that she found Guevara to be an "agreeable looking man with a soft and ironic glance" and that during their conversation she found herself "unable to look him in the eye" because his "gaze was unbearable, piercing, and so tranquil".<sup id="cite_ref-Michèle_260-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-Mich%C3%A8le-260">[260]</a></sup> During their short conversation, Guevara pointed out to Cortez the poor condition of the schoolhouse, stating that it was "anti-[pedagogical](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy "Pedagogy")" to expect campesino students to be educated there, while "government officials drive [Mercedes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_(marque) "Mercedes (marque)") cars"; Guevara said "that's what we are fighting against".<sup id="cite_ref-Michèle_260-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-Mich%C3%A8le-260">[260]</a></sup>

### Execution

Location of [Vallegrande](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vallegrande "Vallegrande") in Bolivia

Later on the morning of 9 October, Bolivian President [René Barrientos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Barrientos "René Barrientos") ordered that Guevara be killed. The order was relayed to the unit holding Guevara by Félix Rodríguez reportedly despite the United States government's desire that Guevara be taken to Panama for further interrogation.<sup id="cite_ref-261"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-261">[261]</a></sup> The executioner who volunteered to kill Guevara was [Mario Terán](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Ter%C3%A1n "Mario Terán"), a 27-year-old sergeant in the Bolivian army who while [half-drunk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication "Alcohol intoxication") requested to shoot Guevara because three of his friends from B Company, all with the same first name of "Mario", had been killed in a firefight several days earlier with Guevara's band of guerrillas.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTETaibo1999267_9-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTETaibo1999267-9">[9]</a></sup> To make the bullet wounds appear consistent with the story that the Bolivian government planned to release to the public, Félix Rodríguez ordered Terán not to shoot Guevara in the head, but to aim carefully to make it appear that Guevara had been killed in action during a clash with the Bolivian army.<sup id="cite_ref-262"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-262">[262]</a></sup> [Gary Prado Salmón](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Prado_Salm%C3%B3n "Gary Prado Salmón"), the Bolivian captain in command of the army company that captured Guevara, said that the reasons Barrientos ordered the immediate execution of Guevara were so there could be no possibility for Guevara to escape from prison, and also so there could be no drama of a public trial where adverse publicity might happen.<sup id="cite_ref-263"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-263">[263]</a></sup>

About 30 minutes before Guevara was killed, Félix Rodríguez attempted to question him about the whereabouts of other guerrilla fighters who were currently at large, but Guevara continued to remain silent. Rodríguez, assisted by a few Bolivian soldiers, helped Guevara to his feet and took him outside the hut to parade him before other Bolivian soldiers where he posed with Guevara for a [photo opportunity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_opportunity "Photo opportunity") where one soldier took a photograph of Rodríguez and other soldiers standing alongside Guevara. Afterwards, Rodríguez told Guevara that he was going to be executed. A little later, Guevara was asked by one of the Bolivian soldiers guarding him if he was thinking about his own immortality. "No" he replied, "I'm thinking about the immortality of the revolution".<sup id="cite_ref-264"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-264">[264]</a></sup> A few minutes later, Sergeant Terán entered the hut to shoot him, whereupon Guevara reportedly stood up and spoke to Terán what were his last words: "I know you've come to kill me. Shoot, coward! You are only going to kill a man!" Terán hesitated, then pointed his self-loading [M2 carbine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1_carbine#Carbine,_Cal_0,_M2 "M1 carbine")<sup id="cite_ref-265"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-265">[265]</a></sup> at Guevara and opened fire, hitting him in the arms and legs.<sup id="cite_ref-anderson739_266-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-anderson739-266">[266]</a></sup> Then, as Guevara writhed on the ground, apparently biting one of his wrists to avoid crying out, Terán fired another burst, fatally wounding him in the chest. Guevara was pronounced dead at 1:10 pm local time according to Rodríguez.<sup id="cite_ref-anderson739_266-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-anderson739-266">[266]</a></sup> In all, Guevara was shot nine times by Terán. This included five times in his legs, once in the right shoulder and arm, and once in the chest and throat.<sup id="cite_ref-Michèle_260-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-Mich%C3%A8le-260">[260]</a></sup>

Months earlier, during his last public declaration to the [Tricontinental Conference](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricontinental_Conference_(1966) "Tricontinental Conference (1966)"),<sup id="cite_ref-MessTricont1967_210-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-MessTricont1967-210">[210]</a></sup> Guevara had written his own [epitaph](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitaph "Epitaph"), stating: "Wherever death may surprise us, let it be welcome, provided that this our battle cry may have reached some receptive ear and another hand may be extended to wield our weapons."<sup id="cite_ref-267"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-267">[267]</a></sup>

### Aftermath

After his execution, Guevara's body was lashed to the landing skids of a helicopter and flown to nearby [Vallegrande](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vallegrande "Vallegrande"), where photographs were taken of him lying on a concrete slab in the laundry room of the Nuestra Señora de Malta.<sup id="cite_ref-268"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-268">[268]</a></sup> Several witnesses were called to confirm his identity, key amongst them the British journalist [Richard Gott](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gott "Richard Gott"), the only witness to have met Guevara when he was alive. Put on display, as hundreds of local residents filed past the body, Guevara's corpse was considered by many to represent a "Christ-like" visage, with some even surreptitiously clipping locks of his hair as divine relics.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTECasey2009179_269-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTECasey2009179-269">[269]</a></sup> Such comparisons were further extended when English art critic [John Berger](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Berger "John Berger"), two weeks later upon seeing the post-mortem photographs, observed that they resembled two famous paintings: [Rembrandt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rembrandt "Rembrandt")'s _[The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anatomy_Lesson_of_Dr._Nicolaes_Tulp "The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp")_ and [Andrea Mantegna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Mantegna "Andrea Mantegna")'s _[Lamentation over the Dead Christ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamentation_over_the_Dead_Christ_(Mantegna) "Lamentation over the Dead Christ (Mantegna)")_.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTECasey2009183_270-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTECasey2009183-270">[270]</a></sup> There were also four correspondents present when Guevara's body arrived in Vallegrande, including [Björn Kumm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj%C3%B6rn_Kumm "Björn Kumm") of the Swedish _[Aftonbladet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftonbladet "Aftonbladet")_, who described the scene in an 11 November 1967, exclusive for _[The New Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Republic "The New Republic")_.<sup id="cite_ref-271"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-271">[271]</a></sup>

Also removed when Guevara was captured were his 30,000-word, hand-written diary, a collection of his personal poetry, and a short story he had authored about a young communist guerrilla who learns to overcome his fears.<sup id="cite_ref-279"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-279">[279]</a></sup> His diary documented events of the guerrilla campaign in Bolivia,<sup id="cite_ref-280"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-280">[280]</a></sup> with the first entry on 7 November 1966, shortly after his arrival at the farm in Ñancahuazú, and the last dated 7 October 1967, the day before his capture. The diary tells how the guerrillas were forced to begin operations prematurely because of discovery by the Bolivian Army, explains Guevara's decision to divide the column into two units that were subsequently unable to re-establish contact, and describes their overall unsuccessful venture. It also records the rift between Guevara and the Communist Party of Bolivia that resulted in Guevara having significantly fewer soldiers than originally expected, and shows that Guevara had a great deal of difficulty recruiting from the local populace, partly because the guerrilla group had learned [Quechua](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quechuan_languages "Quechuan languages"), unaware that the local language was actually a [Tupi–Guarani](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupi%E2%80%93Guarani_languages "Tupi–Guarani languages") language.<sup id="cite_ref-281"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-281">[281]</a></sup> As the campaign drew to an unexpected close, Guevara became increasingly ill.

Debray, who had lived with Guevara's band of guerrillas for a short time, said that in his view they were "victims of the forest" and thus "eaten by the jungle".<sup id="cite_ref-Nadle_285-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-Nadle-285">[285]</a></sup> Debray described a destitute situation where Guevara's men suffered malnutrition, lack of water, absence of shoes, and only possessed six blankets for 22 men. Debray recounts that Guevara and the others had been suffering an "illness" which caused their hands and feet to swell into "mounds of flesh" to the point where you could not discern the fingers on their hands. Debray described Guevara as "optimistic about the future of Latin America" despite the futile situation, and remarked that Guevara was "resigned to die in the knowledge that his death would be a sort of renaissance", noting that Guevara perceived death "as a promise of rebirth" and "ritual of renewal".<sup id="cite_ref-Nadle_285-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-Nadle-285">[285]</a></sup>

## Legacy

### Political left

 [](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Che_Guevara_-_flag.jpg)

A stylized graphic of Guevara's face on a flag above the words "El Che Vive!" (Che Lives!)

[Radical left](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics "Far-left politics") wing activists responded to Guevara's apparent indifference to rewards and glory, and concurred with Guevara's sanctioning of violence as a necessity to instill [socialist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism_(Marxism) "Socialism (Marxism)") ideals.<sup id="cite_ref-286"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-286">[286]</a></sup> Even in the United States, the government which Guevara so vigorously denounced, students began to emulate his style of dress, donning military fatigues, [berets](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beret "Beret"), and growing their hair and beards to show that they too were opponents of US foreign policy.<sup id="cite_ref-287"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-287">[287]</a></sup> For instance, the [Black Panthers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panthers "Black Panthers") began to style themselves "Che-type" while adopting his trademark black [beret](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beret "Beret"), while Arab guerrillas began to name combat operations in his honor.<sup id="cite_ref-Embalm_288-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-Embalm-288">[288]</a></sup> Addressing the wide-ranging flexibility of his legacy, Trisha Ziff, director of the 2008 documentary _[Chevolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevolution "Chevolution")_, has remarked that "Che Guevara's significance in modern times is less about the man and his specific history, and more about the ideals of creating a better society."<sup id="cite_ref-289"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-289">[289]</a></sup> In a similar vein, the Chilean writer [Ariel Dorfman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Dorfman "Ariel Dorfman") has suggested Guevara's enduring appeal might be because "to those who will never follow in his footsteps, submerged as they are in a world of cynicism, self-interest and frantic consumption, nothing could be more vicariously gratifying than Che's disdain for material comfort and everyday desires."<sup id="cite_ref-BBC02_290-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-BBC02-290">[290]</a></sup>

To a certain extent, the belief of Guevara's of a metaphorical resurrection after death came true. After pictures of the dead Guevara began being circulated and the circumstances of his death were being debated, Che's legend began to spread. Demonstrations in protest against his "assassination" occurred throughout the world, and articles, tributes, and poems were written about his life and death.<sup id="cite_ref-291"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-291">[291]</a></sup> Rallies in support of Guevara were held from "Mexico to [Santiago](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago "Santiago"), [Algiers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algiers "Algiers") to Angola, and [Cairo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo "Cairo") to [Calcutta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata "Kolkata")".<sup id="cite_ref-292"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-292">[292]</a></sup> The population of [Budapest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest "Budapest") and [Prague](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague "Prague") lit candles to honor Guevara's passing; and the picture of a smiling Che appeared in London and Paris.<sup id="cite_ref-293"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-293">[293]</a></sup> When a few months later riots broke out in [Berlin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin "Berlin"), [France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_68 "May 68"), and [Chicago](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Democratic_National_Convention_protests "1968 Democratic National Convention protests"), and the unrest spread to the American college campuses, young men and women wore Che Guevara T-shirts and carried his pictures during their protest marches. In the view of military historian [Erik Durschmied](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Durschmied "Erik Durschmied"): "In those [heady months of 1968](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_of_1968 "Protests of 1968"), Che Guevara was not dead. He was very much alive."<sup id="cite_ref-294"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-294">[294]</a></sup>

### Retrieval of remains

 [](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Che_Guevara_-_Grab_in_Santa_Clara,_Kuba.jpg)

[Che Guevara's Monument and Mausoleum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara_Mausoleum "Che Guevara Mausoleum") in [Santa Clara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara,_Cuba "Santa Clara, Cuba"), Cuba

In late 1995, the retired [Bolivian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia "Bolivia") General Mario Vargas revealed to [Jon Lee Anderson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Lee_Anderson "Jon Lee Anderson"), author of _Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life_, that Guevara's corpse lay near a [Vallegrande](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vallegrande "Vallegrande") airstrip. The result was a multi-national search for the remains, which lasted more than a year. In July 1997, a team of Cuban geologists and Argentine [forensic anthropologists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_anthropology "Forensic anthropology") discovered the remnants of seven bodies in two mass graves, including one man without hands (as Guevara would have been). Bolivian government officials with the Ministry of Interior later identified the body as Guevara when the excavated teeth "perfectly matched" a plaster mold of Che's teeth made in Cuba prior to his Congolese expedition. The "clincher" then arrived when Argentine forensic anthropologist Alejandro Inchaurregui inspected the inside hidden pocket of a blue jacket dug up next to the handless cadaver and found a small bag of pipe tobacco. Nino de Guzman, the Bolivian helicopter pilot who had given Che a small bag of tobacco, later remarked that he "had serious doubts" at first and "thought the Cubans would just find any old bones and call it Che"; but "after hearing about the tobacco pouch, I have no doubts."<sup id="cite_ref-The_Man_Who_Buried_Che_259-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-The_Man_Who_Buried_Che-259">[259]</a></sup> On 17 October 1997 (30 years and 8 days after Guevara's death), Guevara's remains, with those of six of his fellow combatants, were laid to rest with military honors in a specially built [mausoleum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara_Mausoleum "Che Guevara Mausoleum") in the Cuban city of [Santa Clara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara,_Cuba "Santa Clara, Cuba"), where he had commanded over the [decisive military victory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Santa_Clara "Battle of Santa Clara") of the [Cuban Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Revolution "Cuban Revolution").<sup id="cite_ref-295"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-295">[295]</a></sup>

In July 2008, the Bolivian government of [Evo Morales](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evo_Morales "Evo Morales") unveiled Guevara's formerly-sealed diaries composed in two frayed notebooks, along with a logbook and several black-and-white photographs. At this event Bolivia's vice-minister of culture, [Pablo Groux](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Groux "Pablo Groux"), expressed that there were plans to publish photographs of every handwritten page later in the year.<sup id="cite_ref-296"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-296">[296]</a></sup> Meanwhile, in August 2009 anthropologists working for Bolivia's Justice Ministry discovered and unearthed the bodies of five of Guevara's fellow guerrillas near the Bolivian town of [Teoponte](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teoponte "Teoponte").<sup id="cite_ref-297"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-297">[297]</a></sup>

> The discovery of Che's remains metonymically activated a series of interlinked associations—rebel, martyr, rogue figure from a picaresque adventure, savior, renegade, extremist—in which there was no fixed divide among them. The current court of opinion places Che on a continuum that teeters between viewing him as a misguided rebel, a coruscatingly brilliant guerrilla philosopher, a poet-warrior jousting at windmills, a brazen warrior who threw down the gauntlet to the bourgeoisie, the object of fervent paeans to his sainthood, or a mass murderer clothed in the guise of an avenging angel whose every action is imbricated in violence—the archetypal Fanatical Terrorist.

### Biographical debate

Guevara's life and legacy remain contentious. The perceived contradictions of his ethos at various points in his life have created a complex character of duality, one who was "able to wield the pen and submachine gun with equal skill", while prophesying that "the most important revolutionary ambition was to see man liberated from [his alienation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx%27s_theory_of_alienation "Marx's theory of alienation")".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELöwy19737,_33_299-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEL%C3%B6wy19737,_33-299">[299]</a></sup> Guevara's paradoxical standing is further complicated by his array of seemingly diametrically opposed qualities. A [secular humanist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_humanism "Secular humanism") and sympathetic practitioner of medicine who did not hesitate to shoot his enemies, a celebrated [internationalist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proletarian_internationalism "Proletarian internationalism") leader who advocated violence to enforce a [utopian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia "Utopia") philosophy of the [collective good](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics) "Public good (economics)"), an [idealistic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism "Idealism") [intellectual](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual "Intellectual") who loved literature but refused to allow dissent, an [anti-imperialist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-imperialism "Anti-imperialism") [Marxist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism "Marxism") [insurgent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency "Insurgency") who was radically willing to forge a poverty-less new world on the apocalyptic ashes of the old one, and finally, an outspoken [anti-capitalist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-capitalism "Anti-capitalism") whose image has been [commoditized](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodification "Commodification").

In a mixed assessment, British historian [Hugh Thomas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Thomas,_Baron_Thomas_of_Swynnerton "Hugh Thomas, Baron Thomas of Swynnerton") opined that Guevara was a "brave, sincere and determined man who was also obstinate, narrow, and dogmatic".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKellner1989106_315-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellner1989106-315">[315]</a></sup> At the end of his life, according to Thomas, "he seems to have become convinced of the virtues of violence for its own sake", while "his influence over Castro for good or evil" grew after his death, as Fidel took up many of his views.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKellner1989106_315-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKellner1989106-315">[315]</a></sup> Similarly, the Cuban-American sociologist [Samuel Farber](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Farber "Samuel Farber") lauds Che Guevara as "an honest and committed revolutionary", but also criticizes the fact that "he never embraced socialism in its most democratic essence".<sup id="cite_ref-316"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-316">[316]</a></sup> Nevertheless, Guevara remains a national hero in Cuba, where his image adorns the 3 [peso](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_peso "Cuban peso") banknote and school children begin each morning by pledging "We will be like Che."<sup id="cite_ref-317"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-317">[317]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-318"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-318">[318]</a></sup> In his homeland of Argentina, where high schools bear his name,<sup id="cite_ref-319"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-319">[319]</a></sup> numerous Che museums dot the country and in 2008 a 3.5-metre (12 ft) bronze statue of him was unveiled in the city of his birth, Rosario.<sup id="cite_ref-320"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-320">[320]</a></sup> Guevara has been [sanctified](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctification "Sanctification") by some Bolivian campesinos<sup id="cite_ref-Tobar2004_321-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-Tobar2004-321">[321]</a></sup> as "[Saint Ernesto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara_in_popular_culture#In_religion "Che Guevara in popular culture")", who pray to him for assistance.<sup id="cite_ref-322"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-322">[322]</a></sup> In contrast, Guevara remains a hated figure amongst many in the [Cuban exile](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_exile "Cuban exile") and [Cuban American](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Americans "Cuban Americans") community of the United States, who view him as "the butcher of [La Cabaña](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Caba%C3%B1a "La Cabaña")".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTECasey2009235,_325_323-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-FOOTNOTECasey2009235,_325-323">[323]</a></sup> Despite this polarized status, a high-contrast [monochrome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monochrome "Monochrome") graphic of [Che's face](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrillero_Heroico "Guerrillero Heroico"), created in 1968 by Irish artist [Jim Fitzpatrick](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Fitzpatrick_(artist) "Jim Fitzpatrick (artist)"), became a universally [merchandized](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchandising "Merchandising") and objectified image,<sup id="cite_ref-324"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-324">[324]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-325"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-325">[325]</a></sup> found on an endless array of items, including T-shirts, hats, posters, tattoos, and bikinis,<sup id="cite_ref-326"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_note-326">[326]</a></sup> contributing to the [consumer culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_capitalism "Consumer capitalism") Guevara despised.

"Because of the circumstances in which I traveled, first as a student and later as a doctor, I came into close contact with poverty, hunger and disease; with the inability to treat a child because of lack of money; with the stupefaction provoked by the continual hunger and punishment, to the point that a father can accept the loss of a son as an unimportant accident, as occurs often in the downtrodden classes of our American homeland. And I began to realize at that time that there were things that were almost as important to me as becoming famous or making a significant contribution to medical science: I wanted to help those people."

"The inflow of capital from the developed countries is the prerequisite for the establishment of economic dependence. This inflow takes various forms: loans granted on onerous terms; investments that place a given country in the power of the investors; almost total technological subordination of the dependent country to the developed country; control of a country's foreign trade by the big international monopolies; and in extreme cases, the use of force as an economic weapon in support of the other forms of exploitation."

The struggle against imperialism, for liberation from colonial or neocolonial shackles, which is being carried out by means of political weapons, arms, or a combination of the two, is not separate from the struggle against backwardness and poverty. Both are stages on the same road leading toward the creation of a new society of justice and plenty. ... Ever since monopoly capital took over the world, it has kept the greater part of humanity in poverty, dividing all the profits among the group of the most powerful countries. The standard of living in those countries is based on the extreme poverty of our countries. To raise the living standards of the underdeveloped nations, therefore, we must fight against imperialism. ... The practice of proletarian internationalism is not only a duty for the peoples struggling for a better future, it is also an inescapable necessity.

Guevara then envisioned crafting an alliance with African leaders such as Ahmed Ben Bella in Algeria, Sékou Touré in Guinea, Kwame Nkrumah in Ghana, Julius Nyerere in Tanzania, and Gamal Abdel Nasser in Egypt, to foster a global dimension to his ensuing continental revolution in Latin America.

This could only be achieved by systematic education, acquired by passing through various stages in which collective action is increased. Che recognized that this to be difficult and time-consuming. In his desire to speed up this process, however, he developed methods of mobilizing people, bringing together their collective and individual interests. Among the most significant of these instruments were moral and material incentives, while deepening consciousness as a way of developing toward socialism. See Che's speeches: _Homage to Emulation Prize Winners_ (1962) and _A New Attitude to Work_ (1964)."

133.  **[^](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#cite_ref-133 "Jump up")** Different sources cite differing numbers of executions attributable to Guevara, with some of the discrepancy resulting from the question of which deaths to attribute directly to Guevara and which to the regime as a whole. [Anderson 1997](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#CITEREFAnderson1997) gives the number specifically at La Cabaña prison as 55 (p. 387.), while also stating that "several hundred people were officially tried and executed across Cuba" as a whole (p. 387). ([Castañeda 1998](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#refCasta%C3%B1eda1998)) notes that historians differ on the total number killed, with different studies placing it as anywhere from 200 to 700 nationwide (p. 143), although he notes that "after a certain date most of the executions occurred outside of Che's jurisdiction" (p. 143). These numbers are supported by the opposition-based [_Free Society Project / Cuba Archive_](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#refFreeSoc), which gives the figure as 144 executions ordered by Guevara across Cuba in three years (1957–1959) and 105 "victims" specifically at La Cabaña, which according to them were all "carried out without due process of law". Of further note, much of the discrepancy in the estimates between 55 versus 105 executed at La Cabaña revolves around whether to include instances where Guevara had denied an appeal and signed off on a death warrant, but where the sentence was carried out while he traveled overseas from 4 June to 8 September, or after he relinquished his command of the fortress on 12 June 1959.
