## Non-fiction books about very specific topics?

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/1043gyd/nonfiction_books_about_very_specific_topics/](https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/1043gyd/nonfiction_books_about_very_specific_topics/)

> IDK how to make this request without sounding goofy but i love non-fiction that dive deep into very specific things like:
> 
> * Butts: A Backstory by Heather Radke - gives the science of the musculature, the history of human obsession and repulsion surrounding butts, butts in fashion and pop culture 
> * Let's Get Physical: How Women Discovered Exercise and Reshaped the World by Danielle Friedman - gives an overview of how outlooks on phsyical fitness changed over time in the western world
> * Semicolon: The Past, Present, and Future of a Misunderstood Mark by Cecelia Watson - a whole book about ;
> 
> i'm not looking for memoirs, or literary non-fiction, histories or biographies. i would guess that this is just like "pop non-fiction" but searching that phrase yields too broad results

	Haven't read this yet, only been wanting to, but *Salt: A World History* by Mark Kurlansky. Mary Roach's books might also suit.

	* 🟨 **[RichCorinthian](https://www.reddit.com/user/RichCorinthian)** ⬆️ 5 _(2023-01-05 15:40:06)_

		Came here to recommend *Gulp* by Mary Roach; a tour of the human GI tract. Start with the mouth and end up learning about Elvis' mega-colon that probably killed him.

* 🟩 **[lnmzq](https://www.reddit.com/user/lnmzq)** ⬆️ 9 _(2023-01-05 13:02:41)_

	[This list ](https://bookriot.com/must-read-microhistory-books/) of 50 must-read microhistory books from Book Riot might be helpful. It has Salt by Mark Kurlansky, Mary Roach, and several other authors.

	* 🟨 **[Beth_Bee2](https://www.reddit.com/user/Beth_Bee2)** ⬆️ 3 _(2023-01-05 22:37:54)_

		Fabulous list includes many of my favorites! Picked up a couple of new ones to look for. And thanks for the term "microhistory." Apparently I have a favorite genre.

		Stiff by Mary Roach (as you mentioned) as well as Bonk (same author) are both books in this genre that have been recommended to me.

* 🟩 **[Speywater](https://www.reddit.com/user/Speywater)** ⬆️ 5 _(2023-01-05 11:58:38)_

	Two by John McPhee come to mind: *The Survival of the Bark Canoe* and *Uncommon Carriers.*  I have also heard that *Founding Fish* is very good, but haven't read it yet.

	* 🟨 **[SemiEmployedTree](https://www.reddit.com/user/SemiEmployedTree)** ⬆️ 2 _(2023-01-05 16:40:13)_

		Pretty much everything  by McPhee fits. I would add to the list Oranges, The Deltoid Pumpkinseed, and La Place deConcord.

	I don’t know if these will be specific enough for you, but check out the author John McPhee. He picks a topic, researches it extensively, but not just by reading about it, he goes out into the world and interviews experts, scientists, historians, etc, and spends time in the field interacting with them and with the topic. He then writes about the topic in depth but includes the story of his research and the people he encountered. I’ve read three of his books and they were all wonderful. I can remember the name of two. The Founding Fish, about shad and shad fishing and its importance in the early years of the US. In Uncommon Carriers he writes about a few specific types of freight carriers—one is captaining a river barge, and another is a long-haul trucker. He has a unique way of not just telling you about the topic, but immersing you in it from a very human perspective.
