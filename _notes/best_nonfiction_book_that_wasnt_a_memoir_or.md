	**Endurance:  Shackleton's Incredible Voyage** and it's not even close.  This was an amazing book and I was just blown away.

	I listened to it on Audible last month on my drive from Michigan to Oregon, and it was just insane (in a good way).

	* 🟨 **[anothercuppaforme](https://www.reddit.com/user/anothercuppaforme)** ⬆️ 4 _(2023-12-14 06:39:23)_

		This is my top book for the year too.  Picked it up not expecting too much and devoured it over two nights.  Really well written book about the desperate, and seemingly hopeless situation they were in.

	* 🟨 **[metzgie1](https://www.reddit.com/user/metzgie1)** ⬆️ 5 _(2023-12-14 07:46:23)_

		Me too! I wonder why so many people picked it up this year? I absolutely loved it. It's the first book that I ever gave a literal fist pump at the end: 
		
		”My name is Shackleton,” he replied in a quiet voice. Again there was silence. Some said that Sørlle turned away and wept.”

		* 🟧 **[jwalkrufus](https://www.reddit.com/user/jwalkrufus)** ⬆️ 3 _(2023-12-15 06:26:25)_

			Well, I've never read the physical book, but I'm sure it's great.
			
			Listening to it was amazing, though.  The narrator was excellent.  I listened while driving long distance and it made it go by like nothing.  After each stop for gas, rest stop or whatever, I was always excited to hit play and continue the book.  I just couldn't wait to find out what happened next.
			
			The crazy thing is that when I pulled into my parking spot after a few days on the road, there was literally only about 10 seconds left on the book - like the last sentence or two.

	Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty

	[**Entangled Life: How Fungi Make Our Worlds, Change Our Minds And Shape Our Futures** by Merlin Sheldrake](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52668915)

	this book is so fucking cool. i had no idea how vital fungi was to literally everything in our every day life. this book has some of the craziest shit i've ever read that at times it felt like i was reading fiction. this is sooooo soooo good and was an absolute 5 star read!

	the audiobook is also very good and is narrated by the author. his voice is so calm and soothing that sometimes i put it on at night just to lull myself to sleep.

			awesome! i'd love to hear what you think about it after you read it! i highly recommend you read it by hard copy because there are lots of pictures, and i think there is a new illustrated edition that has already been  or is coming out, but it's a bit pricey (to me) at $40.00. i've only seen it online, but i think it might be one of those chunky coffee table books.

	* 🟨 **[Glossy___](https://www.reddit.com/user/Glossy___)** ⬆️ 4 _(2023-12-14 08:02:26)_

		Okay I'm reading this right now and tried the audiobook and hated it because he doesn't seem nearly as excited as I am. He's explaining cordyceps in this soothing voice and meanwhile as I read it, my inner monologue is adding exclamation points because it's all SO COOL

* 🟩 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 11 _(2023-12-14 03:22:01)_

	While it seems vaguely inappropriate to refer to this book as my *favorite* given its subject matter, I think that everybody ought to read *A Woman in Berlin: Eight Weeks in the Conquered City*, which chronicles the post-WW2 occupation of Berlin by the Soviet military. The book had to be published anonymously because the atrocities committed by the occupying army were considered shameful to Germany and taboo to discuss. The author’s identity was only released posthumously, fifty years after the book’s initial publication. Impossible to overstate the bravery it took to write.

	American Made: What Happens to People When Work Disappears. I liked it because I learned a lot about blue-collar workers with lives very different from mine.

	Midnight in Chernobyl-Adam Higgenbottom

	Atoms and Ashes-Serhii Plokhy

	The Death of a Solider as Told by his Sister-Olesya Kromeychuk

	* 🟨 **[DarwinZDF42](https://www.reddit.com/user/DarwinZDF42)** ⬆️ 7 _(2023-12-14 06:34:17)_

		Midnight at Chernobyl was incredible. You’d probably also enjoy Plokhy’s book on Chernobyl and also “Atomic Accidents” by James Mahaffey.

		* 🟧 **[Briarfox13](https://www.reddit.com/user/Briarfox13)** ⬆️ 1 _(2023-12-14 10:48:26)_

			I've read Plokhy's book on Chernobyl, it's probably my favourite on the subject. 
			
			Thanks for the recommendation, I'll definitely hunt down Mahaffey's book. Thank you!

	Ejaculate Responsibly by Gabrielle Stanley Blair. As someone who considers themselves fairly well versed in abortion rights and gender equality, a lot of the arguments in this book were still extremely eye opening, simply explained, and very compelling.

	I quite liked all of my non-fiction choices for 2023, tough to pick one since they cover quite diverse topics. So, I'll share a top 5 in no particular order...  

	* **Phantoms in the Brain** by V.S. Ramachandran

	This had been on my TBR for a long time, so I had to do quite a lot of research to see what has happened recently on certain neuroscience themes, but still a good book regardless for a non-expert. 

	&amp;#x200B;

	* **What If ? 2** by Randall Munroe

	Big xkcd nerd, love everything about it.

	&amp;#x200B;

	* **These seats are reserved - Caste, Quotas and the Constitution of India** by Abhinav Chandrachud

	Good review of the caste conundrum in India; highly recommend for anyone interested in our diversity/issues, but take note that it reads more as a thesis. I'd have also expected a more extensive take by the author, given his expertise, on how the reservation problem could be tackled going forward.

	&amp;#x200B;

	* **Long Way Round** by Ewan McGregor

	I love an occasional travelogue and I'm glad I picked this one for 2023, especially given the stories in Central Asia. Looking forward to catch the other journeys by Ewan and Charley.

	&amp;#x200B;

	* **Around the World in 80 Books** by David Damrosch

	Prof. Damrosch is an expert on comparative literature, which is effectively the core theme of this book as the title says. I have read only the chapters for the books I have read so far, and I want to keep it that way. So it is highly unlikely I would ever actually finish this book, but a nice resource from an academic interest with multiple parallels.

	* 🟨 **[dipdream](https://www.reddit.com/user/dipdream)** ⬆️ 2 _(2023-12-16 21:35:10)_

		Hi friend, I’m just about to start Phantoms in the Brain or Tell-Tale Brain. Would you recommend to skip Phantoms as it’s so outdated?

		* 🟧 **[jyothishraj](https://www.reddit.com/user/jyothishraj)** ⬆️ 3 _(2023-12-17 02:42:13)_

			Hi, I haven't read The Tell-Tale Brain yet so I really can't comment which topics it improves on from Phantoms in the brain, in the sense that one can substitute for the other. But from what I have read, Phantoms in brain is still relevant for many of its case studies and notes on historical progress of the field. So if you like reading on those aspects, it is still a fantastic book. Only thing I emphasize is that to not think of it as a final word on our current understanding of the brain.
			
			I guess if you just want to read one now, read The Tell-Tale Brain, and if he mentions/refers any specific study from the previous book, you can always look it up online (or read those excerpts). Maybe someone who has read both can comment !

	A Short History of Almost Everything - Bill Bryson

	Factual, well written, jargon free and amusing!!

	This touches on everything and constantly lead me into leaving the book to go off down a sideline rabbit hole of personal research when something itched my curiosity bone..

	* 🟨 **[vada_buffet](https://www.reddit.com/user/vada_buffet) (OP)** ⬆️ 3 _(2023-12-14 02:49:34)_

	* 🟨 **[ipicu](https://www.reddit.com/user/ipicu)** ⬆️ 2 _(2023-12-14 11:37:37)_

		I did like this book as well, but a take on the same subject that I liked better was Origin Story by David Christian. It doesn't have the humor of the Bryson book, but the science is better integrated and I love his construction of it as a science version of the origin myths that all cultures seem to have.

* 🟩 **[Hoppy_Croaklightly](https://www.reddit.com/user/Hoppy_Croaklightly)** ⬆️ 7 _(2023-12-14 00:57:01)_

	Finished it today; [The Invention of God](https://www.amazon.com/Invention-God-Thomas-Römer/dp/0674504976) by Thomas Römer; a really great study of the development of monotheism from polytheism in Ancient Israel. The reviews that mention the strengths of the book as a synthesis are spot-on; the author brings together lots of data points (Kuntillet Ajrud inscriptions, hints in the Biblical text, treaty language) to try to chart the emergence of YHWH over historical time. There's speculation, as there always is, but overall, the book is sober and detailed; I wanted it to be longer.

* 🟩 **[ifthisisausername](https://www.reddit.com/user/ifthisisausername)** ⬆️ 8 _(2023-12-14 06:02:05)_

	The Dawn of Everything by David Graeber &amp; David Wengrow: an exploration of how ancient tribes lived based on new anthropological evidence suggesting that their societies were far more politically complex than we thought and that the discovery of the Americas and the ways in which Native American tribes organised was actually a significant influence on Enlightenment thought in Europe. Really fascinating stuff that gets into the birth of agriculture and cities as well as the political implications of all this for modern thought. 

	Doppelganger by Naomi Klein: a reckoning with the "mirror world" of conspiracy theory and post-truth and how the somewhat deranged communities on social media are eroding truth.

	*Wordslut: A Feminist Guide to Taking Back the English Language* by Amanda Montell - I’m a sucker for sociolinguistics and this was so fascinating! Definitely didn’t know the origin of the word “hussy” was simply housewife that was then turned derogatory later on!

	*Hello I Want to Die Please Fix Me* by Anna Mehler Paperny - this one is part memoir but the majority of the focus after the first few chapters is an investigative deep dive into mental health care within Canada and the US, and was very well researched

	*American Crusade: How the Supreme Court is Weaponizing Religious Freedom* by Andrew L Seidel - very informative, well researched and eye opening, but also incredibly frustrating due to the subject matter

	I really enjoyed reading some medieval history (of England) recently. I was leery of it as I thought it could be  boring, but it was not so. Instead it was fascinating. The two I read were: 

	A Brief History of Life in the Medieval Ages by Martin Whittock. 

	Life in a Medieval Village by Gies

	Alternately, I have read several books by Hampton Sides all of which were great. Two in particular are: Hellhound on His Trail is about tracking down Martin Luther King’s assassin and Blood and Thunder is (mostly) about the life and adventures of Kit Carson in America’s Wild West. 

	If you are interested in math at all check out the books of Paul J Nahin which are all great.

	Not a joke answer: Wikipedia.

	It’s been given so much contempt by academics over the years, and it’s so easy to take it for granted, but it’s the first place I look if I want the basic facts about something else I’ve read. Several people in this thread have talked about ‘diving down a rabbit hole’ after reading something they’ve paid for, and I’ll bet every single one of those began with a Wikipedia page. I think it’s safe to say it’s finally living up to the promise of what it was always trying to be.

	I promise I’ve got nothing to do with Wikipedia or its Foundation! But if anyone reading this thinks “you’re right - it *is* an amazing resource”, please consider donating a few pennies to keep it freely accessible worldwide. I must spend at least £50 on books every year, and even sending 1% of that to Wikipedia makes a huge difference if enough of us do it. There are millions of people in the world who use it from countries where 0.50 £, € or $ is a week’s wage. We can’t expect them to pay for it, but they’re the ones who benefit most, need it most, and actually use it for more important things than finding out (aged 40) that the cotton gin wasn’t a drink.

						Ok okay I didn’t know that. So I guess this nonfiction book rec is in the format of a comic book. I’m going to have to check it out. Sounds interesting

					Oh, of course. My brain just processed “graphic novel” as the catchall term for the comic-style format. And usually I’m the first one arguing when someone calls a narrative nonfiction book a “novel”! I am properly chastened

	"The Origin of Species" by Charles Darwin

	Pretty easy to understand and follow, but it stuns me how smart Darwin was. 

	Ofc he didn't come up with everything on his own, but the fact that he could put 2 and 2 together AND express it all in language so simple and easy to follow that even a non-native English speaker from ~200 years in the future can understand it is astonishing to me.

	Sea People: The Puzzle if Polynesia by Christina Thompson. It explores how Polynesia was settled as best as we known it’s a fascinating story and the book is very engaging. 

	Invisible Women: Exposing Data Bias in a World Designed for Men. I recommend this often. It’s a fascinating (and infuriating) look at how omitting women from research and design impacts everyone. 

	Stiff by Mary Roach. She’s a humorous science writer and this book explores what happens to our bodies after death. She includes crash test dummies, medical research, and more. 

	And I’ll also add another vote for Endurance.
