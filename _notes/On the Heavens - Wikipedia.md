_**On the Heavens**_ (Greek: _Περὶ οὐρανοῦ_; Latin: _De Caelo_ or _De Caelo et Mundo_) is [Aristotle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle")'s chief [cosmological](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological "Cosmological") treatise: written in 350 BC,<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (March 2024)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> it contains his astronomical theory and his ideas on the concrete workings of the terrestrial world. It should not be confused with the spurious work _[On the Universe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Universe "On the Universe")_ (_De Mundo_, also known as _On the Cosmos_).

This work is significant as one of the defining pillars of the Aristotelian worldview, a school of philosophy that dominated intellectual thinking for almost two millennia. Similarly, this work and others by [Aristotle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle") were important seminal works from which much of [scholasticism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholasticism "Scholasticism") was derived.

## Argument [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=On_the_Heavens&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Argument")

According to Aristotle in _De Caelo_, the heavenly bodies are the most perfect realities, (or "substances"), whose motions are ruled by principles other than those of bodies in the [sublunary sphere](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublunary_sphere "Sublunary sphere"). The latter are composed of one or all of the four [classical elements](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_element "Classical element") ([earth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_(classical_element) "Earth (classical element)"), [water](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_(classical_element) "Water (classical element)"), [air](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_(classical_element) "Air (classical element)"), [fire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_(classical_element) "Fire (classical element)")) and are perishable; but the matter of which the heavens are made is imperishable [aether](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aether_(classical_element) "Aether (classical element)"), so they are not subject to [generation and corruption](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Generation_and_Corruption "On Generation and Corruption"). Hence their motions are eternal and perfect, and the perfect motion is the circular one, which, unlike the earthly up-and down-ward locomotions, can last eternally selfsame - an early predecessor to [Newton's First Law of Motion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_First_Law_of_Motion "Newton's First Law of Motion"). Aristotle theorized that aether did not exist anywhere on Earth, but that it was an element exclusive to the heavens. As substances, celestial bodies have matter (aether) and form (a given period of uniform rotation). Sometimes Aristotle seems to regard them as living beings with a rational soul as their form<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Heavens#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> (see also _[Metaphysics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics_(Aristotle) "Metaphysics (Aristotle)")_, bk. XII).

Aristotle proposed a geocentric model of the universe in _De Caelo_. The Earth is the center of motion of the universe, with circular motion being perfect because Earth was at the center of it. There can be only one center of the universe, and as a result there are no other inhabited worlds within it besides Earth. As such the Earth is unique and alone in this regard. Aristotle theorized that beyond the sublunary sphere and the heavens is an external spiritual space that mankind cannot fathom directly.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Heavens#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>

Aristotle also argued for the view that the following six directions exist as human-independent realities, not just relative to us: left, right, up, down, front, and back.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Heavens#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> This is an important part of his theory that the heavens move always in one direction<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Heavens#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> and with no irregularities.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Heavens#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

Much of _De Caelo_ is concerned with refuting the views of his predecessors. For example, Aristotle sets his eyes multiple times on the analyses of weight given by the Pythagoreans and Plato in the _Timaeus_.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Heavens#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>

## Historical connections [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=On_the_Heavens&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Historical connections")

Aristotelian philosophy and cosmology were influential in the Islamic world, where his ideas were taken up by the [Falsafa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsafa "Falsafa") school of philosophy throughout the later half of the first millennia AD. Of these, philosophers [Averroes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Averroes "Averroes") and [Avicenna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicenna "Avicenna") are especially notable. Averroes in particular wrote extensively about _De Caelo_, trying for some time to reconcile the various themes of Aristotelian philosophy, such as natural movement of the elements and the concept of planetary spheres centered on the [Earth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"), with the mathematics of [Ptolemy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy").<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Heavens#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> These ideas would remain central to philosophical thought in the Islamic world well into the pre-modern period, and its influences can be found in both the theological and mystical tradition, including in the writings of [al-Ghazali](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ghazali "Al-Ghazali") and [Fakhr al-Din al-Razi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fakhr_al-Din_al-Razi "Fakhr al-Din al-Razi").

[Thomas Aquinas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas "Thomas Aquinas") and [Averroes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Averroes "Averroes")

European philosophers had a similarly complex relationship with _De Caelo_, attempting to reconcile church doctrine with the mathematics of [Ptolemy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy "Ptolemy") and the structure of Aristotle. A particularly cogent example of this is in the work of [Thomas Aquinas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas "Thomas Aquinas"), theologian, philosopher and writer of the 13th century. Known today as St. Thomas of the [Catholic Church](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church "Catholic Church"), Aquinas worked to synthesize Aristotle's cosmology as presented in _De Caelo_ with Christian doctrine, an endeavor that led him to reclassify Aristotle's [unmoved movers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmoved_mover "Unmoved mover") as angels and attributing the 'first cause' of motion in the celestial spheres to them.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Heavens#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> Otherwise, Aquinas accepted Aristotle's explanation of the physical world, including his cosmology and physics.

The 14th-century French philosopher [Nicole Oresme](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Oresme "Nicole Oresme") translated and commented on _De Caelo_ in his role as adviser to [King Charles V](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_V_of_France "Charles V of France") of France, on two occasions, once early on in life, and again near the end of it. These versions were a traditional Latin transcription and a more comprehensive French version that synthesized his views on cosmological philosophy in its entirety, _Questiones Super de Celo_ and _Livre du ciel et du monde_ respectively. _Livre du ciel et du monde_ was written at the command of King Charles V, though for what purpose remains of some debate. Some speculate that, having already had Oresme translate Aristotelian works on ethics and politics in the hope of educating his courtiers, doing the same with _De Caelo_ may be of some value to the king.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Heavens#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>
