## CMV: Gender Dysphoria is a cureable mental illness, we've stopped looking for the cure because society is now forced into accepting transgenders.

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/f2ol3f/cmv_gender_dysphoria_is_a_cureable_mental_illness/](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/f2ol3f/cmv_gender_dysphoria_is_a_cureable_mental_illness/)

> I know this is a big yikes to post in 2020, but I am posting this because I truely want my view to be changed. I know it is offensive to a lot of people. I have only met one transgender in my entire life and my view is probably mostly based on this person, let's call her Lana, and on the transgenders you see on the television.
> 
> Lana was male till the age of 19, where he told me he thought he was a girl. It was a very surreal moment for me, he had a huge beard and manly structure and there he sat, telling me he felt like he was a girl. I knew for sure he was joking (we had a habit of making fucked up jokes) so i bursted out in laughter. He told me again and added that he wanted to start progressing into a female. This was 7 years ago.
> 
> I knew Lana has been dealing with mental illness her entire life. She had a very rough childhood due to undiagnosed autism, adhd and depression. For some reason I connected that in my head to her becoming a transgender; She had undiagnosed problems and concluded that she didn't fit in because she wasn't in the right body. Writing this out makes my face turn red a little because i know thoughts like these are heavily frowned upon, but it is what i currently truely believe. I think proper therapy could have been a solution to let him deal with his past and feel comfortable and confident about who he is. I don't think mutilating body and everyone acting like she's a girl should be an acceptable cure.
> 
> Every time I see people on television interacting with transgenders, they seem very  disingenuous to me. Patronizing, almost. *Wow, you're so brave and stunning.* Thoughts that come to mind are: For gods sake, stop playing along, this person is suffering and needs serious mental help, not to be put on a pedestal. I feel the same whenever Im near Lana and out of respect, I've distanced myself from her. I don't want to offend her, and i don't want to play along / support what i think is a cureable illness. I've studied Social Work Childcare, which probably plays part in why i think like i do.
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> I'm sure that if Lana wasn't bullied as much as she was, he would've felt more like he fit in. I'm convinced that his autism, adhd, and depression, next to not fitting in, made him feel feminine, and more distanced to his masculinity.
> 
> Please change my view.
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> Edit: Thanks reddit, you've done it.  **Gender Dysphoria** is a mental illness for which currently the best available treatment is transitioning.
> 
> Edit2: I'm surpised at how much this blew up. When I wrote this post, I was very uninformed and filled with assumptions regarding gender dysphoria. Thank you to everyone who commented with personal stories, information, statistics, researches and all the sources to back them up. They have changed my view, and based from the pms and comments I've read, they've changed many other people's views too.

	There is something known as the social model of disability that applies here.  Being deaf for instance is generally considered a disability, but if society were set up such that we didn’t use sound as our primary means of communication than being deaf would not have any negative impacts on a person’s life and it would no longer be classified as a disability.  This applies with mental illness as well, something is only a mental illness if it causes significant distress in a person’s life by definition.  What is and isn’t a mental illness is a rather arbitrary line to draw and some of it is dependent on what society is willing to accept and accommodate.  This means that one could eradicate a mental illness by changing society, that is entirely possible.

	Mental illness treatment is a rather tricky thing in general.  It usually involves a lifetime of medication and a various forms of therapy that can only ever lessen the problems while only occasionally producing anything resembling a cure in a minority of people.  That is the current level that mental illness treatment is at.  If you consider gender dysphoria a mental illness though, compare that to what happens when people transition.  It cuts suicide attempts by an order of magnitude.  Post-op trans people still have a higher suicide rate than the general population by a couple percent, but that’s still an order of magnitude better than the nearly 50% pre-op suicide rate.  As mental illness treatments go, transitioning has insanely good almost perfect results.  People would kill to have something even half that effective for anxiety and depression.  The higher post-op suicide rate than the general population is fully explainable as a result of people not accepting them including often their own family.

	Transitioning saves lives, that’s just an objective fact.  Trans acceptance is suicide prevention.  The only reason to not do it would be if it also has consequences that are somehow worse than the thing it prevents.  I can’t even think of a single negative consequence though, let alone one worse than avoiding a proven suicide prevention measure.  Calling sex reassignment surgery “mutilation” is misleading at best.  It’s a cosmetic operation done in a starile hospital room under anesthetic by a trained surgeon, not a schizophrenic castrating himself with a rusty knife.  If that’s the standard for calling something “mutilation” than a hip replacement is “bone mutilation” and open heart surgery is “chest mutilation”.  If you are worried about children transitioning, people have thought of that.  Although transphobes will often call it “chemical castration” in their usual fear mongering way, puberty blockers only postpone puberty for as long as a person is on them and the moment they stop taking them things resume as normal.  Nobody is seriously suggesting doing anything irreversible to anyone under 18.

	Homosexuality was once considered a mental illness too.  However, people realized that they were freaking out about nothing and that everyone is better off when nobody goes out of their way to cause active harm in order to prevent a harmless action.  That is happening again with trans people, though that movement has been consistently a few years behind gay and lesbian acceptance.

	I should probably clarify where I’m coming from here.  I’m the son of a trans women, and I dated a trans man once who I’m still close friends with to this day.  My trans-parent was sent to conversion therapy, in a move that lead to multiple suicide attempts she blamed herself for it not working and that sort of thing can put people in a really dark place.  She has since decided to embrace who she is and transition.  My trans-man friend and I have shared things with each other that nobody else on Earth knows about us.  I have known him for every step of the transition process, and I have seen his mental health improve quite a lot as a result.  He was in a really bad place when I first met him, and now he’s doing much better.

	I would also like to add that I am diagnosed with mild autism myself, and I have problems with the way you seem to think of that sort of thing.  I don’t know if this is intentional or if you’ve just spent too long around transphobic rhetoric (I’m going to assume the latter), but the tactic of comparing gender dysphoria to mental illness only serves to pin the existing stigma associated with mental illness to being transgender.  It’s an appeal to ableism, basically.  Calling it a mental illness changes nothing though.  Mentally ill people still deserve a basic level of decency, the right to express themselves, and freedom from bullying.  The word “delusional” is often carelessly thrown around in relation to transgender people, but that is factually inaccurate based on what is known about gender dysphoria and it only serves to bring to mind stereotypes of mental illness.  I have to deal with enough ableism shit on my own, and I hate seeing it used against people I care about too.  They don’t deserve that.

		I have gotten a lot of requests to cite my sources, so I'm going to do that here as a sort of separate sources document so that I don't need to address the 200 or so comments asking about that individually.  I have read through all the comments on this thread, I still stand by everything I said and I do in fact have sources to back up every fact claim I made.  Here I will go through each major claim one by one and cite sources.
		
		>Being deaf for instance is generally considered a disability, but if society were set up such that we didn’t use sound as our primary means of communication than being deaf would not have any negative impacts on a person’s life and it would no longer be classified as a disability.
		
		I picked this example specifically because I happen to know that this is a debate within the deaf community.  Many deaf people don't like being seen as disabled because they can function just fine in society without being able to hear when they have things like subtitles, interpreters, the ability to lip read, and sign language.  When their environment is set up right, they can function perfectly.  Here is a good source for that:
		
		[https://www.verywellhealth.com/deaf-culture-deaf-disabled-both-1048590](https://www.verywellhealth.com/deaf-culture-deaf-disabled-both-1048590)
		
		>\[Transitioning\] cuts suicide attempts by an order of magnitude. Post-op trans people still have a higher suicide rate than the general population by a couple percent, but that’s still an order of magnitude better than the nearly 50% pre-op suicide rate.
		
		This is the big one that I'm writing this to address, and it needs some explanation.  I did not get my data from a single study, but from multiple of them (since I couldn't find any that directly compare pre-transition and post-transition transgender people).  I pulled from two studies in particular, read through their data tables, and did math.  I picked Sweden of all places as a place to gather data from because it seems to have the most data available, and it seems to be quite representative of other western countries.  I also had to pick an exact statistic to go with representing suicide rate, and I decided to go with the probability that a given person had attempted suicide at any point in their life.  Both studies provide this data in the same way, allowing it to easily be compared.
		
		[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5905855/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5905855/)
		
		This study shows some baseline statistics for transgender individuals in Sweden.  The data I'm interested in is not in the abstract but in the data tables, where it reports that 42% of trans men, 37% of trans women, and 31% of trans non-binary people have attempted suicide.  This data consists of a mix of pre-transition and post-transition individuals, meaning that if post-transition people have a lower suicide attempt rate than this than pre-transition people have a higher suicide attempt rate than this.  (spoiler alert: they do)  These numbers represent a medium between the two.
		
		[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3043071/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3043071/)
		
		This study is a long-term follow up on transgender individuals taking place over 30 years, taking a bunch of people who were known to be transgender in 1973 and seeing where they all ended up in 2003.  One bit of data provided in the tables is the number of people who have attempted suicide in the 30 years following their transition.  That number is 29 out of the 324 participants, which comes out to about 9% when you do the math.  That is still higher than the total average suicide rate, but it's still a massive improvement.
		
		Okay, I may have exaggerated a bit when I said that the difference is an order of magnitude.  It's not that far off though, being about a 5 fold improvement over the average that as I remind you consists of a mix of pre-transition and post-transition individuals and counts post-transition people as having attempted suicide even if they did it before they transitioned.  That's the objective data, and there really is no other explanation for it other than transitioning being the cause of reduced suicide attempt rates.
		
		>The higher post-op suicide rate than the general population is fully explainable as a result of people not accepting them including often their own family.
		
		How much a person is accepted has a massive effect on suicide rate.  If you need a citation that transgender people are often not accepted by their friends and family, I put forward the comments of this very comment thread as an example.
		
		[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19117902](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19117902)
		
		**"lesbian, gay, and bisexual young adults who reported higher levels of family rejection during adolescence were 8.4 times more likely to report having attempted suicide"**  I hope we can all at least agree that being gay, lesbian, or bisexual is not a mental illness.  Given that my claim that such things once were considered mental illnesses is one of the claims I've been asked to back up, I would think so.  The only difference between the two groups of LGB individuals is the level of family rejection, meaning that the 8.4x difference in the suicide attempt rate is entirely a result of that.  As I said in my main post, the transgender acceptance movement is a few years behind the gay acceptance movement so there is a higher level of family rejection involved.  I can tell you personally that both the trans people I'm close to have parents who aren't too thrilled about having a transgender kid to say the least.
		
		The study on the baseline statistics for transgender individuals in Sweden also supports this case, in its data it shows that trans people who have experienced more rejection and transphobia are about twice as likely to have attempted suicide at about 48% whereas those who didn't experience much if any transphobia had a suicide attempt rate of around 25%.  This kind of data is why I have no trouble believing that the remaining discrepancy is a result of social rejection, because that is a massive predictor of suicide.  Unfortunately nobody can create a study which controls for social rejection without raising people in a controlled environment like the Truman Show since society right now has a lot of transphobia, and such a study would have obvious problems getting past any ethics committee.  For now there is no way to know for sure if social rejection is the only other factor, and consequently there is no reason to suspect that it's not the only factor either.
		
		>Homosexuality was once considered a mental illness too.
		
		["Psychiatrists, in a Shift, Declare Homosexuality No Mental Illness"](https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/16/archives/psychiatrists-in-a-shift-declare-homosexuality-no-mental-illness.html)
		
		This is a New York Times headline from 1973, reporting on the American Psychiatric Association making the landmark decision to no longer consider homosexuality a mental illness.  I don't think much more needs said here.
		
		Anyway, those are the major things people were asking me to cite sources to.  If you disagree with anything, feel free to reply to this comment to bring it up.  I currently have over 300 Reddit notifications since this comment kind of exploded so I might take a while to get to you, but I promise I will get around to it.

			Hi
			
			Do you have any background in research or a higher degree? I just skimmed the articles but I already see a few issues with what you've said.
			
			You really can't compare raw numbers from studies with entirely different construction like this ([Long-Term Follow-Up of Transsexual Persons Undergoing Sex Reassignment Surgery: Cohort Study in Sweden] and [Targeted Victimization and Suicidality Among Trans People: A Web-Based Survey]). One of these was a self reported web based survey while the cohort doesn't list where it gets the suicide rates from but almost all their data appears to be from hospital discharge summaries, so I'd assume it comes from there. You can compare these rates within a single study as they use the same methodology between their cases and controls, but you can't extrapolate that to a different survey which used a different sampling technique.
			
			A good example of this is what you've shown - a lot of people would self report suicide attempts that were likely never hospitalised, which explains why the suicide rate looks much higher in the web-based survey than it does in the cohort study.
			
			Obviously this doesn't mean the alternative is true either, but that you can't really use this to argue there is objective evidence around a significant reduction in suicidality post transition.
			
			Hope this is helpful

			Do you have any sources about puberty blockers? I don’t understand how this doesn’t effect someone down the line if they decide to get off of them.

				I'm not OP. But puberty blockers probably do affect people down the line. [Here](https://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.bone.2016.11.008) is a study showing statistically significant decrease in bone turnover. [Here](https://sci-hub.tw/10.1210/jc.2014-2439) is the famous "bone density" study showing the effects of puberty blockers on lowering bone density lasting years after puberty blockers were ceased. 
				
				If you prefer news articles to journal papers, you can also read about [this Australian teenage boy](https://www.news.com.a[u/entertainment](https://www.reddit.com/user/entertainment)/tv/current-affairs/patricks-pain-i-didnt-know-who-the-person-staring-back-at-me-was/news-story/65ff86c8bfe269109f1b28cbeb93ab7a) who got on puberty blockers, regretted it, and developed permanent breasts as a result. 
				
				This being said, puberty blockers are a LOT better than forcing someone who is genuinely very dysphoric to go through puberty... a decrease in bone density and the possibility of regret has to be weighed against the massive emotional relief puberty blockers bring to most of the transgender kids that get on them. For some reason, the trans movement likes to present this stuff as though it's 100% infallibly inarguably good with zero downsides, and you were right to be skeptical, because that isn't the case.

				Not OP, but I have sources about puberty blockers:
				
				 
				
				There is *extensive* research about long term use of puberty blockers, and they have overwhelmingly been shown to be very gentle and safe.
				
				This treatment isn't just used for trans youth - it has been the standard treatment for kids with precocious puberty for decades. Most kids with precocious puberty don't have any underlying medical condition, their early development is just an extreme variation of normal development,  but it would still cause serious psychological damage to start puberty at the age of, say, 6. This treatment has no long term side effects; it just puts puberty on hold. Stop treatment, and puberty picks up where it left off.

				[Wikipedia has some good information on them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty_blocker), including parts about their risks.  There are a few mild risks, but they are considered generally safe.  It does make someone go through puberty at a later time, but that's not something the human body loses the ability to do for a really long time.  My trans-mom went through female puberty in her 40's just fine (via HRT), and I doubt even the most indecisive kids would stay on them for that long.

		Before I begin, everybody should be treated with respect and understanding and I am in no way trying to suggest otherwise when it comes to transgenders. People can do what makes them happy, but it doesn’t mean it’s always the right thing to do. Here is my counter to your post:
		
		Using deaf people as an example for the social model of disability for the subject of transitioning and transgender discussion is not effective. Being deaf is the loss of one of the five essential senses for human beings. Gender dysphoria is on a different level where the person still has full function but suffers from mental distress. It is a different and extremely more controversial topic than accommodating deaf people. In addition, this model suggests that the majority of people would have to change to accept and accommodate mental dysphoria in order to eradicate it. This is a huge feat to accomplish, especially with a controversial treatment of transition. A treatment shouldn’t have such a difficult condition to accomplish in order to have positive results. There are other treatments that need to be explored and improved to make a more practical and efficient impact. 
		
		The level of mental illness treatment is low, I agree. However, it will stay this way in terms of gender dysphoria if we keep pushing it onto society to accept transition as a treatment. Post-op suicide rate may decrease, but you’re saying that it is still above average and only by having society accept transitioning will it decrease more significantly. Again, this is a huge condition to meet in order to have positive results. Therefore, transition should not be forced to be accepted. This is a controversial treatment for a reason, and educated and rational people believe that there are better ways to help people who suffer from gender dysphoria. 
		
		Transitioning does save lives, factually. However, compared to what? This isn’t the only treatment that will do so. And I believe there are significant negative consequences of transitioning. How would someone with a mental illness know who they really are? (Like you said, mental illness is a tricky thing). Would we believe someone who has multiple personality disorder to say who they really are? No. They would need help and guidance in order to help them get their answer. I think what I’m trying to say is: it’s not about changing your physical qualities, it’s about embracing the qualities you have to achieve your purpose. I believe that this is the message that is being lost with transitioning.

			Weird ass mods are weird, so reposting:
			
			First, it is "Trans people" not "transgenders", they are not a verb. 
			
			Second, your argument seems to be that society has to change and that is difficult. That's silly, of course society has to change. You won't even notice the change and probably are unaware of dozens of changes going on right now.  
			The Gay community had high suicide rates until they got marriage equality, since then lowering to levels equal to the wider population. 
			
			You seem to think 'mental illness' means that you get all of them at once... or that minorities shouldn't be considered functional human beings?  
			The disorder is specifically the fact that the body does not match the brain's understanding, which is corrected by treatments to shift the body.
			If you think we instead need to 'change the brain', then you are unironically advocating for Conversion Therapy, which is considered torture in many nations around the world. So maybe reconsider before going down that road uninformed.

			Hey, I know you’ve already got what you wanted out of this thread, but I just want to chime in and say (as a trans woman myself) that there’s a great many transgender people who appear to be fully functioning straight cisgender people, and seem well adjusted, but are still tormented by gender dysphoria. The notion that a transgender woman is a “woman trapped in a mans body” is kind of a media fairytale, and going from one gender to another medically doesn’t change much of who you are. 
			I was a straight,  masculine guy for most of my life, but always I knew that it wasn’t what I wanted to be, I was just kind of forced to go along with it. I started transitioning because life just felt hollow, I felt detached/dissociated in general, I was somewhat suicidal, and I knew I really wanted to be a woman (mostly due to being jealous of women).  This felt a LOT like being forced to play the wrong character in a video game and not being allowed to choose - I wasn’t rejecting the game itself, but it was obvious it wasn’t my favorite character and I wasn’t enjoying it as much. Life shouldn’t feel like that.
			Transitioning made me feel much better almost immediately, and in a tangible, chemical way. I NEEDED estrogen in my system, and I don’t know why, but I felt way better within the first few weeks, even when I didn’t look any different. It was like I finally was clicking and settling into my body. It’s a physical issue, not really a mental issue in my opinion. Things like hand eye coordination and general mood have vastly improved for me, and these aren’t things that require me to dress as a woman to achieve. 
			Transgender women aren’t men in dresses, and generally don’t want to be men in dresses. We want to pass as our target gender primarily for safety reasons because the world isn’t very safe for us at the moment.

				Your description of transgender worries me. I always understood it as a strong sense of not belonging in your body. You make it sound as though just thinking “being the other gender would probably be great”, or “I’m not comfortable in my body” are reasons you might be transgender. But literally everyone I have ever talked to has, at one point or even consistently, thought that being the other gender would be better. It’s the classic, “grass is always greener on the other side”.  How are you to know if it’s just this, or an actual dysphoria if it isn’t an everyday struggle and discomfort?
				
				Also, literally everyone I have talked to is also uncomfortable in their body in one way or another. Many women are uncomfortable with their femininity, and many men find stereotypical masculinity repulsive. This also doesn’t mean they are transgendered. 
				
				I feel like, while OPs original post is obviously untrue for those with true dysphoria, there are a lot of people (especially teenagers and young adults) who think they may be transgender when they are really just like everyone else. Awkward and uncomfortable with their bodies and societies expectations. And how is one to know if you have dysphoria and transitioning would help, or if you are just feeling those normal insecurities and uncertainties that everyone feels?

				* 🟪 **[RougeAnimator](https://www.reddit.com/user/RougeAnimator)** ⬆️ 12 _(2020-02-13 00:43:43)_

					I would say that it’s that it always comes back to gender and it was more uncomfortable and strangling than I thought it was, I’d just become used to it. Prior, I kind of knew I’d always have to do it, but was in denial because taking steps towards transition seemed really extreme.
					I’m talking about night after night wishing, praying etc. to wake up the next morning the other gender, for 18+ years. There’s an order of magnitude of difference between that and a normal insecurity. I didn’t mean to make light of the reasons to transition, I just wanted to make it clear I really did my best to be a straight dude and appeared that way before, I didn’t want to transition, and was scared of going to therapy because I knew they’d pretty much lead me to transitioning, then did a complete 180 when I finally decided to go for it. My response to dysphoria was to dissociate from my body to a degree, which ruined my fast response hand eye coordination, and made me feel depressed and disconnected from my life. I felt like a robot, I didn’t have much in terms of emotional response. But I was used to it. I thought that was normal, so I did my best to be a cis guy.

						Yeah, that makes more sense to me. Most people would be lying if they said they didn’t occasionally go to bed wishing to wake up as a different gender, but that consistency and always present feeling, even if you learn to live with it, seems to be the difference. 
						
						I still worry many people may not know (both ways, some people who are trans likely dont transition because they do not know the way they feel is abnormal, and others may at least begin to transition before they realize it’s not right for them). But I feel like your clarification shows that most people should at least know something is up by the time they decide to try transitioning, so thank you for the response :)

							I have no idea what you're talking about. I'm sure everyone has entertained the idea "what if I were a ____ instead" but I have never actually *wanted* or "wished" to be a woman. I've never "gone to bed" wishing I would wake up as the opposite sex. Not occasionally. Not once.
							
							And it wouldn't matter if you were right, because...
							
							>others may at least begin to transition before they realize it’s not right for them
							
							You can't just transition on a whim! You need extensive therapy. If the therapist can't help you figure out that you're wrong about transitioning then, idk, I guess you'll have to make a mistake and learn to live with it like everyone else.
							
							The amount of concern I see for "people transitioning who aren't actually trans" is astronomical. If people put one percent of that concern towards actually trans folks they probably wouldn't be suicidal anymore. Like "oh no, you've been medically put into the wrong body, that is the worst possible thing that could ever happen to anyone on earth! We should stop that by any means necessary" vs "oh, you were born in the wrong body? Get over it, you're just crazy".

					I think it’s important for people to know about other ways dysphoria can feel besides feeling like you don’t belong in your body. I went 30 years without considering I was trans because all I knew was the “woman trapped in a man’s body” narrative and that’s not what it felt like to me. I never insisted I was a girl when I was little. I didn’t feel like a girl or a woman, I just felt unlucky that I was born male.
					
					I stumbled into /r/egg_irl last May. The weird name caught my eye first, then I checked the sidebar: memes about trans people who don’t know they’re trans yet. I didn’t know that was possible. The sidebar and posts were absolutely eye-opening. The posts resonated with me. I started questioning my cis-ness that night.
					
					It wasn’t the “trapped in the wrong body” narrative that resonated. It was always playing opposite gender characters in video games and D&amp;D. It was realizing I’d press the magic gender-changing button in a heartbeat. It was always wishing I was a girl.
					
					I put in hundreds of hours of research over the following 4 weeks. It was on my mind constantly. I got a therapist. I started a journal.
					
					I’ve been on hormones for 4.5 months now. I still do plenty of research and introspection, but it’s slowed down a lot. I’ve learned so much since May. Now that I have the language and understanding, I’ve found so much of what I did and felt in the past makes way more sense with the context of dysphoria. Being trans seems kinda obvious in hindsight.
					
					I’ve found that a lot of the negative feelings I’ve experienced for years are tied up in my dysphoria. I actually had to laugh to myself a few weeks ago when I realized, in that moment, I felt like a woman stuck in a man’s body.
					
					I don’t think wanting to be another gender necessarily means you’re trans. That was the idea I needed to hear before considering it for myself, though. If anything, the “trapped in the wrong body” narrative significantly delayed my ability to figure it out.

					You do not need to expereince gender dysphoria to be trans. It's just an \*extremely\* powerful motivator to transition or die.
					
					Consider if you will a society that accepts transpeople, a society that has actually mastered medicine for transpeople (as opposed to the practically medieval methodologies and extremely lacking data and development we've had to deal with so far) and reduced medical side effects pretty much as far as they can go.
					
					If you are comfortable with no longer biologically producing children of your own (consider: you already have some/you don't mind a partner being fertilized/adopting), what is the actual flaw with transitioning in that environment? Basically nothing, right?
					
					So I don't really see the problem with deciding to transition if you think it would be better. Realistically, your own resistance to transitioning is your major barrier to doing so. If you don't have any resistance to transitioning, maybe you're trans?
					
					\-
					
					But on a different tack, consider: There's a difference between "I think being \[other gender\] would be better", and the feeling of \*gender euphoria\*, which is the joy, bliss, excitement, etc. that can occur from being identified positively with a gender.
					
					Consider: Awkwardness aside, would you feel more excitement and joy if a friend called you an awesome man, or an awesome woman?
					
					It's a much better indicator of transness than the relatively common belief that the grass is greener.
					
					Specifically though, the best indicator of transness is that you can't get it out of your head. Which leads me to point 3:
					
					\-
					
					The Null Hypothesis. What proof do you have that you are trans? **What proof do you have that you are cis?**
					
					Transness is given a weirdly high burden of proof, due to a broad assumption that everyone is cis. Scientifically, there's no reason to assume either, there's just a statistically probable outcome.
					
					So I'd generally advise people not to doubt their feelings, but instead to examine them, and try to understand them better. Even if ultimately it's nothing to do with transness, it's still a worthwhile self-reflection. But it caused me a great deal of grief for a long time that I didn't feel "trans enough", and reflections along this vein helped me a great deal.

			You probably won't see this, but it's perfectly fine to feel feminine. Feminine/masculine descriptors are so arbitrary it's really useless. Even more so with trying to correlate being gay with being feminine. If you don't feel gay or like a female you are probably not, not to mention non-binary or bisexuality.

			Honestly? Playing the pronoun-swap game with people I had already known for years **irked the fuck out of me**, but adjusting to it turned out to give me a better sense of self, too. 
			
			Given that my own lifestyle is as alternative as it can get for someone who's cishet, let alone the lives of those close to me, that knee-jerk reaction really bothered me in a similar way it bothered you.
			
			I think it amounted to 'how dare you make me change my habits.' Of all the stupid things, right? I got a reaction because someone wants to be called by 'they' instead of 'he,' or 'he' instead of 'she.' Worse, suddenly I had to disassociate something I had '_known_' for the vast majority of my life wrt sex &amp; gender; language that was practically hard-wired into my senses that certain smells, visual or aural queues meant This Person Is A Man, or This Person Is A Woman. Could feel my blood pressure rise every time I messed it up, or someone corrected me.
			
			But was any of that really more important than supporting someone I care about? Using a different word to call them by causes me 0 physical or mental harm, yet serves to make them feel comfortable and accepted. That impact alone is huge for people, and regardless of whether or not they seek to change that in the future, make it more permanent, or if it's just a philosophical decision, that little bit goes a really long way.
			
			Funnily enough, it proved to be beneficial to me, too. I got to look at myself in a different light; see my 'masculinity' for what it was, as well as my 'femininity' (missed the boat on machismo growing up, so no surprise I didn't associate much with the same sex. Insert r/notliketheotherboys joke here). I got to embrace both a little more, see the toxic aspects of both. Despite my fluidity (I've had to let down a lot of gay boys), and almost in spite of it, I chose to keep the obvious label associated to growing facial hair and having two biometric thermometers hanging outside my body. 
			
			Fuck it, I figured, I'm a man. I'll let my behaviors and actions reflect on what that means for others, rather than let what other people think that means [control me](https://i.redd.it/a6unnkxsocy11.jpg).

				Yeah growing up I didn't consider myself very feminine at all (I learned later fitting into gender roles is something almost everyone actually grapples with and has complex feelings about) even though I'm a cis female and probably a 1.2 on the Kinsey scale.  If anything people coming around to see gender as less of a restrictive binary feels emancipatory even to people like me.

			I would like to add to this to say Homosexuality has not always been a bad thing. Ancient cultures had no problems with it. The great Spartan soldiers were raised to be with men because it promoted better brotherhood in combat. When they finally married a woman, the wife would often wear the clothes of men during sex and slowly work their way back to feminine clothes to because the men were accustomed to sleeping with men and sleeping with a woman was weird.
			
			Even some bible scholars believe the references in the bible opposing homosexuality are misunderstood from the context of the time and that the bible was condemning the rape of a man as a person would force themselves on their wife to establish power dominance.  We know from frescos discovered at Pompeii that homosexuality was common and accepted in the roman empire around the time Christ is estimated to have lived. 
			
			Homosexuality is also found in nature. Scientists surprised scientific findings that penguins will mate for life in a homosexual pairing because they feared what would happen when the knowledge became public. 
			
			Essentially the reason homosexuality, and therefore all other non-heterosexual forms of sexuality and gender expression are considered taboo these days is because of organized religion and the control of a few individuals with power who needed something as a weappn of fear to keep people needing them for forgiveness.

			To give a non gender spin to this explanation,
			
			If your body doesn't match what you want to look like, we don't generally tell people they have a mental illness for not liking what they see. We recommend shapewear we like. We talk about weight loss routines, we go shopping and find clothing that hides our bumps and bulges. We try wrinkle creams, get face lifts, weight loss surgery, book plastic surgery. Sometimes we even perform surgery to remove sections of genitals from newborns in the belief that they will have an easier time getting laid in a couple of decades. We modify our bodies to match a mental ideal all the time and none of this is considered a sign of mental illness.
			
			So my question is this OP. Why is wanting to modify your gender a mental illness in the first place? Why isn't it just a simple case of changing to something you like better?

					The most common reason for any bigotry is being uninformed/misinformed. Getting a grander perspective on different people's lives and struggles is the cure for bigotry. I grew up in a town of 1300, as white and redneck as could be. The amount of casual racism/homophobia/ you name it that I saw is astounding, looking back. But then I met and befriended gay people, black people, muslims, trans people. I learned we are all just people, trying to make it. It helped me come to terms with my own issues, and now I know that I am a trans woman. Albeit still closeted, but that mainly my perfectionism rather than any self hatred.

			If I may suggest, [u/Phill_Hermouth](https://www.reddit.com/user/Phill_Hermouth), read *Gender Diversity* by Serena Nanda (2nd edition). This short text takes an academic look at the various gender identities that exist around the world, across countries and cultures. 
			
			While we already know that heteronormative genders are predominantly Euro-American social constructs, gender identity is far more nuanced. Beyond transgender, cultures such as the indigenous nations of the Americas —such as the Mohave— may recognize 4+ genders within their societies and some nations revere these non-heteronormative persons due to skills demonstrated or spiritual connections. 
			
			The Sworn Virgins of the Balkans is another example of a unique gender identity that falls outside of heteronormative constructs. 
			
			All this is to say that not all cultures or groups define gender so narrowly nor do all see transgender people as mentally ill. 
			
			I applaud you for allowing yourself to absorb and truly consider opposing views. I hope your journey of discovery and acceptance continues successfully.

			I believe a large part of transphobia in Western cultures comes from the binary way in which Western cultures construct reality, from sex (m/f), gender (man/woman) to sexuality (hetero/homo) and on and on.  There are other cultures that do this, and they also have troubles fitting trangendered and intersex individuals into their cultures.
			
			However, many cultures aren't so binary and have more than 2 genders. North American Native cultures had 3 and sometimes 4 genders available: man, woman, manly-woman, womanly man (the latter two collectively called "two-spirit" individuals).  In these cultures, men's activities were largely outside of the camp, women's were largely inside, and the two-spirit individuals had the gender they assumed plus extra roles such as fortune telling, shamanism, etc.
			
			In such cultures, transgendered and intersex individuals are normal and natural, and fit right in.  Thus there's no discussion about their gender, just like there's no discussion about the justification for, say, a man or woman's gender.  It just is.
			
			I believe Western cultures are moving toward that.  We're realizing that sex and gender aren't black and white, and people's identities don't conform to outdated cultural ideals.  The problem with contemporary psychology is that it's based largely on Western cultural constructions of normality and health.  These aren't necessarily human universals and we should question their categorization of the human mind because the disease label can be damaging.

		Slight addendum, according to the DSM-5 dysphoria is a mental health issue. Actually being trans is not. Dysphoria are the feelings associated with certain trans persons experiences and it’s the emotional distress of not fitting in correctly to the body you are in.
		
		Some trans persons feel gender dysphoria more strongly than others or experience it differently. I have one friend who mentioned electrolysis and I assumed she meant for her 5’oclock shadow but it turns out she personally finds her leg hair the most dysphoria inducing.
		
		For some trans individuals hormone replacement therapy is the only treatment they require, others choose things like facial feminization and chest surgery (reductions in men is honestly more common than implants as women, HRT causes some breast tissue growth). One woman I know had her testicles removed to stop testosterone. A very select few will get genital reassignment because it’s risky, doesn’t always work out the way that is desired and while it makes them “look right” the individual in question loses sensation and pleasure.

		Just a side note there is a catch 22. As long as the community in which the transgender individual lives is hostile to transgender issues, it will inevitably result in a degradation of mental well being. Thus the community as a whole (majority) will perceive their transgender ness as a mental illness. That’s not to say that’s the correct point of view of course.

		> puberty blockers only postpone puberty for as long as a person is on them and the moment they stop taking them things resume as normal.
		
		This is not a proven fact and I consider it quite an egregious misrepresentation of where we are in the understanding of how puberty blockers affect people.  At the very minimum saying that continuing as normal as if they hadn't been on them is false in many cases.  For a lot of boys that choose to stay men it means they get stuck with a smaller penis.

					So let me get one thing straight- the /r/detrans community has a lot of transphobic people within it. In fact the detrans community is very much so linked up with /r/gendercritical, /r/itsafetish, and other places like it and if you read the comments you'll understand what I mean.

The entire point of the community is to let people who have been harassed, attacked, disowned, and otherwise, find a place where that doesn't happen and which they are free to come and go as they please. They don't force confused people into being trans, they give other options than the cis-normative world we live in.

					I'd also love for you to explain what you mean by this.

				Second, surgeons working in this field have an incentive to exaggerate the effectiveness of their work so as to keep their jobs.
				
				Third, only 46 surgeons were actually sampled, meaning there IS ample room for sampling errors. 46 is not statistically significant.

			Hi, trans person here who works in trans advocacy in healthcare and on the national level for my country.
			
			I have read many, many detransition narratives from that sub and elsewhere. Virtually all of them bring up huge red flags which suggest that the person should not have been greenlit for transition. So many were the result of incompetent healthcare, and psychiatrists who could have averted transition regret with just a couple or so simple questions, but didn't.
			
			There were people who had a history of sexual trauma and were worried it might have made them think they were trans, and they never had a chance to raise that, or had their concerns dismissed when they tried. There was one girl who didn't even think she was trans but wanted to go on testosterone as a form of self-harm; likewise, no one stopped her. There was another whose abusive trans partner (note: not the community at large) pressured her into believing she was trans and transitioning even though she didn't think she was trans. She lied to the doctors and got hormones and top surgery, both of which she deeply regretted. There were also people who were misdiagnosed despite clearly having other issues going on.
			
			I know someone who wanted to be a man solely so she could be strong enough to defend her mother against her abusive father, and was seriously considering transition. I know a lesbian couple who were trying to decide which of them would transition so that they could get married. (same-sex marriage is illegal here). I know of a lesbian couple who actually did go through with that, making that sacrifice for love.
			
			Those aren't trans people who regretted it. They were never trans to begin with, and notably, many of them would have said as much if doctors had tried probing just a little and if society had been less terrible.
			
			There were also trans people who fit the regular narrative and felt better after transition, but were convinced they would never be 'real' men or women and that it was pointless to keep trying. I know several who detransitioned as a result of religious conversion after they were shamed and pressured into doing so by pastors telling them they were disgusting and going to hell. There were those who found their dysphoria relieved after transition, but whose families disowned them and jobs fired them and left them homeless and suffering on the streets, and eventually they couldn't take it any more and decided to detransition in hopes of getting some semblance of a decent life back.
			
			I also personally know one person in his 40s who said he wasn't actually trans, but greatly preferred living as male (which he'd been doing for years) because it spared him the violent homophobic abuse he got for being a butch lesbian. So that's also an interesting counterpoint to the claim that if butch women wrongly transition, they will regret it. This person went into transition knowing fully he didn't identify as male, and his only regret was not starting earlier. He does experience dysphoria now, though, but considers it tolerable.
			
			Meanwhile, I know hundreds of trans people - including many youths - who were depressed and suicidal and then transitioned and are now thriving and living happy, fulfilling lives. I do not personally know anyone who detransitioned or who regrets it; all those detransition stories are ones I read online.
			
			Basically, that sub's detrans narrative of an epidemic of innocent trans youth being tricked into thinking they were trans and ruining their life with irreversible medication and surgery is really not based in reality. There are probably such cases out there, but they're the exception amongst detransitioners.
			
			The reality is much more nuanced and complicated, and the things that are often responsible for transition regret - such as inexperienced, incompetent doctors who think gender = stereotypes and who have problems distinguishing a trans person from someone who wishes to transition for questionable reasons - are exactly the things the trans movement is fighting to fix, because that benefits everybody in the long run.

			De trans is not a fair place to look for legitimate people detransing. It is largely an extension of the Gender Critical subreddit space and has many sock puppet accounts and concern trolls.
			
			On ask transgender you will often see people ask if they are trans or not. In my experience the majority of responses are along the lines of “that sounds like my experience but at the end of the day only you can say”. 
			
			The whole you aren’t a butch lesbian you are a man is something I’ve seen many gc’ers state but never actually seen, I’m sure there are a few real cases but in my experience they are heavily overstated. While there are butch lesbians who would/do identify as trans when they explore more there are plenty of butch lesbians who aren’t/would never be trans. There are even MtF butch lesbians. Few but some. The problem is that trans people often have to over compensate in order to be correctly read, or given medical treatment at all. Which is where some of these stereotypes about reinforcing gender roles comes from.

			May I add to what you said? When I was seeing a therapist for my gender identity issues years ago she told me how often younger people came to her office with the sole intent of beginning hormones. In Missouri at the time you had to see a therapist and have them write you a letter stating you absolutely are transgender and experience dysphoria before any endocrinologist would give you any hormone replacement therapy. She told me that a good majority of the people that came through had no symptoms of gender dysphoria... so she wouldn’t give them letters and they’d leave pissed off. 
			
			Hormones and surgery of course have alleviated a lot of my distress. But I can imagine that if you experience no dysphoria from the start...  beginning hormones will inevitably LEAD to dysphoria. 
			
			I think some folks may naively jump into what is cool and edgy at the time. Go to Instagram and look at the tag #ftm... you’ll see exactly what I mean.
			
			There are a lot of states now that don’t require a therapists approval to begin transition. And I don’t think people fully realize how drastic and permanent some of those changes can be.

			As a transgender person myself, I have no idea who these people are who are saying this. This has most definitely not been my experience.
			
			Transitioning is NOT a magic bullet, it still requires work, it still requires taking steps to be healthy. That often includes therapy and other medical interventions to get there.
			
			I would likely be dead by now had I not made the decision to transition when i did. My experience with other trans folks is they often feel the same way. The study that [u/Darq_At](https://www.reddit.com/user/Darq_At) references below is an indicator that such regrets are RARE. The follow on comments by others just amplify that.

		I would add one comment about the argument that trans people are “delusional”, the claim simply doesn’t make sense. For example, a person born physically male who transitions from male to female does not deny that they were born physically male. They do not deny that they were born with a penis. That isn’t the claim they are making. In fact, if they were in denial about their physical features, they would likely not suffer the distress from gender dysphoria.
		
		They know very well what physical features they have, they far know better than some random stranger does, that’s for sure. There’s no delusion on their side. There is a mismatch between features of the brain and features of the body. We can change features of the body, but we can’t change features of the brain. In this way, we can alleviate the distress from the mismatch.

			If you’re referring to the usual 40% statistic, it’s a misleading one. It was presented as “lifetime suicide attempt rate” iirc, and the way it was calculated was that if a person had attempted suicide and had transitioned, they were added to the tally. It did not take account of whether the suicide attempt had occurred before or after transition, or if suicidality was impacted by transition. It’s correct that 40% of trans people surveyed had attempted suicide, but saying that that number didn’t change after transition intentionally leads people to an incorrect conclusion.

					Yes, post-transition transgender people are still at a higher risk than cisgender people, but they are at a much lower risk than untreated, pre-transition transgender people.
					
					This makes sense. A post-chemotherapy cancer patient is still at a higher risk than a patient that has never had cancer. But the chemotherapy is still the recommended treatment to decrease their overall risk.
					
					Additionally, much of the residual suicide risk for post-transition transgender people correlates strongly with experiences of rejection by family and friends, discrimination, victimization, or violence.

					At this point it is safe to say that transition saves lives. The jury is not out on this matter. It greatly improves wellbeing, lowers suicide risk, and regrets are exceptionally rare.

		> There is something known as the social model of disability that applies here. Being deaf for instance is generally considered a disability, but if society were set up such that we didn’t use sound as our primary means of communication than being deaf would not have any negative impacts on a person’s life and it would no longer be classified as a disability.
		
		I came from outside this subreddit and normally its a big no-no to insert ones self into such a conversation as this (especially such an important one). However, I *needed* to comment here.
		
		Your example hits home for me. There is another example on the other side of that line, across from deafness, which is extremely relevant to the subject here. Anosmia and ageusia are just like deafness, except with smell (anosmia = no sense of smell) and taste (ageusia = no sense of taste). Because society **is set up such that we don't use smell or taste as our primary means of communication**, or even secondary like visual cues, or even before touch! These two are at the bottom of the sense barrel. They're in exactly the place that you suggest deafness would be in if society didn't determine it as a disability.
		
		As an anosmic I am very aware that my lack of sense of smell is disabling in many respects. Some of the ways it is disabling are surprising to those with a normal sense of smell. As I am not ageusic and haven't really studied it, I'm not sure where it sits here, but I imagine its comparable. Memory, libido, fears, physical safety, food identification, food expiration, the list goes on...
		
		Not only does this prove your example but it supports your whole message. If society required the use of smell to function within it, anosmics and ageusics would suffer greatly and we would be considered disabled. Society does not, and so we are not considered disabled in any official capacity (that I am aware of anyway) and... well we get along alright. This does not mean we are perfectly content or require no more work or effort to live a normal life than others. I can tell you it has and continues to have a significant impact on my life.
		
		In a way, anosmia and ageusia are like gender disphoria in a world that doesn't care it exists. I'm glad the world is becoming more understanding and trans acceptance is (I think?) the new normal. At least its headed that way. Not only is it good and makes us better as a society, and eventually will mean healthy happy lives for all those with gender dysphoria, it gives me a kind of hope for my own "disability".
		
		Thanks to everyone who takes the time to read this. :D

		I'm actually confused about why you got a delta for this. None of this seems to me to contradict OPs views (as stated). You have described why transitioning currently is an acceptable (the only) treatment for dysphoria, which I agree with. But it still seems to me like trasitioning (and most especially the cases which require re-assignement surgery) are less than ideal treatments. THey are major surgeries that come with lots of risks and negative downsides. 
		
		As far as I see it, dysphoria is a condition like any other health condition in that it shouldn't have any stigma attached to it. It *does* but it shouldn't, and, similarly, people who transition, which is currently the only viable treatment for that health condition, should also not be stigmatized. Trans people are people who deserve respect and being part of society just like anyone else, and the terms on which they join society are there business, not mine or anyone elses.
		
		All that being said, we as society should not look at transitioning and, especially, gender reassignment surgery and go "yup, looks good, nothing to do here". We should want to find treatments that are less risky and have fewer side effects. Maybe we will never find them, and until we do, transitioning and gender reassignement surgery should be available and de-stigmatized, but that doesn't mean we should be ok with the current state of affairs.
		
		In order to change OP's view, I would have liked to see sources showing that research into alternate treatments is ongoing. I have never heard of any, and sort of agree with OPs point. The quest to try and de-stigmatize trans people and and transitioning/reassignment surgery, which is a good thing, has had the negative side effect of preventing (or at the very least not encouraging, since I doubt the research was ever happening) research into alternative, superior treatments.

			> In order to change OP's view, I would have liked to see sources showing that research into alternate treatments is ongoing.
			
			How would you ethically perform this research?
			
			If I have a cure for depression that works on 99.72% of depressed people, but it has a side effect of giving them the hiccups for three hours, how do we ethically test for a 'better' cure that might exist without the hiccups?
			
			Transitioning is the go-to fix for 99.72% of cases. 0.28% detransition - which is basically just stopping hormones because it wasn't right for them. 
			
			The problem is that 0.28% of 1% of a medically treated population isn't enough for a substantial sample size, and the new treatment is experimental at best, and the side-effects will be effectively unknown. So how would someone justify experimenting on these people who, quite possibly were misdiagnosed, or changed their mind, and might not even want treatment for the condition anymore?
			
			Medicine is full of 'good enough' because of how it intersects with 'do no harm'. Sometimes, cross-sectional studies can note interactions in medicine in certain subgroup populations that allow us to refine things down, but as far as medical treatments go, transitioning is absolutely amazing at what it does for the cost and side effects. The problem isn't the medicine - it's the cultural and societal response.
			
			> negative side effect of preventing (or at the very least not encouraging, since I doubt the research was ever happening) research into alternative, superior treatments.
			
			Do you think that people just discovered transitioning in a vacuum? Of course there were 'alternative treatments'. This one worked. Up until a year ago, people were still practicing the 'alternative treatment' of conversion therapy, where they torture people until they believe they're ~~straight~~ their gender assigned at birth.

		I’m a child of the 90s. We grew up thinking that acceptance was a great thing. Racial, gender equality, LGBT. It’s been all good. Then the pendulum swung somewhere in the last few years and the left started to get super super rabid about not accepting dissenting views. It pushed a fairly liberal me to kind of question things, and I started in the last couple years, in my mid 30s, to start questioning things to the point I kind of ended up where OP was.
		
		And it’s not comfortable thinking of yourself as really accepting, but then feeling the way OP does, oartly because of messaging and things in the world. I mean I work with a few trans people and I use their preferred pronouns but ultimately do I kind of think it’s BS? Yeah. Gay I get, trans I don’t. I kind of identify with something I read Rupaul said (I think) ... basically drag makes fun of gender and social definitions and deemphasizes it’s magnitude of importance, while trans is actually the polar opposite and overemphasizes it. That clicked with me and really solidified that yeah, this forced acceptance of trans is kind of bullshit.

	Some neuroendrocrinology (brain and hormones interactions) study and case show that a brain can be masculine in a body otherwise feminine (physically, genetically and hormonaly) and the opposite too.

	It can happen because the processes structurally differentiating the brain are different than those differentiating the genital organs (both are hormones dependant but the brain ones are trickier and so more prone to alteration)

	The brain (or behavioural) sex is actually composite and consists of sexual (gender) identity and attraction to female or male.

	Biologically speaking there isn't homosexual vs heterosexual but instead gynosexual (attraction to female) and androsexual (attraction to men). Less is known about bisexuality.

	The brain sex can't be changed once the individual is born because this sexual differentiation (like genital differentiation) happens and is decided before birth. And after that any hormone treatment only has a behavior activating activity on the brain/behaviours and not a structuring one.

	My source is a book published in french named "Quand le cerveau devient masculin" (when the brain becomes masculine) written by a Belgian Neuroendocrinologist (actually specialised in birds) named Jacques Balthazart and actually still researching in this subject. He is the director of a university research team on the subject. His studies are in english

	His book is a review of the subject wich starts with animals findings and ends with humans one. With fewer about humans because knowledge can't come from experimentation because of ethical issues. But he is very careful to only conclude what is possible from this small data.

	Mental illness are actually just neurological ones.

	In conclusion I'd like to show a double standard/ absurd version of your statement:

	"Diabetes is an auto-immune disease. We stopped looking for an actually cure because society is forcing us to accept people needing insulin shot"

			Yeah it's actually really interesting. Humans seem like a masterful design, with a soul and a distinct mind, but we're actually a pretty holistically meshed blob of cells. My brain in the womb was exposed to more androgens, something that can happen by mistake in development. It means my entire nervous system is male, and everything that entails. Logically, one tries to argue that the physical form is a shell for the mind. I should be a meat robot, and that I was born in this female body (breasts, no beard etc) should be meaningless, but humans are more basic than that. The disconnect in signals my nervous system was getting from having "breasts" and "no dick" was instinctually stressful.

			Actually me saying something resembling "female brain male body" was a mistake, orver simplification.
			
			Actually there's no male or female brain but some brain area and brain conductivity are statistically sexually differentiated.
			
			Some of those sexually differentiated area are known (by cases and experimental studies) in animals to play a role in sexually differentiated behavior. In human, cases study have highlighted correlation between sexually differentiated area and gender identity compounds (identity itself and sexual preferences and there's little evidence for causation (certain causation is hard to obtain when you can't do experimental studies because of ethics). 
			
			So brain sex is somewhat more a continuum than a binary model; this explains why, although being attracted to female is statistically a masculine traits (95% have it), lesbian females identifying as women can still be attracted exclusively by women.

	what you're trying to do when you support trans people in transitioning is not a temporary fix for other mental illnesses. while there's no definite proof, like anything else in science or nature, that correlation is causation, and that being trans may have been the root cause of the other issues, perhaps there are other issues, or the other issues lead to a feeling of gender dysphoria.

	so there's no definite cause and effect. but i will say that for one trans person in particular, contrapoints, a youtuber named natalie wynn, it was kind of the other way around. she was diagnosed with a lot of different mental illnesses throughout her life, and never gender dysphoria, so she took different medications to treat her for depression or anxiety or bipolar disorder or what have you. but eventually, she figured out that she was trans, she transitioned, and a lot of her issues were resolved or at least really alleviated. she says that transition saved her life.

	gender dysphoria is a very very specific feeling, and feeling as if you should have breasts when you don't, or feeling as if you should look less muscular when you don't, is intensely troubling. and suicidal ideations are common in trans people. but these issues are alleviated through transition.

	so, yeah, they could get therapy for ever and ever and ever, but gender dysphoria just does not seem to be an issue that goes away with therapy or medication except in a very small minority of detransitioners.

	and there is evidence that supports the idea that gender is intrinsic and therefore self dictated. for example, the brain similarities between cis and trans women, cis and trans men. cis men and trans men have more in common with in terms of brain structure, the size of certain areas, than they do with trans women.

	so the issue is alleviating pain and alleviating suffering. transition helps people, it saves lives. i'm sorry if you don't believe that but suicidal ideations and attempts are lessened after transition. if you think the same things could be achieved through therapy, you are entitled to your opinion, but it's not as if trans people do not get extensive therapy beforehand.

	it is a drastic decision, and there are a lot of steps they need to take, doctors need to diagnose them, they need hormone levels checked, they need to see a psychologist for an evaluation to confirm they have gender dysphoria. there are lots of checkpoints, you could say, before a trans person can actually begin transition.

	my point is that they do get therapy beforehand. and i do understand why your view was shaped by your friend Lana, but she is one person. one trans person out of hundreds of thousands.

			transition really does ease pain. it lowers the suicide rate. i do know of someone who is trans named Blaire White who hopes that there are other alternatives out there other than transition. it's a difficult, painful process. reintegrating yourself into society under a new name, a new face, introducing yourself to your family, getting them used to that, is very hard.
			
			sterility is another issue that comes along with transition, and some people don't want kids, but it's a big price to pay for some. perhaps that could give you perspective as well on the difficulties of gender dysphoria, that people perceive their transition as medically necessary enough to most likely not allow them to have children.

	Yeah gender dysphoria is a mental illness. I'm a trans person and I understand this. It's a mental illness caused by internal biological factors though. It's not caused by trauma or by other mental illnesses getting out of control. It's caused by a misalignment between the brain sex and genetic sex. Genetic sex is determined by, genetics obviously. It's your chromosomes. Brain sex is your gender. It's determined by the hormones that you're exposed to while developing in the womb. It's a common misconception that trans people choose their gender. Gender is something that you're born with that just doesn't change. You can't choose it, or I'd have chosen my gender to be the same as my genetic sex and avoid all this bs. At this point the only "cure" is physical transition. Maybe one day we'll be able to change the brain which would be awesome

			Hey look up intersexed it's actually the proper term for people who have hormones and such off in their brain. From what I've read the scientific community distinguishes the difference that trans is a state of mind and intersexed is an actual biological thing. They are not one in the same. I feel like it more people understood this it would help society understand trans people more. Also if you do look it up understand that there are different degrees of intersexed like people being born with weird bits between their legs and like what is being discussed here is hormones being different in ones body.

		Where has this been established? This [study](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/05/180524112351.htm) seems to talk about adolescence with Gender Dysphoria and the similarities they share with the opposite sex, but it's not enough to say anything for certain. I say that because the individuals being studied aren't adults, and haven't finished puberty, and while it is likely they will experience Gender Dysphoria in adulthood, establishing that is vital to the integrity of the study. 
		
		In particular, the unusually [high correlation of autism](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zhanavrangalova/2017/11/15/growing-evidence-for-a-link-between-gender-dysphoria-and-autism-spectrum-disorders/#58571743153e) and Gender Dysphoria would suggest there is a link to 'other mental illnesses.'

		Hi, I really appreciate all of the people that are having such open discussions in this thread as it's adding a lot to my own understanding of gender dysphoria and trans gender people in general. At this point I understand that  gender dysphoria is a mental illness and the thing that makes people feel better the most is transitioning. I'm really accepting of it all actually as I don't really see the need to worry about what people choose to do with their bodies. However, one thing that I'm still really confused about is what exactly is the "suffering?" (I put suffering in quotations because it's the word that's being used not because I don't think it's actually suffering). My current understanding is that the suffering is feeling like you're in the wrong body and not being accepted for it, but as you can imagine, that's very difficult to understand.  
		One thing you mention is genetic sex vs brain sex. While I understand genetic sex, and the phenotypes associated with them, I do not understand the brain sex equivalent. What exactly is a more masculine or feminine brain? Yes I understand the chemical differences but what does this equate to in everyday life?  It makes me deeply confused about what someone means when they say they identify as a man or they identify as a woman. What are these defining factors of masculinity or femininity that actually matter on a day to day basis? Like I said before, I do not actually worry about people who want to transition. I support them choosing whatever they want to do with their bodies. I just want to be able to say something to some people that I've met that feel personally involved in these other people's lives. Often times telling them, "It doesn't matter what someone chooses to do with THEIR body!" Doesn't really change anyone's mind. So I would like to be a bit better informed. I know this is a long reply and I'm sorry for the formatting (mobile), but I would love to hear more from you!

			I am transgender. I am on estrogen hormone replacement therapy.
			
			I will address the dysphoria aspect here. So let's start with the definition: gender dysphoria is the distress caused by incongruence between one's internal gender identity and one's external physical and sexual characteristics. In other words, the programming and the hardware don't match (as an apt metaphor).
			
			So how does this distress manifest? It can appear in many ways and in many intensities. It can be vague, something just doesn't feel right and this creates stress and negative feelings, or it can be so intense that people are driven to desparate means to alleviate it. It is different for every single person. It is different over time for me, some days are good, some suck terribly.
			
			One item that is a big source of dysphoria for me personally is body hair and facial hair. I am undergoing permanent hair removal (electrolysis, laser won't work for my hair color). When I have body or facial hair, I sometimes can't even look at myself on a bad day. Other days, it just gives me a general feeling of distress. The days after electrolysis and/or waxing sessions, I feel much, much better.
			
			I unfortunately also have androgenic alopecia (male pattern baldness), this is a huge source of dysphoria, unhappiness and stress for me. Putting one of my wigs on helps immensely, I don't even want to look in a mirror on some days as it reminds me how wrong it is to me, it feels like somebody played a cruel joke on me and I often want to just cry about it.
			
			As my HRT progresses, there are physical changes that are helping me have less dysphoria (breast development, slowing of body/facial hair growth, changes in fat distribution, softening of my skin and others).
			
			One aspect I don't think has been touched on here is the opposite of gender dysphoria. That is gender euphoria. When I can get all things working together for my feminine presentation, I have a strong feeling of how RIGHT everything is. It is pretty remarkable.
			
			Some people don't have much or even any dysphoria but they do experience euphoria quite intensely. It was really my first such euphoria experience that helped me to see that I was in fact symptomatic with dysphoria.
			
			I hope this helps.

				Thank you for replying! I have heard this explanation of dysphoria being the distress caused by the incongruence between internal and external gender identity multiple times. I am very confused on what internal gender identity is? You described a couple of examples of what made you feel better but I don't see how they are inherent to male or female. Women and men both have body hair so I don't understand how completely removing it makes someone feel like more of a woman. And as for male pattern baldness, I'm sure that men experiencing it have their own struggles with it. Some men try to use products to get it back, some use plugs, and some use wigs. And I'm sure many of them don't want to look at themselves in the mirror either because it bothers them. But it doesn't inherently bother them. It bothers them because they have this insecurity about not having hair, but in reality it doesn't significantly effect their ability to live day to day. If it does have a significant impact on their mental health because they are that insecure about it then sure they can do something. But I don't understand how this is gender specific because even women can lose their hair for various reasons. So I'm still a bit confused. 
				
				However it's interesting that you mention gender euphoria. I've actually never heard of this concept so I appreciate you bringing it up. If you don't mind me asking, what exactly triggered this feeling of euphoria or what often triggers it in other people? Again, I really appreciate your response. This is something that I've been trying to understand for a while.

					So I cannot speak to anyone else's perception of their own gender, only my own. What triggers dysphoria or euphoria is unique in each person. I know what it is I feel are feminine traits and what I see as masculine ones. Masculine traits are ones that cause me distress, but can I list all of them? Probably not, I gave easy to understand examples though. And yes, even cis men can have dysphoria over hair loss. It is certainly a thing.
					
					As for what does an internal gender identity feel like, well, I can't tell you, I wish I could, especially since I am gender fluid with a very agender state and a very feminine state, I never feel like I am a man, despite my physical phenotype.
					
					There are things that make me feel like I am a woman. But are those things universal? Nope. Can I describe them? Not really. To use an analogy, can you describe the color blue to even another sighted person? I doubt it, you can list physical things like light wavelengths but the essence of your perception of blue is only something you will experience and know.
					
					Gender euphoria is what happens when those things that cause me distress are suppressed. For instance, when I have hairless, smooth skin after waxing and I have done my makeup, put on a feminine outfit and donned my wig, it makes me feel really good, it triggers pleasure and happiness instead of stress and despair. It is almost like getting high on the release of endorphins.
					
					I wish I could describe it in a way that you could understand, but I don't know how.

	A lot of these posts are specifically about Lana and her condition, I'd like to talk about you and how you feel about it.

	Reading between the lines you were very close to this person when they presented as male, that relationship ended after Lana transitioned and you hold an opinion that Lana should still be male. This suggests that you wish to go back to how things were before she transitioned, why? Is your primary concern Lana's welfare or is it yours?

	Do you miss your male friend? Do you feel uncomfortable with transgender people? Are you concerned about how having a friend who transitioned reflects on you?

	If your concern is really for Lana then you need to get to know her and understand her, is she happier now? Is there any reason she'd think she'd be better off male? However, if this is all about your own neurosis then you have stop with this front that you're concerned about her and face up to your own problems, they aren't her responsibility and you can't expect her to change to suit you.

			I'm glad your mind had been changed but I'd like to say one more thing, especially as you seem genuinely open to discussing this issue. You say that she acts like she doesn't see you, is that because you've been weird with her since she transitioned, is she weird with you or have your circumstances changed (you both hang out with different people now for example)? 
			
			Does it bother you that the relationship is different? Are you the sort of guy who wouldn't want to a friend transitioning to effect them (whether it does or not)? If you want to be a friend to her (and you are under no obligation to want that) maybe you need to be the one to bridge the divide between you as maybe she feels she can't.

			Your replies all through this post have brought a smile to my face and I've truly appreciated seeing your willingness to confront some difficult preconceptions you've held. 
			
			I'm trans myself, and I'll admit that *I* feel uncomfortable with myself at times, years into transition. It's not an immediate, or even a quick process of acceptance, both for out transgender people and the cisgender people in their lives. 
			
			As a simple anecdote, I've had two people reach back out to me years after transitioning confessing that they were uncomfortable early on and regret that our friendship suffered as a result. I couldn't have been happier to welcome them back in my life. You have to make a lot of difficult decisions when you come out, and if someone doesn't seem totally on board, it's easy to let that relationship fall by the wayside as you're singularly focused on figuring out how you're going to establish your identity in those early days. But once you have a new routine established, and can get through most days with your head held high, your support system in place, getting to reestablish old relationships is such a rewarding thing.
			
			tl;dr It's rarely ever too late if you want to reintroduce yourself.

	Hello, I’m sure that my reply will get lost in this now very long chain of replies, but it’s worth a shot. I’m transgender myself, and I’ve been taking testosterone for almost 4 and a half years now. I was born a female and started transitioning to male when I was 18. Before I started to transition, I was very feminine. I wore makeup and dresses, and had long hair and a petite build. Many people were shocked when I revealed my gender identity. 

	I often ask myself why I’m this way and what makes me this way, and quite honestly I don’t know why. For a very long time I hated being this way, and sometimes I still do get upset and wonder why I can’t be like other people. I can see why you would feel how you feel, and sometimes I feel as though maybe my life experiences could have affected my identity. I grew up in a mess of a household with very little influence from my father, and his impression was also very negative to me. I was a loner and very shy; from a young age I knew that I wasn’t like the other kids. I realized I had multiple mental illnesses at around 8 without even being familiar with depression or anxiety. I’ve always feared that these issues and the lack of help I received somehow contributed to my gender identity. 

	However the older I’ve gotten, the more I’ve began to believe that there is some sort of “LGBT” gene. Years ago I thought this was ridiculous, but I think there is definitely a genetic connection with being LGBT. Both of my siblings identify as LGBT, and at least 4 other gay people that I know of also have LGBT siblings as well. I don’t have any scientific evidence that I can provide, but based on my experience and my very deep involvement with the LGBT community, I believe that genetics play a huge role in this and I hope that more research is conducted on this theory in the future. 

	I honestly don’t think that you’re completely wrong with saying that environmental factors have an affect on gender identity. No one is sure why or what causes someone to identify as transgender; not even people like myself who are transgender. All I know is that I started to feel these feelings late into my teens and ever since I followed my intuition, I’ve felt more complete and like myself than I ever did. I always tell people that I’ve lived my entire life in these past 4.5 years because the previous 18 felt like I was just existing but not alive. 

	However, I don’t think that being transgender is a mental illness, but more so something that is based on both genetics and life experiences. Not everything that happens as a result of your negative experiences is negative outcome, and if this is something that is a result of my experiences, then it is definitely what I needed to truly be happy. Starting hormones and identifying how I do right now has made me realize that I really don’t need anything else out of life than what I have and who I am right now.

		Thank you so much for sharing. There have been comments in this post linking to sources that claim that you're born as a transgender due to structural differences in the brain. How do you feel about that?

		* 🟧 **[Thick_Swing](https://www.reddit.com/user/Thick_Swing)** ⬆️ 3 _(2020-02-12 18:06:29)_

			I think that could definitely be a reason! I think there’s more than one reason actually. Gender is such a strange thing and it’s very hard to understand if you’ve never experienced those feelings of uneasiness with your sex given at birth. Before I transitioned I never thought anything of gender and am a little ashamed to admit that I was not very open to the idea of transgender people at one point in my life. 
			
			I think there’s definitely something that just clicks at one point for a lot of people. I think that maybe for people who know they’re transgender from the time they’re very young (such as 5 years old), it’s very likely that it could be brain structural differences, since kids that young don’t even know what gender is; they’re just acting on how they feel! However I think that as you get older and then begin to realize, it gets much more complicated. The cause could be so many different things from genetics to the effects of prior experiences, etc.
			
			I don’t think we’ll ever really know the cause of being gay or transgender, and that’s okay with me. What matters most is just having people know that this is out of my control, and that the only thing that’s helped is transitioning. It’s not only helped with my dysphoria, but it’s also greatly relieved other issues I had been dealing with, such as depression.

	We are still looking for a cure though. There's quite a lot being done in the field of developmental biology, because it's really very interesting. Gender dysphoria is feeling like your experience of gender disagrees with your physical sex. There are two potential ways to fix this: Change one's experience of gender, or change one's physical sex. So far, we have absolutely no idea how to do the first thing, and to even try would be extremely unethical because it would literally be rewriting people's personalities (and if we can do that, what's to stop us viewing say, christianity as a mental illness and rewriting all christians to be normal?). But we *do* know how to change a body's physical sex, at least to a point where it's a pretty good analogue of the target sex. We have one real treatment for gender dysphoria, which is to help them transition. That *is* the cure. The point is to bring them to a point where the brain can feel confident in the body that contains it, and the only method we have right now is to make the body into one that the brain doesn't feel like an alien in. Now, whether or not that is the ideal treatment is still up for debate, but for the moment it's the only treatment we have, and I see absolutely no reason we should force them to live in a body that doesn't feel like their own *just in case* we manage to find a non-transitioning cure and somehow come to the conclusion that rewriting personality is morally fine.

	Also, autism and adhd are both incurable, whilst Lana's depression is most likely a result of her experiences in the world (depression is very common for people with autism and for people with gender dysphoria, but it tends to decrease when these people figure out how to fit in and find the people with whom they will fit). Even if those things had been diagnosed, it would not have had any effect on her gender dysphoria. 

	Further, most of Lana's suffering at this point is going to be due to lack of support networks - transgender people are often abandoned by their peers and family when they transition (as you have done). This is why they have such a high suicide rate, even after transitioning. Autism is only going to make that worse because it provides difficulty socialising and forming close connections. If you really want to reduce her suffering, you should offer her support, not avoid her or criticise her for transitioning. If you can't get over this though and just treat her like a person, then distancing yourself is probably the right decision.

		We do - or attempt to do - exactly that with all other mental illnesses, through a combination of medication, talk therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, etc.  It's recognized as the proper treatment for mental illnesses, and it's widely and loudly advocated for all other mental illnesses.  But gender dysphoria?  Noooooo, everyone has to accept and believe that men are women and women are men.  It's like insisting that we all now have to believe and accept and behave as though every person with any other kind of delusion who proclaims that they're god, actually *is* god.

		*We at Johns Hopkins University—which in the 1960s was the first American medical center to venture into "sex-reassignment surgery"—launched a study in the 1970s comparing the outcomes of transgendered people who had the surgery with the outcomes of those who did not. Most of the surgically treated patients described themselves as "satisfied" by the results, but their subsequent psycho-social adjustments were no better than those who didn't have the surgery. And so at Hopkins we stopped doing sex-reassignment surgery, since producing a "satisfied" but still troubled patient seemed an inadequate reason for surgically amputating normal organs.*  
		
		*It now appears that our long-ago decision was a wise one. A 2011 study at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016885) produced the most illuminating results yet regarding the transgendered, evidence that should give advocates pause. The long-term study—up to 30 years—followed 324 people who had sex-reassignment surgery. The study revealed that beginning about 10 years after having the surgery, the transgendered began to experience increasing mental difficulties. Most shockingly, their suicide mortality rose almost 20-fold above the comparable nontransgender population. This disturbing result has as yet no explanation but probably reflects the growing sense of isolation reported by the aging transgendered after surgery. The high suicide rate certainly challenges the surgery prescription.*

Some 25% did have persisting feelings; what differentiates those individuals remains to be discerned.*  (From the same article as above)

Doctors don't do those things, *because they recognize that the right approach for dealing with mental illness is* **not** *to just accept the ill person's deluded view that they should have their body surgically altered.*   However, the ill people then sometimes do things like force a surgeon at gunpoint to amputate their healthy leg.

That doesn't mean that the correct response is to hack up their bodies, especially when it doesn't stop them from being depressed, bi-polar, suicidal, etc. afterwards, which proponents of the acceptance of gender transitions assert will be the improved state once GD patients "can be who/what they truly are".
			
			Should we "force" them to be in a body that doesn't "feel" like their own?  That's not the reality of the situation.  The appropriate question is "Should doctors surgically alter people's healthy, normal bodies just because they have a disease of the mind or brain?"  The answer is No.  The "sound mind" autonomy of people with mental illnesses is doubted in most societal circumstances where things like giving consent, or entering into contracts or similarly legally binding agreements or understandings, or formulating legitimate intent to do things are required.  The same is and should remain true in the circumstances of getting doctors to surgically alter ones body in huge ways, especially when it doesn't cure or treat the mental illnesses one is suffering.

In individual cases, the diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder and of a loss of autonomy may be controversial, but it has to be made by psychiatrists, not by surgeons.* **In all cases of BIID that have been investigated by psychiatrists, the diagnosis states that the amputation desire is obsessive or results from a monothematic delusion, comparable to anorexia, Capgras syndrome or anankastic counting. Therefore a surgeon must not rely on the patient's ‘autonomous decision.’**   
			
			*Nonmaleficence*  
			*According to the principle of nonmaleficence physicians must not perform amputations without a medical indication because amputations bear great risks and often have severe consequences besides the disability (Beckford-Ball 2000; Dotinga 2000; Johnston and Elliott 2002), for example, infections, thromboses, paralyses, necrosis, or phantom pain (Amputation Gliedmaßen, www.chirurgie-portal.de/orthopaedie/arm-bein-amputation.html, accessed December 5, 2008). Even though some physicians perform harmful surgeries as breast enlargement surgeries, this cannot justify surgeries that are even more harmful. Even if amputations would be a possible therapy for BIID, they would be risky experimental therapies that could be justified only if they promised lifesaving or the cure of severe diseases and if an alternative therapy would not be available. At least the first condition is not fulfilled in the case of BIID, and probably the second is not fulfilled either. Above all, an amputation causes an irreversible damage that could not be healed, even if the patient's body image would be restored spontaneously or through a new therapy.*  ...  
			
			*Beneficence*  
			*Amputations could be justified according to the principle of beneficence if their benefit for the patient would override their harm. Therefore the following conditions needed to be fulfilled: 1) effectiveness, 2) sustainability of the effect, and 3) non-existence of a less noxious therapy. Bayne and Levy (2005), First (2004), Fisher and Smith (2000) and Furth and Smith (2000) claim that these conditions are fulfilled. But they cannot present scientific evidence for the effectiveness of amputation as a BIID therapy, and refer to only about approximately 10 cases. Furthermore, these cases are collected from patients who looked for a contact to researchers and media because they are happy with their amputations. Additionally, the sustainability of the effect can be doubted: in some cases a symptom shift occurred—resulting in the successive mutilation of several limbs (Berger et al. 2005; Skatessoon 2005; Sorene et al. 2006). The fact that psychotherapy and psychotropics are not very effective to cure BIID is shown only by a few case studies, whereas in some cases SSRI and behavioral therapy slowed down the amputation desire (Berger et al. 2005).* **The conclusion that the only possibility to match the physical body and the body image of BIID patients was amputation is wrong: The alternative of adapting the body to the body image is adapting the body image to the body**—*for example by movement therapy, rTMS, or electrical stimulation of the brain.* **Hence the prerequisites that could justify amputations according to the principle of beneficence are either not fulfilled or not proved sufficiently.**
			
			Note well that, in a pilot study to investigate similarities and differences between body integrity identity disorder and gender dysphoria (http://www.sciencepublishinggroup.com/journal/paperinfo.aspx?journalid=203&amp;doi=10.11648/j.ajap.20140306.14) ...  
			
			*Results:* **No differences** *were found between BIID and Gender Dysphoria with respect to body image and body perception (U-test: p-value=.757), age of onset (p=.841), the imitation of the desired identity (p=.699 and p=.938), the etiology (p=.299) and intensity of desire (p=.989 and p=.224) as well as in relation to a high level of suffering and impaired quality of life (p=.066).*
			
			And as such...  
			*If BIID were a neuropsychological disturbance, which includes missing insight into the illness and a specific lack of autonomy, then amputations would be contraindicated and must be evaluated as bodily injuries of mentally disordered patients. Instead of only curing the symptom, a causal therapy should be developed to integrate the alien limb into the body image.*  (Body integrity identity disorder (BIID)--is the amputation of healthy limbs ethically justified?  
			 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19132621)
			
			Since both BIID and Gender Dysphoria are neuropsychological disturbances in which sufferers have a misperception that their bodies aren't "the right ones", surgical "correction" is not the answer for either.

		I have a maybe uneducated question.
		
		Why is Gender Dysphoria increasing in cases in the modern age compared to say, 50 years ago? Homosexuality goes back pretty extensively so why is it seemingly increasing at a pretty rapid rate? I cant speak for everyone but my own personal experience, I didnt see a single child/teenager who was gender dysphoric growing up yet now, I see them all the time. I'm aware it could be down to it being more open and acceptable nowadays, but the jump in how common it seems now, to me, seems really high.

		* 🟧 **[Nephisimian](https://www.reddit.com/user/Nephisimian)** ⬆️ 9 _(2020-02-12 09:17:18)_

			I suspect several contributing factors:
			
			Firstly, awareness has simply increased. This not only helps us notice transgender people more, it also helps people with gender dysphoria actually realise they have gender dysphoria. It's also helped psychiatrists and therapists diagnose better. Psychology is a very poorly understood field, and if most therapists don't know much about gender dysphoria they can't diagnose it even when it's there. A similar problem exists for Dissociative Identity Disorder - even though this is surprisingly common, the process of diagnosing it is extremely long and extremely difficult, because not many therapists know much about it and even for those who do, distinguishing its symptoms from the symptoms of other conditions can be hard. 
			
			Secondly, gender dysphoria has become a thing that a lot of teenagers latch on to. Teenagers are renowned for feeling broadly uncomfortable, that's just a teenage thing, but teenagers are still very impressionable. They have certain social circles and can often mis-attribute things based on the ideas they're exposed to. It's not uncommon for teenagers who don't feel like they fit gender stereotypes to identify as having gender dysphoria even though they don't, which is why a lot of countries have a very involved process of diagnosis before any transitional actions are approved. 
			
			Third, gender dysphoria is a mental condition. It's not something you can innately see, and it's very easily hidden. Chances are, there were a lot of people with gender dysphoria even when you were growing up but because society was in general more conservative back then, everyone kept it very, very quiet.

	The point of medical treatment is to reduce the patient's suffering, to increase their well-being and make them more functional. The point is *not* to beat their illness with a stick just for the sake of beating it.

			As far as I know we don't have any true cure for any mental illness.  Your friend Lana has chosen what they see as the best treatment available to them, which I believe anyone would do.
			
			People with depression or anxiety who seek out therapy are not "cured" by their therapist, the therapist helps them learn healthy coping mechanisms and guides them to make choices that will improve their mental health, but in the end it's up to the person to learn about their mental illness and put in the effort to control it rather than succumb to it.  But it's not a cure in the way a vaccine acts as a cure.
			
			To provide an analogy of sorts, it's like saying to a paraplegic: "You shouldn't get a wheelchair, it won't cure you.  There's a cure for you somewhere else, we just have to find it." Their reasoning for getting a wheelchair isn't to cure themselves, it's to make it easier to live their life.
			
			In the end, I think Lana should be in therapy to help her cope with her illness, but if she wants a wheelchair too, she should have one.

			The idea of some hypothetical cure is one debated within various communities (including trans ones). Some people do embrace the idea. But others see it as actually not a cure at all, but a fundamental personality change. After all, if your gender is a big part of who you are, then changing your gender means changing *you*. Whereas changing your appearance does not. After all, our brains and our thoughts *are* us.
			
			There's tons of ways that changing your appearance isn't controversial, too. Tattoos, hair styles, fitness, fashion... Is gender presentation so different? Transitioning can be viewed as unifying the body to match your mind (and from that, how society treats you).
			
			Of course, it's still complicated. It's hard to draw the line on what mental aspects are "really" you and what are unacceptable to change. Eg, if a schizophrenic person hears voices, is that inherently them? But at least where trans people are concerned, the majority of their suffering seems to come *not* directly from their mismatched gender identity, but rather from it being mismatched, from how society treats them, and from difficulties in actually correcting the mismatch. **That is, their gender identity is not *wrong* or *directly* harmful, as many mental illnesses are.**
			
			Either way, though, there's no reason to believe that if something existed to change your mind to fit your biology that everyone would want to take that. Some would, especially if it's simpler. But it's probably obvious why a number of people would rather change their body than their mind. The main issue is that changing their body in this way makes *other people* angry (ie, transphobes).

			Well, you seemed to heavily imply that such a cure is available now.
			
			If you do agree that transition is currently by far the best treatment for gender dysphoria, then how does the mere possibility of finding a way *in the future* to make people comfortable with the body and social role they were given at birth make it hard for you to support their preferred body and social role *now*?

		* 🟧 **[CarpeMofo](https://www.reddit.com/user/CarpeMofo)** ⬆️ 5 _(2020-02-12 07:47:43)_

			It's not something anyone should 'cure' in the way you're talking about. If you took a transgender person and essentially rewired their brain to make their brain match their body you would be massively altering their personality and who they are as a person. A transgender person's brain is structurally what one would expect of the gender they feel they are. Your friend literally has the brain of a woman. Changing that is changing who she is in a very profound way. 
			
			Are there people who are simply mentally ill and not truly transgender? Almost certainly, but that isn't the case for the very vast majority of people who identify as a different gender and it's why they go through a ton of psychological counselling before they transition.
			
			The perfect cure for being trans isn't trying to fix their brain, there is nothing wrong with their brain their brain works just as it's supposed to. It's their body that has something wrong with it. The perfect cure would be perfecting the procedures done to the body to the point where they can fully be the gender the identify as. 
			
			They best perspective to look at it from is to not look at being trans  as an issue with the brain, the best perspective is to look at it as there is something wrong with their body because it doesn't match their gender. 
			
			To put a bit of a finer point on it, there was a man named [David Rainer](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/David_Reimer#/Death) as an infant he suffered a botched circumcision, at the time it was believed that gender was a learned behavior so a psychologist suggested they do surgery to turn him into a girl and just not tell him which is what his parents decided. Well, at around 9 or 10 he started feeling like he was in fact a boy and by 15 was living as a male. He lived the rest of his life as a male, but growing up originally as female kind of messed him up along with sexual assault by his psychologist and at the age of 39 he took his life with a sawed off shotgun.
			
			In any case, the point is, just like a transgender person, his gender identity didn't match his body. This is exactly what trans people go through, the only difference between he and they are that they are born with the wrong sexual characteristics rather than having them medically altered. If we can accept that it's kind of obvious this would happen to someone in his case and we can accept that the gestation process isn't perfect and things go wrong, then we should also be able to accept that someone being born with a brain that doesn't match their body is kind of inevitable.

	This is a pretty common misconception of medicine. 

	**First do no harm** 

	—From the Hippocratic oath. It actually established what is disease and how treatment ought to be provided. 

	The APA diagnoses disorders as a thing which interfere with functioning in a society and or cause distress. 

	It's not that there is some kind of blueprint for a "healthy" human. There is no archetype to which any living thing ought to conform. We're not a car, being brought to a mechanic because some part with a given function is misbehaving. That's just not how biology works. There is no "natural order". Nature makes variants. Disorder is natural. 

	We're all extremely malformed apes. Or super duper malformed amoebas. We don't know the direction or purpose of our parts in evolutionary history. So we don't diagnose people against a blueprint. We look for suffering and ease it. 

	Gender dysphoria is indeed suffering. What treatment eases it? Evidence shows that transitioning eases that suffering. 

	***

	Now, I'm sure someone will point this out but biology is not binary anywhere. It's modal. And usually multimodal. People are more or less like archetypes we establish in our mind. But the archetypes are just abstract tokens that we use to simplify our thinking. They don't exist as self-enforced categories in the world. 

	There aren't black and white people. There are people with more or fewer traits that we associate with a group that we mentally represent as a token white or black person. 

	There aren't tall or short people. There are a range of heights and we categorize them mentally. If more tall people appeared, our impression of what qualified as "short" would change and we'd start calling some people short that we hadn't before even though nothing about them or their height changed. 

	This even happens with sex. There are a set of traits strongly mentally associated with males and females but they aren't binary - just strongly polar. Some men can't grow beards. Some women can. There are women born with penises and men born with breasts or a vagina but with Y chromosomes. 

	Sometimes one part of the body is genetically male and another is genetically female. Yes, there are people with two different sets of genes and some of them have (X,X) in one set of tissue and (X,Y) in another. 

	It's easy to see and measure chromosomes. Neurology is more complex and less well understood - but it stands to reason that if it can happen in something as fundamental as our genes, it can happen in the neurological structure of a brain which is formed by them.

	I think this bit is interesting. Mutilation is not exactly a neutral term, it  has some strong negative implications.

	So, you might want to ask yourself whether your belief that therapy must be the solution is based upon the idea that therapy must help, or based upon some innate feeling that transition must be the wrong solution.

		Especially since nobody calls any other form of cosmetic surgery "mutilation". If you want a smaller nose or to fix a cleft lip or bigger boobs, it's viewed as enhancing yourself.
		
		Bottom surgery for trans people is pretty similar, but far more important. People get cosmetic surgery to be happier with themselves. But trans people are often dysphoric about their genitals and thus the surgery doesn't just make them happier with themselves, but unifies their body to fit their mind. It removes a cause of discomfort.
		
		Note that bottom surgery isn't the only one, too. Trans men typically get top surgery to remove breasts. There's also sometimes rarer surgeries to change facial structure or vocal chords. Finally, a number of trans people don't want surgery (they're not dysphoric about their genitals or don't see the surgery as worth it).
		
		It begs a reminder that nobody gets surgery early on or just whenever they decide to transition, since many misunderstand that. The only typically consistent part of transitioning is changing presentation and getting hormones. Surgery is a years away kinda thing that has long wait times, high cost, and lots of red tape. Eg, in my country, it's publicly funded but that translates into needing multiple psychiatrist approvals, at least a year of HRT (these are recommendations by WPATH), and likely a year or two on a waiting list. If not funded, it's ballpark $20k USD and as far as I know, all the reputable surgeons require you meet the WPATH requirements. Finally, nobody does surgery on anyone under 18. Trans youth start with hormone blockers (super safe and reverseable) till 16 and then HRT.

If the latter then I think you need to realize most of the studies we have right now do not show psychological therapy to be particularly effective on its own, especially non gender-affirming therapies. We can’t really be asked to change your mind on something that’s completely hypothetical because you are talking about what you believe as an ideal as opposed to what if provable fact.

	I’m gonna add also, on the topic of delusion, “delusion” isn’t an accurate word.

	It’d be delusional for a pre-op AMAB (assigned male at birth) to say “I have a vagina”.

	But that’s not what they’re saying, they’re saying “I want a vagina”.

	They’re acknowledging reality for what it is (that they have a penis and male sex characteristics) and saying they want to change it.

	That’s not delusional, that’s just a want/need.

	And when I trans woman says “I am a woman” they are not saying “I have XX chromosomes”. They are fully aware that they were born in a “male” body, that their female body is the result of surgery and injected hormones. What they’re actually saying (implicitly) is a statement about what it means to be a woman - that being a woman isn’t about how you were born, but about how you feel inside and relate to the world around you. Whether you agree or disagree, you can’t (in good faith) call this a delusion - it’s just an opinion that you disagree with. Anyone can have this opinion - trans or cis. In fact, many cis people do hold this opinion.

	Also, I don’t think your hypothesis about Lana holds up, because gender identity is usually fully developed at the age of four. At 7 months infants begin to tell the difference between male and female voices, 12 months they tell the difference between male and female faces, 2 years infants begin to use gender stereotypes while playing, 2-3 years they develop a gender identity (labelling themselves and others as male/female), and at age 3-4 they begin to put things into “boxes”. Typically at 4 years old they have a stable sense of gender identity.

	Chances are Lana knew (or was suppressing) she was trans during childhood, before she endured all this traumatic shit.

	The final thing is you seem to have ideas about why Lana is trans, but if trauma caused people to be trans, then every trans person would have had a traumatic childhood. This is factually inaccurate. I know many trans people who are healthy and have had non-traumatic lives. There are also plenty of traumatised kids who don’t grow up to be trans. *Even if* you’re right about Lana, the statistics don’t back up your theory about transness in general - the evidence simply isn’t there to back up your claims more broadly.

	Why is disfiguring your otherwise healthy body approved by society, and why do transgenders not notice that they are perfectly fine they just don't like the body they have, and really nobody does, but that means you get to opt out of being what you are? What about kids? If we allow this to happen what are we going to tell little girls when they ask what a penis is because they have to change with boys at school and vice versa for boys, this can get really ugly really quick if we don't look at the logical side. Gender is not assigned at birth that's just the way you came out. And the problems are endless that affect us as a society not saying it would kill us but kids go through shit and Maybe we just need to be more aware of mental health in general otherwise we wouldn't be having this conversation.

	If we’re talking about mental illness, let’s compare it to something such as anxiety and depression. Let’s say there was a pill that someone could take away your mental illness. Most patients with anxiety and depression would take this in a heartbeat. Meanwhile those with gender dysphoria wouldn’t. Wanting to be another gender is part of who they are. The only reason they feel upset is because society is trying to force them to be the gender they were born with. If everyone let them be the gender they wanted to be, there wouldn’t even be gender dysphoria.

	U/Mikeman7918 had a great comment and I just wanted to add a little context for understanding the relationship between trans and/or non-binary and depression. Most kids can recognize their own gender by about 3 years. Link below. It used to be more often the case though that they didn't know how to express that or that feeling deferent then what everyone was calling them was an option. So they bottle those feelings and don't allow themselves to feel them. Years of every day being called something you're not takes a lot of practice to numb their feelings. That numb feeling is one of the most common ways depression manifests and then it just builds because they've already spent their lives practicing it.

	I'm not saying necessarily that in Lana's case she got depression from this, but it happens a lot and it's certainly a possibility.

	**The critical problems with the discussion about transgenderism have to do with framing and language.**  

	Let’s make this clear: Gender is not real. It has never been real. It is a sociological concept that was invented in the 1950s by sexologist John Money, who borrowed the grammatical term “gender” from linguists to coin the now-familiar term “gender role”, which he defined as the loose collection of an individual’s behaviors and thoughts that, in a social context, could be considered male or female and which presented that individual as a certain gender.

	This isn’t inherently a problem. Psychologist and sociologists come up with terms all the time to describe phenomena. But the enduring issue with gender theory is its unfortunate mingling with critical social ideologies that have nothing to do with the underlying science or discussion about the phenomena in question, and is instead focused on this idea of GENDER.  

	It is obvious that the phenomena of *what we call* “gender dysphoria” and “transgenderism” exist. I’m not saying they do not. The problem is that GENDER is an intangible concept, it is not a physical characteristic like weight, height, eye color, or biological sex. There is no “seat” in the brain for gender, just as there is no “seat” for the ego or the id. But the discussion is consistently fixated on the physical characteristics that allow someone to conform to an idealized, performative GENDER - the use of hormones to emulate the opposite sex, the removal or addition of genitalia, emulation of stereotyped “gendered” behaviors - as opposed to the neurological foundation of these behaviors that go beyond GENDER.  

	There are certainly studies that correlate specific areas of the brain to observed gender-related phenomena. That is intriguing as a study of the phenomena in question, but not as a study of GENDER. So when we have people talking about “male” or “female” "gendered" brains as if that is a meaningful designation, we have problem, in that the discussion has moved out of the scientific realm vis-a-vis the phenomena in question, and instead into the critical realm of gender theory, which has no basis in reality, being purely the non-evidential invention of Dr. Money. 

	A major issue is that words like “gender” have so thoroughly infiltrated the discussion, and those discussions have become so loaded with jargon, that even people educated in the field are required to infinitely recurse in complexity their attempts to describe what is, at its base, an extremely colloquial designation.

	Gender, as a concept, has very little scientific value and has been wildly misleading, to the detriment of those experiencing the phenomena mentioned by the OP. I understand that it is convenient to use these terms to describe what is being observed, but the concepts and the sphere of inquiry that has sprung up around them have been thoroughly poisoned.

	Trans people are objectively mentally ill. Why is it seen as offensive to say that? Because people harbor lots of negative feelings towards the mentally ill. Calling trans people mentally ill isn't "transphobic," and anyone who says it is, is actually revealing their own bigotry toward the mentally ill. My ex-wife suffered from mental illness. When she claimed to be the Anti-Christ, the doctors' solution wasn't to build her an altar painted in goats' blood, it was to figure out what was going wrong in her brain.  

	Transitioning is objectively *not* a good treatment. If it were, there would be an appreciable difference in pre- and post-op suicides. On the other hand, [proper medication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8839957/) eliminates dysphoria. If someone had healthy eyesight, but self-identified/felt themselves to be a blind person, would you permit them to permanently damage their eyes to conform to their discordant worldview, or would you try to identify and treat the actual origin of the cognitive dissonance?

* 🟩 **[Otherwise-Echidna](https://www.reddit.com/user/Otherwise-Echidna)** ⬆️ 5 _(2020-02-12 16:01:47)_

	So a bit late here, but I'm a psychiatrist who has worked with individuals with gender dysphoria in various capacities. I noticed that you posted "Gender Dysphoria is a mental illness for which currently the best available treatment is transitioning."

	FWIW, I actually disagree with the last part of this. I think your original sentiment is maybe not quite right but I do think the focus on transitioning is shortsighted, and I don't think it's always the best outcome. 

	The part where I'd disagree with your original statement is "we've stopped looking for the cure because society is now forced into accepting transgenders." 

	The problem is dysphoria related to gender identity. What I see as not really being explored often enough is accepting trans or nonbinary identity as a state of existence, helping people with gender dysphoria to be more comfortable with that. That is, "I am trans" or "I am nonbinary" as opposed "I need to pursue transition or sex reassignment surgery to address my dysphoria." I think part of the problem is getting caught up in the idea of "male vs female" as opposed to "male vs female vs trans vs nonbinary vs..." To me, sex reassignment surgery is just getting caught up in that false dichotomy and reinforcing it. 

	Studies of sex reassignment surgeries are not nearly as rigorous as some advocates would have you believe. There are studies of them, and they suggest that about a 1/3 or more of people who have them continue to have the same level of problems or greater problems afterward. There's also not a lot of great controls in these studies, basically because it would be highly unethical, so it's hard to really know what the true effect of surgery is versus some other course of action that could be taken that might have been more helpful.

	My sense is that a lot of people would be better served by embracing trans identity per se, rather than thinking they need a surgical procedure to "become male" or "become female". That is, "transitioning" as an ideal might not be for everyone, as opposed to learning to embrace some kind of other gender identity that's more mixed and unavoidable in my opinion anyway (in that even with sex reassignment surgery, one is still not male or female in the same sense of someone genetically male or female).

		This just sounds like "conversion therapy" with more words though. Studies suggest "accepting that you are trans as a state of being" does absolutely nothing good, these people go through life tense and depressed and actively repressing their urge to transition, and very often they end up transitioning later in life anyway. This is the same for a not-insignificant number of people who detransition, some even denouncing the idea of being transgender entirely--many of them go on to later *retransition*.
		
		Those who consider themselves some mixture of both may end up getting some surgeries and not others, some may go on hormones and nothing else, some identify as non-binary and take very surface-level steps to masculinize or feminize themselves (body building, shaving/epilating, etc), etc. But for binary trans people who feel strong gender dysphoria, trying to instead just say "well I know you hate your body and that sucks but have you just tried...y'know, living with it?" seems shortsighted at best, cruel at worst.
		
		Also, I can't help but notice you have a throwaway account and this is the only comment you've made on this account, *ever*. I want people to take your claims with some *heavy* skepticism and to not accept them simply because an anonymous person makes a claim of authority on the subject by claiming they are a psychiatrist that works with people with gender dysphoria. *Many* people tend to hop onto these gender identity discussions with some major bad faith involved, and concern trolling is an issue. People will often make claims that are seemingly reasonable until you stop to actually think about them for more than ten seconds.
		
		People like this will often make claims of "bad data", "politically motivated data", "suppressing the dissenting opinions" (if anybody is has interacted with climate change denial enthusiasts this one should ring very familiar), and more.
		
		Just stop and think about it for a second. Even if the person I am speaking to is 100% legitimate, are *they* really the true arbiter of the actual way to help transgender people, and *not* the consensus of all the top medical associations in the world who say transition and societal acceptance is the most effective treatment we have?

	I see transgender operations and drugs as the wrong decision. Acceptance and appreciation of the body you have can be far healthier for the long term. Mutalation so you can look in the mirror to see what's not really there does and can cause many suicides and depression. 

	I can't change OPs mind. The issue is complicated but I just see it no different to the lizard lady, dog man or who ever uses medical treatment to change physically. It's not a fix. There is a problem.

	I couldn't do a better, more comprehensive answer than that sublime reply from [u/Mikeman7918](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mikeman7918), that was an excellent comment.

	My experience was the opposite of yours Op, i met my first transgender woman when i was in my early teens, she was one of the most beautiful, empathetic &amp; courageous people i'd ever met, this was when transphobia was rampant, most of them hid behind the facade of being cross dressers for entertainment purposes, if they ventured out in public at all, &amp; then, only in safe places frequented by other trans, gay/lesbian folks, &amp; even those places could be dangerous because gay/trans bashing was a favourite pastime for those with sickening black &amp; white,  wrath of god type views.   

	Looking back, my thoughts on the matter were that if she truly felt there was no other recourse for happiness &amp; she felt a fundamental need to change from her birth identity,  because to live any other way would result in a lifetime of distress, then the obvious consequence would be to accept that without metamorphosis, she would never feel right about who she was.

	I think if anyone genuinely put themselves in a trans persons shoes &amp; were forced to dress, act, look &amp; behave in perpetuation opposite to the gender you felt a natural affinity to - of course it makes sense to see it as a potentially endless torment, my understanding was that this was no mere desire, it was a sincere need.

	If we acknowledge how hard it would be for us to live a lifetime in a skin that didn't fit, it's only a short jump to realise that others are deserving of compassion for enduring a life - living in an alien body.

	Most folks can understand &amp; make that jump, sadly, some will never be able to overcome their distaste for others outside the accepted constructs that society so far deems *'normal'*, their apathy will never allow them any further insight into the complexity of the human condition because their compassion doesn't stretch that far, that my friend, is far worse a way to live &amp; be than trans folk, who simply want access to the acceptance that others in society take for granted.

	I am not a psychiatrist of course, but I sometimes wonder if transgender people would transition if society didn’t have our current gender norms. For example: would a trans man feel the need to transition if it was more accepted for a woman to simply be really masculine? Or when it was more accepted for a man to be really feminine. Or does body dysmorphia play a big part in it?

	I personally don’t really like those gender norms because I think that people should be free to express themselves how they see fit as long as it is not harmful to themselves and others.

	[Here is a journal from the society for neuroscience a month ago](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/12/191202135655.htm) studying it.

	Well, I will tell you this. 

	We arent really sure what makes people trans or causes gender dysphoria. It likely has to do with a hormone imbalance while in the womb during pregnancy, but there is no clear answer. Hormone therapy to reverse this has proven highly ineffective. Conversion therapy is also a violation of basic human rights because of the way they treat people, and is also proven to be highly ineffective.

	So...we dont really have a "cure". We don't really even know much about it, hence why gender dysphoria remains in the DSM (as it should) until we can better figure out how to help and treat trans people in a more clinical setting. 

	The highly concerning thing about gender dysphoria (and why it remains in the DSM, to the dismay of progressives, and I am a staunch believer that it needs to stay) is because so many other mental health issues stem from it that it needs to be treated as its own separate diagnosis. It needs to be treated differently than just major depression or generalized anxiety, it simply wont cut it in this situation. Social attitudes definitely have something to do with it, but again we arent quite sure. 

	The best you can do is dont treat trans people like shit. All it does is make someone's mental illness worse. You don't have to like it, or even understand it but just be nice because it's what decent humans do. What someone else does doesnt really affect you, you know?
