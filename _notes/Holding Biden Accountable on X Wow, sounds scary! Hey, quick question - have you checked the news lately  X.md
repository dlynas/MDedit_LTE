Wow, sounds scary! Hey, quick question - have you checked the news lately?

lawful protesting isn't even possible in authoritarian societies like the one Trump wants to transform America into. Just saying.



That is unlawful protesting. You do not have an absolute right to protest wherever and however you want just because you're shrieking about Palestine.

If your protest has a permit, its a parade not a protest.

Have you heard this before?

What if it's not lawful protesting the 1st amendment doesn't mean protest however you want

Have i seen hundreds of protests across America for the last six months? Why yes i have. Lots of protests in Russia or China these days?

He’s a Biden troll and a thug

Why? What has been in the news lately? Cause it can't be protests, since Biden doesn't allow those.

If only we had, eyes, and video, and people there to post such things

Have you ever read a history book?

He's a bit busy posting edits from foxnews

No need to transform. America is already there.

I seem to remember protests happening when Trump was president. I can't remember if any peaceful protestors were tear gassed, thrown to the ground like rag dolls, or had their futures threatened.

I've never understood why the desire to return to one's ancestral homeland after 2,000 years is considered legitimate and reasonable but the desire to return to one's family home after 80 years is considered unreasonable romanticism and an "obstacle to peace"

Leftist critique of POTUS - started with Trump, now on Biden. Bad things are still bad when Dems do them. Tracking how "nothing would fundamentally change."
