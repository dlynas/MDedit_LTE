					Shows what you don’t know about the Arab world. You think Saudi Arabia and Egypt are handing out dollars for this? No? Because SA doesn’t support Palestine and is actively developing relations with Israel and Egypt’s strategy (they don’t have money to hand out) is to allow Palestinians to suffer pathetically in the hopes that the international community will finally recognize right of return. Maybe you meant Iraq. I’m sure paying US protesters is worth every penny out of struggling Iraq’s meager coffers. Does war-torn Syria have an easy way to funnel money to the US? Oh wait…Libya. No - Tunisia….

							I never said the genocide in Gaza is the reason why Tiktok is being banned. It's clear that there are compounding reasons as to why US lawmakers would want to get rid of it. It would be moronic to claim that what my first sentence says is true. I'm simply pointing out the hypocrisy of people worrying over the data TikTok harvests because it's China. 
							
							But it would also be idiotic to deny that TikTok is *not* important to reveal world events like this. Israel / AIPAC isn't why Tiktok is being banned, but they sure as hell supported the fuck out of it, for obvious reasons. Twitter / X is more of a cesspool than TikTok, and the problems Musk has brought to it make it way less viable as a way to virally propagate world events / news. For better or worse, it's the only way to shove news in the face of people.

								I agree, that would be moronic and I'm glad you clarified your stance, but this is what I was originally commenting about:
								
								>And congress wants to ban tik tok because it's showing Us citizens what is really happening in Gaza. They want us complicit and quiet, not informed and pissed.
								
								You jumped into this thread by acting as if the government is some big scary Boogeyman with zero accountability. I keep highlighting the specific committee that sponsored this to point out that this is one small cog in the machine whose sole purpose is Chinese foreign relations and they've been working on this for quite some time now.
								
								>For better or worse, it's the only way to shove news in the face of people.
								
								We're talking mega media entities, not some altruistic platform for the unheard - you're just as likely to be fed propaganda as any other platform. Also, this is all assuming bytedance chooses not to sell and lose all their money from it... Which is doubtful.

							But I would appreciate greatly if you gave me the specific name of this bill. MSM and new google never fails to be as useless as a pile of dumb rocks. From all the articles and sources I've read about it and its contents, not one lists the name of the bill. It doesn't help that individual states have had this going on too. 
							
							If the ban is only being applied to select devices and areas like US institutional devices and the like, that is fine. But a nationwide ban that bars even normal citizens on their own personal devices? That last part I can't get behind.

								>But a nationwide ban that bars even normal citizens on their own personal devices? That last part I can't get behind.
								
								Either bytedance divests and tiktok continues as is, or they don't and things close down (just as China has done with every major social media platform based on the US, and most likely a competitor fills the void). 
								
								We 100% need more regulation on our privacy and data - most importantly regarding our own government/private entities - but barring foreign governments from harvesting our data is a no-brainer. At least regulation at home is possible, but there's no reigns on what a foreign entity can do with your data.

										That's fair lol, it's not the most intuitive site but once you know what you're loosely searching for it gets easier. 
										
										I just searched "tiktok" under legislation and found the one marked "passed house" and sponsored by Mike Gallagher. There are several others regarding data security that have simply been introduced.
										
										Alternatively, if you know the sponsor of the bill you can search by congressperson.
										
										It's a great tool and I highly recommend taking a look - at least at the summaries - of bills that are floating around in pop culture to see whether the media narrative lines up or not. 
										
										Every news article you see on this, is an outright ban, but the bill is half about timelines of a sale. Bytedance isn't just going to throw away ~$10b, and tiktok most likely won't even have a downtime.

				It’s insane how people haven’t woken up to the propaganda and blatant control in this country. Most people are either ignorant or lying to themselves in the face of this situation. 
				
				We have the media trying to label these college kids “pro-terrorists” because they don’t like that they’re holding up a free Palestine sign. You can protest anything but Israel. What a bunch of scumbags the leaders are in this country and the bunch of follower idiots who believe their shit.

					Trust and believe that recent events are definitely helping the general population become aware of what's going on.
					
					The fact is that they literally control many aspects of our country, from our politicians to our media, to our college campuses. But, historically, saying that outloud has been met with harsh criticisms of antisemitism. They basically hide behind their faith.
					
					Its the 1% of the 1% doing this. Some of em arent even Jewish (looking at you Biden), just hardcore Zionist for whatever reason.

		We believe that Zionism is an extension of settler-colonialism, and that its’ current actions following 7 October is ethnic cleansing at “best,” and genocide at worst. 
		
		We have no tolerance for it, and this community is meant to be a haven against it in the sea of hasbara. 
		
		Pro-Zionist takes will be deleted, and those espousing it will be banned indefinitely. 
		
		Yes - this is a “safe space” and an “echo chamber” - 
		
		We get enough hasbara elsewhere, we don't need to deal with yours too.
