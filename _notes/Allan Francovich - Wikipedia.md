**Allan James Francovich** (March 23, 1941 – April 17, 1997)<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Francovich#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> was an American film maker. He is best known for creating a number of films critical of the [Central Intelligence Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency "Central Intelligence Agency") (CIA), linking them to terrorist attacks during the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War "Cold War") in Africa, South America and Europe. The most notable of these are the _Gladio_ (1992) series about [Operation Gladio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gladio "Operation Gladio") which featured on [BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC "BBC")'s _[Timewatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timewatch "Timewatch")_ and _[The Maltese Double Cross – Lockerbie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Maltese_Double_Cross_%E2%80%93_Lockerbie "The Maltese Double Cross – Lockerbie")_ (1994) about [Pan Am Flight 103](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Am_Flight_103 "Pan Am Flight 103").

## Background\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Allan_Francovich&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Background")\]

Francovich was born in [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City"), to a [Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jews "American Jews") engineering family.<sup id="cite_ref-indi_2-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Francovich#cite_note-indi-2">[2]</a></sup> His father, Aldo Francovich, worked as a mining engineer for Cerro de Pasco mining company in [Peru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru "Peru"); as a child he lived in high altitude mining towns and witnessed the extreme poverty of the miners. He attended an elite preparatory school in Lima then came to the U.S. to attend Notre Dame University, where he completed a B.A. He lived in Paris for several years, studying freelance at the Sorbonne before coming to Berkeley. There he finished an M.A. in Dramatic Arts at UC, Berkeley; he also studied film briefly at Stanford and received a grant to study film from the [American Film Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute "American Film Institute") in 1970. He and translator and writer [Kathleen Weaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Weaver "Kathleen Weaver") were married in 1970; the two separated amicably and were divorced in 1986. She collaborated on his films during the time of their marriage.<sup id="cite_ref-indy_3-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Francovich#cite_note-indy-3">[3]</a></sup>

## Lockerbie bombing\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Allan_Francovich&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Lockerbie bombing")\]

Allan Francovich produced, wrote and directed _[The Maltese Double Cross – Lockerbie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Maltese_Double_Cross_%E2%80%93_Lockerbie "The Maltese Double Cross – Lockerbie")_, a documentary which challenged the official view that Libya was responsible for the sabotage of [Pan Am Flight 103](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Am_Flight_103 "Pan Am Flight 103"). Instead, an unwitting drug mule, with links to [Hezbollah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah "Hezbollah") and to both the [Drug Enforcement Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_Enforcement_Administration "Drug Enforcement Administration") (DEA) and the CIA, was argued to have carried the bomb on board the aircraft. The documentary was funded by [Tiny Rowland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_Rowland "Tiny Rowland").

When his British production company, Hemar Enterprises, released the film in November 1994, it was immediately threatened with legal action by lawyers acting for a US government official (believed to have been the DEA's Michael Hurley). Screenings of the film at the 1994 London Film Festival, at the [Institute of Contemporary Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Contemporary_Arts "Institute of Contemporary Arts") and at several universities were prevented. But Labour MP [Tam Dalyell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tam_Dalyell "Tam Dalyell") ignored libel warnings and went ahead and showed the film at the [House of Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_House_of_Commons "British House of Commons") on November 16, 1994.

[Channel 4 television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_4 "Channel 4") decided to broadcast the film in Britain on May 11, 1995. A spokeswoman responded to critics of the decision by saying that "it needed to be shown to a wider public".<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Francovich#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>

### Letter to _The Guardian_\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Allan_Francovich&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Letter to The Guardian")\]

The day after the Channel 4 broadcast, _[The Guardian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian "The Guardian")_ published a letter from Francovich headed "The Lockerbie smears":<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Francovich#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

> The attacks by the UK and US authorities on my film _The Maltese Double Cross_ (UK and US scorn Lockerbie film, May 11) are exactly what we predicted would happen. The aim is to smear people in the film in order to divert attention from the mass of evidence that supports our claims.
> 
> The film shows how Lockerbie was masterminded by [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran "Iran") and [Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria "Syria"), not [Libya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya "Libya"), and that the bomb got on the plane through a botched US intelligence operation based on Middle East drugs and hostages. Elements within western intelligence knew what was happening but failed to act. The authorities can never admit this, as to do so would make [Watergate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate "Watergate") look like a vicar's tea party.
> 
> The smears referred to have been circulating for years and have been used to attack anyone who has suggested that US government agencies have dirty hands in the affair. The latest round of attacks was begun in a letter to [Tam Dalyell MP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tam_Dalyell "Tam Dalyell") by a Todd Leventhal, of the [US Information Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Information_Agency "United States Information Agency"), who has the [Orwellian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell "George Orwell") title "Program Officer for Countering Disinformation and Misinformation". It is disturbing that the supposedly independent Scottish [Crown Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Office "Crown Office") should choose to repeat Leventhal's allegations without question.
> 
> The full Crown Office statement states that the Lord Advocate deprecates all attempts to give a version of the Lockerbie story while criminal proceedings are pending. It goes on: "The proper place for such issues to be explored is in a criminal court."
> 
> This argument was substantially undermined on November 15, 1991, only a day after the indictments were issued against the two Libyan accused. On that day the [US State Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_State_Department "US State Department") issued "fact sheets" which detailed the evidence against the two accused. The information they contained has been repeated in numerous media reports and at least two books published in the UK since that time. One of the media reports was an item about how the Scottish and US authorities "solved" the [Lockerbie case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigation_into_the_bombing_of_Pan_Am_Flight_103 "Investigation into the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103"), contained in a [BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC "BBC") "How Do They Do That?" programme broadcast on February 15, 1994. It featured the former [Chief Constable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Constable "Chief Constable") of [Dumfries and Galloway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumfries_and_Galloway "Dumfries and Galloway"), John Boyd. So far as we are aware, neither the Crown Office nor the [Lord Advocate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Advocate "Lord Advocate") ever issued similarly critical statements against the BBC, John Boyd, or any of the other broadcasters, newspapers or book publishers which have raked over the evidence.
> 
> The British and US authorities insist that the Lockerbie case is still open. Yet during the months my team has been investigating the subject, not one approach has been made by these authorities to see any of the new evidence we have gathered. Is it any wonder that the Libyans are reluctant to stand trial in [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland "Scotland") or the US?

Because of the likelihood of legal action, _The Maltese Double Cross - Lockerbie_ has never been publicly screened in America. It can however be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0B5hv6scbBo) on the internet, by scrolling down to _Allan Francovich - The Maltese Double Cross_.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Francovich#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>

## Death\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Allan_Francovich&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Death")\]

Francovich suffered a fatal heart attack in a Customs area at [George Bush Intercontinental Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bush_Intercontinental_Airport "George Bush Intercontinental Airport") in Houston, Texas, on April 17, 1997, whilst entering the United States from England; he was 56.<sup id="cite_ref-indy_3-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Francovich#cite_note-indy-3">[3]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-indi_2-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Francovich#cite_note-indi-2">[2]</a></sup>

His films and papers are archived by the [Pacific Film Archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Film_Archive "Pacific Film Archive"), in Berkeley, California.

## Reception\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Allan_Francovich&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Reception")\]

[John Pilger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Pilger "John Pilger") described Francovich's films as "extraordinary" political documentary films, with particular praise for _The Maltese Double Cross_ - which "destroyed the official truth that Libya was responsible".<sup id="cite_ref-R000777_7-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Francovich#cite_note-R000777-7">[7]</a></sup> Lee Kreindler, the head of a legal team for American families of Pan Am 103 victims, alleged that Francovich approached the American families and misrepresented himself by not mentioning the [Libyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya "Libya") financing of the film and by saying he was a friend of John Merritt, a journalist from _[The Observer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Observer "The Observer")_ who had the respect of the American families. Daniel Cohen, the father of Pan Am 103 victim Theodora Cohen, said that in his eyes Francovich was "completely discredited" since Francovich did not mention the Libyan financing. [Jim Swire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Swire "Jim Swire"), the head of a British Pan Am 103 family group, supported Francovich.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Francovich#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>
