## Midwestern Marx claiming that a “labor dictatorship” in Southern US was actually the first example of communism, before the Paris Commune.

> In a recent video Carlos L. Garrido claims that there was a “dictatorship of labor” that existed in the Southern US after the Civil War, and that this and not the Paris Commune is actually the first example of communism. He claims the US protected this “dictatorship of labor” with military force. I’ve never heard such a claim and I’m having a hard time finding any information. He says more that I honestly have a hard time believing and agreeing with his conclusions on.

	I think he means du Bois' theory that during the Reconstruction Era there was effectively a Black dictatorship of the proletariat. Du Bois argues this in Black Reconstruction in America. I'm not American and don't have the necessary knowledge about American history to make a judgement here.

		To be fair, most of us Americans also do not have the necessary knowledge of American history about this either, it is deeply buried and papered over. For most Americans history begins some time around the bombing of Pearl Harbor.

		Can you explain a little more? In what ways are they patsocs? I've heard them spouting off historical myths like that Marx and Lincoln were pen pals but I've never heard them go far enough for me to think they're patsocs

			I'm curious too. They started popping up in my YouTube recommended and I haven't seen anything from them I don't like yet, but I'd like to know if there's something problematic about them.

			They have repeatedly defended Jackson Hinkle, calling him a friend of their show.
			
			They have literally defended American patriotic "socialism" with Hinkle on their channel.

			They do all kinds of mental gymnastics to call China socialist and how they're gonna kickstart the global communist movement, they support Russia constantly spouting that they fight nazis without any material analysis.

				I think the jury is still out on China, we just have to wait and see. But they're definitely a geopolitical force for good, and represent a progressive force in the sense of breaking the shackles of imperialism and rentier finance in favor of a cooperative industrial capitalism.

	Also, there is zero legitimacy to the claim that the era Black reconstruction created a proletarian dictatorship. Highly recommend reading the book Hammer and Hoe, where the fight for self determination in the 30s the emphasized

		Why do you oppose Du Bois' thesis?

			From what I’ve seen it’s flawed, even the subtitle on his work related to this mentions “Reconstructing Democracy in America.” There never was, and never has been Democracy in America. So while I respect him I find his reasoning to be flawed.
			
			It would be ignorant of me not to read his entire essay though as it has been nicely provided to me by another commenter. So I will read the entire thing and see what I think. I have a ton of respect for the man himself so I wouldn’t doubt that his work is legitimate, I do not trust this Midwestern Marx guy to properly frame it though. The way he tries to reclaim “patriotism” in a settler colonial country really just rubs me the wrong way. The more I read I think it’s the way he presents the information in the video itself and not actually that the date he is using or that Du Bois’ work itself is false.

				Black Reconstruction is a thoroughly Marxist work. It's not flawed. Reconstruction was a specific historical juncture where the Bougeriose's hand was forced to uphold a dictatorship of labor in the south due to fears of a black rebellion after the slaves demonstrated intense class consciousness bringing the south to its knees in a general strike. They were also armed after fighting in the civil war. During this labor dictatorship and democracy the black workers advanced the most progressive policies the United States has ever seen.
				
				E: I watched some of the video. Ironically, they are trying to use Black Reconstruction for settler apologia and as a tool against "identity politics". Anyone who has read Black Reconstruction knows that Du Bois describes in detail the white settlers collaboration with south landowners to oppose the black labor dictatorship, and that the work is a precursor and inspiration to Sakai's Settlers.

					Yep this was my point, they subverted Dubois original thesis

					A dictatorship of the proles in what sense? 
					
					Did they abolish profit, seized their MOP and started centrally planning ?

		They definitely were not pro-bourgeois or supported by the bourgeoisie though.
