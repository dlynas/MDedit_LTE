The **World Bank Group** (**WBG**) is a family of five [international organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_organization "International organization") that make [leveraged loans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leveraged_loan "Leveraged loan") to [developing countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_countries "Developing countries"). It is the largest and best-known [development bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_bank "Development bank") in the world and an observer at the [United Nations Development Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Development_Group "United Nations Development Group").<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> The bank is headquartered in [Washington, D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C. "Washington, D.C."), in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States"). It provided around $98.83 billion in loans and assistance to "developing" and transition countries in the 2021 fiscal year.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> The bank's stated mission is to achieve the twin goals of ending extreme poverty and building shared prosperity.<sup id="cite_ref-bicusa1_9-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-bicusa1-9">[9]</a></sup> Total lending as of 2015 for the last 10 years through Development Policy Financing was approximately $117 billion.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> Its five organizations are

-   the [International Bank for Reconstruction and Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank_for_Reconstruction_and_Development "International Bank for Reconstruction and Development") (IBRD),
-   the [International Development Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Development_Association "International Development Association") (IDA),
-   the [International Finance Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Finance_Corporation "International Finance Corporation") (IFC),
-   the [Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilateral_Investment_Guarantee_Agency "Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency") (MIGA) and
-   the [International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Centre_for_Settlement_of_Investment_Disputes "International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes") (ICSID).

The first two are sometimes collectively referred to as the [World Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank "World Bank").

The activities of the World Bank (the IBRD and IDA) focus on [developing countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country "Developing country"), in fields such as human development (e.g. education, health), agriculture and [rural development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_development "Rural development") (e.g. irrigation and rural services), environmental protection (e.g. pollution reduction, establishing and enforcing regulations), infrastructure (e.g. roads, urban regeneration, and electricity), large industrial construction projects, and governance (e.g. anti-corruption, legal institutions development). The IBRD and IDA provide loans at preferential rates to member countries, as well as grants to the poorest countries. Loans or grants for specific projects are often linked to wider policy changes in the sector or the country's economy as a whole. For example, a loan to improve coastal environmental management may be linked to the development of new environmental institutions at national and local levels and the implementation of new regulations to limit pollution.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>

## History\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_Bank_Group&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")\]

### Founding\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_Bank_Group&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Founding")\]

The WBG came into formal existence on 27 December [1946](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1946 "1946") following international ratification of the [Bretton Woods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system "Bretton Woods system") agreements, which emerged from the [United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_Conference "Bretton Woods Conference") (1â€“22 July 1944). It also provided the foundation of the [Osiander Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Osiander_Committee&action=edit&redlink=1 "Osiander Committee (page does not exist)") in 1951, responsible for the preparation and evaluation of the [World Development Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Development_Report "World Development Report"). Commencing operations on 25 June 1946, it approved its first loan on 9 May 1947 (USD 250M to France for postwar reconstruction, in real terms the largest loan the bank has issued to date).

## Membership\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_Bank_Group&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Membership")\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/The_World_Bank_Group.jpg/220px-The_World_Bank_Group.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_World_Bank_Group.jpg)

The World Bank Sign on the building

Together with four affiliated agencies created between 1957 and 1988, the IBRD is part of the World Bank Group. The group's headquarters are in [Washington, D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C. "Washington, D.C.") It is an international organization owned by member governments; although it makes profits, they are used to support continued efforts in poverty reduction.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>

Technically the World Bank is part of the United Nations system,<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> but its governance structure is different: each institution in the World Bank Group is owned by its member governments, which subscribe to its basic share capital, with votes proportional to shareholding. Membership gives certain voting rights that are the same for all countries but there are also additional votes that depend on financial contributions to the organization. The president of the World Bank is nominated by the president of the United States and elected by the bank's Board of Governors.<sup id="cite_ref-WBA_16-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-WBA-16">[16]</a></sup> As of 15 November 2009, the United States held 16.4% of total votes, Japan 7.9%, Germany 4.5%, the United Kingdom 4.3%, and France 4.3%. As changes to the bank's Charter require an 85% supermajority, the U.S. can block any major change in the bank's governing structure.<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> Because the U.S. exerts formal and informal influence over the bank as a result of its vote share, control over the presidency, and the bank's headquarters location in Washington, D.C., friends and allies of the U.S. receive more projects with more lenient terms.<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup>

### World Bank Group agencies\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_Bank_Group&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: World Bank Group agencies")\]

The World Bank Group consists of

-   the [International Bank for Reconstruction and Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank_for_Reconstruction_and_Development "International Bank for Reconstruction and Development") (IBRD), established in 1944, which provides debt financing based on sovereign guarantees;
-   the [International Finance Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Finance_Corporation "International Finance Corporation") (IFC), established in 1956, which provides various forms of financing without sovereign guarantees, primarily to the private sector;
-   the [International Development Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Development_Association "International Development Association") (IDA), established in 1960, which provides concessional financing (interest-free loans or grants), usually with sovereign guarantees;
-   the [International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Centre_for_Settlement_of_Investment_Disputes "International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes") (ICSID), established in 1965, which works with governments to reduce investment risk;
-   the [Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilateral_Investment_Guarantee_Agency "Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency") (MIGA), established in 1988, which provides insurance against certain types of risk, including political risk, primarily to the private sector.

The term "[World Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank "World Bank")" generally refers to just the IBRD and IDA, whereas the term "World Bank Group" or "WBG" is used to refer to all five institutions collectively.<sup id="cite_ref-WBA_16-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-WBA-16">[16]</a></sup>

The [World Bank Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Institute "World Bank Institute") is the capacity development branch of the World Bank, providing learning and other capacity-building programs to member countries.

The IBRD has 189 member governments, and the other institutions have between 153 and 184.<sup id="cite_ref-WBG_Member_Countries_2-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-WBG_Member_Countries-2">[2]</a></sup> The institutions of the World Bank Group are all run by a board of governors meeting once a year.<sup id="cite_ref-WBA_16-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-WBA-16">[16]</a></sup> Each member country appoints a governor, generally its minister of finance. Daily, the World Bank Group is run by a board of 25 executive directors to whom the governors have delegated certain powers. Each director represents either one country (for the largest countries), or a group of countries. Executive directors are appointed by their respective governments or the constituencies.<sup id="cite_ref-WBA_16-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-WBA-16">[16]</a></sup>

The agencies of the World Bank are each governed by their Articles of Agreement that serves as the legal and institutional foundation for all their work.<sup id="cite_ref-WBA_16-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-WBA-16">[16]</a></sup>

The activities of the [IFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Finance_Corporation "International Finance Corporation") and [MIGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilateral_Investment_Guarantee_Agency "Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency") include investment in the private sector and providing insurance, respectively.

### Presidency\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_Bank_Group&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Presidency")\]

Traditionally, the bank president has been a U.S. citizen nominated by the president of the United States, the bank's largest shareholder. The nominee is subject to confirmation by the executive directors, to serve a five-year, renewable term.<sup id="cite_ref-WBA_16-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-WBA-16">[16]</a></sup>

#### Current president\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_Bank_Group&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Current president")\]

[Ajay Banga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajay_Banga "Ajay Banga") is the current and 14th [President of the World Bank Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_World_Bank_Group "President of the World Bank Group").

### Managing director\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_Bank_Group&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Managing director")\]

The managing director of the World Bank is responsible for organizational strategy; budget and strategic planning; information technology; shared services; Corporate Procurement; General Services and Corporate Security; the Sanctions System; and the Conflict Resolution and Internal Justice System. The present managing director, Shaolin Yang, assumed the office after [Sri Mulyani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Mulyani "Sri Mulyani") resigned to become finance minister of [Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia "Indonesia").<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> The managing director and World Bank Group chief financial officer is Anshula Kant since 7 October 2019.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup>

### \[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_Bank_Group&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Extractive Industries Review")\]

After longstanding criticisms from [civil society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society "Civil society") of the bank's involvement in the oil, gas, and [mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_industry "Mining industry") sectors, the World Bank in July 2001 launched an independent review called the _Extractive Industries Review_ (EIRâ€”not to be confused with [Environmental Impact Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_assessment "Environmental impact assessment")). The review was headed by an "Eminent Person", [Emil Salim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Salim "Emil Salim") (former Environment Minister of Indonesia). Salim held consultations with a wide range of stakeholders in 2002 and 2003. The EIR recommendations were published in January 2004 in a final report, "Striking a Better Balance".<sup id="cite_ref-SBB_22-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-SBB-22">[22]</a></sup> The report concluded that fossil fuel and mining projects do not alleviate poverty, and recommended that World Bank involvement with these sectors be phased out by 2008 to be replaced by investment in [renewable energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy "Renewable energy") and [clean energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy "Sustainable energy"). The World Bank published its Management Response to the EIR in September 2004<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> after extensive discussions with the board of directors. The Management Response did not accept many of the EIR report's conclusions, but the EIR served to alter the World Bank's policies on oil, gas, and mining in important ways, as the World Bank documented in a recent follow-up report.<sup id="cite_ref-OGMC_24-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-OGMC-24">[24]</a></sup> One area of particular controversy concerned the rights of indigenous peoples. Critics point out that the Management Response weakened a key recommendation that indigenous peoples and affected communities should have to provide 'consent for projects to proceed; instead, there would be 'consultation'.<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> Following the EIR process, the World Bank issued a revised Policy on Indigenous Peoples.<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup>

[The World Bank has long been criticized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank#Criticisms "World Bank") by a range of non-governmental organizations and academics, notably including its former chief economist [Joseph Stiglitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz "Joseph Stiglitz"), who is equally critical of the [International Monetary Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund "International Monetary Fund"), the [US Treasury Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Treasury_Department "US Treasury Department"), and the US and other developed country trade negotiators.<sup id="cite_ref-stiglitz_27-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-stiglitz-27">[27]</a></sup> Critics argue that the so-called [free market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market "Free market") reform policiesâ€”which the bank advocates in many casesâ€”in practice are often harmful to [economic development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development "Economic development") if implemented badly, too quickly ("[shock therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_therapy_(economics) "Shock therapy (economics)")"), in the wrong sequence, or in very weak, uncompetitive economies.<sup id="cite_ref-stiglitz_27-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-stiglitz-27">[27]</a></sup> World Bank loan agreements can also force procurements of goods and services at uncompetitive, non-free-market, prices.<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 5">:â€Š5â€Š</span></sup>â€Š Other critical writers, such as [John Perkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perkins_(author) "John Perkins (author)"), label the international financial institutions as 'illegal and illegitimate and a cog of coercive American diplomacy in carrying out financial terrorism.<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup>

In _Masters of Illusion: The World Bank and the Poverty of Nations_ (1996), Catherine Caufield argues that the assumptions and structure of the World Bank operation ultimately harm developing nations rather than promote them. Caufield first criticizes the highly homogenized and Western recipes of "development" the bank holds. To the World Bank, different nations and regions are indistinguishable and ready to receive the "uniform remedy of development". The danger of this assumption is that to attain even small portions of success, Western approaches to life are adopted and traditional economic structures and values are abandoned. A second assumption is that poor countries cannot modernize without money and advice from abroad.

Several intellectuals in developing countries have argued that the World Bank is deeply implicated in contemporary modes of donor and NGO-driven imperialism and that its intellectual contribution functions, primarily, to seek to blame the poor for their condition.<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup>

Defenders of the World Bank contend that no country is forced to borrow its money. The bank provides both loans and grants. Even the loans are concessional since they are given to countries that have no access to international [capital markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_market "Capital market"). Furthermore, the loans, both to poor and middle-income countries, are below market-value [interest rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate "Interest rate"). The World Bank argues that it can help development more through loans than grants because money repaid on the loans can then be lent for other projects.

Criticism was also expressed towards the IFC and MIGA and their way of evaluating the social and environmental impact of their projects. Critics state that even though IFC and MIGA have more of these standards than the World Bank, they mostly rely on private-sector clients to monitor their implementation and miss an independent monitoring institution in this context. This is why an extensive review of the institutions' implementation strategy of social and environmental standards is demanded.<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup>

The World Bank was the subject of a scandal with its then-president [Paul Wolfowitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Wolfowitz "Paul Wolfowitz") and his aide, [Shaha Riza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaha_Riza "Shaha Riza"), in 2007.<sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup>

According to reports citing a recording of a 2018 staff meeting shared by a [whistleblower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower "Whistleblower"), World Bank staff were informed Robert Malpass, a recent economics graduate of [Cornell University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University "Cornell University") and the son of [David Malpass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Malpass "David Malpass"), then US [Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_Secretary_of_the_Treasury_for_International_Affairs "Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs") and later [President of the World Bank Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_World_Bank_Group "President of the World Bank Group"), would be hired as an analyst in July of that year. On the recording, staff were reportedly told Robert Malpass was a "prince" and an "important little fellow" who could go "running to daddy." Bank officials also believed David Malpass was more influential than then-[US Treasury Secretary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Treasury_Secretary "US Treasury Secretary") [Steven Mnuchin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Mnuchin "Steven Mnuchin"), who they said "has little or no clue on things."<sup id="cite_ref-33"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup> In April 2018, the US Treasury had changed its position to back a $13 billion capital infusion for the bank.<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup>

### Allegations of corruption\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_Bank_Group&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Allegations of corruption")\]

[The World Bank's Integrity Vice Presidency (INT)](http://www.worldbank.org/en/about/unit/integrity-vice-presidency) is charged with the investigation of internal fraud and corruption, including complaint intake, investigation, and investigation reports.<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup>

### Investments\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_Bank_Group&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Investments")\]

The World Bank Group has also been criticized for investing in projects with human rights issues.<sup id="cite_ref-upside_down_36-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-upside_down-36">[36]</a></sup>

The [Compliance Advisor/Ombudsman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compliance_Advisor/Ombudsman "Compliance Advisor/Ombudsman") (CAO) criticized a loan the bank made to the palm oil company Dinant after the [2009 Honduran coup d'Ã©tat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Honduran_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat "2009 Honduran coup d'Ã©tat"). There have been numerous killings of Campesinos in the region where Dinant was operating.<sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup>

Other controversial investments include loans to the [Chixoy Hydroelectric Dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chixoy_Hydroelectric_Dam "Chixoy Hydroelectric Dam") in Guatemala while it was under military dictatorship, and to [Goldcorp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldcorp "Goldcorp") (then Glamis Gold) for the construction of the [Marlin Mine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlin_Mine "Marlin Mine").

In 2019, the [Congressional-Executive Commission on China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional-Executive_Commission_on_China "Congressional-Executive Commission on China") questioned the World Bank about a loan in [Xinjiang, China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang "Xinjiang"), that was used to buy high-end security gear, including surveillance equipment.<sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-39"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup> The bank launched an internal investigation in response to the allegation. In August 2020, U.S. lawmakers questioned the continued disbursement of the loan.<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup>
