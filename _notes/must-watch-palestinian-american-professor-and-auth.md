"I cannot tell you the joy I have right now, joy that I have not felt in many, many weeks,
but the joy that I feel right now in your company.
The joy in being able to gather with a testament to our ancestors, with a testament, a commitment
to the generations after us, that we are fighting, that we fought for our humanity, that we
were here, that we said no, that we gathered, that we had no fear.
I am so happy to be with you here, with the folks in the Riverside Church, with the folks
that are streaming with us.
When I thought about this evening, I did not know if I should speak to you as a teacher
and tell you about Gaza, Resid.
Should I tell you that Gaza was once a city district of historic Palestine that sits
on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, that its harbor and fertile land has made
it a focal point of trade and empire for centuries, including the Romans, the Mongols, and Napoleon's
friends.
That prior to 1948, the Gaza district contained almost 90 towns and villages.
It was 38 times larger than the current 140 square miles strip, making it the largest
district in Mandatory Palestine until Zionist militias destroyed a majority of these towns.
Should I tell you that upon Israel's establishment, a severely truncated Gaza absorbed nearly
25% of Palestinian refugees exiled from their former homes, increasing its population from
80,000 to 280,000, that that number has grown to 2.2 million today who are predominantly
refugees and children, dependent on food aid for survival.
Do I explain to you that Israel began to circumscribe this Palestinian territory in 1993 as it
was entering into the Oslo Peace Accords, that it began a process of de-development, isolation,
containment of Gaza with the intent to make it a Palestinian state-led and to instead focus
on annexing the West Bank whose land it coveted and whose natives it also sought to remove.
In this context, I can tell you that Israel imposed a land siege and a naval blockade
to be dramatically sealing this coastal enclave, placing it on a subsistence diet just above
starvation, relegating it to conditions of bear life and then systematically pummeling
it with advanced weapons technologies in a bid to take the land without the people, to
achieve in Gaza by warfare what it seeks to do in the West Bank through martial law,
in East Jerusalem through administrative law and throughout historic Palestine through civil
law. Or should I speak to you as an attorney and tell you that when Israel withdrew its
settlers and military infrastructure in 2005 that it maintained its effective control over
the population registry, the skies, the underground water sources, the electromagnetic spheres,
all points of ingress and egress and thus remains an occupying power with the duty to protect
its civilians that Israel has no right to self-defense against territory that it occupies.
It has no right to self-defense against territory that it occupies no more than Portugal had the
right to self-defense to protect its hold on Mozambique and Angola.
Should I explain that people fighting against colonial domination, alien occupation and racist
regimes, Palestinians have a right to use armed force so long as it's regulated by the laws of war.
Would it be helpful to tell you that any force must be bound by principles of distinction and
proportionality and that Israel has promised to disavow both its top military and political
brass have made clear that their purpose is destruction not accuracy. There are no Palestinian
civilians that hospitals and schools and sources of electricity and fuel are not afforded the
presumption of civilian infrastructure. Do I remind you that they have expressed a specific
intent to destroy and hold or impart a people based on the racial, ethnic, national or religious
grounds? Should I remind you that they need not kill a single person in order to be prosecuted for
the crime of intent and incitement according to the genocide convention?
Should I recite the numbers anyway that in 26 days Israel has killed more Palestinians that were
murdered in the Bosnian genocide? Do I tell you that for the past two decades Israel has not
gotten away with murder but has changed international law to make its grotesque violence permissible.
That it says Gaza is not occupied nor is it sovereign, it is a hostile entity.
That it claimed that this is not a civil war nor is it an international armed conflict but it's
a new category, an armed conflict short of war. That Palestinians participating in hostilities are
not merely legitimate targets when they pick up arms but even when they lay a sleet next to their
partners in homes filled with their families. That the lives of their soldiers are worth more than
the lives of enemy civilians and proportionality is forward looking so that untold destruction
is reasonable and recommended in the language of law. Do I remind the world? Do I remind you all
that what happens to Palestinians now sets a new precedent that means that everywhere anywhere in the globe is not safe?
No, no, no, no. I should speak to you plainly as a mother. I should tell you that my heart breaks
over and over every single day that I cannot take another image of a baby covered in dust from
the rubble that was her home gasping for air. That I cannot handle another young girl running after
her mother's corpse asking her to get up. That it pains me to watch a young boy begging the man
to bury his baby brother for a strand of hair from his baby brother's head.
But I have to admit that I am in sheer awe of what Al-Dahduh who buried his wife and his son
and his daughter who both wanted to be journalists like him and got up the next day in front of a camera
to continue to report the genocide of his people.
Shall I describe my acute stress imagining 130 newborns in NICU
at risk of death because of lack of fuel and electricity only to look up and hear anchors ask me
if the price is worth paying because some civilian life is sacred or that when I ask my cousin in
Ramallah this morning how her children are fairing she says they have learned a painful lesson
these past weeks that world powers agree that their lives are not worthy.
Do I speak to you as a Palestinian and tell you that we are a remarkable people fighting for
the noble cause of freedom that we understand clearly that this is a genocidal campaign intended
to complete the NICVA to fulfill the Zionist fantasy of a land without a people despite a
valiant people that refuse to disappear who vow to stay in their homes rather than become refugees
again who tell us Lannar Hal min Huna Lannar Hal min Huna Lannar Hal
whose pride and love and rootedness and tradition and song and prayer and belonging will forever forever
haunt settlers who build nuclear weapons, martial global superpowers and still tremble before
the truth of our existence.
We existed before Zionist colonial invasion. We exist now even among the rubble of humanity's remains.
We will exist when Zionism is dismantled bit by every racist colonial bit.
Let me speak to you as a comrade and tell you that we must fight on, that we must rest and breathe
and not tire, that our efforts are causing global vibrations and generational change.
Filling streets from London to Cairo, Amman to Beirut, Istanbul to Sanaa, shutting down Congress,
shutting down Grand Central Station, shutting down Highway 101 in San Francisco,
having the State Department official resign, a human rights officer resign,
having Chile, Colombia and Jordan rescind their ambassadors, watching Bolivia cut its diplomatic ties,
listening and witnessing 2000 plus black allies signing onto a letter in Palestine,
when 3 million Belgian unionized workers refuse to transport Israeli weapons.
We have disrupted Senate appropriations hearing asking for more money.
We have watched hundreds of artists call for a ceasefire and pull 66% of Americans that oppose
this genocide and call for a ceasefire now.
That number keeps growing and as your comrade I want to ask you and remind you that as we fight
on to be vigilant because repression is growing, to remind you that in our vigilance we can protect
ourselves, we need not power. Palestine legal, the only legal institution in the United States
dedicated to protecting activists and allies in order to keep fighting has documented 400 incidents
of harassment, abuse, doxing in the past three weeks alone on average annually they document 200
to 300 incidents. But in the past three weeks 400 incidents alone, law students who had their
offers rescinded medical residents who have been fired, editors and chiefs of art magazines who
have been fired, fashion magazine or excuse me entertainment agency executives who have been set
aside for opposing genocide. And while this racist war-mongering media and political establishment
has led to the stabbing of a six year old Walid Fa'uni, 26 times in his home in Illinois.
And the murder of a Muslim woman in Texas, the Biden administration is mobilizing law enforcement
to surveil social media of university students struggling for Palestinian liberation."
