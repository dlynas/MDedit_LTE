## Your trauma explains why you might behave the way you do. It does not justify your behavior. 

If you justify hurting someone else because of your own past experiences, then you will continue the cycle of pain - and it will perpetually continue. We are responsible for our healing, even when we are not responsible for what happened to us. 

Let this be a reminder to focus on owning yourself and steering your own growth.
