## As a mental health worker or someone affected by mental health issues, what is one thing you would want to say to educate people about mental health and to lessen the stigma and shame surrounding it?

	As someone who struggles with PTSD, I would like to say that I don't choose to be as repetitive and exhausting as I can be. I will react the same way to the same situation because that is an association that has been with me for half my life. It's very difficult to keep opening up to friends without feeling like a burden because you cannot cope with the same thing as last week. They have heard me talk about it so often and given me several pieces of advice on it and I hate feeling like this broken record, but to me that is a core part of this disorder.

	Edit: obligatory thanks for the first Reddit gold! Also, thank you so much for your responses. I've been reading all of them during breaks and try to respond here and there.

		>feeling like a burden
		
		This is a big one for me. 
		
		My partner is the only one that I really open up to about my illness and my emotional issues that come with it. Every time I get over one thing, I shift that pain to something else. I feel like it's exhausting for him.
		
		But feeling like a burden is *a symptom* of my depression. The more I push that fact, the more I believe him when he says that I'm not bothering him with it. That feeling is what he's helping me try to fix.
		
		Even if your friends think that you come to them with the same things, *I'm absolutely sure* that they don't see you as a burden. You're a friend in need.
		
		Edit: To everyone going through the same thing, remember that your illness is *real*. What you're going through is *real*. There are countless people having the same problems and yet *every one of you is different.* Giving a name to my struggles gave me something to work against. It made it tangible. Find something that makes it real for you and do your best to take steps and be conscious about your illness.
		
		May not work for everyone, but I figured I'd try to share what helped me.
		
		Edit 2: Thank you for my first gold, stranger! For that I'll be donating to the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation. Charity needs your money more than Reddit does.

			Thank you. It is true that the feeling of being a burden is a symptom of depression. I need to remember that too. I've been trying to talk to my friends about this feeling I have and some respond saying I am not a bother to them, but others do not respond at all. One friend has told me they rather not reinforce attention-seeking behaviour like that, they thought I wanted to hear I'm not a burden I guess. All I wanted is for them to know how I feel. I don't need anyone to validate anything negative for me.

	Physical therapy is seen as a regular part of recovery from of any serious injury. There’s no stigma attached for someone in a cast or a wheelchair to see a physical therapist. 

	Mental health counseling should be considered in the same light.

	We know we are acting irrational, but its not something we could help. Especially if its something like ptsd or anxiety. Somedays are just harder than others, but that doesn't mean we aren't trying. Just being their for us is enough and we appreciate it so much.

		The worst part of when I have a panic/anxiety attack is knowing that I'm thinking and acting incredibly irrationally. I know that it doesn't make sense. I fucking know. I keep repeating to my self over and over and over that, "I'm okay, just breathe, I'm okay". But even though I'm telling myself that, another part of my brain is going, "DUDE GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE RIGHT NOW NO NOT THAT WAY SIT DOWN STAND UP SIT DOWN FUCK IT RUN GET OUT OF HERE YOURE GOING TO FUCKING DIE RIGHT NOW".
		
		I know how ridiculous it is to think that just because I'm in a room with a lot of people or the passenger seat of a car. But knowing it's irrational doesn't stop my brain from yelling at me.

			After many years free of them, I had the worst panic attack I've ever suffered about 2 months ago. Went from being fine to feeling totally unable to breathe within 10 minutes, simply because I went to bed (I'd been having a lot of nightmares that week). It was so bad that I had my partner call an ambulance and even though they strongly suspected it was indeed a panic attack as I had indicated, they transported me to hospital. My partner had never seen me like that so was obviously concerned, but also super supportive. All the tests confirmed the suspicion, I wasn't dying. But fuck, it sure felt like I was. Brain said nah, you're good, body said fuck you

				I have PTSD from childhood abuse and trauma and just two nights ago had the worst flashback I've ever had. My partner and I had been fighting and I was crying and he laid across me to try and comfort me, but for the first time, it sent me back to when I was like twelve and my father was holding me down and beating me until I couldn't breathe from crying and I hit my boyfriend to get him off of me and proceeded to curl up into the fetal position and sob and scream in pain and panic for at least half an hour. I knew and told him that it was a flashback right before it took control but my mind and body were stuck in an endless loop of reliving that experience over and over until my boyfriend managed to bring me back.

					I had something similar happen and I still feel really bad. I don't know if I have ptsd, but I was abused pretty badly by my mother- She would frequently grab my arm, slap me, drag me by my hair, strangle me, etc. Pretty much every day. Just really violent until I left home. 
					
					About a year and a half ago, my boyfriend and I had been arguing, and he grabbed ahold of my left arm to tell me "lets stop this, I love you"... and in an instant without thinking, I swung my other arm and hit him and ended up curled in a ball with a panic attack.
					
					I've talked to a therapist about it and she insisted that it was a reaction from all the trauma I grew up with, because anytime I ever was grabbed, it led to something really bad.. and even though I knew my boyfriend wasn't hurting me and wasn't about to, my brain reacted defensively.
					
					He was mostly understanding after, but I still feel terrible about it.

				I have ptsd from homelessness and a mistake by a hospital where they didn't realize my 15 year daily intake of strong benzos for anxiety and took me off in 3 days followed by acute withdrawal that happened during the homelessness.  I just never feel like I can get over it.  I go right back to writhing in the hospital begging to die.

		Also I always appreciate someone trying to help or asking to help but sometimes I'm trying so hard to focus on not going into a full blown panic attack that I can't tell you what you can do to help, or can even voice what's wrong exactly. Be patient with anxiety sufferers and DO NOT tell me it's just in my head, try to focus on something else, tell me it's nothing.
		It sounds patronising and makes me feel like I'm exaggerating or my feelings aren't real to you.

			Thanks for trying to help but saying things like “you can do better” doesn’t help. Acknowledge people’s efforts and leave me be, don’t have your expectations so high into the roof that someone without anxiety or depression couldn’t achieve.

	Something to help with the stigma?

	 Most people don't see mental illness until it has manifested itself outwardly. You know, the homeless guy yelling at a trash can type of thing. 

	Realize that you are looking at the extreme end, thinking that is what mental illness is, is like thinking someone with 90% of their skin scorched off is what a burn looks like.

					Not OP, but with a similar condition. I used to repeat a lot, turn the sink on and off, switch a light switch, open and close car doors, all of this upwards of a dozen or more times each. In my head I required myself to perform each instance repeatedly until I was ok with it, or it felt right. Otherwise the consequence of not doing it right would have a 100% chance of happening immediately, which would cause extreme anxiety for hours to sometimes weeks. When it came to addressing the root of the repetition, I had to actualize the target of my anxiety, the consequence, and literally ask myself out loud "how does me performing this action affect this?" If there wasn't a connection, I had to then actualize my anxiety and confront it. This meant sitting under the ceiling fan if I didn't turn the lights on the correct number of times, removing what I wanted out of the refrigerator even if I didn't open and close the butter tray, washing my hands after turning on the water only one time, and washing them only once. I am happy to report that the fan didn't fall on me, the refrigerator didn't catch on fire, the water has never given me chemical burns, and my hands are still my skin color and not covered in mold. After repeating that process over 3-5 years, I identify compulsions quickly and address them, and forcing myself to actualize consequences to my actions has actually helped me learn how to address my anxiety.

				Not OP but I will give you my somewhat new trick to de-escalate anxiety when it kicks in. I think of myself as a ant. One day I was watching ants in a video when one ant just stopped working. It was like it tetanized for unexplained reasons. All the other ants kept doing what they were doing, all working or going somewhere except for that freezed ant. That's when i had this connection with this ant. I don't know exactly what happened but I felt insignificant like a ant. Uniquely reacting to wrong chemistry in my brain, nothing more nothing less. Now when I start feeling overwhelmed or irritated I try to go back to the this ant and the feeling of non importance in the grand scheme of things. Anyway I don't know if this make sense. It's my way of putting things in perspective.
				
				Finally the ant went back to work and from that I extrapolate

						It's very comforting to know that the world does not actually require anything of me - all I have to do is exist. Any obligations I put on myself are constructs in my head. Feeling the need to be useful is programming I've received all my life, but sitting quietly and simply breathing is just fine.

				Try checking out some of the subs that revolve with getting yourself on track such as r/productivity or something. It's good to habitualize daily events even. I personally have little reminders for simple things like brushing teeth. There is an app called "Habit" and there is a little moticum of happiness from checking off a box for each event. 
				
				As far as for outward appearance when around everyone else, for me what helps is I tell myself little things as I'm getting ready like "Look good, feel good" or "Smell good, look good, feel good" stupid stuff, if anything I'll get a chuckle out of myself. The mirror can work wonders, focus on things you like about yourself.
				
				Also I have a tendency to not want to bother other people or disrupt their lives with what's going on with me, I'll bottle it in which, is unhealthy, find someone you can talk to and talk. Most important would be to receive professional help, I have yet to do that step minus my initial diagnosis.

		I have moderate depression and generalized anxiety that is now somewhat successfully treated. Meaning I am mostly functioning but I think I just look lazy and distracted. When I was at the bottom and just before I got my diagnosis, I told my flatmate I thought I might be depressed and she said she doubted it, I was usually so happy. She knew really mentally ill people and I didn't present crazy enough. 
		
		It still hurts knowing that people don't fully believe I'm sick just because I don't show it enough.

You're actively slowly killing yourself, but "you can't have anorexia, you're overweight! or you're so fit! “ Yes, yes you can - just because you have weight to lose or look healthy does not mean it's okay to just stop eating, to have massive anxiety around food, to develop awful behaviors to cope. 
			
			Guess what? Give it 6 months and " you can't possibly have anorexia" becomes "how did I not notice she was so sick?“

	As someone with bipolar, I always compare it to diabetes.

	It's a lifelong condition, usually managed by medication though occasionally people manage without. The medication isn't always perfect, so you have to let those around you know the warning signs. If you ignore / stop taking your meds suddenly, you will have serious problems and may embarrass yourself in public.

	Sadly, I've recently had to add an extra section to my explanation as part of an apology. If you're a diabetic in hospital waiting for your foot to be amputated, even if you took your meds perfectly, you get limited sympathy if you spent every weekend stuffing yourself with cake. For bipolar, the equivalent tends to be booze / drugs, and god damn is the level of substance abuse high amongst us.

		My children’s mother (my ex) is bipolar I. As someone who spent years with someone who has bipolar disorder and fought hard to keep us together, I will say that it is one of the most misunderstood disorders out there simply because people don’t understand the destructive nature of mania. Everyone “understands” depression in some capacity, but they think mania is just “really happy.” She was unmedicated and went into full blown mania after what should have been our best times: engagement, kids being born, and buying a home. Took so long to come to terms with how she seemed to actively destroy everything we built during our best times. I ended up going to therapy with a bipolar specialist after we split up just so I could understand it better. These days she goes to CBT weekly, takes her meds, and sees a psych once a month, and we are on great terms.
		
		I also genuinely hate when people describe themselves as “a little bipolar.” It undermines the severity of the disorder.
		
		I hope you stay well and continue to take your meds.

			The terrible thing is that the trigger for the mania was probably having the most amazing time - it's like the governors for mood are broken, so an upwards turn twists itself into something so extreme it isn't positive or negative any more, it's a self sustaining state of chaos that all makes sense from the inside.
			
			It's odd - it isn't psychosis (necessarily, I know BP1 folk do get that) but the logic of the world warps just a little bit next to the fire burning in your head, and then all that's left is ashes. 
			
			I'm not massively keen on "zomg I'm so bipolar", but I tend to confine myself to a mild mental eye roll and a brief thanks to the gods of chance that I don't have OCD, because if there is ever a condition taken in vain...

		Yo I also have bipolar! The worst part is when you’re on a good roll with medication and then for some stupid reason it stops working. And the last time I went to the hospital with a meds-related issue they outwardly asked me if I was seeking drugs. It’s so sad that this thought process of “mental health = druggie” exists and it needs to stop.

		As an addition to this, you may be around someone who is bipolar, but don't know it because they are med compliant and managing their psychotic behavior. For the love of God, please, please stop saying, "Oh my God, I'm so bipolar." Bipolar disorder is not some quirky personality trait. It's a horrifying illness, and when you say that in front of a bipolar person, you're inadvertently diminishing what that person is going through.
		
		Also, don't assume you know what a bipolar or schizophrenic person is going through. Know that bipolar disorder is closer to schizophrenia than it is to severe depression, but no two people are going to suffer the exact same way. I'm Type 1 Bipolar, and I exhibit more textbook signs such as paranoid delusions and full manic episodes. My experience will be widely different than someone else. Don't think that because you read the Wikipedia article you're a mental health care professional. Just ask me, I'd be happy to tell you about it.

			I would *also* like to add that "hyperfocus", which is what often differentiates the inattentive type from the hyperactive type, isn't what most people say it is. I get the need to console yourself about your disabilities but acting like ADHD is some kind of superpower needs to stop. 
			
			Many teachers use the idea of hyperfocus to try to deny students disability accommodations-- "Just use your hyperfocus and get it done!" I've experienced this treatment myself.
			
			
			Hyperfocus is a consequence of the malformation of our frontal lobes. The part of our brain that allows us to move from one task to another does not work properly. Sometimes, it fails to fire. This makes us unable to change tasks in favor of other ones, often to the point of being unable to get up to drink, use the restroom, go to sleep, etc.
			
			*We cannot control when this brain misfire happens*. It's literally a neurological malfunction, not an ability to be whipped out on command. Sometimes, the occasional sufferer will manage to predict some pattern and time it to happen when they need to work, but this is far outside of the norm.

			anyway, I agree that the female side of things should be seen and acknowledged as well. And the part that people don't really grow out of it. They gave me some medicine when I was 10 or 11-ish for a few months until it stopped working and decided "my work here is done, this child is cured/untreatable" and for years, I never connected anything to my ADHD and thought I was just stupid and not functioning properly, turned out not to be true, but I still can't shake the idea that I am after believing it for that long

		Not only does ADHD exist, it's most devastating effects aren't even listed in the goddamn DSM. 
		
		Less than 93% of psychiatric residencies even touch on it so good luck getting properly medicated. Our disorder should more accurately called *executive function* deficiency disorder. 
		
		It affects not just attention, memory &amp; organizing but our emotions, reactions &amp; decision making.  ADHD is chronically misdiagnosed &amp; can share interpersonal 'quirks' with BPD, narcissism &amp; bipolar disorder so imagine how great we are with relationships.
		
		I've seen a lot of us agree that the Rejection Dysphoria &amp; emotional hyperarousal are the most crippling in our day to day. They're also not officially recognized as symptoms despite the fact they were included in earlier versions of the DSM &amp; the evidence is overwhelming.
		
		Imagine how disrupted your life would be if you couldn't hear constructive criticism without it burning? A spouse asks a question and an imagined tone sends you spiraling? Career ending performance fright because the sheer expectation of criticism is paralyzing? Everyone experiences those anxieties but ours are a feature &amp; the volume is way up. 
		
		It affects us physically too. Muscle overdevelopment, pain &amp; difficulty with fine motor movements have all been tied to ADHD. Idiopathic toe walking too! Sensory sensitivity which we have in common with autism.
		
		I am done with ADHD deniers, I can literally see the proof in my DNA so they are the Flat Earthers of mental health as far as I'm concerned.

Most of the time, I know what I'm doing is "unnecessary" and I don't WANT to be doing it, but my brain is forcing me.

				This is how I am with my wife. Early on I always “wanted to help” by trying to cheer her up on her dark days. What I’ve learned is the best way to help is to do things she wanted or was trying to do.

It seems to me that helps more than “being there” and trying to fix her mental state.

					Yes, 100%. Because there really is no "fixing my mental state", at least not that my SO can do. When I have a compulsion, I just have to do it sometimes. A lot of my compulsions deal with cleaning, as soon as I come in my door my brain gives me a list of things I NEED to deal with before I can relax. If I try to sit down and try to without doing them, I'm basically wasting my time, because in the back of my mind I have things making me uncomfortable and at that point there is no stress relief.
					
					It's really helpful to have a partner that understands that if they do some of the stuff on my mental list, then I can get through them and relax quicker is super helpful. I feel like a burden when he helps so much though. Haha. I'm sure your wife is as grateful for you as I am my partner!

			No, you’re overwhelmingly likely to not be a monster, and have probably exhibited a thousand and one signs to indicate you’re the opposite. 
			
			I like to think of it as an unfortunate side-effect of hyper-vigilance over moral issues. For example, you can abstract yourself from a dangerous situation, keeping it as conceptual and removed from yourself as you possibly can. But as soon as some threat poses itself to you or someone around you, you’re likely the kind of person whose body automatically reacts. 
			
			Being the sort of animals who’s evolved so many responses to danger in order to maintain peace and safety has some snowball effects for some of us. Some of us become hyper-vigilant about *ourselves.* Our instinct to sniff out danger turns inward. Our own subconscious, and our uncertain futures, become the antagonistic threats our bodily reactions automatically fights against.
			
			Having some awareness of this, or perhaps at least allowing oneself to think within such a mental framework, provides some relief. It doesn’t make the reactions go away, but it conceptualizes them as just that – automatic reactions which indirectly reveal how good of a person you actually are. Only an exceptional person maintains some kind of practice whereby they look at and modify their own behavior in order to make themselves and others happier and safer. And really, most of us are like that, working on becoming better people, sometimes stopping and starting up again, and all at our different rates of growth.

					And then the knot in your stomach that just doesn't go away, no matter how hard you relax. 
					
					And *attempting* to do something you know you should enjoy because you did before, but the uncomfortable stomach knot still remains and your body is too slow to move at all anyways, so you just sit on your phone browsing Reddit even though more productive things could be done if your brain and body would just let you out of the cycle.

	You're dealing with people who are essentially running with one leg in a two legged race.  The bar for success for the mentally ill is much different than everyone else.  For instance, someone suffering from severe depression making it to old age is sometimes a great feat... It certainly kills many before they get there.

	Edit:  to all of you who have replied and I cannot answer, cheers to you for getting up and doing what you need to do to get through another day.  I know it's hard.  I know it's thankless.

			It's not spoken about often as compared to things like schizophrenia or bipolar. I noticed within the last couple of years,many people have come out as having bipolar and everyone is so supportive them. But God forbid someone comes out as having BPD,people immediately flock to all the horrible behaviors about BPD that someone could portray,and we're not given the same support.
			-Fellow borderline personality disorder victim
			
			Btw only 1.6% of the worlds population had BPD.
			
			Edit:As stated below by another reddit user,1.6% have been diagnosed* it's not confirmed
			
			Edit2:While I understand negative stigmas exist for many things,I'm not talking about just breaking it. It's a problem when this negative stigma makes people stereotype or generalize all people with Borderline. There are different types of borderline (i.e introvert BPD to those that display many symptoms outwardly) It's like a spectrum. While there are 9 symptoms in the DSM,there are people with borderline that can be abusive or controlling but then there are others that are not,and have symptoms such as self harm behaviors,feelings of emptiness,intense anger,etc. I'm not sure if I'm making sense.

				I also have BPD, but currently it's tame. And I also dislike the stigma, but a lot of our symptoms are legitimate abuse. I've manipulated people and done my share of emotional abuse. I understand the stigma and how people who have been hurt by people with bpd have ill-feelings towards everyone with it. 
				
				I, personally, don't want to talk to anyone with BPD (who knows they have it) and just refuses to go to therapy or try to get better. I seen on forums that some self-aware pwBPD make excuses for their actions and don't do anything to get better. THOSE are the people who are giving a bad name to us who have been trying so hard, take all the drugs, go to all the therapy. 
				
				As an FYI to non-BPD people: BPD is "curable" (as in you don't meet the dsm requirements anymore). BUT only if you make the effort to get help. We're not lost causes. But I think that if a BPD person is hurting you, but refuses to get help, then you absolutely need to (safely) leave.

		This is so true. I have BPD, and while it isn't as bad as it was when I was younger (lord, I was engaging in so many self-destructive behaviours all at once), but when it flares up, I have a little checklist, and a day is considered a success if I get out of bed (I must admit, I give myself a sticker if I do that - and extra ones if I shower, and eat at least one meal that's more than 200 calories, it makes me feel like a good noodle).
		
		At one point, everyone thought I was going to die before I was 18, then 21 - accidentally or on purpose at my hands or someone else's. My birthday was last month, and my grandmother gave me £100, and told me it was her way of showing how happy she was because I'm still alive.

				As someone who also was diagnosed with BPD, along with PSTD, MDD, and GAD; this is the best description of BPD. I feel like I am a raw, open nerve sometimes; like when you have an cavity in your tooth and everything you do hurts.. Your whole face throbs... Well that is how I feel emotionally most of the time. I don't have that lovely shield most people have that protects their heart from pain and hurt. I feel it all on a level that most people can't understand. I will do all kinds of stupid crazy shit to avoid that pain including breaking up with/removing from my life wonderful people just so I can "control the hurt". 
				
				I have had extensive therapy and am doing a lot better. It still is a constant battle against my own head knowing if I am overreacting or if I can trust my own thoughts and emotions.
				
				What I wish people understood the most is this (this is my own personal thing): this is what extreme abuse, neglect, and such looks like. This is what happens when a brain is broken by years of abusive and neglective parents. You grow up not trusting anyone, but wanting to be loved cuz you kinda never were. It is such a fucking paradox. I didn't know what  healthy interpersonal relationships looked like because I was never modelled one as a kid. I was literally thrown into this world and was like here, survive. I wish people really understood that and really took some time to think on that before demonizing mental health issues.

			* 🟦 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 196 _(2019-05-23 05:00:12)_

				It might be because we still don't know how these diseases work. It's easy to dismiss mental illnesses when their symptoms are classified as being part of your character. That depressed person is staying at home all the time? They must be lazy. That's the conclusion that most people who haven't experienced it would come to.
				
				There is so much more to understand. I'd say that some people just can't accept that we are literally slaves to our brains. Anything wrong in the brain (chemical imbalances, let's say) will have adverse impacts on how we feel, act and behave. And these symptoms are harder to diagnose and less understood than something like a tumour.

				Oh, bipolar, especially II is considered to be among one of the most severe disabilities - similar to intense dementia, spinal cord injury etc.
				
				Edit: of course bipolar I is shitty too. It usually has less uptime (30-40% vs 70-90%) so some ppl consider it less disabling but more life treating. Kinda like getting malaria twice a year vs having flu all the time. Not saying one is better than other, they both suck

	I cant answer the phone. Cant drive the car sometimes, even for groceries or prescriptions. Cant go to sleep. Cant deal with criticism. It’s like entropy, a small thing grows all on its own into an unrelated mess of disorganized anger and frustration often over nothing tangibly real. But it’s so real to me. It becomes panic. Or anger at myself. To combat this I feel the need to be perfect, constantly. You could consider this a benefit, I often out perform my peers. But if I fail, even a little, I’m a failure to myself. I lost a hat in January and I’m still punishing myself for it. So to you, on the outside, I do everything right and that makes you think I’m okay, annoying even. I make good enough money and I’m successful in my field. But the moment I’m alone I pull the skin off my scalp with my fingernails and have almost no close relationships.

	I can’t control how I feel. I know it’s not normal, but I know I do everything I can to try to cope.

	I have a full time job. I have a house. I have a decent wage and I'm doing okay for my age.

	I also have borderline personality disorder, depression, anxiety, possibly ptsd, and traits of other personality disorders.

	I appear to function on the outside, but inside I struggle every day. I co-own my house with my dad, and despite living with me even he thinks I'm okay.

	People who are suffering often bottle it up in an attempt to not be a burden or to just try and get on with life, but it wears them down.

	Reach out to your friends and ask how they are. Let them know you're there for them. And if they disclose they have a certain disorder, do a little research

	Think about how it affects them rather than how it affects you.

	Talk about it. Suicide is the second most common cause of death among teenagers and young adults, so they are a big clientele to reach. But also middle-aged people are at high risk, especially men.

	You can share articles that talk positively about mental illness and recovery, along with being active in foundations for suicide prevention like the [AFSP in the US](https://afsp.org/take-action/), the [NSPA in UK](https://www.nspa.org.uk/) or whichever it is in your country. 

	Most importantly, if you know someone who is feeling down or has suicidal thoughts, the best thing you can do to help is listen and ask directly "Do you have suicidal thoughts?". This leaves them with a simple yes or no question, so they aren't the one who have to "say it out loud". Don't panic when someone says "yes"! You can have suicidal thoughts without wanting to actively take your life,; they are a coping mechanism for underlying issues. If you think you can handle it, ask how persistent they are, if they can distance themselves from those thoughts or if they have a plan on how to take their life. Make sure to use the word "suicide" or any phrases without a negative connotation (see: "killing yourself").

	 **Don't** give advice: Just actively listen and comfort them in a way that doesn't make them feel trivialized or judged. Staying away from any moral judgements (regarding their feelings) is very important! Also, you can offer to support them when they plan to get treatment, like accompanying them when going to the doctor, figuring out who to call and so on. There are also some chat or mail-based counceling options if speaking in person or on the phone is too much for them.

		Sometimes that's all someone needs is support. Don't try to be someone's therapist; just let them know that you're there for them. If they're harming themselves or are at risk of suicide though, please get them professional help. This goes for if you're feeling like harming yourself as well.

	I would say the prevalence of antagonist characters that have a (usually misrepresented or grossly inaccurate) mental health issue is a problem. Same for a lot of true crime documentaries and the like, where they speculate on whether the perpetrator might have had some kind of mental illness without explaining the illness correctly, or write off a person's actions as being down to the effects of the mental illness.

	 I can tell if someone has been influenced by this kind of shitty pop culture by the way they look at me and others. No, being bipolar does not mean I might murder you for no logical reason. In fact, it makes ME statistically more likely to be murdered or a victim of abuse.

		I'm sorry I suck. When I was younger we had a kid in our class with autism named Kevin.. the teachers of this school kind of sucked and just told us he was different, instead of telling us what he had was a disability and not just a different kid that does weird stuff... we all picked on him. In grade 5 I remember we held a class meeting explaining the severity of our bullying on Kevin's life. As kids we still didnt care. Nobody could contain our class honestly. Kevin broke down and let out that his father beats him. Nobody took him seriously. Even the teacher laughed and said " Kevin my buddy, I know your father and hes a good man." Later on he was arrested for abuse. 
		
		It breaks my heart how we all treated Kevin, he is most likely not the top notch kid he could be today because of us before...
		
		I'm so sorry to Kevin, and you. I wouldn't accept forgiveness though.

			The fact that you acknowledge your mistakes just shows you didnt know better. And the fact that you will never forget it is good. You will never forget how wrong you were and that will make you remember who you want to be. I made some fucked up things too as a kid and as much as I wish I could undo them, I know they taught me right and wrong. Stay positive and dont forget that being good is a daily battle. You are on the right track and nobody is perfect. Dont let your mistakes take control of you =)

	We literally have no control over what our mind is doing, feeling, or how it’s going to react to anything. There is zero control. Be understanding that this is much harder for the sufferer than it is for you. 

	Your brain is an organ and like any other organ it can get sick or weakened or simply not work as strongly or efficiently as it used to. You wouldn’t expect someone to just “get over” or “snap out of” a heart attack or kidney failure. It’s unfair to expect the same of mental illness.

	Edit because this got a lot more popular than I ever expected. While most people are agreeing with me, some seem to think I’m being damaging in what I say so I’ll make it clear. What goes on in our mind we cannot control. The thoughts, compulsions, panics that just appear we cannot preempt or stop. We *all* can, however, work hard to recover. We can seek help, get medicine, use coping mechanisms that will help us control how we act and react. But nobody can ever convince me we can just stop thinking the things that pop into our brains.

		I know I pass as normal. Even to people who have seen my full diagnostic work up. Even to the people closest to me. I have high functioning autism with some awful mix of anxiety and depression. Everyone thinks I should be practicing driving. 
		
		I. Can't. Drive. 
		
		My doctor agreed. I'm probably gonna have to get that documented at some point. Everyone in my family still expects me too and explaining why I can't is just too much to handle so I brush them off.
		
		Edit: thank you all for your support! My Reddit account is like a week old and this quickly became my most popular comment.
		
		Edit 2. I'm getting asked a lot why I can't drive because of autism. I figured I would just post one of my replies rather than responding to the question over and over. 
		
		It isn't just the HFA but comorbid stuff that goes along with it. 
		
		Driving is a phobia right now. There's a lot going on in the road and my reaction time is sometimes pretty slow when I'm stressed. Plus I don't think I'd be able to pay attention to the other cars on the road, the people who might bolt into the road, the signs and other factors that are constantly changing. 
		
		I don't have great motor skills when it comes to controlling things.
		
		Anxiety and panic attacks are not good on the road. 
		
		I know all of these points can be argued because I have heard them all before. "it's different when you are behind the wheel. You will feel in control" no lol I still will probably be dissociative and anxious. I have tried it before. 
		
		Directions are another thing. They say you can't always use GPS to get around. I will probably always need a gps. I have no sense of direction, even in town.

			I can’t drive either! Medical decision too. I’m nearly 30 and have just got to the stage that I have tried explaining situations so often to people who don’t understand that I’ve developed this ability to say something firmly enough that people don’t usually press it, and if they do I kill the conversation quick and move on. Not worth my time to argue with people who aren’t willing to listen and will make me feel worse about myself.

				After I graduate I hope to move to the city so that I can just say I prefer public transportation. Not sure when that will be though.

					You’ve got a goal in mind, just be patient because it will come soon enough. Then one day you’ll be saying “no I just prefer public transport” and you’ll be reminded of the fact you wanted to be in that place, and I guarantee you’ll feel absolutely fantastic about it.

			I match your first paragraph, except I can drive. Which is weird, because right when I was getting my learner's permit my family was in a major car crash. Driving is ok. Riding in a car? A hell of a lot less okay.
			
			Which just goes to show how unpredictable anxiety can be. No, it doesn't make sense. No, I can't predict or control it. That's what makes it a disorder, rather than normal every-day anxiety that everyone gets from time to time. My dad (who is wonderful in just about every other way, and very supportive) still has trouble understanding that sometimes, there is no cause to my anxiety and depression. Everything can be perfectly fine in my life at that moment, and I'll still feel like I can't get out of bed, or I'll still feel sick to my stomach and panicky over nothing.
			
			I often get frustrated; just knowing that there's not much to be done about it all. I can, and do, take medication to mitigate my mental illness, but that's not a cure, it's a treatment. I still have to fight, every day. And considering my depression/anxiety is neurological, not situational, in nature, that's just how my life is going to be. Forever.
			
			I've gotten my suicidal ideation under much better control over the years... But that thought, of there being no real tangible "end" to it, is what brings it back up again most consistently. I can't really think of a scenario where I'd act on it again, but it still scares me sometimes.

	Suicide isnt an 'egoistic' choice.

	If a severely depressed person comitted suicide, he/she did it because they felt that the people left behind would do much better without them. They actually commit suicide to help relatives and loved ones.

* 🟩 **[LonelyCheeto](https://www.reddit.com/user/LonelyCheeto)** ⬆️ 126 _(2019-05-23 03:38:23)_

	People are coping the best way they can based on their experience. For example, someone who yells and turns people away can just be trying to comfort themselves based on past experience of letting someone in and being hurt by it. 

	Treatment is about learning new coping skills that will give people comfort that also gives them other things they need in their life (relationships, stability, etc.)

	I know this isn't exactly what your asking for, but as someone who works in mental health, has suffered from mental health issues and has witnessed some of the effects...

	Get. Off. Social. Media.

	Reddit isn't too bad because it isn't tied to your personality and identity. But get off Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat and any other media that is linked to your real identity and self worth.

	Those platforms are directly responsible for more harm to young people's mental health than everything else combined. I know of multiple suicides, attempted suicides and self harm cases that are a result of interaction on social media.

	I work in the NHS and we can't keep up with all the depressed teenagers that come in with depression and anxiety brought on by social media use. This in turn is stopping us from treating serious cases of mental illness.

	Every single young person who has deleted their social media accounts on professional advice (in my service) has immediately felt a significant improvement in their mental health, their self worth and a reduction in their anxiety.

	Please, if you do nothing else this year... Delete your social media apps, wait for the withdrawal to wear off and feel the freedom that comes with not feeling like your whole life is on show and that you don't need to prove anything to anyone.

	Edit 1: Under no circumstances should you feel like you are taking up a professionals time. I know I said we're overloaded, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't seek help. Definitely seek help if you feel like you aren't coping.

	Edit 2: If you have a healthy relationship with social media then that's great, but if logging into Instagram has you feeling fat, worthless, boring, ugly, poor, stupid, or any other negative feeling... Delete it.

	Cheers for the silver.

	Well shit... Gold too. Thanks a bunch.

		I deleted all social media except for Reddit and I must say, huge difference in my day to day life. It took a few months to really notice but those platforms really had such a negative impact on my already fragile mental health.

	As much as I wouldn't wish my mental illnesses on anyone, there have been many times I wish someone could live in my head for just one day.  The constant thoughts of ways and planning and just running thoughts of suicide and anxiety about the simplest of things is so very exhausting. And as much as I would love to "just get over it", it takes a lot of work to feel like what I imagine a "normal" person must feel like. Also, I need those meds just as much as a person with heart disease or other chronic illness needs theirs. I cannot function without them and therapy. Stop saying I don't need them!!

	BPD is not inherently abusive, and people with it can be good people and live normal lives. On that vein, not everyone who acts irrationally/in a way that offends your sensabilities will have BPD, and if you know someone with BPD who acts a certain way, that’s likely not universal. Just don’t stigmatise and overgeneralise.

	We don't choose to act this way for "attention" or because we "want to". I didn't choose ECT because I felt like it. I want to be able to get up and do things like work, go to school, start my life but I can't.

	We have empathy for people if they broke their leg, why is it not the same for mental health? Also stop romanticizing it; suicide is not "cute" or "cool" (I'm looking at you 13 Reasons Why).

	Also: Mental health is not just depression or anxiety. There is lots that don't get brought up like schizophrenia, bi-polar... Way more than I can think of. Here is a list: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mental_disorders

	Source: 26 (Turning 27) year-old on disability due to depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Did six rounds of ECT. Was diagnosed with my mental health issues ~10 years ago now.

		>We don't choose to act this way for "attention" or because we "want to"
		
		I'm like "yeah, you got me, it's all an act to get to those sweet, sweet impotence-inducing SSRIs, and I thought it might be an easy way to get someone to jolt my skull with 1000 volts"
		
		*Although* - have you checked out if ketamine treatment is an option where you live? It seems like it shows a bit of promise in people who have really difficult cases (and if you've had ECT six times I suspect you qualify for that description).

	I am bipolar.

	People don't know how to react when you tell them you're ill. Which I understand of course. We talk a lot about people that are mean or treat you like you're crazy and stuff. It sucks obviously but we talk so much about them that we forget about the other side of the coin. 

	When people are too benevolent or sympathetic, they can also cause damages. I am surrounded by friends and by my family and they all support me which is great and i'm very greatful for that. But sometimes (or always) they have absolutely no idea what to say but feel like they must say something no matter what. They usually try to reassure you but doing this they just get the opposite reaction. I call it minimization.

	Basically, they tell you not to worry, what you're experiencing isn't that bad don't be afraid, they also feel like this sometimes IT'S GONNA BE FINE

	Stop. Doing. This. It's the worst. Imagine you feel like shit or that something's reaaally wrong and you're afraid, and then someone tells you "meh it's okay everybody have ups and downs ;)". All my friends and my family (except my sister) do that. Now everytime i fell like something's happening, i'm asking myself "do I really need to see my doctor? Is there really something wrong? Am I faking it?". So yeah, not useful at all, I'd rather be told to worry so I can get some help instead of keeping it to myself. Also it's painful and really annoying so now I just don't talk to anybody at all, except my sister. 

	What does she do ? What do I personally want people to do ?

	Just listen to my rants or worries or news from my doctors, but don't say anything. Accept that you will never understand it so don't try to give advice, judge (yeah some friends told my I take too much meds and that they worry), relate, reassure, etc. I just need a shoulder to cry on and that's it. The only people that I will listen to are my doctors, and that's it.

	It's my personnal situation so maybe other will disagree with me.

	Mental illness can happen to anyone, literally. It's as common as physical illnesses like the common cold. Part of removing the stigma is to talk more openly about it, to stop the whole "hush-hush, behind closed doors" thing. Anxiety and depression are among the most common, and lately I've seen a rise in eating disorders (looking at you, influencers who promote body dysmorphia with plastic surgery they claim is achievable with diet and exercise, and especially influencers who push intense diets and weight loss products. You are literally causing damage to people with your pursuit of fame and money). 

	Bipolar, schizophrenia and personality disorders are treatable. They're not something to fear. Important to note too, that personality disorders can be incredibly mild, and don't necessarily need treatment unless it impacts your life negatively.

	There is literally nothing wrong with having to take medication for a mental illness. It doesn't mean you're creating "artificial happiness" or a dependency issue. You're correcting your brain's shortcomings with the resources that you have available. We do what we have to do to improve our mental health

	I think my concussions have fucked me up permanently.  I grew up playing hockey every day for 15 years, trying to make the NHL.  But after being knocked unconscious for the 10th time something... changed.  My long term memory is non existent, I’m very irritable and depressed.  I can’t look people in the eyes anymore.  I went from social butterfly to a compete hermit shut in that can’t bare being in public.

	Are these things correlated?  My parents refuse to believe they are and they think I’m being dramatic.  I’m not.  I think about suicide on a daily basis.  I was *never* like this until my last violent head trauma.

	I’ve probably had over 25 instances of severe head trauma (*at least*), I only know for sure of the ones where I was knocked out cold.

	As someone who suffers from schizophrenia, one thing that i hear the most is ""shouldn't you be locked up?" ... seriously people? I thought society has moved past the point where psychopaths in horror movies represent what a disorder is actually like. No, i will not murder your child. No, i will not commit any other crime you might be thinking of right now. Relax, we aren't as dangerous as you think. In fact, we aren't that dangerous at all ( most of the time. ) why not give me a goddamn chance?

	If you wish to understand someone with a mental health condition please educate yourself and research the condition. I have a lot of people who claim to know and try to give advice.

	Once you've worked with professionals the average persons advice can become awkward and patronising at times. 

	Learn before you weigh in. It's a very sensitive subject and would go some way to lessening the stigma if more people educated themselves.

	Don’t stray away from a person if they confessed their struggles to you. They’re probably in a very difficult situation and trust you enough to tell you about it. You should get informed about their mental illness and try to fix it with them. Or just be supportive at least or get someone who can help more than you involved but I just beg you don’t under any circumstances stray away from them
