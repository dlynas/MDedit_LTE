## What do you think a multi party America would look like in practice?

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/18tsmpm/what_do_you_think_a_multi_party_america_would/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/18tsmpm/what_do_you_think_a_multi_party_america_would/)

> A few ground rules. The president is elected with a system providing for a runoff, either instant or sequential ballots, whether the electoral college is retained or not. Federal senators, local mayors, and state executives like the governor, as well as elected judicial officers like judges and district attorneys and sheriffs, are the same with a runoff or a ranked ballot to ensure majority support, if there is a vote on them and is not simply a yes or no vote on a candidate proposed by a judicial commission or being appointed by the governor. The House of Representatives, state legislatures, local councils, county commissions, boards of education, and similar, are elected proportionally so that X% of the vote roughly leads to X% of the seats in whatever is being elected.
> 
> Edit: Some speculations on my part. The decision about what to do about the speakership, and contested votes for presidents pro tempore (the VP is the president of the senate. The senate probably doesn't want to let the chairperson have any more authority than they absolutely have to as they cannot control who the VP will be. The longest serving senator may well be tapped for this role going forward. Some states however have more influential senate presidents and presidents pro tempore) will be pretty significant. Some states use secret ballots if votes are contested, others do not, and a few states have rules to knock off the least voted candidate in each ballot if necessary, such is the case in Nebraska.
> 
> Given the vast variety of elective positions in the US at each level of government, this could prove to be very interesting. The differing coalitions who will come to support pieces of legislation, how it is unlikely for any one party alone to have enough seats to prevent cloture in the senate, the senate rules themselves maybe being changed too. Who ends up being the majority and minority leaders, committee chairs. Brazil is the closest example, but even that isn't complete. Many presidents and governors will probably fail to have a majority of the legislature from their own party but they probably won't have a legislature that will always have a supermajority against them to override everything they do either. Not really much precedent for what this is like but we have a few clues in a few examples from history.
> 
> Edit Two: A parliamentary system is not even remotely tied to the definition of a multi party system. Nothing I said implies the introduction of a parliamentary system.

	We'd have two big centre-right and centre-left parties and a few minor parties that sometimes would be kingmakers in the House and Senate. See Australia's House of Commons and Senate for how that might work.

	Even in countries with tons of political parties, for important national elections, they often run as a broad coalition of centre-left and centre-right. See Poland's most recent election.

	My prediction is that the Republican Party would either become the centre-right Mitt Romney type of party or a populist Trump party. The Trump party would probably be smaller, especially after Trump goes away somehow.

	Either way, there is a Mitt Romney type of party. They either colonize the Libertarian Party or start their own if the Trump people take over.

	The Democratic Party would be the centre-left party, but there would be an equivalent to the NDP in Canada. This would be composed of Bernie and AOC type of people. They would either colonize the Green Party or start their own. The Green Party itself might stay a small minor party with few seats (like Canada's) or become a kingmaker like in Germany. 

	I could also see a 'trendy' centrist technocratic party like the FDP in Germany. It might be founded by a neoliberal billionare like Bloomberg or Schoultz or somebody less rich but still an 'outsider' like Andrew Yang. 

	What would be interesting is to see how divided government would work with so many parties. In Austrialia, the Prime Minister's party forms a government even if they have a minority in the Senate. 

	I'd say look to Latin American democracies  to see how a presidential system with tons of parties would work.

			I think you misunderstood what "kingmaker" meant in that context
			
			So in a multiparty system you often wind up with minority governments. Let's look at the current Canadian Parliament for an example
			
			So there are 5 parties in Parliament, Liberals have 158 members, the Conservatives have 117, the NDP have 32 and the Bloc 25 and the Greens have 2. 
			
			No one party has over 50% of the seats. But the NDP struck a deal with the Liberals. If the Liberals support specific NDP bills then the NDP will vote in favor of any budgets or confidence motions, ensuring that the Liberals can govern smoothly. So the NDP are "kingmakers" in this Parliament as if they withdrew their support it is very likely an early election would occur

					It was an example of the term, not a 1:1 reference to your hypothetical 
					
					In the comment it seemed to be referring to the idea of 2 dominant parties in the house and the senate with smaller parties. In this scenario it would be likely that no 1 party would control half of the house (for instance) 
					
					So the "kingmaker" would be the smaller party willing to work with a larger party ensuring that the larger party could meet their agenda while securing concessions for themselves (ie the greens ally with the dems until the next election. The dems are able to pass what bills they want but in return the greens get a few specific pieces of legislation through that they wouldn't have been able to on their own)
					
					Edit: Also no the Liberals can't be forced out "instantly" there is protcal over what is and what isn't a confidence vote, they do not happen everyday, most votes in Parliament are not confidence votes

							>if it happens, results in the VP becoming president not someone of the choice of the legislature
							
							Irrelevant especially in the example of Canada. If the PM steps down his own party selects an interim leader from amongst themselves and then have a leadership race later to select a permanent leader. None of that affects the parties standings in Parliament. In practice the party leader of the party who won the most votes is always the next PM. Only once was that not the case, and that event was controversial enough that they still teach it in schools nearly 100 years later 
							
							Kingmaker can be a colloquial term used to describe legislative majority. In the example I gave the NDP being kingmaker had no effect on who the prime minister was. The prime minister had already been elected, they are only ensuring budgets and other confidence level votes pass.

								The VP I brought up in case you were going to say a majority coalition was necessary to prevent impeachment, I was citing why legislatures don't ways do that in presidential systems. 
								
								The governor general has only done that in the past but it is not unheard of at the provincial level. In 2017 in British Columbia the party with the second most votes became premier. Canada is a bad example given that it does not comply with the rules I laid out with proportional elections, something like a certain pinocchio went back on when he had a majority of seats.
								
								The word kingmaker is not very useful for a legislative majority for just a piece of legislation or simple motions. You can find a wide variety of times when different people and parties will align with each other issue by issue.

									>something like a certain pinocchio went back on when he had a majority of seats.
									
									Tbf, and I highly disagree with the decision made, Trudeau never supported a proportional system. That's a messy situation in it's own right. LPC wanted run off elections (they would have benefited the most from this) but when they formed the committee the opposition parties pointed out the hypocrisy of setting up a committee based off of election results when your trying to replace the election system.
									
									This meant the committee that was formed did not have a LPC majority and no other party supported runoff. So Trudeau was forced into 2 options, kill the idea quietly over a break, or put MMP to a referendum. One of those options would have more then likely killed the advantage the LPC currently have. He picked the smart choice (but the morally incorrect choice)

			If you look at [Brazil's Senate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Senate_(Brazil)), the important positions like Majority Leader are given to different people in each party coalition, but the President's party, if the majority, gets the presiding officer. 
			
			For the House, I'm not sure if any other Republics give our Speaker as much power as they have, which is why I thought that coalitions would emerge.

	exactly the same as what we have now. 

	at the end of the day, the parties are just going to converge down to 2 coalitions bringing us back to where we already are. 

	aoc for example said last cycle that "her and biden wouldn't be in the same party in other countries". this change would be the literal embodiment of that statement, and she'd be in a different party, but the same coalition.

		I'd imagine it'd turn into something like the UK or Canada. *Technically* a multi-party system, but in any practical sense there are just two parties. There'd be one for liberals and one for conservatives making up the vast majority of the legislature, a small but solid regional party (Texas or California?) and then a handful of irrelevants having only a handful of seats between them.

* 🟩 **[SadSpeechPathologist](https://www.reddit.com/user/SadSpeechPathologist)** ⬆️ 5 _(2023-12-29 14:24:30)_

	As you point out, we'd have to change the entire system. It would only work if we had a parliamentary system where each party gets representation based on their percentage of votes. Otherwise, the "all or nothing" way we do things now will always support two big parties. But that's what we're stuck with.

		Ranked Choice Voting which is already slowly spreading would allow for viable parties besides Democrats and Republicans.  People could vote for Libertarian and Green Parties and when those parties don't garnish enough vote the voter's second choice and the third choice, etc would be selected.

		* 🟧 **[digbyforever](https://www.reddit.com/user/digbyforever)** ⬆️ 1 _(2023-12-30 22:27:20)_

			Sure, but the issue is those third parties still would *never actually win the election* and get a Representative in Congress.  At some point if your third party never actually elects anyone, what's the point?

			* 🟦 **[Tb1969](https://www.reddit.com/user/Tb1969)** ⬆️ 2 _(2023-12-30 22:46:26)_

				People don't vote for the party on the left and right besides the Democrats and Republicans respectively since they don't want to split the vote in our plurality voting (also called first-past-the-post).
				
				Ranked Choice Voting (also known as instant runoff voting) removes that worry of splitting the vote.  It's not perfect but it works.  I can, for instance, vote for the Green Party candidate and if that candidate doesn't gain enough votes in the first round the candidate is dropped and my second choice is automatically voted for instead.
				
				What happens in RCV elections is that some candidates that are like minded start working together ... one candidate says to their supporters "Vote for me first and vote for X second" and the other candidate says to theirs "Vote for me first and vote for Y second".
				
				People who want to control us want to stop RCV from spreading.

			I mean... sure. It's not exactly the same thing. But it's pretty close depending on the format of the new system. If, for example, we changed our Legislative branch to a parliamentary system, abolished the direct election of the President, and the parliament had to form a government by electing a Prime Minister then yes that would have a huge influence on our politics. But if we're just electing Presidents directly with multiple parties and had some kind of ranked choice ballot then the influence of such a change would be minuscule. That's basically the status quo.

							It really doesn't though. The reason why some districts are competitive and others are dominated by a single party is because of the voters that live in those districts. The coalitions that would form the new major parties in your scenario already exist and already influence our politics. For example, the MAGA right, Libertarian right, and center right all exist today - they duke it out in the primaries, one of those candidates wins, and then the winner goes up against the winner of the Democratic party. If these three coalitions formed individual parties they'd make up about 45-50% of the electorate. The top vote getter would secure either first or second place in the field, and then there would be a runoff against the candidate who carried the rest of the field. So the runoff would be winner of the Republican coalition fight vs the winner of the Democratic coalition fight. That's virtually identical to the way we already do elections. Suddenly adding new parties doesn't do anything because those coalitions already exist! All you would be doing is formalizing the coalitions that already exist into their own "parties" rather than being distinct sub-groups of either the Democratic party or the Republican party. 
							
							Under your system there would still be districts that aren't competitive because the overwhelming majority of the electorate is MAGA right or Progressive left. What incentive is there for a third, fourth, or fifth party to compete in these races when everyone knows the way they're going to vote?

									The whole thing is that both parties currently are big tent parties with many different factions. Creating a multiparty system would more or less produce the same coalitions just in more formal arrangements. eg, the areas that elect progressive democrats would still vote for the progressive party. The only difference is rather than being a faction of the Democrats, they would now have to form a coalition with the center-left party. 
									
									The voters haven’t changed what districts and states they’re in. They’re just voting for the same people with a different party label.

* 🟩 **[gonotquietly](https://www.reddit.com/user/gonotquietly)** ⬆️ 6 _(2023-12-29 13:55:59)_

	Basically the same. We only really have a two party system on the surface level. The democrats and republicans have multiple factions which have to form alliances and compromise to pass legislation. AOC and Manchin or MTG and Romney aren’t really in any other than a loose coalition.

	Pretty much the same as now. Imagine all the little caucuses of the house as their own separate parties. In the end, in order to get anything done, they’d have to form a coalition with those that agree with them most. What that would end up looking like is the two party system.

	I think GOP and Democrats would still be the larger parties, but if there a couple of smaller parties that had at least a solid 15-20% of members, they have the potential to be kingmakers at the legislative level. 

	I also think you would see less polarization overall. You would still have the extremist bomb throwers like MTG and far left like AOC, but they would probably be members of one of the smaller parties. Even if they weren't, finding common cause with one of the smaller parties could be enough to make deals that could get legislation through.

* 🟩 **[Loraxdude14](https://www.reddit.com/user/Loraxdude14)** ⬆️ 1 _(2023-12-29 13:09:32)_

	I think a lot of this depends on how many seats you allocate per district. Ireland has 3 seats in almost every parliamentary constituency, and they have 3 major parties (that each control 1/4-1/3 of parliament) with the remainder filled up by a diverse group of smaller parties.

	Anyway, I think politics would be different. At least congress would We have always had more centrist and less centrist politicians that demand consensus on some level but it's never been done in a truly representative way. Things would be more consensus based, but not necessarily in the way that you'd expect. It would probably be easier to pass legislation than through a divided Congress.

	The presidency could still be a mess though.

	I think we could probably see at least 5 major political parties, contenders as follows:

	-The "establishment" democrats (center-center left)

	-Social democrats and some democratic socialists

	-The centrist/center right "Joe Manchin" types

	-The greens

	-the libertarians

	-old guard/institutionalist/moderate conservatives

	-a party that tries to bridge the gap between the institutionalist conservatives and the populist ultras

	-the populist far right

	-maybe 1-4 wild cards with 1-10 seats each (pirate party, a satirical party, Alaska independence party, neo-black panther, communist, idk)

	I'm not sure I quite understand what you're saying about "judicial commission" could you please clarify?

		There are 39 Irish constituencies. Nine have three members for a total of 27. 17 have four members for a total of 68. 13 have five members for a total of 65. That's 41% of the seats going to five member districts, just about the same percentage for four member districts. 
		
		In about half the states, judicial commissions are used to organize the judges. Usually some members appointed politically such as three members named by the governor with the consent of the state senate, three by the bar association of the state, and the chief justice of the supreme court elected by the other judges on the court as the chairperson, they, by a majority, give the governor a list of names whenever a vacancy on a court occurs to choose from, and the governor picks one. At the time the next general election happens, a vote happens where voters say yes or no to the selection, without opposition, and a majority of voters are necessary to endorse the judge to remain in their seat usually for terms of between six and twelve years. This is called the Missouri plan.

					I don't see it that way. It could mean that 30% want candidate A, 11% want candidate B, and 10% want Candidate C. In that case, 26% did not actually vote FOR the "winner". I'm not saying it's infeasible, only that I don't like it.

					Listen, respectfully, you literally do not know what you're talking about.  You really don't.  You need to read and learn.
					
					In Burlington Vermont in 2009, 4064 voters marked their ballots that Andy Montroll was preferred over Bob Kiss.  3476 voters marked their ballots to the contrary. Now who was elected?
					
					In Alaska in August 2022, 87000 voters marked their ballots that Nick Begich was preferred over Mary Peltola while 79000 voters marked their ballots to the contrary.  Yet who was elected?
					
					Both IRV elections were spoiled.  Both had spoilers, who was the losing candidate on the extreme right.  But the voters for that candidate were screwed when their candidate lost but their 2nd-choice votes were never counted.

							You still avoiding the facts.  It not about whether Wright should have won.  More voters preferred Kiss over Wright.  It's about Kiss winning when more voters marked their ballots that Montroll was preferred over Kiss.

										I don't have a specific credential of this nature in a journal but I do campaign in elections in these multi party systems, having helped getting an opposition candidate to 21% of the vote in my district with tens of thousands of votes, I personally being the one who interviewed and recommended the candidate for nomination. 
										
										The question was designed around the question of a multi party system using proportional elections and runoffs or ranked ballots for singular positions. We know without doubt that multi party systems are widespread in such systems like Portugal to Namibia to Brazil, among many more. Even if voters don't know why, it does result in such a thing. 
										
										You don't opine on anything about what an American political system would, in general, end up being like, which was the question. And you so seem to nothing have much of an explanation for why countries with so much experience like Australia behaves as it does with such ranked ballots, you just seem to be an irritating perfectionist who seeks infinite progress to the exclusion of good enough who doesn't have much useful to the public debate by commenting on that issue when voters who use ranked ballots all their life seem not to care or vote with such issues in mind and the more important issue is whether STV or IRV is used in the legislature, Australia has elections of both kinds.

	thank god we don't have a parliamentary system in the US. We would end up as an ultra-right fascist plutocracy controlled by fringe nationalists. They'd probably outlaw green &amp; liberal parties.

		What are you talking about? This post is about multi party systems. Nothing I said involved parliamentary systems. And the coalition that backed the right wing in the US are themselves divided up, even in a parliamentary system it is hard to outlaw other parties as Germany shows, having only ever banned two since the federal republic was established. It would be a threat to the coalition partners too to ban parties, and a threat to the far right party too if they ever lose favour. The courts remain independent in a parliamentary republic.

	The first thing I'd suspect is to look at what existing Congressional caucuses exist along ideological lines and comprise several individuals.  I'd expect some of those caucuses to be their own parties (at least over time, or if there was some reset to prevent the existing parties from continuing through inertia),

	looking to wiki, it looks like there'd be a progressive group, the blue dogs (center-left dems), the freedom caucus all splitting off

	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_caucus

	Past that I'm not seeing anything obvious.  While it's hard to say for sure hwo trendlines would develop, I don't see a likelihood of regionally focused parties, except perhaps for some sort of Texas party that only operates out of Texas.

	The US economy is diverse enough that I don't see any likely parties focused on any industry.  You'd probably see a couple very small eccentric parties for the disaffected, but i'm not sure they'd get any seats; and you already have the libertarian and green parties for that.

	It would probably look a lot like Australia. There would still be two dominant parties that are reasonably close to the centre but with some more extreme (on both sides) candidates/parties in the mix. The President would still always come from one of the dominant parties.

	Instant Runoff Voting (which of course require a Constitutional Amendment) is not [precinct summable](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YtejO54DSOFRkHBGryS9pbKcBM7u1jTS/view).

	There is no fucking way we can do a national election with Instant Runoff.  But we ***could*** use a [better form of Ranked-Choice Voting](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jIhFQfEoxSdyRz5SqEjZotbVDx4xshwM/view) which is what we should be doing anyway.

	My hope is someday Progressive and Green and Libertarian and Socialist parties can run people for office without fear of Duverger's Law.  With a few third party people in government, I believe that would be a better thing.

				I am perfectly well aware of what ranked ballots are and have been for ten years now. I live in a country where parties use it to choose their candidates. 
				
				The theoretical problems you cite hardly seem to be important for over a hundred countries. They just want a president the majority had voted for in the decisive round. Very smart people, more than you, have freely adopted it dozens of times knowing about issues you cite and don't care much, it works and hundreds of elections show it works to choose a president and lots of other kinds of positions like mayors and governors.

			Yes.  There are a few stabs at the problem.  IRV, without redistributing excess votes (like with the Gregory method) won't solve the problem.
			
			Multiwinner elections are different from single winner.  And electing delegates for a candidate for the national convention in a proportional manner is another problem still.

	A multi-party system is "doomed" to collapse into some form of two groups. Perhaps you can get those groups to take vaguely different shapes on particular issues... But politics is about policy.

	To set policy, you draft the policy. Then you vote on it. You either support the policy as written, or you don't. 

	Let's say you get a party of gun happy environmentalists that want guns and green energy. That party gains some support.

	At first you think, "great!!!" They'll support the right on 2a and the left on climate change!!"

	But then everyone comes to the table on a particular policy. The Democrats say, "we need your support on this solar spending bill. Yes it's not as much as you want and it's not happening as fast as you want but it's something"

	it's an easy choice right?

	The problem is, the Republicans are sitting on the other side of the table. They don't want this spending. Some of their single issue 2a voters have been absorbed by the new party. 2a is, surprisingly, less important to them. They have an "American Families Act" Bill in the works. It might include enhanced 2a protections... Or they might see gun based domestic violence as a threat to American families...

	At the end of the day... When it comes time to sit down and make policy, you're going to need allies.

	Parties are terrible as a way to control outcomes, but fine if you have ranked choice voting more or less.  We need ranked choice voting, and more parties will be fine then, and viable.
