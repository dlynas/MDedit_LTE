We all want Systemic Change, but…  
Systems are not monolithic entities spurn into action by force of will alone; but complex organisms with vital functions and complex interdependencies, animated by their own “needs”, (at times against our best interests). While their configurations run the gamut from corporations to communities, financial institutions and families, they are all dependent on energy exchanges. We identify and formalize healthy patterns of flow through symbol systems (ex, tokens, badges, tickets, standards) we call current-sees. We choose to focus on Currencies as we consider them as the foundational building blocks from which all complex systems are built.

We recognize systems as dynamic, living things, whose health and efficacy depend on the integrity of their ‘flows’. It is this continued active exchange of value that gives shape and motive force to a system. Coherence is maintained by these interchanges alone, interrupt those flows and nothing remains but a lifeless collection of parts.

As an industrialized society, we have a propensity for reducing complex systems to nothing more than their component pieces.  
We’ve been conditioned to objectify viable resources, rather than observe their vitality in context. This is a holdover from an era (not yet past) whose end goal was to extract from, rather than work within, living systems. If we are to make better decisions & craft better systems going forward, we need to develop “new” ways of understanding and interacting with our environment.

Markets, Governments, Businesses, and Institutions of all sorts don’t simply rely on currency to function. They operate as a function of currency. All extant institutions are formed around, and operate from within the constraints of popular currency. -The design of which dictates the rules and selection pressures that shape all our collective social endeavors. We cannot begin to hope for “systemic reforms” without first addressing the singular circumstance which belies them all.

We are committed to developing the tools, practices, and technologies that assist projects in their efforts and people on their journey to encode new social patterns. And together to build new economies that are distributed, equitable, and regenerative.

#### Currencies

The words "currency" and "current" come from the same Latin verb, correre, meaning "to run." Crucial for designing community, "current-sees" shape, enable, and measure flows of resources and value. The MetaCurrency Project uses these powerful tools to create solutions that go much deeper than money. We specialize in designing dynamic systems for specific communities and their specific needs.

#### Open Technology

If we want technology to actually solve problems, it can't recreate the same imbalances found in our economic system. An equitable, healthy economy in an information age requires information technology that empowers everyone equitably. Our team demands the most rigorous standards for distributed processing and data integrity in all the technology that we develop.

#### Collective Intelligence

Evolution has provided humankind with deep social skills for collaboration and mutual support. In order to achieve goals in a complex and changing context a group of people can tap into this matrix of information and skill sharing that defines our species. The MetaCurrency Project has developed this common sense into a discipline and ethics for the Information Age: a strategy for scaling our humanity. 

#### Sovereign Accountable Commons

New tools and capabilities require new organizational models. A Sovereign Accountable Commons (SAC) holds the code, assets, and communities emerging as we release the Ceptr network. An equitable economy requires a composable grammar of the commons. SACs provide a medium with which to make that composability happen, revolutionizing our organizing capacities in their capability to scale and fork.
