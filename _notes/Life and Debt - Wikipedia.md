_**Life and Debt**_ is a 2001 [American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") [documentary film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film "Documentary film") directed by [Stephanie Black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephanie_Black "Stephanie Black"). It examines the economic and social situation in [Jamaica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica "Jamaica") after [globalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization "Globalization"), and specifically how the [International Monetary Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund "International Monetary Fund") and the [World Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank "World Bank")'s [structural adjustment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_adjustment "Structural adjustment") policies have impacted the island.

## Synopsis\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Life_and_Debt&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Synopsis")\]

_Life and Debt_ is a 2001 United States documentary film directed by [Stephanie Black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephanie_Black "Stephanie Black") about the economic and social situation in [Jamaica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica "Jamaica") after [globalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization "Globalization"), specifically the impact of [International Monetary Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund "International Monetary Fund") (IMF) and the [World Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank "World Bank")'s policies. It starts with the essay "[A Small Place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Small_Place "A Small Place")" by [Jamaica Kincaid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica_Kincaid "Jamaica Kincaid"). The IMF loans were conditional on structural adjustment policies, which required Jamaica to enact major economic reforms, including trade liberalization, privatization, and deregulation. Reforms were not successful and left Jamaica with $4.6 billion in debt.

The film features a number of interviews with former Jamaican Prime Minister [Michael Manley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Manley "Michael Manley"), in which he critiques the system of International Financial Institution loans. He is particularly critical of required structural adjustments as an attack on the sovereignty of many former colonial nations and suggests the system is akin to [imperialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism "Imperialism") or [neocolonialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neocolonialism "Neocolonialism"). He also criticizes the [Jamaican Free Zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaican_Free_Zones "Jamaican Free Zones") as [U.S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States").-subsidized [sweatshops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweatshop "Sweatshop"). The film itself interviews several of the free zone workers.
