**Dialectical materialism** is a [materialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialist "Materialist") theory based upon the writings of [Karl Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx "Karl Marx") and [Friedrich Engels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Engels "Friedrich Engels") that has found widespread applications in a variety of philosophical disciplines ranging from [philosophy of history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_history "Philosophy of history") to [philosophy of science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science "Philosophy of science").<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> As a materialist philosophy, [Marxist dialectics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic#Marxist_dialectic "Dialectic") emphasizes the importance of real-world conditions and the presence of functional contradictions within and among social relations, which derive from, but are not limited to, the contradictions that occur in [social class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(social) "Class (social)"), [labour economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics "Labour economics"), and [socioeconomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics "Socioeconomics") interactions.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> Within Marxism, a [contradiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contradiction#Dialectical_materialism "Contradiction") is a relationship in which two forces oppose each other, leading to mutual development.<sup id="cite_ref-:02_4-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-:02-4">[4]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page: 256">: 256 </span></sup> 

In contrast with the idealist perspective of [Hegelian dialectics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic#Hegelian_dialectic "Dialectic"), the materialist perspective of Marxist dialectics emphasizes that contradictions in material phenomena could be resolved with dialectical analysis, from which is synthesized the solution that resolves the contradiction, whilst retaining the essence of the phenomena. Marx proposed that the most effective solution to the problems caused by contradiction was to address the contradiction and then rearrange the systems of [social organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_organization "Social organization") that are the root of the problem.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

Dialectical materialism recognises the evolution of the natural world, and thus the emergence of new qualities of [being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being "Being") human and of human existence. Engels used the [metaphysical insight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics "Metaphysics") that the higher level of human existence emerges from and is freerooted in the lower level of human existence. That the higher level of being is a new order with irreducible laws, and that evolution is governed by laws of development, which reflect the basic properties of _matter in motion_.<sup id="cite_ref-Jordan,_p._167_6-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-Jordan,_p._167-6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>

In the 1930s, in the Soviet Union, the book _[Dialectical and Historical Materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_and_Historical_Materialism "Dialectical and Historical Materialism")_ (1938), by [Joseph Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin "Joseph Stalin"), set forth the Soviet formulation of dialectical materialism and of [historical materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_materialism "Historical materialism"), which were taught in the [Soviet system of education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_the_Soviet_Union "Education in the Soviet Union"). In the [People's Republic of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China "People's Republic of China"), an analogous text was the essay _[On Contradiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Contradiction "On Contradiction")_ (1937), by [Mao Zedong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong "Mao Zedong"), which was a foundational document of [Maoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maoism "Maoism").

## The term\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dialectical_materialism&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: The term")\]

The term _dialectical materialism_ was coined in 1887 by [Joseph Dietzgen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Dietzgen "Joseph Dietzgen"), a socialist who corresponded with Marx, during and after the failed [1848 German Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1848_in_the_German_states "Revolutions of 1848 in the German states").<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> Casual mention of the term "dialectical materialism" is also found in the biography _Frederick Engels_, by philosopher [Karl Kautsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Kautsky "Karl Kautsky"),<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> written in 1899. Marx himself had talked about the "materialist conception of history", which was later referred to as "[historical materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_materialism "Historical materialism")" by Engels. Engels further explained the "materialist dialectic" in his _[Dialectics of Nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectics_of_Nature "Dialectics of Nature")_ in 1883. [Georgi Plekhanov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgi_Plekhanov "Georgi Plekhanov"), the father of Russian Marxism, first used the term "dialectical materialism" in 1891 in his writings on [Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel "Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel") and Marx.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> Stalin further delineated and defined dialectical and historical materialism as the world outlook of [Marxism–Leninism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism "Marxism–Leninism"), and as a method to study society and its history.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>

## Historical background\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dialectical_materialism&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Historical background")\]

Marx and Engels each began their adulthood as [Young Hegelians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Hegelians "Young Hegelians"), one of several groups of intellectuals inspired by the philosopher Hegel.<sup id="cite_ref-Sperber_2013_12-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-Sperber_2013-12">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Hunt_2009_13-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-Hunt_2009-13">[13]</a></sup> Marx's doctoral thesis, _[The Difference Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Difference_Between_the_Democritean_and_Epicurean_Philosophy_of_Nature "The Difference Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature")_, was concerned with the [atomism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomism "Atomism") of [Epicurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicurus "Epicurus") and [Democritus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democritus "Democritus"), which is considered the foundation of materialist philosophy. Marx was also familiar with [Lucretius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucretius "Lucretius")'s theory of _[clinamen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinamen "Clinamen")_.

Marx and Engels both concluded that [Hegelian philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegelian_philosophy "Hegelian philosophy"), at least as interpreted by their former colleagues, was too abstract and was being misapplied in attempts to explain the [social injustice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_injustice "Social injustice") in [recently industrializing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrialisation "Industrialisation") countries such as [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany "Germany"), [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France"), and the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom"), which was a growing concern in the early 1840s, as exemplified by [Dickensian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dickens "Charles Dickens") inequity.<sup id="cite_ref-Hunt_2009_13-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-Hunt_2009-13">[13]</a></sup>

In contrast to the conventional [Hegelian dialectic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic#Hegelian_dialectic "Dialectic") of the day, which emphasized the [idealist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism "Idealism") observation that human experience is dependent on the mind's perceptions, Marx developed [Marxist dialectics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic#Marxist_dialectic "Dialectic"), which emphasized the [materialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism "Materialism") view that the world of the concrete shapes [socioeconomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics "Socioeconomics") interactions and that those in turn determine [sociopolitical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_sociology "Political sociology") reality.<sup id="cite_ref-Sperber_2013_12-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-Sperber_2013-12">[12]</a></sup>

Whereas some Hegelians blamed [religious alienation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_alienation "Religious alienation") (estrangement from the traditional comforts of religion) for [societal ills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_issue "Social issue"), Marx and Engels concluded that alienation from economic and political [autonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy "Autonomy"), coupled with [exploitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploitation_of_labour "Exploitation of labour") and [poverty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty "Poverty"), was the real culprit.<sup id="cite_ref-Hunt_2009_13-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-Hunt_2009-13">[13]</a></sup>

In keeping with dialectical ideas, Marx and Engels thus created an alternative theory, not only of why the world is the way it is but also of which actions people should take to make it the way it ought to be. In _[Theses on Feuerbach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theses_on_Feuerbach "Theses on Feuerbach")_ (1845), Marx wrote a famous quote, "The philosophers have only _interpreted_ the world, in various ways. The point, however, is to _change_ it."<sup id="cite_ref-Sperber_2013_12-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-Sperber_2013-12">[12]</a></sup> Dialectical materialism is thus closely related to Marx's and Engels's [historical materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_materialism "Historical materialism") (and has sometimes been viewed as [synonymous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonym "Synonym") with it). Marx rejected [Fichte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fichte "Fichte")'s language of "[thesis, antithesis, synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis,_antithesis,_synthesis "Thesis, antithesis, synthesis")".<sup id="cite_ref-Wood_14-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-Wood-14">[14]</a></sup>

Dialectical materialism is an aspect of the broader subject of [materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism "Materialism"), which asserts the primacy of the material world: in short, matter precedes thought. Materialism is a [realist philosophy of science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_realism "Scientific realism"),<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> which holds that the world is material; that all phenomena in the universe consist of "matter in motion," wherein all things are interdependent and interconnected and develop according to [natural law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_law "Natural law"); that the world exists outside consciousness and independently of people's perception of it; that thought is a reflection of the material world in the brain, and that the world is _in principle_ knowable.

Marx criticized classical materialism as another idealist philosophy—idealist because of its transhistorical understanding of material contexts. The Young Hegelian [Ludwig Feuerbach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Feuerbach "Ludwig Feuerbach") had rejected Hegel's idealistic philosophy and advocated materialism.<sup id="cite_ref-Marxists_16-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-Marxists-16">[16]</a></sup> Despite being strongly influenced by Feuerbach,<sup id="cite_ref-Marxists_16-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-Marxists-16">[16]</a></sup> Marx rejected Feuerbach's version of materialism ([anthropological materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropological_materialism "Anthropological materialism")) as inconsistent.<sup id="cite_ref-NC57_17-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-NC57-17">[17]</a></sup> The writings of Engels, especially _[Anti-Dühring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-D%C3%BChring "Anti-Dühring")_ (1878) and _[Dialectics of Nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectics_of_Nature "Dialectics of Nature")_ (1875–82), were the source of the main doctrines of dialectical materialism.<sup id="cite_ref-Wood_14-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-Wood-14">[14]</a></sup>

## Marx's dialectics\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dialectical_materialism&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Marx's dialectics")\]

The concept of dialectical materialism emerges from statements by Marx in the second edition postface to his _magnum opus_, _[Das Kapital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital "Das Kapital")_. There Marx says he intends to use Hegelian dialectics but in revised form. He defends Hegel against those who view him as a "dead dog" and then says, "I openly avowed myself as the pupil of that mighty thinker Hegel".<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> Marx credits Hegel with "being the first to present \[dialectic's\] form of working in a comprehensive and conscious manner". But he then criticizes Hegel for turning dialectics upside down: "With him it is standing on its head. It must be turned right side up again, if you would discover the rational kernel within the mystical shell.".<sup id="cite_ref-Marx,_p._25_19-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-Marx,_p._25-19">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup>

Marx's criticism of Hegel asserts that Hegel's dialectics go astray by dealing with ideas, with the human mind. Hegel's dialectic, Marx says, inappropriately concerns "the process of the human brain"; it focuses on ideas. Hegel's thought is in fact sometimes called **dialectical idealism**, and Hegel himself is counted among a number of other philosophers known as the [German idealists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_idealists "German idealists"). Marx, on the contrary, believed that dialectics should deal not with the [mental world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_world "Mental world") of ideas but with "the material world", the world of production and other economic activity.<sup id="cite_ref-Marx,_p._25_19-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-Marx,_p._25-19">[19]</a></sup> For Marx, a contradiction can be solved by a desperate struggle to change the social world. This was a very important transformation because it allowed him to move dialectics out of the contextual subject of philosophy and into the study of social relations based on the material world.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup>

For Marx, human history cannot be fitted into any neat _[a priori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori "A priori and a posteriori")_ schema. He explicitly rejects the idea of Hegel's followers that history can be understood as "a person apart, a metaphysical subject of which real human individuals are but the bearers".<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> To interpret history as though previous social formations have somehow been aiming themselves toward the present state of affairs is "to misunderstand the historical movement by which the successive generations transformed the results acquired by the generations that preceded them".<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> Marx's rejection of this sort of [teleology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology "Teleology") was one reason for his enthusiastic (though not entirely uncritical) reception of [Charles Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin "Charles Darwin")'s [theory of natural selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_natural_selection "Theory of natural selection").<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup>

For Marx, dialectics is not a formula for generating predetermined outcomes but is a method for the [empirical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empiricism "Empiricism") study of social processes in terms of interrelations, development, and transformation. In his introduction to the Penguin edition of Marx's _Capital_, [Ernest Mandel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Mandel "Ernest Mandel") writes, "When the dialectical method is applied to the study of economic problems, economic phenomena are not viewed separately from each other, by bits and pieces, but in their inner connection as an integrated totality, structured around, and by, a basic predominant mode of production."<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup>

Marx's own writings are almost exclusively concerned with understanding human history in terms of systemic processes, based on [modes of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modes_of_production "Modes of production") (broadly speaking, the ways in which societies are organized to employ their technological powers to interact with their material surroundings). This is called _[historical materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_materialism "Historical materialism")_. More narrowly, within the framework of this general theory of history, most of Marx's writing is devoted to an analysis of the specific structure and development of the [capitalist economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist_economy "Capitalist economy").

For his part, Engels applies a "dialectical" approach to the natural world in general, arguing that contemporary science is increasingly recognizing the necessity of viewing natural processes in terms of [interconnectedness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monism "Monism"), development, and transformation. Some scholars have doubted that Engels' "dialectics of nature" is a legitimate extension of Marx's approach to social processes.<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup> Other scholars have argued that despite Marx's insistence that humans are natural beings in an evolving, mutual relationship with the rest of nature, Marx's own writings pay inadequate attention to the ways in which human agency is constrained by such factors as biology, geography, and ecology.<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup>

## Engels's dialectics\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dialectical_materialism&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Engels's dialectics")\]

Engels postulated three laws of dialectics from his reading of Hegel's _[Science of Logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_of_Logic "Science of Logic")_.<sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup> Engels elucidated these laws as the **materialist dialectic** in his work _Dialectics of Nature_:

1.  The law of the unity and conflict of opposites
2.  The law of the passage of quantitative changes into qualitative changes
3.  The law of the negation of the negation

The first law, which originates with the ancient [Ionian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionians "Ionians") philosopher [Heraclitus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclitus "Heraclitus"),<sup id="cite_ref-33"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup> can be clarified through the following examples:

> For example, in biological evolution the formation of new forms of life occurs precisely through the unity and struggle of opposites in heredity and variability. In physical processes the nature of light was explained precisely by means of the unity and struggle of opposites appearing, for example, as corpuscular and wave properties; this, moreover, cleared the path for a “drama of ideas” in physical science, whereby the opposition and synthesis of corpuscular and wave theories characterized scientific progress. The most basic expression of the unity and struggle of opposites in the world of commodity capitalism is that of use value and value; the most highly developed oppositions in capitalism are the working class and the bourgeoisie,
> 
> — _The Great Soviet Encyclopedia (1979)_, Unity and Struggle of Opposites – [Web page](https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Unity+and+Struggle+of+Opposites)

The first law was seen by both Hegel and [Vladimir Lenin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin "Vladimir Lenin") as the central feature of a dialectical understanding:

> It is in this dialectic as it is here understood, that is, in the grasping of oppositions in their unity, or of the positive in the negative, that speculative thought consists. It is the most important aspect of dialectic.

> The splitting of a single whole and the cognition of its contradictory parts is the essence (one of the "essentials", one of the principal, if not the principal, characteristics or features) of dialectics. That is precisely how Hegel, too, puts the matter.
> 
> — _Lenin's Collected Works: Volume 38_, p. 359: On the question of dialectics.

The second law Hegel took from Ancient Greek philosophers, notably the [paradox of the heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_the_heap "Paradox of the heap"), and explanation by [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle"),<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup> and it is equated with what scientists call [phase transitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_transitions "Phase transitions"). It may be traced to the ancient Ionian philosophers, particularly [Anaximenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaximenes_of_Miletus "Anaximenes of Miletus")<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> from whom Aristotle, Hegel, and Engels inherited the concept. For all these authors, one of the main illustrations is the phase transitions of water. There has also been an effort to apply this mechanism to social phenomena, whereby population increases result in changes in social structure. The law of the passage of quantitative changes into qualitative changes can also be applied to the process of [social change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_change "Social change") and [class conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_conflict "Class conflict").<sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup>

The third law, "negation of the negation", originated with Hegel. Although Hegel coined the term "negation of the negation", it gained its fame from Marx's using it in _Capital_. There Marx wrote this: "The \[death\] knell of capitalist private property sounds. The expropriators are expropriated. The capitalist mode of appropriation, the result of the capitalist mode of production, produces capitalist private property. This is the first negation of individual private property ... But capitalist production begets, with the inexorability of a law of Nature, its own negation. It \[this new negation\] is the negation of negation."<sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup>

Z. A. Jordan notes, "Engels made constant use of the metaphysical insight that the higher level of existence emerges from and has its roots in the lower; that the higher level constitutes a new order of being with its irreducible laws; and that this process of evolutionary advance is governed by laws of development which reflect basic properties of 'matter in motion as a whole'."<sup id="cite_ref-Jordan,_p._167_6-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-Jordan,_p._167-6">[6]</a></sup>

## Lenin's contributions\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dialectical_materialism&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Lenin's contributions")\]

After reading Hegel's _Science of Logic_ in 1914, Lenin made some brief notes outlining three "elements" of logic.<sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup> They are:

1.  The determination of the concept out of itself \[the thing itself must be considered in its relations and in its development\];
2.  The contradictory nature of the thing itself (the other of itself), the contradictory forces and tendencies in each phenomenon;
3.  The union of analysis and synthesis.

Lenin develops these in a further series of notes, and appears to argue that "the transition of quantity into quality and vice versa" is an example of the unity and opposition of opposites expressed tentatively as "not only the unity of opposites but the transitions of every determination, quality, feature, side, property into every other \[into its opposite?\]."

In his essay "On the Question of Dialectics", Lenin stated, "Development is the 'struggle' of opposites." He stated, "The unity (coincidence, identity, equal action) of opposites is conditional, temporary, transitory, relative. The struggle of mutually exclusive opposites is absolute, just as development and motion are absolute."<sup id="cite_ref-39"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup>

In _[Materialism and Empiriocriticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism_and_Empiriocriticism "Materialism and Empiriocriticism")_ (1908), Lenin explained _dialectical materialism_ as three axes: (i) the materialist inversion of Hegelian dialectics, (ii) the [historicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_(philosophy) "Historicity (philosophy)") of ethical principles ordered to [class struggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_struggle "Class struggle"), and (iii) the convergence of "[laws of evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution "Evolution")" in physics ([Helmholtz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz "Helmholtz")), biology ([Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin "Charles Darwin")), and in [political economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_economy "Political economy") (Marx). Hence, Lenin was philosophically positioned between historicist Marxism ([Labriola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Labriola "Antonio Labriola")) and [determinist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism "Determinism") Marxism—a political position close to "[social Darwinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Darwinism "Social Darwinism")" (Kautsky) <sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (February 2023)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>. Moreover, late-century discoveries in physics ([x-rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-rays "X-rays"), [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrons "Electrons")), and the beginning of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"), philosophically challenged previous conceptions of [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter") and materialism, thus matter seemed to be disappearing. Lenin disagreed:

> 'Matter disappears' means that the limit within which we have hitherto known matter disappears, and that our knowledge is penetrating deeper; properties of matter are disappearing that formerly seemed absolute, immutable, and primary, and which are now revealed to be relative and characteristic only of certain states of matter. For the _sole_ 'property' of matter, with whose recognition philosophical materialism is bound up, is the property of _being an objective reality_, of existing outside of the mind.

Lenin was developing the work of Engels, who said that "with each epoch-making discovery, even in the sphere of [natural science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_science "Natural science"), materialism has to change its form".<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup> One of Lenin's challenges was distancing materialism, as a viable philosophical outlook, from the "vulgar materialism" expressed in the statement "the brain secretes thought in the same way as the liver secretes bile" (attributed to 18th-century physician [Pierre Jean Georges Cabanis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Jean_Georges_Cabanis "Pierre Jean Georges Cabanis")); "metaphysical materialism" (matter composed of immutable particles); and 19th-century "mechanical materialism" (matter as random molecules interacting per the laws of mechanics). The philosophic solution that Lenin (and Engels) proposed was "dialectical materialism", wherein matter is defined as _[objective reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective_reality "Objective reality")_, theoretically consistent with (new) developments occurring in the sciences.

Lenin reassessed Feuerbach's philosophy and concluded that it was in line with dialectical materialism.<sup id="cite_ref-NC57_17-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-NC57-17">[17]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Accuracy_dispute#Disputed_statement" title="Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute"><span title="The source says that Feuerbach is consistently materialist, not that he is a dialectical materialist.

## Trotsky's contributions\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dialectical_materialism&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Trotsky's contributions")\]

In 1926, Trotsky said in a speech:

> It is the task of science and technology to make matter subject to man, together with space and time, which are inseparable from matter. True, there are certain idealist books—not of a clerical character, but philosophical ones—wherein you can read that time and space are categories of our minds, that they result from the requirements of our thinking, and that nothing actually corresponds to them in reality. But it is difficult to agree with this view. If any idealist philosopher, instead of arriving in time to catch the 9 pm train, should turn up two minutes late, he would see the tail of the departing train and would be convinced by his own eyes that time and space are inseparable from material reality. The task is to diminish this space, to overcome it, to economise time, to prolong human life, to register past time, to raise life to a higher level and enrich it. This is the reason for the struggle with space and time, at the basis of which lies the struggle to subject matter to man—matter, which constitutes the foundation not only of everything that really exists, but also of all imagination ... Every science is an accumulation of knowledge, based on experience relating to matter, to its properties; an accumulation of generalised understanding of how to subject this matter to the interests and needs of man.<sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup>

In his book, _In Defence of Marxism_, [Leon Trotsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Trotsky "Leon Trotsky") defended the dialectical method of [scientific socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_socialism "Scientific socialism") during the factional schisms within the American Trotskyist movement in the period 1939–40. Trotsky viewed dialectics as an essential method of analysis to discern [class nature of the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalinism#Trotskyism "Stalinism"). Specifically, he described scientific socialism as "the conscious expression of the unconscious historical process; namely, the instinctive and elemental drive of the proletariat to reconstruct society on communist beginnings".<sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup>

## Lukács's contributions\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dialectical_materialism&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Lukács's contributions")\]

[György Lukács](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs "György Lukács"), Minister of Culture in the brief [Béla Kun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Kun "Béla Kun") government of the [Hungarian Soviet Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Soviet_Republic "Hungarian Soviet Republic") (1919), published _[History and Class Consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_and_Class_Consciousness "History and Class Consciousness")_ (1923), in which he defined _dialectical materialism_ as the knowledge of society as a whole, knowledge which, in itself, was the [class consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_consciousness "Class consciousness") of the [proletariat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proletariat "Proletariat"). In the first chapter "What is Orthodox Marxism?", Lukács defined _orthodoxy_ as fidelity to the "Marxist method", not fidelity to "dogmas":

> [Orthodox Marxism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Marxism "Orthodox Marxism"), therefore, does not imply the uncritical acceptance of the results of Marx's investigations. It is not the "belief" in this or that thesis, nor the [exegesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exegesis "Exegesis") of a "sacred" book. On the contrary, orthodoxy refers exclusively to method. It is the scientific conviction that dialectical materialism is the road to truth and that its methods can be developed, expanded, and deepened, only along the lines laid down by its founders. (§1)

In his later works and actions, Lukács became a leader of [Democratic Marxism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Marxism "Democratic Marxism"). He modified many of his formulations of his 1923 works and went on to develop a Marxist [ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology "Ontology") and played an active role in democratic movements in Hungary in 1956 and the 1960s. He and his associates became sharply critical of the formulation of dialectical materialism in the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") that was exported to those countries under its control. In the 1960s, his associates became known as the [Budapest School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_School_(Luk%C3%A1cs) "Budapest School (Lukács)").

Lukács, in his philosophical criticism of [Marxist revisionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist_revisionism "Marxist revisionism"), proposed an intellectual return to the Marxist method. So did [Louis Althusser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Althusser "Louis Althusser"), who later defined Marxism and [psychoanalysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis "Psychoanalysis") as "conflictual sciences",<sup id="cite_ref-43"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup> stating that political factions and revisionism are inherent to [Marxist theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist_theory "Marxist theory") and political praxis, because dialectical materialism is the philosophic product of class struggle:

> For this reason, the task of orthodox Marxism, its victory over Revisionism and [utopianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopian_socialism "Utopian socialism") can never mean the defeat, once and for all, of false tendencies. It is an ever-renewed struggle against the insidious effects of [bourgeois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeois "Bourgeois") ideology on the thought of the proletariat. Marxist orthodoxy is no guardian of traditions, it is the eternally vigilant prophet proclaiming the relation between the tasks of the immediate present and the totality of the historical process. (§5)
> 
> ...the premise of dialectical materialism is, we recall: 'It is not men's consciousness that determines their existence, but, on the contrary, their social existence that determines their consciousness'.... Only when the core of existence stands revealed as a social process can existence be seen as the product, albeit the hitherto unconscious product, of human activity. (§5)

Philosophically aligned with Marx is the criticism of the [individualist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualist "Individualist"), bourgeois philosophy of the [subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_(philosophy) "Subject (philosophy)"), which is founded upon the voluntary and [conscious subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness "Consciousness"). Against said ideology is the primacy of social relations. Existence—and thus the world—is the product of human activity, but this can be seen only by accepting the primacy of social process on individual consciousness. This type of consciousness is an effect of ideological [mystification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystification_(sociology) "Mystification (sociology)").

At the 5th Congress of the [Communist International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comintern "Comintern") (July 1924), [Grigory Zinoviev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigory_Zinoviev "Grigory Zinoviev") formally denounced Lukács's heterodox definition of Orthodox Marxism as exclusively derived from fidelity to the "Marxist method", and not to Communist party dogmas; and denounced the philosophical developments of the German Marxist theorist [Karl Korsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Korsch "Karl Korsch").

## Stalin's contributions\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dialectical_materialism&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Stalin's contributions")\]

In the 1930s, Stalin and his associates formulated a version of dialectical and [historical materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_materialism "Historical materialism") that became the "official" Soviet interpretation of Marxism. It was codified in Stalin's work, _[Dialectical and Historical Materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_and_Historical_Materialism "Dialectical and Historical Materialism")_ (1938), and popularized in textbooks used for [compulsory education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_education "Compulsory education") within the Soviet Union and throughout the [Eastern Bloc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Bloc "Eastern Bloc").

## Mao's contributions\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dialectical_materialism&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Mao's contributions")\]

In _[On Contradiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Contradiction "On Contradiction")_ (1937), [Mao Zedong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong "Mao Zedong") outlined a version of dialectical materialism that subsumed two of Engels's three principal laws of dialectics, "the transformation of quantity into quality" and "the negation of the negation" as sub-laws (and not principal laws of their own) of the first law, "the unity and interpenetration of opposites".

## Ho Chi Minh's contributions\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dialectical_materialism&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Ho Chi Minh's contributions")\]

In his 1947 article _New Life_, Ho Chi Minh described the dialectical relationship between the old and the new in building society, stating:<sup id="cite_ref-:0_44-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-:0-44">[44]</a></sup>

> Not everything old must be abandoned. We do not have to reinvent everything. What is old but bad must be abandoned. What is old but troublesome must be corrected appropriately. What is old but good must be further developed. What is new but good must be done.

## As a heuristic in science and elsewhere\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dialectical_materialism&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: As a heuristic in science and elsewhere")\]

Historian of science [Loren Graham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loren_Graham "Loren Graham") has detailed at length the role played by dialectical materialism in the Soviet Union in disciplines throughout the [natural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_science "Natural science") and [social sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_sciences "Social sciences"). He has concluded that, despite the [Lysenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trofim_Lysenko "Trofim Lysenko") period in genetics and constraints on free inquiry imposed by political authorities, dialectical materialism had a positive influence on the work of many Soviet scientists.<sup id="cite_ref-45"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup>

Some [evolutionary biologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_biologist "Evolutionary biologist"), such as [Richard Lewontin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Lewontin "Richard Lewontin") and [Stephen Jay Gould](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Jay_Gould "Stephen Jay Gould"), have tried to employ dialectical materialism in their approach. They view dialectics as playing a precautionary heuristic role in their work. Lewontin's perspective offers the following idea:

> Dialectical materialism is not, and never has been, a programmatic method for solving particular physical problems. Rather, a dialectical analysis provides an overview and a set of warning signs against particular forms of dogmatism and narrowness of thought. It tells us, "Remember that history may leave an important trace. Remember that being and becoming are dual aspects of nature. Remember that conditions change and that the conditions necessary to the initiation of some process may be destroyed by the process itself. Remember to pay attention to real objects in time and space and not lose them in utterly idealized abstractions. Remember that the qualitative effects of context and interaction may be lost when phenomena are isolated". And above all else, "Remember that all the other caveats are only reminders and warning signs whose application to different circumstances of the real world is contingent."<sup id="cite_ref-evolutionthe1st4billionyears_46-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-evolutionthe1st4billionyears-46">[46]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-47"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup>

Gould shared similar views regarding a heuristic role for dialectical materialism. He wrote that:

> ...dialectical thinking should be taken more seriously by Western scholars, not discarded because some nations of the second world have constructed a cardboard version as an official political doctrine.<sup id="cite_ref-Urchininthestorm153_48-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-Urchininthestorm153-48">[48]</a></sup>
> 
>   
> ...when presented as guidelines for a philosophy of change, not as dogmatic precepts true by fiat, the three classical laws of dialectics embody a holistic vision that views change as interaction among components of complete systems and sees the components themselves not as a priori entities, but as both products and inputs to the system. Thus, the law of "interpenetrating opposites" records the inextricable interdependence of components: the "transformation of quantity to quality" defends a systems-based view of change that translates incremental inputs into alterations of state, and the "negation of negation" describes the direction given to history because complex systems cannot revert exactly to previous states.<sup id="cite_ref-Urchininthestorm154_49-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-Urchininthestorm154-49">[49]</a></sup>

This heuristic was also applied to the theory of [punctuated equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuated_equilibrium "Punctuated equilibrium") proposed by Gould and [Niles Eldredge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niles_Eldredge "Niles Eldredge"). They wrote that "history, as Hegel said, moves upward in a spiral of negations", and that "punctuated equilibria is a model for discontinuous tempos of change (in) the process of speciation and the deployment of species in geological time."<sup id="cite_ref-Gould&amp;Eldredge_50-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-Gould&amp;Eldredge-50">[50]</a></sup> They noted that "the law of transformation of quantity into quality... holds that a new quality emerges in a leap as the slow accumulation of quantitative changes, long resisted by a stable system, finally forces it rapidly from one state into another", a phenomenon described in some disciplines as a [paradigm shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_shift "Paradigm shift"). Apart from the commonly cited example of water turning to steam with increased temperature, Gould and Eldredge noted another analogy in [information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory "Information theory"), "with its jargon of equilibrium, steady state, and homeostasis maintained by [negative feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_feedback "Negative feedback")", and "extremely rapid transitions that occur with [positive feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_feedback "Positive feedback")".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGouldEldredge1977146_51-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGouldEldredge1977146-51">[51]</a></sup>

Lewontin, Gould, and Eldredge were thus more interested in dialectical materialism as a heuristic than a dogmatic form of 'truth' or a statement of their politics. Nevertheless, they found a readiness for critics to "seize upon" key statements<sup id="cite_ref-Brockman_52-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-Brockman-52">[52]</a></sup> and portray punctuated equilibrium, and exercises associated with it, such as public exhibitions, as a "Marxist plot".<sup id="cite_ref-Gould2002_53-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-Gould2002-53">[53]</a></sup>

The [Communist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union "Communist Party of the Soviet Union")'s official interpretation of [Marxism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism "Marxism"), dialectical materialism, fit [Alexander Oparin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Oparin "Alexander Oparin")'s studies on the [origins of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis "Abiogenesis") as 'a flow, an exchange, a dialectical unity'. This notion was re-enforced by Oparin's association with [Lysenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trofim_Lysenko "Trofim Lysenko").<sup id="cite_ref-schopf123_54-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-schopf123-54">[54]</a></sup>

In 1972, the worst chaos<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch"><span title="The material near this tag may use weasel words or too-vague attribution. (April 2024)">according to whom?</span></a></i>]</sup> of China's [Cultural Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution "Cultural Revolution") was over and scientific research resumed. [Astrophysicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysicist "Astrophysicist") and [cosmologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmologist "Cosmologist") [Fang Lizhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fang_Lizhi "Fang Lizhi") found an opportunity to read some recent astrophysics papers in western journals, and soon wrote his first paper on cosmology, "A Cosmological Solution in Scalar-tensor Theory with Mass and Blackbody Radiation", which was published on the journal _Wu Li_ (Physics), Vol. 1, 163 (1972). This was the first modern cosmological research paper in mainland China. Fang assembled a group of young faculty members of USTC around him to conduct astrophysics research.<sup id="cite_ref-55"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup>

At the time, conducting research on relativity theory and cosmology in China was very risky politically, because these theories were considered to be "idealistic" theories in contradiction with the dialectical materialism theory, which is the official philosophy of the Communist Party. According to the dialectical materialism philosophy, both time and space must be infinite, while the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang "Big Bang") theory allows the possibility of the finiteness of space and time. During the Cultural Revolution, campaigns were waged against [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein") and the Theory of Relativity in Beijing and Shanghai. Once Fang published his theory, some of the critics of the Theory of Relativity, especially a group based in Shanghai, prepared to attack Fang politically. However, by this time the "leftist" line was declining in the Chinese academia. Professor Dai Wensai, the most well-known Chinese astronomer at the time and chair of the Astronomy Department of [Nanjing University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing_University "Nanjing University"), also supported Fang. Many of the members of the "Theory of Relativity Criticism Group" changed to study the theory and conduct research in it. Subsequently, Fang was regarded as the father of cosmological research in China.

## Criticism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dialectical_materialism&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Criticism")\]

Philosopher [Allen Wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_W._Wood "Allen W. Wood") argued that, in its form as an official [Soviet philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_in_the_Soviet_Union "Philosophy in the Soviet Union"), dialectical materialism was doomed to be superficial because "creativity or critical thinking" was impossible in an [authoritarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism "Authoritarianism") environment. Nevertheless, he considered the basic aims and principles of dialectical materialism to be in harmony with rational scientific thought.<sup id="cite_ref-Wood_14-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-Wood-14">[14]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Kołakowski_56-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-Ko%C5%82akowski-56">[56]</a></sup>

Economist and philosopher [Ludwig von Mises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_von_Mises "Ludwig von Mises") wrote a critique of Marxist materialism which he published as a part of his 1957 work _Theory and History: An Interpretation of Social and Economic Evolution_. [H. B. Acton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._B._Acton "H. B. Acton") described Marxism as "a philosophical farrago".<sup id="cite_ref-Acton_57-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-Acton-57">[57]</a></sup> [Max Eastman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Eastman "Max Eastman") argued that dialectical materialism lacks a psychological basis.<sup id="cite_ref-58"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup>
