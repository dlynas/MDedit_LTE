			Ranked choice voting can be implemented in a state through a citizens' initiative, which is to say that enough people have to sign a petition to put it up for a public vote. It will then face a whole bunch of legal and political challenges of varying levels of bullshit, particularly from conservative politicians and judges, so its ultimate success is largely dependent on what kinds of people are in public office at the time.
			
			In other words, you can get RCV by, well, voting. Voting for a change in the law and voting for people who will be the least likely to pull heinous, probably illegal stunts to get in the way.
			
			This does, of course, fly in the face of the whole "both sides are bad and voting is pointless" thing that a bunch of people like to cling onto, but it is the truth and it has already worked once, in Maine. And just like other changes that once seemed impossible on a national scale, making progress one state at a time is a good start.

				Ranked Choice Voting can be implemented in a state that hasn't already banned Ranked Choice Voting. These are the states that have banned the idea altogether:
				
				[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked-choice\_voting\_in\_the\_United\_States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked-choice_voting_in_the_United_States)
				
				As you can see, they are conservative states like Idaho, Tennessee, Montana, etc. No, Democrats aren't actively trying to keep Ranked Choice Voting off the ballots, just because the DC Democratic Party doesn't want RCV, it doesn't represent the Democratic Party as a whole. DC isn't even a state ffs.
				
				I'm happy my home state of Nevada is open minded, nay blue enough, to at least consider RCV. In 2020, I participated in the Democratic Primary where I got the opportunity to participate in the first experimental RCV in Nevada history. We were able to rank and choose between Biden, Warren, Sanders, Yang, Klobuchar, Steyer and a host of other candidates. If you're curious, Sanders came out on top with Biden as number 2.

						It's been gaining traction in a lot of places slowly.  The key is to find the up and coming politician (in established party) who needs an edge to beat out the other side and in an area that would support ranked choice and doesnt have some other bigger election issue being voted on.  That person could be convinced to use ranked choice as the way to get the last few votes they need.

	He's not 100% wrong, but the Dems haven't had actual control of the government for a long time. The last time they had 100% control (The Presidency and House+Senate in filibuster-proof majority) was a brief 4-month stretch from 09/24/09 to 02/04/10. That's it. They used that time to pass ObamaCare and that's all they could manage.

This video doesn’t once mention gerrymandering and voter suppression, the elimination of the fairness doctrine, eliminating civic education in schools, nor does he connect how or why executing on democratic initiatives would hurt corporate sponsors in the long run.

				100% but it's also really important to understand the political dynamics at play here. Joe Lieberman, senator from Connecticut was the hold out who refused to vote for the ACA if it included a public option.
				
				Well you say if Democrats won't vote progressive enough we should just primary them from the left, to either replace them or pressure them to support more progressive candidates.

Carter reran in 1980 and lost in a landslide, then Mondale ran on them in 84 and lost in a landslide, then Dukakis ran on them in 88 and lost in a landslide. Then Clinton ran as a centralist blue-dog dem in 92 and won, then Obama with the same in 08 &amp; 12, and Biden in 20.
			
			The 75th congress in the 30s was a huge democratic majority, true. But half those seats were filled with segregationist, Jim Crow southern democrats who left the party in the 60s. It was NOT the democratic party of today.

It’s designed to increase investment in local green infrastructure and business so we can compete with China and other government backed entities around the world. The end result is a cleaner world.

					While the other half are so stuck on being on their high horse and self-perceived ethical values, that they are unwilling to view the world in anything but black and white.
					
					Literally have a orange moron going around and saying I plan to be a dictator, wants to give up ukraine to russia and allow putin to take over more control of europe, gave jerusalem to israel and made statements of encouraging military to bomb family and children, used his entire term to benefit himself with tax break after tax break and inside deals for the wealthy putting the country in over 10 trillion dollar higher deficit.
					
					And because Biden cant magically fix every fucking issue perfectly, while fucking 150m voters sit on their asses when voting comes, fucking only 20% of eligible voters under the age of 35 voting, and having 2 senators fight against every bill in their own party. (Which the same dumbass people think is like a sports team where they all think and want the same things, and not you know representation of every group from far left, left, center-left, center, and even center-right with different wants because their voters are different.)
					
					Then suddenly they cant see the difference between the two.....
					
					"WHY SHOULD I CARE ABOUT NOT HAVING MY ARM CUT OFF WHEN THE OTHER OPTION IS A PAPER CUT ON MY FINGER!!!!"
					
					Screaming about gaza, student loans, whatever bullshit they pull out, always looking at everything in black and white. You think US stopping any alliance with Israel will help palestine? You dont think Israel will ally with russia or china and give american technology up and start clusterbombing the fuck out of anyone left in Gaza? Biden is the one who is trying to make ceasefires and stop Israel from killing everyone. Israel isnt going to stop just because UN told them. Theyre not gonna stop because US Stops supplying them. They will go to other nations happily waiting for them. And then you have another section of allies lost in a part of the world that has nukes.

You'd be here saying they are pro rich because the rich can easily set up tons of coal mines and start fracking easily.

			Yep. They weren't galvanized to vote for one side before. See in previous generations your local politicians were more local. 24 hour national news wasn't a thing. It was local news, politics, concerns. Locally there were districts in the South that were eternally Democrat no matter how conservative the Republican, because of the Civil War. That changed when Republicans switched to pro life.
			
			The fact is in 1980 there was a clear choice between the most Christian who ever served as President and the Candidate who courted the Christians the most, despite esousing rhetoric that was ultimately antagonistic to the teachings of christ.
			
			It's also worth pointing out, pro life didn't become big until segregation became unpopular. Segregationist leaders had to pivot to a new moral panic to start their own schools that just so happened to have no black people in them.

	This guy is so lost in his own epistemological reality that it wouldn't be worth the effort to refute even one of the 200 or so false and/or misleading claims he made in the video.

	His understanding of American politics is so ahistorical it's tiresome just thinking about it.

	Uh. Biden is no saint, but this gives zero credit to the actually great things Biden has done that Trump absolutely would not have done.

	He is absolutely spot on tho for every election from the 90s to 2016.

	Or, more specifically, 2020.

	Or, more specifically, until Jan 6 2021.

	When suddenly their very lives were in danger, the Ds stopped being as willing to be complicit in the game.

	Addon: Also, the Democrats are not the ones bombing babies. The Israeli are bombing babies. We are giving them aid we are already legally obligated to give them. Biden, the head of the **Executive** branch, does not have control over our money. Congress does.

	We could stop that, but that would require both houses of Congress to agree to stop that. And that would mean the Republican House would have to agree to.

		And also the party is made up of individual politicians. Yes there is a platform but, some could be in their position to make money not the mission of the party. 
		
		I don’t think all of the democrats want to lose. I do think there is a small group of wealthy neoliberals that fit this man’s description. Unfortunately, when the Dems did have all three all it took was 1-5people in each house to spoil a bill. That just the fact of the matter. Leiberman, sinema, manchin, Pelosi, come to mind.

	I agree with the premise until, “they could’ve codified roe”. No they couldn’t. That is subject to the filibuster. Could they have undone that, yes but the people who prevented it are either no longer a democrat (sinema) or actively considering a third party run (manchin). Conceptually fine, but again another example of people missing the actual nuance of governance. 

	Also screw both parties for their corporate cowardice.

		Democrats held the supermajority for like 6 months. It was pass ACA, or codify Roe. Congress moves slow, as designed by the Constitution.
		
		Back then there were still holdover conservative Democrats, their seats would inevitably turn red, but while they thought they had hope of retain g the seat, they dug their heels in on ACA and would have with Roe.

			Yeah, I think the thing is in retrospect we realize the Tea Party was coming and would decimate the blue dogs.  But at the time I don’t think the Obama administration/congressional leadership realized how bad the backlash would be.  So the thought slow and methodical was the way to go.  I have lots of complaints about how Obama handled his supermajority, but I can sort of understand why they played if the way they did(even if it was idealistic bullshit).

	I only made it like three minutes into this video - literally everything this guy said up to that point is dead-ass wrong. Not wrong as in "wrong opinion", wrong as in factually, historically incorrect. Like, holy shit. Let's go through them real fast!

	 - To start, maybe he gets into the DNC itself eventually, but at least as far as I went, he seems to conflate the democratic party with the DNC - the democratic national convention. These are not the same thing. Not a great start.

	 - He claims up until 50 years ago, both parties appealed to the public in various genuine ways, and THEN the right wing realized that "unimaginable money could be made from corporate campaign funding". 20 seconds in I literally laughed out loud at this. So this pretty clearly says to me that this dude hasn't studied any political history further back than 50 years. Just google "Tammany Hall" (or hell watch the movie Gangs of New York), and you can instantly see immediately how INSANELY incorrect this claim is.

	 - He claims that evangelical and fundamentalist Christians were a "new, apolitical base", and thus a target to go after by the right. That's 2 claims he's made, and twice I laughed out loud. These groups have *always* been a huge driving force in US politics. They've been heavily involved in, pretty much EVERY major political event in the US. Here's a short, easy to reference list: 60s civil rights movement; women's suffrage; prohibition; slavery; treatment of Native Americans; hell manifest destiny, the idea that we are destined by God to spread our ideals from coast to coast *literally came* from fundamentalist Christianity. Extremist branches of any religion in every human society has been a huge political force since...literally all of history. 

	 - He claims that Republicans were pro-choice until the 1980s, where they suddenly became pro-choice. [Here is a very short, educational article](https://magazine.jhsph.ed[u/2022](https://www.reddit.com/user/2022)/brief-history-abortion-us) (complete with citations!) that goes through a brief history of abortion in America. The fight against abortion first became prevalent in the **mid 1800s**, not fuckin 1980 holy shit. He does realize why Roe vs Wade was a thing, right? It happened because abortion was *already illegal* at that time. I, don't think he understands how the Supreme Court works.

	 - He goes on about how both parties are warmongerers that exist solely to funnel money into corporate pockets. I'm not saying exactly he's completely wrong here, but this is such a gross and stupid oversimplification of this, it might as well come from an edgy 15 year old. I *could* give him leniency that he's just saying this for the sake of brevity, but....THIS VIDEO IS NINE FUCKING MINUTES LONG AND HE TALKS LIKE A WW2 MACHINE GUN.

	 - So now he goes into individual policy, how Americans as individuals agree on what we want, but both parties fight against that. He says most Americans want some sort of universal healthcare (which is true, and which we do have? Has he forgotten about the ACA/Obamacare?), but IT'S BARRED FROM EVEN BEING DISCUSSED - okay, again we literally have policy that passed a (shitty version) of universal healthcare. He says we "all want the rich to pay taxes" (not true), "not to watch people die from medical issues (hyperbolic nonsense, this is not a "policy issue"), "living wages" (not true, the right does not want government involved in wage setting), "fair elections" OKAY WHAT. Ask someone on the extreme right vs someone on the extreme left what "fair elections" means to them and how to achieve that. You think they'll agree on that? Yeah ok. So all of these "issues" he lists - the differences in the parties isn't whether or not "babies should die", it's what the *role of the government* is in to achieve the thing we all agree on. This dude seriously has a 15 year old understanding of this stuff.

	 - He says that both parties put on a farce to pretend to be against each other, painting the other side as essentially evil, for profit??? It's an unironic argument using the South Park underpants gnome meme. Again realize that his WHOLE claim here is that this ONLY started 50 years ago, that this is a relatively new strategy the parties employ. We once had a senator attempt to *cane an opposing senator to death* on the floor of the chamber in the 1850s. Yeah the kind of fighting between the two parties is not only not new, it's not even special. In fact that I would say up until Trump, we'd seen more cooperation between the two than most any other period in American history. That's what makes what things are like now feel so vitriolic and special (if you have no sense or knowledge of history).

	 - He keeps repeating how genocide and killing babies and whatnot lines the pockets of corporations. This feels obvious, but...he must realize that *most* corporations in America do not benefit one iota from, say, selling weapons to Israel, or being at war in Iraq/Afghanistan (I'm assuming this what he must be alluding to). Yeah there are some, but these corps make up a very small part of wealth in America. If you even think about this for 5 seconds, a person would realize this. I also don't know why he keeps censoring the word genocide.

	 - And so now we get to the crux of his argument, which is where he decides to go on a strange tangent. He says that Republicans have it easy, because their culture war has no effect on corporations - ok, but your entire point is that the parties are doing this for corporation benefit. So they make money for corporations by....trying to enact policy that has no effect on corporations? And then he asserts that Democrats intentionally try to lose after winning elections - the only evidence he provides for this is that "we've all seen the Democrats hold the Senate, House, and Presidency simultaneously multiple times in the last few decades", and that they've made no change. So this is called a trifecta, and while yes it is technically true the Dems have had a trifecta multiple times, in reality not so much. The Dems have had the trifecta in recent decades only for very brief moments in times, and they only had that when you include people like Sinema, Munchin, and some democrat-leaning independents. The last time the Dems had a TRUE trifecta for meaningful time, was in the 60s under Kennedy and LBJ. During the civil rights movement. When we saw the most change through policies and laws since, I dunno abolition? Which we had to fight a fucking war against ourselves for? That's a REAL big whiff my guy to ignore that.

	 - Oh, also the Dems only once had a filibuster-proof trifecta (he does know what a filibuster is, right?) - for four months under Obama, and they used that to pass *universal healthcare*. Again, kind of destroys his claim that 1.) discussing healthcare is "barred", and 2.) that Dems don't do anything.

	That's where I stopped. I doubt anyone will see this at all but for my OWN SANITY I had to put down on words just how ABSURDLY INCORRECT this dude was on literally every single thing he presented as fact. Just, wow it's impressive honestly.

		Yeah a lot of his ignorance would seemingly be cured by a better understanding of the circus required to pass the ACA.
		
		Democrats got the closest to a true filibuster-proof trifecta in 2009, and it turns out passing their #1 policy priority was still really damn hard. Even in its final, watered-down form, the ACA led democrats into an electoral bloodbath in 2010. Turns out the American electorate is by almost every metric… fairly moderate.
		
		When confronted with constant own goals the voting public inflicts on themselves the OP chooses to believe it must be a shadowy conspiracy instead.

Like no, I’m center left, and I identify with some of the old personal freedom policies from old school republicans. But to look at today’s society, operation red map, the removal of blue slips, pushing judges through who even the BAR association judged as “not qualified”….

	This is the most asinine/surface level thinking on American politics which is par for the course for TikTok. Here is the Democratic 2020 Platform: https://democrats.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-Democratic-Party-Platform.pdf. Here is the Republican Party Platform for 2016 (They didn’t even put up a platform for 2020): https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/7019-republican-platform/cc2c15a0e1b432d6964b/optimized/full.pdf

	If you do even a cursory reading of these platforms, it’s night and day. The parties are not at all the same. If they were, we wouldn’t be hemming and hawing over the U.S. Supreme Court having a Republican majority. If we are, then clearly justices appointed by Republican presidents have differing philosophies/worldviews than that of justices appointed by Democratic presidents. In addition, Dems didn’t seem to intentionally lose in taking back the House in 2018, taking back the White House and both house of Congress in 2021, and having the best midterm performance of an incumbent party since a century. Clearly, Dems know what they’re doing. In fact, Biden has been able to pass the most progressive legislation with the Build Back Better agenda. 

	As for polling, I would advise people to realize that people can have differing responses depending upon how questions are worded. Opinion is positive on “universal healthcare.” However, when you define what “universal healthcare” means in practice, positive opinion significantly decreases.

	As for citing Noam Chomsky as a moral authority, you should look at his record of denying the Bosnian genocide and Cambodian genocide.

	All in all, this is at best, a misinformed video and at worst a video that inspires apathy and disengagement. Please get truly educated on the differences and vote accordingly.
