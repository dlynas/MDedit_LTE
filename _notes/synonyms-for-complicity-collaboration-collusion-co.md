	"You see, a lot of folks believe that if they can't change the whole world by themselves,
	no sense in them doing anything.
	Absolutely wrong.
	As in why vote?
	Because everybody's, you know, each one's worse than the other.
	Well, it means I recommend that people vote so that they be eligible for jury duty, because
	I need some friendly folks up there in the box if they grab me.
	I'm saying that like, if you're in a struggle to correct some wrongs, then whatever you
	can possibly do, vote, demonstrate, teach, protest, organize, activate, whatever you
	can do because you're in a struggle.
	If you're a soldier, they don't just say, well, you know, here's a gun and use this gun
	and no matter what happens, don't use this other one or don't use this stick or this
	ball.
	You use whatever you can because you're in a war.
	You're in a struggle to survive in general.
	And so you use whatever you can get your hands on.
	And right now I feel the thing that I'm most qualified to do is in the field in which I drew
	my education and that's an acting center's poetry and art.
	And so I try to use that to help folks."

	"You tell the story about how you try to find out what they call the Mossad when they deal
	with publicly.
	I thought it was a reasonable question, but the trouble is you can't pick up the phone
	book.
	There's no language in Israel that you can look up CIA or in our case the Mossad.
	We thought we should ask what shall we call it in English?
	You can translate the Hebrew words, as I said, Mossad as Institute, but when they write
	a letter to their friends in the CIA or the British intelligence, what do they call themselves?
	It took a while.
	It was a matter of asking the Prime Minister spoke.
	The best you could do because, officially, the Mossad is under the Prime Minister's office.
	And I think he sort of wondered why he wanted to know and all that, so we explained.
	And he came up with the Israeli Secret Intelligence Service.
	I mean, if it were to have initials, it would be ISIS.
	Simple words like that.
	Interestingly enough, kind of a British model.
	The British don't really like the names, MI5 and MI6, for their foreign service."

	"Deb, what fucking history book are you reading in which you believe that people worked within the current fucking system to get fucking rights?
	Are you joking? That has never fucking happened.
	What the hell?
	Do you think Black people voted to get voting rights?
	Think!"
