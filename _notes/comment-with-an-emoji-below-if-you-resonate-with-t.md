## ðŸŒŸComment with an emoji below if you resonate with thisðŸŒŸ It's common for anxiously-attached individuals to be in a relationship with avoidantly-attached individuals (OR those with disorganized attachment) because their deepest fears are confirmed in each other. 

Pursuers deepest fear is that they are too much, aren't good enough and will be abandoned.

Distancers deepest fear is that they'll be overwhelmed, controlled or fail if they get too close to people. 

In such relationships, the Pursuer-Distancer Cycle is a common pattern in which many couples get stuck and can break many relationships. 

If you struggle with this, please know that you aren't alone, and with willingness and effort, it can be changed.

This post has just touched the surface: we started by looking at the cycle from the 'Distancer/Avoidant' partner's perspective. Stick around, as I'll be sharing more on this cycle!

P.S. I teach this in-depth in the 'Secure Love Program.' I share what you and your partner can do, including scripts!Â 

Intrigued? And want to heal anxious attachment and become secure in yourself and your relationship? 

Then the â€˜Secure Love Programâ€™ is for you!

â€¢ Lessons, practical guidance + Homework

â€¢ Personalized support from me.

NOTES:
* Distancing/withdrawing: This doesn't apply to healthy breaks. In some situations, taking a break and moving away from heated conversations are actually GOOD for the relationship.â€¨
* This doesn't apply to abusive or manipulative habits (e.g. when someone intentionally gives silent treatment or unreasonably ghosts as a way to punish their partner because they want to remain in control).â€¨
