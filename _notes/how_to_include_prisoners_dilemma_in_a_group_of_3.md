## How to include Prisoners Dilemma in a group of 3+ players?

> Just wondering here. Prisoners dilemma works well with 2 players. How do you do it with 3+? A boardgame with that as a main mechanism would be ideal, but any text/blog would work or your own text. Just can't wrap my head around this.

	So first I would say a game, which has as a mechanic ONLY the prisoner dilemma, will become quite boring quite soon.

	However, the prisoner dilemma is JUST ONE example of Game Theory examples, and there exist A LOOOOT of them. And you can make new up easily also for 3+ players.

	When you search for "Game Theory 3 player examples" you can find a lot of things, including this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7Dg5FRH0cc

	And if you are interested in this, I would suggest you to read about Game Theory: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory

	**So How can this be done?**

	- First each player gets cards for their decisions, and all reveal their decisions at the same time.

	- Different players could even have different roles in the problems, so the problems could be asymetric.

	- It could also just involve a series of 2 player dilemmas. Like every round 2 other player play a prisoner dilemma.

	- It would be important that these games are played over several rounds, such that trust is important

	- Also its important, that it is not completely clear, when exactly the last round is, since in the last round in the prisoner dilemma its always better to betray.

	And if it is rough for you to think about 3+ player dilemmas here some examples:

	- The climate dilemma: Each player can choose to "care for climate" or "just produce cheap". Every player gets 1 money, for each player who does "care for the climate", and every player who decided "to produce cheap" gets 3 additional money

	- The (made up now by me) kings follower dilemma: 1 Person is king, every person can choose to follow the king or not. If more than 50% of the player follow the king: All players following the king get 1 money, the king gets 1 money per player in total. All players not following the king get -2 money. If less than 50% of the players follow the king, all the players not following the king split "the pot" of 2 points per person (king included) among themselves, the rest get nothing.

	- X person prisoner dilemma: People can choose to betray or not to betray. If no one betrays everyone gets 2 points. If 1 person betrays, that person gets 3 points everyone else -1 points. If more than 1 person betrays everyone gets -2 points.

	- The losing bid: Every player bids (in secret) an amount of money. The players who bid most get 10 coins each. The player who bid most and the player who bid second most, must pay the amount they did bid.

	- The "I just made some random crap up" When there are X players, the players can secretly select a number between 0 and X. Each player who choose their number alone (no one else choose the same number) get the amount of money equal to their number.

	etc.

		Yeah, I was heavily involved in the development part of a game called Fruit Bandits which was deliberately designed as a multiplayer game theory exercise.  The odd thing about it, and I suspect this may hold for similar games, is that it appealed to families, who generally didn't care about the analysis, and high level poker players, who did. But it generally failed miserably with gamers who quickly understood that it would need analysis to play well but were also smart enough to know that that probably wasn't going to be "fun", which meant that it devolved into randomness too easily.

		* 🟧 **[TigrisCallidus](https://www.reddit.com/user/TigrisCallidus)** ⬆️ 2 _(2022-06-19 20:28:34)_

			Oh I just looked at fruit bandid, this is quite a bit different how I imagined it, its interesting in that it has pretty much every game every turn a different dilemma, but, it also has just a lot to analyse!
			
			
			
			Every player has n choices (when there are n players),  so for 3 player this means there are 27 different cases. for 3 player there are 256 different cases and for 5 player there are 3125 different cases!
			
			This is just really a lot!
			
			
			Also I think this game feels a lot less like betraying, which makes it a bit different from the mind set, since its more about guessing what players do and less about knowing if someone is trustworthy.
			
			
			If player have less choices (normally betray or not betray) then it becomes easier to analyse and when its just about deciding if people are trustworthy it may also feel less random since it is about trust.
			
			
			Also the graphic just look like "simple family game", so I can see why you got that reactions.
			
			
			
			I think it is a really interesting design (and conveys game theory quite nicely!), and its also good to have such data from such a game.
			
			
			I am not sure if it would be different, but I would try to really narrow it down to "can I trust that/these peops" and "Is it worth betraying them and losing their trust?" This is a lot easier to grasp.
			
			
			Also about "it just deluded into randomness", wouldn't the nash equilibrum in a lot of these situations also be random to some degree?
			
			
			I mean like the best strategy would be 30% go to A, 40% go to B etc.  At least this is what I would expect. 
			
			
			
			Poker players might have analyzed the best strategy (which might be random) less and instead might have just tried to guess their opponents (like in poker)

				Yes, I think that's partly what I meant but didn't make clear - high-level poker is more about playing the other players; the 'game' is merely the opportunity to create a randomised scenario with wide-but-limited options so that the analysis becomes "what would (other player X) do in this circumstance and what should I do in response?" rather than "what's the optimal play in this circumstance?" which is what regular gamers tend to incline towards thinking Fruit Bandits is about, and that's where the collapse into hell happens!
				
				One intent of the game was to have an even more controlled scenario (in that the permutations diminish over the course of the game whilst an understanding of the other players increases) and it does achieve that, but it really suffers from one of the other lessons I have learned over time, which is that a first game experience really needs to be positive or people will be unwilling to revisit it, and this game is more likely than not to produce a negative experience!
				
				And for me, that's the main risk of a Prisoner's Dilemma design - that it's quite hard to create one that has a positive feedback loop simply by its very nature...

				* 🟪 **[TigrisCallidus](https://www.reddit.com/user/TigrisCallidus)** ⬆️ 2 _(2022-06-20 10:29:23)_

					I agree about the positive first game experience. Thats also why I am surprised that Haven and Ale was still quite successfull as a game  since it is really really brutal to people playing it the first time.  Scores of 0 points can happen often with new players... 
					
					
					One way which could help to make the play experience more positive, would be to let cooperation feel like a reward, instead the lack of it (or betrayal) as a punishment.
					
					
					So what I mean is that you  could for example change the standard prisoner dilemma to the following:
					
					
					Both players work in the fields. If both players help each other, they get 4 points each. If one player helps and the other not, the helping player gets 2 points and the other 5, if no player helps they both get the standard 2. 
					
					
					This way you always get something, you just get rewarded when the players do cooperate. 
					
					It might still leave bad feelings, dependonh on the precise implementation  but it could be worth a try.

* 🟩 **[CorvaNocta](https://www.reddit.com/user/CorvaNocta)** ⬆️ 1 _(2022-06-19 11:17:08)_

	Couple different thing you could do:

	The player that defects is out if both players cooperate. Then play again with just the two.

	PD is best with some kind of scoring system, so if you arbitrarily assign some points it makes it easier. 5 to each if they cooperate, 10 to defect/cooperate, 2 to defect/defect

	You can just spread that out over a bigger matrix.

	5/5, 0/10

	10/0, 2,2

	That's the standard PD, a 3 player one requires a 3 dimensional chart, which is still possible to make just a lot harder to visualize. It's just a question of how you want it to work. Like your example cooperate + cooperate + defect. I would say it's 5/5/0, since defecting when others are cooperating gets you ahead. But I can see a case for 5/5/10.

	I like to think about PD as a different game where instead of talking about crimes, it's about group of players around a table agreeing to not shoot one another. All players simultaneously reveal their action. Either do nothing, or shoot another player. Last man standing gets the prize. In a table of 3, each player cooperating would be then doing nothing. Players all gain equally. But one player shooting another player means the player that got shot loses, the player who did nothing gains and the player that defected gains.

	But it really depends on how the game is set up. PD is meant to be pretty arbitrary between 2 players, so getting more players means you likely have to look at a new Game Theory Game.

	HMS Dolores goes around the table in pairs, with each person pairing up with the prisoner to their left.

	Simple version for n players:  

	1)  Each player has n cards where n is the number of active players and personal stash.  

	2)  Each player places on coin from their stash into the pot.  

	3) On cue each player reveals one of their cards.  

	4)  If the revealed card is that of another player, the _target_ player is eliminated and the _target's_ stash is placed in the pot.   

	5) Outcomes:  

	A)  If no player targets another player, i.e. each plays the card representing themself, the pot is divided among surviving players.  

	B)  If all players are eliminated the pot is discarded.  

	6)  If neither A nor B, survivors discard cards representing eliminated opponents and go to step 1.

	Rounds continue until the all players are eliminated or the pot is divided.

		isn't in this case the problem that in turn 1, there is absolutely no reason not to target anyone.
		
		And when everyone targets someone it is a bit random who survived (if any).
		
		I guess the rounds following the first are more interesting especially if this game is repeated often.
		
		
		I still see the problem that if one player does not like me, I will never get any points. It 100% take that.

			No set of rules can control meta-play.  I've offered several variations with different payoffs and strategies.

		I'm paraphrasing here, but I think Einstein said it that if you can explain a very complicated formula in a very easy way, you fully understand it. I think you fully understand this concept because this made soooooo much sense to me! Thank you so much!

			You know he just brought one example of a possible game, there are 100s other ways to do this.
			
			Also this scenario has the problem of being take that/king maker.
			
			
			You could easily do it without player elimination, just having different rounds, where a random subset of players (so you choose 2-X-1 players each round (alwayys at least 2 players and at least 1 player is not playing)) in a way that each player is chosen the same amount of times.
			
			Each player currently playing choosing "betray" or "not betray" and then the same happens as in normal prisoner dilemma.
			
			
			No one betrays 1 coin each.
			
			
			1 person betrays: That player gains 2 coins
			
			
			2+ people betrayy: No one gets coins.

			Change the cost &amp; the risk.   
			
			I)  Remove the ante.  If you are targeted you lose 1/3 of your original stake. You are eliminated when your stake is gone.   
			
			II)  Remove the ante and the stake.  Each round the bank adds an amount equal to the number of players eliminated/remaining to the pot.
			
			III)  Begin with a pot of n coins.  When a player is eliminated remove a coin from the pot.   
			
			IV)  Begin with a pot of n  coins.  Each turn add the number of remaining players to the pot.
			
			V)  Begin with a pot of n coins.  Each turn add the number of eliminated players to the pot.
			
			Each of these has different payoff and changes game play.

				And none of them change the fact that it is still purely take that.
				
				Also I don't think that these variants will help much, since you dont care about your total gain, but your gain vs the other players, and letting others live changes your chance of survival a lot.
				
				Have you calculated for any of them the nash equilibrium?

				* 🟪 **[EmirFassad](https://www.reddit.com/user/EmirFassad)** ⬆️ 1 _(2022-06-20 16:56:56)_

					I haven't calculated the equilibria.  You are welcome to do so yourself.  Create a matrix of T turns (for T some small number).
					
					Randomly targeting opponents on the first turn will have a low return.  Optimally your target each turn should be a player whom you consider unreliable.  After all if all players are eliminated everyone's return is zero.  
					
					Maximum gain arises from creating an implicit alliance that divides the pot.  Unreliable players should be eliminated early to maximize the pot and reduce risk.  Greedy players are by their nature unreliable.  The only question becomes "when do I cooperate?"

					* 🟥 **[TigrisCallidus](https://www.reddit.com/user/TigrisCallidus)** ⬆️ 1 _(2022-06-20 17:29:16)_

						I would guess that the ideal strategy is target enemies randomly acording to their points. The more points they have the higher your want to eliminate them.
						
						Your gains do not matter if others get the same gains, you just want to make sure the distance is as big as possible. 
						
						So alliances cant be there for long since else the other player gets also a lot of points.

						* 🟫 **[EmirFassad](https://www.reddit.com/user/EmirFassad)** ⬆️ 1 _(2022-06-20 18:20:18)_

							You seem to think the best strategy is winner take all.  If you follow a non-cooperative strategy you will be eliminated the turn after you betray your alliance.

	I would suggest watching Running Man, a Korean TV show. 

	The games they come up with on the show are always very "Prisoner's Dilemma" oriented.
