Video transcript:
	So when does aid stop immediately?
	State Department says that aid should stop immediately if there's a problem does it?
	It totally depends on the circumstances in situated. Does it depend on the country that's getting the aid?
	It also depends on the country get receiving the aid. Yes. So what country does aid not stop immediately under Leahy?
	I'd have to go back and look at my notes. You don't know what country that is. It's only one in the entire world.
	Yes, what?
	Except
	for
	Israel. So look Congress has been told time and time and time again that the Leahy laws apply to everyone to every country and on paper
	They do but when we pull back the curtain when we do some oversight
	Not all countries are being treated equally when the Leahy law is being implemented
	Especially our ally Israel
	Look if Israel wants to be treated equally which I'm for

Video transcript:
	The people of Gaza, for example those young men who burst through the gate on October 7th,
	they were born in a concentration camp.
	It's a life with no past, no past, no present, and no future.
	People always say, why don't the Palestinians, why don't they have a Gandhi, why don't they try non-violence?
	Well guess what? They tried non-violence, they tried it.
	214 people in Gaza, including 46 children were killed during the great march of return.
	A large scale, peaceful protests along the separation fence between Gaza and Israel.

Video transcript:
Now wonder this country wants the Bantik talk.
I just witnessed a video where human beings were unalived by helicopters
for merely walking. This is no war. I don't want to hear about the moss.
Your October 7 bullshit. Anymore. This country isn't complicit in genocide.
It's orchestrating it. This is white colonialism. Israel is no ally of ours.
The IDF in blackface. Mocking people. This is acceptable to the United States
government that's bought by APEC. Our Congress has been hijacked.
And how be fitting that people don't believe that we are in decline,
nor that this could happen to us. Get a grip. This is the slave master now enslaved by Israel.

Video transcript:
	October the 7th, triggering this final phase, has completely exposed Israel.
	It's shown that Israel is deranged. It's not normal. This is a human being. There would be in a
	hospital. It's a deranged operation that is taking place. People are deranged. Those young people
	who are doing this killing, it's beyond imagination. You can understand Palestinian, the
	resistance of the indigenous people. But this is something horrifying. But it is the inevitable
	final phase of the settler colonial project. But it has a kind of because of the scale of it,
	because of bombing. This harbours I do in my piece, I share the horrifying nature of the actual
	bombing. We are revolted by the fact that they had no defense. They call it a war. How could
	it be a war when there's no defense?

Video transcript:
	We created ISIS.
	I mean ISIS is no less than the people up in Islamburg,
	no less than Gulen, is a CIA creation.
	John McCain for heaven's sake was over there with the ISIS officials.
	We created them. They came from the al-Nursi group,
	the Syrian liberation front.
	These two organizations combined and they morphed into ISIS.
	It's our creation. We create them. We still direct them.
	When ISIS warriors are injured in battle, where are they transporting?
	They're transported from heaven's sake to Israel.
	They're treated by the Israelis and Israeli hospitals and brought back to battle.
