I thank The Intercept for corroborating what

Hey Max, have you watched any of the the videos Hamas made on Oct. 7th? They giddily filmed themselves shooting pets, beheading one worker with a garden hoe, and killing civilians. There’s even video from inside Gaza of one kidnapped girl bleeding from her crotch.

LOLOLOL. Four fringe conspiracy theory websites are refuted by

Why aren't you reporting on Swiss media? Or can't you lift the curtains on them? Rhetorical question.

This must be the only war where rape isn't used..

I watched Mac from Breaking Points quote The Intercept alone for this. Infuriating. He should know better. He has been great on Palestine.
