Very few Americans, then, have a real say in who represents them in the House. Once elected, politicians tend to be more concerned about losing their next primary than losing their next general election. As a result, they legislate according to the wishes of the small sliver of the electorate that put them in office rather than the much broader pool of constituents who make up their district. This reduces the motivation to compromise and deepens polarization.

	Multi member districts are only evil if they use winner takes all.  Combined with ranked voting.

	Around 10 states still use MMDs at least in part for state and local elections.  Some still use them with winner takes all.

	Israel example can be refuted.  Many countries use pr, not all are like that.  Avoid a national list system and have a 5% threshold if it is used.  If Israel had a 5% threshold only 6 parties met that threshold in the 2022 election.

	A list system is ill advised for the usa as it just enables swamp creatures to embed themselves even further.  It strengthens party control.  so rich donors control party leaders and they in turn control the rest of the party members.  open lists would not remain open for long.  this reform would soon get co-opted to an extent.

	MMDs with ranked voting is needed.  incentives need to be changed so lawmakers break with the party more and voters can reinforce that by ranking them higher or at all.  that creates a partial counterbalance to rich donors. it offers lawmakers a path if they don't to be a corporate tool.  it encourages cross party co-operation instead of kneejerk opposition to anything the other party supports.  that can tamp down polarization.
