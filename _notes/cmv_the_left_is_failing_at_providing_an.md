## cmv: the left is failing at providing an alternative to outrage culture from the right

	There are MANY many people online on the left talking about this issue and giving advice to young men.

	The issue though, is that there is no simple, clean, singular solution to all young men.  The truth is more challenging.  A lot of the young men are lonely and looking for relationships, but for many of them they simply aren't *ready* for a relationship.  The best advice you can give them is to practice socializing, to make friends, to get therapy and work on self improvement.   Doing these things will lead to romantic relationships, but they want the most direct path... which for the most case, doesn't exist.

	But when the right promises them a direct path, they want to take that because they are lonely *now*.  The left can't really promise them that direct path, because it's not real.  There isn't going to be an answer they are going to like that'll work.

		The other issue is that the real solution to help the male loneliness issue is for men to NOT rely on women to fix their loneliness but fix issues in their own community to foster healthy interpersonal relationships with other men. Men need to learn how to seek validating relationships outside of romantic relationships. And they also need to work on keeping toxic mindsets OUT of their community building. 
		
		The reason why guys like Andrew Tate get followings is because men (like all humans) crave community, but don‚Äôt have meaningful community that isn‚Äôt based on toxic masculine values. And when men like Tate are the ONLY ones creating any kind of community, that‚Äôs what young men will flock to. 
		
		Look at the way other groups create community and foster validating relationships. Even in online spaces. Queer spaces, women‚Äôs spaces, black spaces, etc. and you don‚Äôt have to start that broadly. You can create community with men in your area by focusing on a few things like the way a lot of QTPOC create niche communities. 
		
		For example, there‚Äôs a broad online knitting community. Then there‚Äôs small pockets of Asian creators, black creators, queer spaces, etc. I didn‚Äôt grow up in a city with any sort of strong Asian presence and the online knitting community, especially the small pockets of Asian creators, has been really nice and validating because we can share our hobbies and shared cultural experiences and different cultural experiences. 
		
		That‚Äôs the real work that needs to be done. Men who see the problem, want to change the problem, need to step up and do the work of wanting to fix that problem.

		!delta. I'll concede this has gotten more attention but with the caveat that it has still failed to provide outlets and examples of what a "good man" looks like, values, strives for. 
		
		It still feels like the left merely knows what a "bad man" looks like without constructing a path towards "good masculinity".

			Because authorities telling you how you should live your life is antithetical to leftism. Leftists might say "here are some aspects of masculinity that are harmful" and they might personally express their own masculinity in non-harmful ways, but advocating for a single authoritative model of "good masculinity" is just an inherently conformist, right-wing idea.

					Education helps. E.g. the Jordan Peterson or Sam Harris gateway to the alt-right is a lot less compelling to people who have a basic education in philosophy. We can also advocate for technological solutions that fix the algorithmic bias that's driving these men to radicalization on social media.

						Well Holy fucking damn man.... I remember watching so much of his shit like 10 years ago, along with people like Steven Pinker and Richard Dawkins and, solidifying my Atheism... then I stopped watching them, because they'd just repeat their Atheist beliefs and I'd heard it all by that point.... they all seem to have wandered into the exact same deep end. While I started watching them as a lonely (very lonely) person, at the time, if they even suggested negative things like pushing back against women's rape claims, or railed against "wokism" I would have stopped listening to them, because I was in my mid-20s and had a good feeling for my beliefs and values of Equality... I can't say how I would have handled this them if I was exposed to them as a teen, but I like to think my parents did a good enough job instilling caring values in me that I would not have been tempted to the dark side.

								The others in that whole circle, including Lawence Krauss are tied in with nasty remarks on Equality, how being 'Woke' is ruining america and thinking Jeffery Epstien is great because he gave them money. (Definitely only money, right?)

							Woke people don't value equality at all, they value equity. Equality is about rules and procedures not outcomes.
							
							Liberal Enlightenment equality is a metric of when you deal with an institution are you treated as an individual and are you treated without regard to your immutable characteristics. If you go any further than that you are looking for equity not equality.

						Not to mention if you fully understand their ideas, the alt-right is not even where you'd end up as it's antithetical to the core ideas they teach. A few years back my first entrance to philosophy and politics was through Jordan Peterson, and when my interactions in politics got to the alt-right, I couldn't stand them. To view an entire race or group of people as a single tribe and then blame them for your issues that you face in life is like what you'd discover after watching like 2 Jordan Peterson videos yet somehow the idiots listen to every few words and nod along and then get deranged into the alt-right. I guess if listening skills were their strong suit they wouldn't be there in the first place.

							I disagree that the alt-right is anti-thetical to Jordan Peterson's teaching.  He is surface level against the alt-right, but fundamentally, a lot of what he argues, the logical conclusion is the alt-right.  Peterson is big on arguing in favour of social hierarchies, meritocracy, gender norms, and occasionally touches upon race realism.

								I guess it depends on our definition of "alt-right." I mean to say the ones that are adamantly Nazis, like the ones who openly wish for genocide and oppression on scales never before seen. They hate Jordan Peterson, they certainly are not fans of his. 
								
								Now if we are talking about a lighter alt-right that is still oppressive and racist I can see how one could make that journey from Peterson. But to me, his emphasis on individuality and the freedom of a single person amongst a collective taught me that there is no claim you could make about an entire race of people that would make me value that individual any less. That was my key take away, and it's sad that others could not see that.

									Except Jordan Peterson's emphasis on individuality isn't universal.  He uses individuality to counter narratives he doesn't like, but will then use hierarchies to determine a person's rightful place.  Where is Eliot Page's individual right to post a happy photo of himself?  Peterson seems to believe the fact he is trans with top surgery means it is intrinsically bad for him to post such a photo.
									
									Where is individualism when it comes to attraction?  Peterson railed against a larger woman being put on the cover of Sports Illustrated.  If individualism was key and we cannot judge a person outside of that, then the notion there exist indivudals who find that person attractive, that Sports Illustrated has a right to use the indivudal on their cover, that that person is allowed to express their own sexuality, wouldn't be questioned.
									
									Peterson will also talk about how people below a certain IQ are basically useless to society and there is "no good answer for this".  He also will advocate for traditional gender roles, rather than individualism in that regard.  
									
									When you only use individualism to contradict notions of systemic issues, it doesn't really take many steps to go from that to an alt-right belief system.

I think it‚Äôs clear from the spirit of their post and comments that they would be satisfied with, for instance, a greater abundance of and attention toward examples of what a ‚Äúgood man‚Äù can look like from a progressive, left-leaning perspective. I largely agree with OP that the left seems to be lacking in this department, preferring instead to focus on harmful and negative expressions of masculinity.

There‚Äôs no consistent or correct way to be a ‚Äúgood man‚Äù.

				But the reality is that many males respond to clear models and some sort of authority and leadership.  You might consider this a bad thing, and more "toxic masculinity", but it's just a thing that's a reality-- so there's a chasm between the "left's" reluctance to provide male models that apply to many for being "cis-normative", and the alt-right's eagerness to capitalize on that void.
				
				Something is not being met.  An authoritarian one-size-fits-all solution is of course harmful, but it might be argued that few clear models of healthy/positive masculinity (many of them being disparaged as being "trad") are being consistently elevated as much or more than the ways men being "bad" are enforced, and that isn't very helpful either.
				
				Also I dispute that authorities telling you how to live life is antithetical to leftism.  Some of the strongest leftist movements at scale inevitably incorporate authoritarianism, very high levels of conformity, and clear rules of conduct and how and what to think and say (as does the right of course), or it turns into a no-true-Scottsman situation where any authoritarian-left example is dismissed as "not really left".
				
				What you describe sounds more Libertarian, which also gets understandably mocked for being unworkable, because there's no way to live your life in a way that doesn't affect others, and any sort of community requires expectations and how to live your life on \*some\* parameters, maybe just not the ones that bother one political side vs another.

					I think that's only partially true, because in my experience the people that are most vocal about craving clear models, authority and/or leadership are primarily looking for a guy whose performance of masculinity aligns with their preconceived notions, but also he has status and power enough to validate these notions. 
					
					Like, guys that complain there are no good male role models aren't blank slates looking for just any positive representation of masculinity. They want muscly dude with 15 cars and expensive watches to go an tell them exactly what they want to hear.

						Partly agree in some respects, partly disagree.  While some are just looking for confirmation of the type of "dude" they think epitomizes "masculinity", I think there is also less cultural, public emphasis on "positive masculinity", where even healthy models aren't as easily encountered apart from really brief and fleeting instances.
						
						That's kind of the problem.  When consistent examples aren't brought to young boys'/men's minds in their engagement with the world and consumption of media, and when they lack fathers or their fathers aren't good models themselves, they will not have "positive masculinity" impressed upon them, but will be left to form their own idea of what such a thing looks like.  Or be more vulnerable to the blowhards, narcissists, and egotists who have no qualms about pulling eyes and creating a following.
						
						Teaching youth and parenting is so much about getting there before the wrong thing does, and being present to correct things if they do.  The left usually understands this dynamic pretty well regarding almost every other issue important to the left, as activists make themselves present in early ears even in toddler and baby books.  It's odd there's such a gap when it comes to healthy male models (I know the left treats gender roles and tendencies like its radioactive unless it's a non-cis arrangement, so that partly accounts for things).
						
						When what we end up with is 13 year old boys picking a role model based on what their idea of a "man" is and following that bro-dude, that actually highlights the problem to a tee.  How did we as a society end up there?

							I want to be clear that this isn't necessarily anyone's fault, mind you. That's the way boys are socialized and I can't really blame them for that. What I mostly want to argue is that our issue here isn't really "lack of role models". 
							
							The fact that people are looking for "positive masculinity" tells me they already have a pretty clear picture of what masculinity ought to be and are now looking for people that perform their ideal successfully - meaning they embody them and derive success from them. It's very likely these ideals are some variation on hegemonic masculinity. As I said, they are not blank slate in search of some value-neutral positive presence. Like, I have a very hard time believing any significant of people have grown up beyond the age of 10 without ever encountering a decent human being. Rather, they are looking for men to be performing some degree of hegemonic masculinity to satisfaction, but in a "healthy" kind of way. 
							
							The problem with that, I believe, is twofold. First, hegemonic masculinity is often not "healthy" or "positive" in the ways I assume you are talking about. At the very least, I think it emphasizes the very thing that are leading some men to suffer. Even in cases when it's not outright toxic, it still carries a lot of the elements that lead some men to feel lonely, useless and unworthy of support. Is it surprising that emphasis on stoicism means men have a hard time dealing with emotions? Is it surprising that devaluing things like clothes and aesthetics leave men ill-equipped in the dating market? Even in the cases where it manages to be somewhat healthy, it's obviously not going to accommodate everyone. Hegemonic masculinity tends to emphasis heterosexuality and able-bodiedness, for instance.
							
							Second, people that occupy the specific space between performing hegemonic masculinity *enough* to be perceived and accepted as a role model, but not so much as to experience negative consequences, are going to be few. I think it's just a math thing. So, at least from where I'm standing, there being an hegemonic masculinity is the problem here. The best way for men to live healthier lives is to get rid of that. I don't think you'll get rid of it with "role models" really. 
							
							> When what we end up with is 13 year old boys picking a role model based on what their idea of a "man" is and following that bro-dude, that actually highlights the problem to a tee. How did we as a society end up there?
							
							We didn't really "end up here". We've been here for decades. Being a dude-bro just used to work. 
							
							What we did is drill it into people's head for generations that there's a very narrow definition of man and women, then heavily policed the performance of these genders. This created very clear modes of beings and sets of expectations. Few people actually achieved such outcomes, but there was definitely a blueprint (and you'll get screwed if you don't at least pretend to follow it). When women liberation started it broke down many barriers and pushed the boundaries of what "being a woman" could mean. This is sort of happening for men, but there's one crucial difference: While breaking the traditional mould of femininity is a promise of emancipation, that not how it appears to men. 
							
							Therein lies the tension you are seeing today and I guess that's where I'd go full circle and point out that men and boys do have *some* agency in that process.
							
							Furthermore, and that's my own pet theory, it's undeniable that emancipation is a powerful cultural narrative, but women emancipation is also not revolutionary enough to actually threaten today's established order. Women started to gain the same rights as men, but that doesn't really undermine the foundation of capitalism either. It just gained more workers to exploit, really.

						That's not necessarily true. Even among guys who want better role models to define masculinity, the idea of what makes someone a good role model of that varies. Of course, you have people who idolize those with money and muscles, but you also have people who idolize guys who can live independently or low-tech. You have guys who idolize family members as examples of masculinity (fathers, uncles, grandfathers, etc). There's similarities in the overall idea of masculinity, but they still differ from person to person. In my experience, those guys who do idolize people like Tate do so because they see them controversial, and people like Tate know how to play on that as proof their way is better. They feed off ideas like "strong men create good times" as a way to prove their legitimacy. 
						
						To many lonely and frustrated men, it's almost like a revolt in a way. They see their idea of masculinity as under attack, whatever that might be, and follow people who feed on those feelings. Those people then influence their ideas of masculinity to the image they created for personal profit/clout. Some followers might even be aware of what their "role models" are doing, but they don't see any better alternative due to their own personal experiences, not to mention the wider view of masculinity in progressive spaces. It's not always just a bunch of turbovirgins looking for money and sex (that may have a soft findom fetish considering how much money they throw at these people). If anything, it's embittered, socially awkward guys who either haven't had access to any positive male role models or who think that those positive role models are weak/fake, etc.

				I think this hints at the problem OP has identified though. The problem with leftism's approach to masculinity and gender dynamics is that a significant subset of the movement seeks to downplay the existence of gender dynamics in the first place. This results in what OP mentions as an inability to construct a path toward 'good masculinity'. 
				
				Much of modern leftist idealism is couched in 'postmodern' (and I use that word loosely because there's a significant amount of baggage attached to it - it should be considered a non-authoritative umbrella term to contextualize the sort of comparisons I'll make) ideas like Queer Theory. These advocate for deconstructing paradigms and metanarratives without necessarily replacing them with anything beyond, say, intersectionalism. 
				
				What this does, then, is wind up giving men platitudes like 'improve yourself' and 'don't be an asshole'. At best, the advice is frustratingly broad, and at worst it's downright condescending. 
				
				The result of all this is that leftist dating advice ignores the fact that different genders find different things attractive (on a bell curve, not universally). For instance, I write romantic fiction for females. It is one of the largest markets for fiction in general and though there are many subgenres, the tropes of the bestselling books are often iterations of 50 Shades of Grey or any run-of-the-mill dark mafia story. Rich, powerful, and often dangerous masculine protagonists with a soft spot are the bread and butter of the genre. 
				
				That is to say that, with regard to advice for young men, prescriptive platitudes that go beyond 'be positive and improve yourself' are likelier to give them more success in the dating pool. Telling a man specifically to lift weights, improve their fashion sense, and amass social status is going to net them more success with most women than any of the general things that leftists in the dating space offer because those leftists often refuse to acknowledge that a large subset of women actually like specific things.

			There are many great paths to being a good man.  Being considerate of others, self reflective, looking towards self improvement.  If you mean something specific of what it means to be "masculine", then that's a pretty open question, there are many ways you can be a "real man", and that's something for you to explore for yourself.  Any prescription is going to inevitably lead to bad results.
			
			But if you *want* something more traditonally masculine, you can abslutely pursue that if it is what is right for you.  Look at Nick Offerman, as a great example.  He's a pretty traditionally masculine guy.  Big burly dude who likes to cut down trees and build things with his own hands.  The difference here is that Offerman doesn't prescribe this as the real way to be a man, he doesn't look down upon others who choose to explore their masculinity differently, it just so happens that that's the right way *for him*.   Totaly non-toxic way of exploring traditional masculininty.

			I think American culture is a culture of weaponized victimhood. From the "as a black woman" to the " Jews will not replace us" it is all about seeking to be the victim, and seeing others as a threat.
			
			This has led to a polarised society, where one cannot acknowledge the suffering one self is not subjected to, because this would undermine one's own position on the "suffering scale".
			
			The people who talk to young men, like Peterson, do so in the context of a hostile environment. Both in terms of the hardship young men face, and in the context of how feminism is perceived.
			
			I grew up in a post-feminist environment in Norway (meaning the feminist won and shut up) and I can't really relate to most of the stuff Peterson is saying. For me, getting an education and being at work on time was all that was expected.
			
			In Norway, a "good man" is much the same as a "good woman". They are able, can provide, have enough strength to focus on you, and help you through emotional trauma when you need, and are self-aware enough to not make a meal out of small conflicts. They are rare, but they are aspired to and respected.
			
			Of course it is the extremes, about fighting, or extreme sports, but both sexes do that.
			
			The only specific traits to the sex, are the dysfunctional ones, like men demanding respect, and women talking bad about others.

				Great, and I think that the definition also applies in the US. It's just that being able to provide in the US is a far higher bar than it is in Norway. The lack of a good social security network means that a person might fail to provide in ways that just cannot happen in Norway (*what do you mean you "can't afford chemo"?*). 
				
				Men in the US hear the stories about their grandparents and parents being able to provide, see their own failure, and see that something's changed. But instead of pointing to the failing purchasing power of wages and the ever increasing costs of housing and healthcare, the Alt Right will tell them "It's socialism/radical feminism", and provide an easy target for rage.

			> I'll concede this has gotten more attention but with the caveat that it has still failed to provide outlets and examples of what a "good man" looks like, values, strives for.
			
			I am curious about something with this.
			
			The political right, at least in the US, often touts themselves as being the party of freedom, liberty, personal responsibility, self sufficiency, etc.
			
			It seems to me that people looking to embody those traits shouldn't be looking to others for an example of what a "good man" looks like. If anything, those are exactly the traits in which one might expect there to be a clear definition of what makes someone a "bad man" while leaving the path to being a "good man" more open ended. In other words: Letting people live their lives as long as they don't cross a few clearly define lines of what is  clearly wrong or bad.
			
			By all accounts, shouldn't people looking to embody those traits be flocking to the political side that doesn't tell people how to live their life, rather just tells them a few basics of how not to be a shitty person?
			
			That's clearly not happening though. Which, at this point, leads me to believe that it's not an issue of the left failing to provide something. Rather that the people who buy into this outrage culture aren't looking for what they say they are looking for and the people selling it to them aren't selling what they say they are selling. It's bullshit all the way down the line and people are just looking for reasons to be angry because being self-righteous feels good.

Things like courage we might associate with men, but it isn't like it's not also important for women to have courage. I think the need to have a concept of "positive masculinity" is misplaced. 
			
			The conversation we should be having with young men imo isn't about what it looks like to be a good man, it's what it looks like to be a good person in general. If the question is what does the left have to offer young men, I would say that patriarchy is actually detrimental to them, and dismantling it is better for everyone, not just women or gender non conforming people.

				Then the same should apply for toxicness, right? If you don't see why we need positive masculinity because it should just be being a good person, then why highlight toxic masculinity, when it should just be general negative traits. Women exhibit plenty of these traits, but they are overlooked because they are women. Why can only masculinity, and by extension men, be labeled as toxic, but positivity is a general term? Either there's toxic masculinity and toxic femininity and positive traits of each, OR there's general positivity and general toxicness.

					Well, no. When people point out toxic masculinity, they are pointing out negative traits that men often have due to societal power structures that grant us privilege. The people who point this out are arguing that this shouldn't be the case, so really they are making the same point. When you ask for positive masculinity, you are asking for a role to be created. When I ask for positive traits to not be gendered, I'm asking for a role to be removed, just like I'm asking for when I criticize toxic masculinity. People who point out toxic masculinity aren't advocating for it. There is a difference between questioning the use of the concept of gender and denying that human society has developed a concept of gender.

						"When you ask for positive masculinity, you are asking for a role to be created" NO, I'm saying that if there are toxic masculine traits, then there must be positive ones right? And if you're saying that those traits are just generally positive ones, then I'm saying the toxic traits should also be general and not focused on masculinity. Women can be just as bad. We are not different species. 
						
						Also, considering that there is no measurable privileged in the Western world anymore that men have that women don't (cept for physical attributes like strength, height, no periods, etc. Also, there's plenty of privileges that women have that men don't: no draft, actually higher pay when all other things are equal, almost always gets the kids in a divorce even when the father is a better parent, can hit men without repercussions, can ruin a man's life with one accusation, never have to wonder if their child is really theirs, softer jail sentences for the exact same crime, need I go on?), the privilege aspect you brought in has no bearing here.

							I think the biggest misunderstanding in your comment is the assumption that by criticizing toxic masculitnity, we are saying that it's ok for women to exercise the same traits, just not men. This simply isn't true. When women are pointlessly aggressive, it isn't due to societal pressure for women to be pointlessly aggressive. With men, the same is often untrue. Therefore, it is worth pointing out and criticizing this trend for the purpose of ending it. You can say over and over that women can do bad things and have bad traits too, and everyone already agrees with you. That doesn't mean toxic masculinity as a trend is not worth combating and pointing out. 
							
							>NO, I'm saying that if there are toxic masculine traits, then there must be positive ones right? 
							
							Sure absolutely, but like I said, there is no reason for positive traits to be particularly important for men to practice or to be associated with. There *is* a reason to point out how the concept of masculinity as developed by humanity is often toxic. There is nothing contradictory about saying positive traits shouldn't be gendered, and neither should negative traits even though they often are. 
							
							>Also, considering that there is no measurable privileged in the Western world anymore that men have that women don't (cept for physical attributes like strength, height, no periods, etc. 
							
							Sexual assault frequency, present stereotypes about women, the rise of figures like Andrew Tate, opposition to reproductive rights, increased incidence of toxic treatment, particularly online, and others.
							
							>Also, there's plenty of privileges that women have that men don't: no draft, actually higher pay when all other things are equal, almost always gets the kids in a divorce even when the father is a better parent, can hit men without repercussions, can ruin a man's life with one accusation, never have to wonder if their child is really theirs, softer jail sentences for the exact same crime, need I go on?), the privilege aspect you brought in has no bearing here.
							
							Feminists also tend to oppose the draft for men. I'll need more info about what you mean by higher pay. I assume you mean maternity leave? If so, feminists also tend to support paternity leave. Would love to see statistics that include "even when the father is a better parent." No they can't hit men without repercussions. The repercussions are often not as severe, but if you think there is an epidemic of people who think it's totally fine to beat up men, you are just wrong. Feminists agree that women shouldn't hit men either. The "ruin a man's life with one accusation" is a little ridiculous when you consider how difficult it is to prosecute sexual assault. Softer jail sentences I agree with you on, and would point out that it's usually men in positions if power who make that decision. Again, no one is arguing patriarchy doesn't have negative affects on men. It very much does, and feminists know and agree with this. The only mistake many men make in recognizing this is thinking feminists are their enemy on these issues. 
							
							>If there is toxic masculinity, then there is toxic femininity. 
							
							Let's take this to a different analogy to give you am idea of why this is not a good way of looking at things. Before I do, I'm guessing you consider yourself color blind on issues of race?
							
							>If positive traits are genderless then so are negative traits. Point blank. We're supposed to be equal here right?
							
							Positive traits *should be* genderless, and so *should* negative traits. When that isn't true, it's perfectly fine and reasonable to look into the issue and ask why that is, and how we can fix it. That's what analysis on toxic masculitnity is about.

			You can learn a lot of these things through platonic relationships and therapy, if need be.  By forming platonic relationships, with both men and women, and being comfortable in those, you will gain the skills you need for the most part, so long as you are able to make yourself emotionally vulnerable when need be.

		If we boil it all down to, "young men horny, young men don't get to demand sex" were still leaving young men in a lurch. 
		
		I really think we're actually suppressing young men's sexuality in unhealthy ways without providing an outlet. The right DOES provide outlets, they're just negative. The left could/should do a better job of channeling young male energy into positive things. It could be leadership WITH other genders, it could be martial/community defense/fighting bullies and bigots, it could be how to build things.. etc. 
		
		The left needs to build a framework for young men that says, "hey, you have wants/needs/hopes/fears and that's okay. Here are ways you can fit into our society and be celebrated. Here are the positive qualities we value and strive for."
		
		Right now it's just don't be a rapist. Don't be violent. Don't be a scrub.

			I think this framework needs to exist so that young men and boys have more to go on than "don't do this, don't be like your fathers".
			
			I don't think it needs to come from the left, if the left is gunshy about it for these models appearing "cis-normative" or distracting to their issues with the patriarchy, or with their advocacy that tends to frame issues relevant to the majority mainly from the paradigm of the minority or only who they consider the more oppressed.
			
			It can just come from moderates or better yet, those who don't think about themselves on a political spectrum anymore, but through wholistic philosophical values-- those who can hold onto those developed, healthy convictions strong enough to not have discussion about them hijacked by those who can only find fault with them as being too "trad" or too "woke" from either end of the spectrum.

					Okay, let‚Äôs give an example of a fantastic male role model.
					
					In Disney‚Äôs Strange World, the father of the main protagonist is:
					
					Someone who cares about his family and community
					
					Someone who actively points out the toxic masculinity of his own father who‚Äôs willing to put him and others in harm for the sake of his legacy 
					
					Cares about his son
					
					Willing to sacrifice his legacy to do the right thing.
					
					Etc.
					
					
					All are extremely positive aspects of masculinity. Self sacrificing, cares about his family, etc. What was the end result? Part of the ‚Äúwoke agenda‚Äù because a gay character. 
					
					So who‚Äôs the replacement role model the right provides? Tate (sex trafficking)? Peterson(drug abuse)? Walsh(allegedly a pedo and abuser)?

		I think specific to the vocal incel movement looking to assign blame, your statement is absolutely true.  But I have noted since at least 2008 that *the concept of men seeking relationships* itself has gotten much more fraught.  As a person who considers themself on the left and matching at least some definitions of "feminist," I have read countless times--and believe--that women in general in public don't want to be approached by men.  And that's fine!  Message received, loud and clear, men who are seeking relationships in spaces are generally decreasing the quality of womens' lives.  Of course I've been in an LTR for more than 20 years at this point, so it wasn't particularly meaningful for me in particular.
		
		Men, though, are still generally expected to be the one making advances as near as I can tell.  If a man isn't in a relationship, it can only be a "them" problem (as the narrative goes).  In fact, I've noticed that in general when a man fails to "find love," it's seen as only possibly being a failing of theirs--and almost always itself interpreted as reflecting a deficiency.  It's absolutely wrong for them to complain about women.  However, *in these same feminist spaces I'm in*, women routinely complain about men at large.  When a woman doesn't find love, there is wide latitude to say that it's because available men are deficient or what have you. In general, men are viewed as sympathetic/empathetic figures maybe 1/3rd as much, if that.
		
		So I do find that there is no room in feminist spaces to acknowledge that acceptable venues to seek relationships have shrunk significantly while men in particular do still seem to be the one who has the onus to find relationship opportunities.  It seems to be a sympathy/empathy problem--it almost feels like people believe that you can't acknowledge a difficulty a group tends to experience without blaming some other group or structure.

			Young guy here (gen z) and I'd say your analysis is pretty spot on. Before I talk about my own experience I just want to say I lean right and always have.
			
			Growing up the whole system of finding a relationship was turned on its head. And pretty much every guy Ive talked to the conversation has always ended up at a similar point: "how/where am I supposed to even approach a woman?" 
			
			Through pretty much our entire childhood we've been told not to approach women. It's always a situation where we've been told the woman is not looking to be approached, whether at a club/bar, the grocery store, school, etc. To the point where no one really knows where an appropriate time/location is. 
			
			There's also the problem of "how do I ask a woman out?"
			We've been repeatedly told what's creepy/unacceptable etc. But we've never been told what's acceptable, in today's political climate accidentally saying something unacceptable can be life ruining at the extremes.
			
			Then there's the #metoo movement. I'm not saying this was bad or not nessescary or anything like that but it's had unintended consequences. Alot of guys are petrified of false accusations etc. To the point where alot of men don't treat women as coworkers in the workplace/school but rather as hazards, it's perceived as dangerous to talk to female co-workers alone which causes a variety of issues. 
			
			On top of all of this we.are largely still expected to make the first move, pay for the first date etc. It all comes down to the question of "how/where am I supposed to ask out a woman?". Probably 90% of guys I've talked to who are in relationships are in one because the woman made the first move. At this point most guys would prefer it if women were expected to make the first move. 
			
			There definitely needs to be some action to address this issue because we aren't headed anywhere good at the moment.

				So I would first ask you what "leans right" means because if I was searching for a man that would make you an instant no. We wouldnt get along and having arguments all the time doesn't make a healthy relationahip
				
				Also note that the Overton window has been shifted so much that things that the democrats do are considered right wing by a lot of the world. So someone in the US who "leans right" is very right
				
				And as a woman who has experienced the perusing side of things yea it's difficult there are no good ways to meet women with the intent of a romantic relationship. It's frustrating and I don't even have a good solution. I think that there are two sides that have to be figured out
				
				One is the fact that the imbalance on dating apps needs to change. That is a place where everyone is clear why they are there. However a lot of that is working on making it less toxic for women than ones of the past. There is a great video about the statistics of dating makes things really hard for everyone. Search "why men get so few matches on dating apps" on YouTube by meme able data
				
				The second thing is guys only need to work on themselves. I have known too many guys who frustrate the hell out of me. They talk about *insert problem here* and it's hurting their relationship. I plead with them to go to therapy. Watch some Dr k. Or write about their feelings or whatever. Just do something to work on the behavior that is causing your breakup. They always refuse to do so, jump right back into dating and surprise surprise the same thing happens again
				
				So I agree dating is super frustrating because there is no known when to approach women. They dislike it but how else are you supposed to meet them? It's confusing, frightening and frustrating
				
				(note I'm not advocating for approaching more random women, just expressing that it feels like there is nothing you can do. Stuck between a rock and a hard place)

			* üü¶ **[deleted]** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 9 _(2023-10-25 04:46:02)_

				Couldn‚Äôt have said it better. Singleness will continue to rise as the hoops men are expected to jump through become more and more egregious and women maintain their position as deciders instead of pursuers

		* üüß **[-magpi-](https://www.reddit.com/user/-magpi-)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 5 _(2023-10-25 09:29:16)_

			The issue is that these changes all boil down to treating women as people instead of the objects of men‚Äôs romantic and sexual desires. So ‚Äúempathy‚Äù and ‚Äúacknowledging the struggle‚Äù sounds a lot like men saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs so hard to treat women as people :/‚Äú and then women saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre right that *is* so hard :/‚Äú  And to me personally that‚Äôs just disgusting. 
			
			In any case, feminists DO push back against gender roles, and in all the feminist spaces that I‚Äôm in, female feminists talk a lot about asking their partners out, making the first move, and paying for themselves. When feminist women talk about difficulty with dating men, they are usually talking about how *it is nearly impossible to find a male partner who doesn‚Äôt just casually believe that you shouldn‚Äôt have human rights* 
			
			That conversation is not even close to being equivalent to the manosphere discussions of ‚Äúwomen bad, have too high standards‚Äù ‚Äúall women are liars and cheaters‚Äù or victim blaming.

		So I agree with you 100%, entirely.  I think we need to somehow work out how to address the problem that it can be simultaneously true that no one is entitled sex, but physical intimacy, including sex, is a pretty important aspect to a person's mental health.  Both of these are entirely true, and we somehow need to navigate that.  
		
		I think there is some level we can "meet them in the middle" by acknowledging these are very real issues they face, even if there is no immediate solution.  What will solve it will take the order of years, which is a big ask for someone who is struggling.

			> simultaneously true that no one is entitled sex, but physical intimacy, including sex, is a pretty important aspect to a person's mental health.  Both of these are entirely true, and we somehow need to navigate that.
			
			This is a big offshoot of the original CMV and I don‚Äôt mean to put you on the spot, but I think this is an interesting tangent.
			
			IMO, ‚Äòphysical intimacy‚Äô gets reduced to sex/hooking up with women by these incel/right elements. Is that fair? 
			
			I think there would be guys on the incel/right who would counter with something like ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs not about sex I would die just to be cuddled and held‚Äô, and while that is probably true to an extent or as a starter, I think those guys would be lying if they didn‚Äôt admit that they are hoping a snuggle turns in to more. Or that they are craving physical intimacy with a woman as a means to more and greater physical intimacy with that woman.  Does that scan? 
			
			My broader point is gonna be that guys need to understand that the ‚Äòintimacy‚Äô they are craving can also come from other guys. Handshakes, high fives, hugs, exercise, team sports, etc. Just ‚Äòtouching‚Äô someone else as a greeting is a pretty powerful primal thing. 
			
			I think the ‚ÄòIncel Thing‚Äô is more about male loneliness (period), rather than male loneliness from women. Because young men have been unsatisfied sex crazed maniacs since forever, what‚Äôs new is our digital, divided, suburban world.

				I think you are partially correct, intimacy in general is really important, and there are many *kinds* of intimacy.  I think there is a tendency for men to believe that they can *only* be intimate with women, and that even includes emotional intimacy, to the point where women are almost expected to be emotional dumps for men, which is obviously wrong and unfair.  Men *do* need to be taught to be more emotionally intimate with other men.  And some forms of physical intimacy, like what you listed, would absolutely help.
				
				But I do think there is still a strong desire for sexual intimacy.  I know, for myself, that I do *feel* better when I have a regular sex life.  I can really just feel a hormonal imbalance when it's been a while.  I *love* to cuddle, quite a bit, but when I'm feeling that hormonal imbalance, it becomes more difficult to enjoy the cuddling because, yes, I do start wanting something more at that point.  But after sex?  Even the next day? Love to cuddle, without the need for more.  Heck, that's my favourite time to cuddle because I don't have that desire to take it elsewhere.  
				
				It's complicated, and messy, and there are many aspects to it.  
				
				I agree that male lonliness *in general* is a massive problem, but I don't think they are completely unrelated.  I think it's easier for men to find romance when they also surround themselves with platonic relationships, and even those harder to come by right now.

It would certainly make sense for the left to become more sympathetic to the cause of men, because there is a problem here. Offering alternative solutions to dealing with intense rejection and loneliness a lot of men feel these days. This would be a benefit to women as well. But OP has a point the left has so little sympathy and care for men that they‚Äôve lost touch of what it means to be a true progressive.

			So they're just angry at women for exercising their right to discretion.  That's not a problem in need of a societal response, that's an individual way of thinking in need of correction.  Further, that way of thinking is likely a big contributing factor in their ability to form and maintain relationships with the women they categorically resent in the first place.

		But the vast majority of men are not incels. 
		Most men lack meaningful male relationships and more often role models. 
		
		
		The left doesn‚Äôt really outline any clear morality at all. The mantra being 
		‚Äúdo what you want As long you‚Äôre not harming others‚Äù  
		
		
		Sexual freedom Has allowed women the ability to have sex with whom ever they want without the need for a relationship or consequences. While this benefits a small group of richer and socially connected individuals. This can harm societies at large. 
		
		
		This creates a hegemony for young men who have less to offer in the sexual marketplace. This breeds resentment towards women for making the choice. 
		Not condoning it but this is the truth 
		
		
		So now young men are scrambling to protect their worth through monetary and social/physical means. To join that aforementioned group. The natural feeling of wanting to prove themselves leeches into personal relationships and causes toxicity. This leads to bad habits and outcomes. 
		
		
		
		The left overall doesn‚Äôt have a good track record of caring about men. It doesn‚Äôt really serve them politically either. 
		
		
		
		Society overall doesn‚Äôt care about men it doesn‚Äôt serve them to right now either bc of the way things are set up. 
		
		
		There are no third spaces. There are no male role models not looking to make money off of them.

	So there's a lot to unpack here but i'd like to focus on this one point:

	> In fact, i would argue that the left has abandoned the idea that young men CAN be provided with a vision if healthy masculinity.

	I'd argue that the growing provision of paid parental leave for fathers in the EU (and elsewhere) is a good counterexample to this.

	Paid paternity leave was first introduced by the Social Democratic Party in Sweden in 1975 and has since been slowly adopted by other counties in Scandinavia (for example, Denmark) and the wider EU. It gives fathers the right to take paid parental leave and allows for the total leave allowance to be shared between parents. To encourage uptake among men, Fathers are also granted an additional 'use it or lose it' parental allowance. So far, it's been moderately successful in addressing  what was an overwhelming imbalance in early child care.

	I think this is a good counterexample to your point about the left and 'healthy masculinity'. Paternity leave policies advance a model of healthy masculinity by creating the expectation that men share childcare responsibilities. I think this speaks to a left-wing vision of positive masculinity in which fathers are encouraged to be active participants in family life. In chipping away at engrained gender roles, it's also a version of positive masculinity that's in pretty direct tension with more 'traditionalist' views that are spouted off by right wing media figures like Andrew Tate, Steve Bannon, and (to a lesser extent) Jordan Peterson. It might be less flashy than right-wing outrage culture, but I think it's undoubtedly more helpful to men in the long run.

	I think more generally, Paternity leave is a template for a left wing approach to dealing with issues that affect men. It's about chipping away at the fact that men, just as with women, are trapped by gender norms and expectations. The traditional view of masculinity is built around ideas of self-sacrifice, individualism, 'providing for your family', etc. Untempered and unchallenged, these expectations are associated with negative outcomes for men: the epidemic of suicide amongst young men and the overrepresentation of men in workplace deaths are two examples. I don't think you can effectively address these issues without challenging the underlying societal expectations that lead men to pursue these ideals even when it goes against their self interest. In the meantime, better provision of mental health services and robust occupational health and safety legislation will help mitigate these harms. In my country at least, I hear more serious discussion of these policies on the left than on the right.

	EDIT: grammar and clarity

* üü© **[deleted]** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 31 _(2023-10-24 08:57:27)_

	The left does have an outrage culture, it's the basis of the oppressor/oppressed dynamic. I mean, do you look at titles like "White Fragility" or "Toxic Masculinity" or "The God Delusion" and think they're *not* deliberately crafted to be emotionally charged and inflammatory? I mean sure you can argue that the left fails to provide an alternative outrage culture that's appealing to straight white men, but that's kinda a predictable consequence on the left's part that the right wing understands and is able to capitalize on, and there's no real readily available solution without harming the charged base they do have.

		It's interesting that the folks on "The God Delusion" side are now at odds with the rest, and they're now kind of considered alt-right adjacent by the left.
		
		People like Harris and Schirmer say when they used to debate with Christians, even though they vehemently disagreed, they enjoyed each other as people and the latter would want to take them out to lunch.
		
		Now when the "progressive left" disagrees with them, they want to "cancel" them, hurt them, and take away their livelihood.

	Does the left have to be *equally* appealing to men and women? 

	I mean, the left clearly does have *something* to say to men, you can see it in any CMV about gender issues, and it clearly does reach some men. (speaking as a leftist man). 

	So why is it a grievous failure if the left makes up for their message being by and large being a hard pill to swallow for most men, (even when presented in the best possible light), by gaining support from the majority of women? 

	You could always say the left fails to do as much as it could for white people, rich people, religious people, etc., but we live in a polarized, two-sided political culture, even if we are not talking about the US two party system specifically. Someone was bound to occupy both ends of the spectrum after all, there isn't really an option of just being appealing to everyone and skipping real divisions of society.

		>why is it a grievous failure‚Ä¶to lose male support‚Ä¶in favour of women
		
		I would argue a significantly gender voting gap increases likelihood of negative social consequences of political polarisation; this could increase instability and lead to a higher chance of political violence. I think an association between the two can at least be made, 1992 election had a 4-point gender gap; 2016 had 11 points. I won‚Äôt say gender gaps are the cause of the massive political polarity in the US, but they do correlate and I believe contribute to it. 
		
		Allowing this to slip further apart may be a self-fulfilling prophecy or negative feedback loop, as either gender is more likely to listen to someone like them (not a political or moral statement, that‚Äôs just how psychological persuasion theory goes, as I‚Äôve studied it.) so if one party gains a critical mass of one gender it would be very hard to reverse that. 
		
		
		
		I think the extreme possible result of D and R turning into ‚Äúthe women‚Äôs party‚Äù and ‚Äúthe men‚Äôs party‚Äù could be a political experiment ending in disaster. i.e. a coup by the men. I don‚Äôt consider the reverse likely. Before that point there would also be intense social effects that are hard to imagine, like relationship and family difficulties. This might seem very speculative, it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôve considered before, but I‚Äôd encourage thinking about the outcome of this trend taken to its logical conclusion; it seems like a really bad path to consider walking down, with how chaotic and unpredictable the world can actually be. 
		
		
		It‚Äôs also worth noting that men, while they today, I believe, vote at lower rates than women, still have outsized political influence; the wealthiest and most powerful politicians, for the most part, are still men from a certain generation or two. So purely cynically, appealing to them has strategic value. 
		
		I‚Äôm more than willing to hear what the positives of such a trend are; again, women vote a bit more these days so of course that‚Äôs good.

				Testosterone increases violent tendencies, and from observing irl and across history, groups of men are simply more violent and dangerous. I think even when you account for social factors this would remain true. I can‚Äôt explain it much beyond that. The fact that there is a constant threat of violence is actually very significant for political dynamics. It wouldn‚Äôt do to entirely ignore that. 
				
				
				As for the number men holding positions of power, I‚Äôm not advocating it, it‚Äôs a legacy of a previous generation to some extent, guys who are 50-80 now are from a time when the us was majority white and men ran everything. It will be more balanced in 20 years. Though for various factors like, some men have nothing better to do than commit their whole life to seeking power, it will likely remain skewed towards men beyond 20 years. 
				
				I think to some extent the whole patriarchy is a legacy of a more violent time - the world wars etc. Having military experience used to be almost a prerequisite for becoming US president. Capacity for violence had a lot of political capital, in reality. You can see this across history. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good thing, it just is what it is. 
				
				Anyway that power matters because money matters. Money is key for winning elections, which is also something I don‚Äôt think is a good thing but it is true.

		Not necessarily, but it should at least *try.*
		
		I'm not saying it should reinforce toxic ideas of masculinty to appeal to the good old boys or anything of that nature. But when men have issues that need solving (such as custody of children being awarded disproportionately to mothers over fathers, a lack of 50/50 custody being the standard, or child support being assigned in a way that is often radically unfair to men), we need to acknowledge those issues instead of dismissing them.
		
		The left does a terrible job of acknowledging men's issues, and if we're all about equality, we should be about equality for *everyone*. I'm not denying that there are more issues to resolve for other groups. But that doesn't mean men's issues should simply be ignored or dismissed in favor of those other groups. And it does feel like the left has a habit of doing so.

		Why do we accept that the left builds up one side by neglecting or even attacking the other. You're born with a sex. It's not inclusive to merely say, "men had it good, women had it bad, so we build/support/provide examples for one side while denigrating the other."
		
		The left could/should do a better job of providing an alternative to the rights narratives or I would argue they'll lose men (of all creeds, religions, races) and lose the whole culture war.

				If you're a young boy and feel rejected, confused, and weak are you going to follow the person who tells you that you'd be accepted, know your place, and strong if not for the [woke/communist/bad/scary] conspiracy against YOU, that fosters and develops a sense of community, however toxic/misguided, or, are you going to hitch your wagon to the other side that tells you all the things you're going through are invalid and that you're likely to grow up a bad man?
				
				We tell young women they can be anything they want and teach them how to be empowered, strong women. We provide, at best, very mixed messages about what a man should be - at least on the left we do.

					This is ridiculous, I'm saying that it isn't difficult to understand what good behavior is. The model you should strive for is to be a good person. The left doesn't even care what gender you are. Positive lessons are positive lessons, being resilient and assertive, respectful and responsible are gender neutral goals that make a good PERSON. 
					
					A man should strive to be a good PERSON.
					
					Why do boys need to be flattered and coddled in this way? Why do they need gendered flattery? 
					
					"suck it up" suck what up? the left offers far more room for men and boys to be vulnerable and emotional, there's no sucking it up in this worldview

						"Just be a good person"

						Then when the boy says, "I don't know how to be a good person. I feel confused by my role in society. I'm hearing that boys are being left behind and I feel like I am too."

							It's said that when any group suffers, whether that's women, minorities, so forth, the left and Western society in general pours money and resources into it to fix the problem and into looking at whatever systemic issues might exist.  It gets broken down into the complex matrix of intersectionality-- as a woman, as their gender, as their race, as their socioeconomic class-- where each collection of identities is unique and must be uniquely understood and addressed so policy and protocol can be formulated to address systemic issues across all aspects of corporate life.
							
							When boys and men suffer or fall behind, they're expected to fix it themselves.  Suddenly those gender differences or lived experiences don't seem to matter, except as further indictment of the patriarchy.  The OP you're responding to kind of exudes that mentality-- "just be a good person, figure it out... (as a man if you must, but certainly a bad man if you don't)"
							
							Weirdly it kind of incorporates a version of the very thing they might consider a stoic "toxic masculinity" that you'd have a hard time imagine being told to any of the other intersectional groups.
							
							But part of it is that this is the way it has always been.  Human society has never been particularly compassionate to male victimhood, for biological and sociological reasons, and it probably isn't likely to change even if some on the left claim to want to wipe away gender differences in perception and development.  The left will never be able to escape some of their basic perceptions of men either.  It won't coddle men, nor can it or should it.
							
							If the left can only see things as a struggle between the oppressor and the oppressed, then it will be poorly equipped to equip men who it sees as members of the patriarchy to better themselves in a zero-sum power game-- when the truth is as a whole, men and women need each other to be more than themselves (controversial I know).
							
							Leadership and positive masculinity will need to come from elsewhere, and from men themselves.

			No, left has always focused on convergence between genders rather than divergences between them. Left has always viewed the basic needs like love, respect, honour to be common to all humans, not just straight white men, women or queer people.
			
			Left doesn't need to define masculine behaviour as it isn't different than feminine or queer behaviour. So it asks women to do what good men have been doing like getting educated, getting a job, having a career. It asks men to do what good women have been doing like being involved at home, cooking, raising kids, sharing emotions. It also fights for equality for queers with the same rationale. If straight people can get married, why not gay people. If straight people can express their their gender, why not queer people.

				Masculine behaviour is very much different from feminine behaviour. That‚Äôs why we see millions of men resonate with ‚Äúright‚Äù leaning figures. Men express their love differently than women for example. As a man, I behave differently when I have my children in public. I have different thoughts regarding my surroundings and society when in public compared to my wife. Yes some of these things may overlap, but our behaviour is different. Again, the fact that you think they are not different is part of the reason that men are resonating with figures on the right.

	I agree. I'm a cis man, who's best defined by "straight."

	I have traditionally "masculine" desires. I want to take care of my partner, and provide for them. 

	I'm the kind of person who's frequently villainized because I uphold some traditional male values. 

	There's nowhere on the left for me to be myself. It feels very much like I'm being actively pushed away from voting for the objectively correct choice, because they don't want me. 

	I'm not gay, so I'm a bad person for not being gay. I'm comfortable with being a man, so I'm a bad person for being comfortable with being a man. I can't share my feelings, because I'm not a victim so I don't matter. My only role in pretty much every left leaning group that I've tried to interact with is to "feel bad" and be quiet.

	It's incredibly frustrating, honestly, and I can see the traps that lead to alt-right behavior.

		I'm the kind of person who's frequently villainized because I uphold some traditional male values
		
		What values? 
		
		I'm not gay, so I'm a bad person for not being gay. I'm comfortable with being a man, so I'm a bad person for being comfortable with being a man. 
		
		What are you talking about? Like actually I don't understand why you would expect to say something like this and expect the left to court you. 
		
		As someone who identified as a straight "cis" man I legitimately do not get where or why  you internalized this kind of thing from.  You're literally doing the classic "Straight cis males are the real oppressed class" I don't get it. I transitioned sure, we aren't the same clearly, but like I never felt like people hated me because I was a "straight man" or anything like that. that unironically seems like something that therapy might help...  
		
		If you actually believe people think you're a bad person for "not being gay" or "being comfortable being a man" then you've basically made a victim narrative for yourself.  Like I don't think you're a bad person, I don't know you, but I think it's really questionable that is how you see things. I think honestly you are already the type amiable to right wing views if you that is how you choose to present modern LGBT rhetoric.
		
		Downvote because there is NO response to this that won't be ripped apart as absurd.   If you feel vilified  because you're a straight man, you are literally part of the problem.

	My brother in Christ(man), have you heard the good word of the [Grill Pill](https://youtu.be/tM-8Ny2WVK4)?

	 >...The essence of grill pill is to log off and grill instead.

	>And the grilling can be whatever it is that's actually in your life that gives you a sense of satisfaction because all that energy you were expending and I was expending caring about the presidential election.... That is a sterile investment you're not going to get anything out anything in your nothing in your life is going to get better by focusing on the presidential election so grill instead and by that I mean focus on something in your life that brings meaning to it but that goes beyond the inter- that goes beyond just caring about the presidential election it goes broader to caring about politics insofar as your ‚Äúcaring about politics‚Äù is expressed by going online to talk about them to people and spend more likely to argue with people about them or to make fun of people about them and obviously this is hilarious coming from me because I'm one of the Pied Pipers that brought people onto these platforms.

	>Now I think in retrospect I feel pretty, I feel relatively proud of my position because I honestly do feel like Chapo was the opposite of a¬†Fash¬†pipeline, it was a pipeline away from alienated young white men, from the the lure of the genuinely, genuinely transgressive web right because when you're alienated and you're online and one group of people tells you that you're a too stupid piece of shit who should cut your dick off for being a white male and another group is saying we're gonna make fun of these people who think you suck your commitments at that point which aren't very strong because you're just getting online they harden very quickly.

	>They harden very quickly and we were an alternative to that. It's like you can still have fun, you can still do jokes, you don't have to be, like, obviously all of those ‚Äúrad libs‚Äù that people hate they were getting the same joy out of the Internet too but their's was in policing, their joy was in suppressing ideas. They thought they were doing a good thing by making other people miserable those people being the white male cis gamergaters but of course for the white male cis gamergators their enjoyment come from annoying those people and that starts just as a desire to antagonize. But over time it gets rolled up with a bunch of other beliefs because you're in contact with people who are all similarly aligned generally in terms of background and racial identification and gender and things like that and those gonna solidify arguments and that's what happened with arguments within the left and between the left and the right online.

	----

	>And everyone has some some percentage of material and spiritual alienation and they are absolutely inverse to each other so like the Chapo fan or alt right NEET is a classic example of somebody who's not really materially, is materially, is genuinely materially deprived in that they can't really expect to own a home or start a family even if they wanted to work or knew people to do it with. But they have home because they live with their parents or something. So they're wildly alienated from the situation mainly in the first sense, even though they have free time, way more free time than somebody who works a lot of hours.

	>All of their free time is alienated because they are judging themselves and hating themselves for being idle. At some level they believe themselves to be ‚Äúuseless‚Äù because they've internalized the notion of work as worth and that uselessness has to get set somewhere. And at some level you identify it as a political problem, if you do, some people, a lot of people don't, most people don't, I mean all those people screaming about Jerry Dunk headphones on Facebook have the same alienation in different degrees and they're expressing at Jerry Dunk for stealing headphones instead of the president because their relative lack of alienated free time makes them less likely to abstract away their concerns into the political realm, they're more likely to for them to be concrete.

	-------

	>But the thing is there is still something for you to do. You fled to the Internet the first time because you didn't know what it was and now you're going back to the Internet. Now you went to the Internet the last time and found it, I know I did, or something closer to it.

	>Now going back with the same conditions, nothing's really changed, everything's been hardened there is no more growth there. There's only slow decay of your interest in politics. At the end of that hedonic treadmill you are ‚Äúblackpilled‚Äù because it's like I don't get anything else out of this I don't get anything else out of ‚Äúcaring about politics‚Äù. And the only way you're gonna fight, but the thing is is that when you hear get off the internet it's terrifying because you still don't know what to do and so what am I gonna do sit here with my thoughts oh my god I'm gonna go insane.

	>Well that is where the ‚Äúgrill‚Äù part comes in I don't mean grill like in the sense necessarily of a Weber or or whatever. I mean look around you, find something that you are good at in some combination of talented at but also willing to keep trying and what that willing to keep trying is is the closer something is to you the easier it is to get you to do it.

	-----

	>And so find something that is enjoyable to do but takes concentration and do it. It could be grilling delicious meats, whatever, it could be I saw a guy today is building, he's rebuilding a fucking a arcade cabinet from the 80s. Whatever it is it needs to be something that you can focus your attention on completely in the here and now and get better at or complete something.

	>Gaming is the opposite of that. Gaming is just more of the Internet. Gaming is more offloading your need to be directly addressing your needs that are in front of you into a psychic realm where they could only ever fall down the hedonic treadmill like your belief in politics did. Now gaming can't be done in the right frame of mind to be useful to be you know practice. But it cannot be, like, the fact gaming existed is a place for people to put their that alienation is one of the most counter-revolutionary things about American society like in broad structure. Just the fact that there with the internet and with computers and with gaming there's so much place to dump your excess and unexamined alienation that it really undermines your need to address the alienation fundamentally by asking what do I do and so you start by focusing on the here and now.

	I just picked some excerpts from [the transcript](https://cushbomb.fandom.com/wiki/Grillpill:_Explained_05.04.20), its a loooooong rant after all, but the point is, there are folks on the left offering an alternative to the Red Pill.  Discussing alternatives for the alienated male to finding purpose beyond turning into a misogynistic trad cath is a very common topic on the cushvlogs, when he's not getting into the weeds of historical analysis from a Marxist perspective, that is - though often these topics emerge as an offshoot from that, as historical parallels are drawn between our shared human history and modern struggles.

	If you want the left to do better, your gonna have to offer a solution to male created issues that affect males. Namely, old guys who divorce their wives, and then use lots of money to support young ladies who are completely broke (but still in college) 

	In other words, your going to have to fix inequality. Here is how the pipeline works.

	Old guy divorces wife. He has a midlife crisis, and to him his wife isn't that pretty anymore. OR she divorces him. (cash is king). 

	Young girl goes to college. (and is broke, and can't find work that pays the bills while doing classes)

	Girl discovers only fans. Or begs online. Regardless, she gets found by said older guy. 

	Older guy woos her with gifts. Usually monetary. While it is said diamonds a girls best friend, the financial stability of being able to ask her partner to pay the bills, and not have to worry about life and being a kept woman is ADDICTIVE. 20 year Women will gladly date a 50 year old man if he offers to pay their bills. 

	Younger guy comes along. Can't find gf, and becomes an incel. 

	So why is this? How many pairs of old women young guys do you know? Is it more prevalent than old guys young girls? Why is sugar daddy a well known trope, but sugar mommy is not as well known? This is entirely a numbers game, but by and large women are more ok with dating a man twice their age than men are ok with dating women twice their age. Those young incels are not able to see those mature older women as partners, (just like young girls dont naturally see older men as partners) but are the older women approaching? Nope. Are the older men approaching? Yes. 

	And this is the crux of the dating market. When a woman divorces a man and leaves the dating pool when the man has 20 years of dateable life ahead of him, and he stays in the dating pool, if this repeats across all of society, the dating pool gets really really small. Especially if you have 20-30 year old men, 30-40 year old men AND 40-50 year old men competing for 20-30 year old women. The dating statistics are stacked 3 to 1 against younger men because of the older men. 

	Now, how did this get solved in the old days? Well, it was really hard to divorce. There was social shaming for men and women. There was also more death and men didn't live as long. If you want to solve incels from being created, and then listening to tate, becoming radicalized mysognists and wanting to go to war against this or that country, you need to realize this is an evolutionary reproduction fitness issue. In the past, if there was a shortage of viable female partners, how would an organism guarantee passing its genes on? It would attack the competition ofc. You see how taters are super combative? Thats evolutionary programming not just tate logic. From a pure evolutionary standpoint, men who have no partners should be going on an all out war against the outgroup to kill all of the other men from the outgroup. Why? Because it would increase the chances their genes get passed on. The agression and radicalization is a feature of men, not a bug, and if you want to tackle it, you need to start at the dating scene.

	Imo a major reason there isn't a model of ideal masculinity is because it doesn't exist. There's nothing about good behaviour that is exclusive to any gender. Hence, for the most part ideal masculinity is a false ideal and the true ideal is just being a good person, community member, part of society etc. We can hold up a woman, man, or non-binary person as an example of ideal equally. You could say your mother is a good example of ideal masculinity. In nurturing, caring, hearing etc. I would go so far as to say they are probably a better example to follow than a man because it inherently dismantles a lot of the concepts formed by toxic masculinity in a way that can't be done by trying to find a "better" man instead.

	Gender norms and stereotypes aren't really part of the ideals of ideal personhood. They're just displays and traits and cultural trends that happen to be more external. They are things that exist but that's not really what it means to be a "good man". What it means up be a"good man" is to be a good person.

	People who are looking to a masculine ideal might be missing the point.

	I would say that all young people are feeling left behind due to the current economic state and poor outlook on the future. This is hitting men especially hard due to a historical pressure to be providers for their family. People like Steve Bannon, Tate, etc are trying to utilize men‚Äôs current frustrations for either their own gain (Tate) or to push more men to the right (Bannon). They utilize the current sadness and vulnerability to their advantage, which is a real shame. They promise something easy- you get to have a role in society, a place for yourself, someone to take care of you, your home, and your children, and life can be as good as it was in the 50s. But it won‚Äôt be and can‚Äôt be, because it‚Äôs almost impossible to make enough money on a single income. But instead of getting mad at the current system, the energy is directed and women or gender roles.

	The left has decent role models, they just aren‚Äôt that appealing or idealistic. There are male scientists, CEOs, craftsmen, painters, stay at home fathers, etc. There‚Äôs representation there, it just isn‚Äôt full of idealistic lies like Tate offering an easy life with respect and Bugattis. We‚Äôre not going to lie to you so it‚Äôs not as appealing or inspiring. The hard part comes with breaking away from what roles are currently there instead of doubling down. 

	There isn‚Äôt a healthy representation of masculinity because we don‚Äôt believe men should be bound to masculinity at all, but because masculinity is so ingrained in people, some men just don‚Äôt want to see them as role models at all. To ask for a healthy representation of masculinity is to say that you want a road map but you‚Äôre not willing to take back roads or tolls, only toll-free highways. Though we do need more of this for kids, it can be hard because parents don‚Äôt always want that kind of stuff around their child.

	Okay soooooooooo this post has a lot about how young men feel bad and the so called masculinity crisis of the left. But this forgets a large part of what makes the left; **The Labour Movement.**

	While a little less of a slice now - the labour movement has been a large part of the left for a long time. And the labour movement has long been driven *by men*.

	While it doesn't provide a healthy idea of what a man can be directly - it does provide a healthy idea of what work and a worker can be. About collective organisation. About giving back to communities. About breaking down wage slavery.

	This won't mean much to teens and young adults - but to the many many many many many adult working men who have been working low end jobs for a long time - this is what the left has offered them for a long time. Unfortunately this often leads leftist men into being tankies (supporting soviet union and the ilk) but that is an expression of leftism.

	Other people are effectively giving you examples of how the left is trying to do what you are asking in the form of positive masculinity - but in this comment I want to show you that the left is not without ammo when it comes to what it can offer men even without that. Men being turned off from the left is a relatively new idea - and one that right wing propaganda pushes as well as propaganda specifically targeted to alienate workers from the left and get them to stop support the labour movement.

	Additionally - if you look outside the US you will see way more alive examples of the labour movement. In the US it is crushed by both the right and the mainstream left.

	>  

	>The left is really only capable of providing fluid guidelines on this subject and as there are so many competing values, they're not as eager to make those broad assertions.
  

	

	The left is generally critical of the fundamental concept of gender roles.

	It's not merely that "we're not sure / can't agree on what masculinity should look like". It's not just competing values. It's that a lot of the left doesn't think that boys *need* to be "masculine" *at all*. It's not "ideal A" vs "ideal B", it's the explicit rejection of a single ideal.

	"Here's the Ideal Man" is certainly *simpler* than "Be whoever you want to be", which gives the former an advantage. This is a necessary problem of most struggles in social progress. Bad ideals and views are commonly more amenable to sound bites, because good ideals and views are grounded in reality, and reality is complicated, nuanced, and messy.

	The left has, to a significant degree, explicitly rejected the idea that young men can be provided with *a single* vision of healthy masculinity. The left's vision of healthy masculinity is plural.

	For example, two commonly brought up examples of healthy masculinity are Steve Rogers and Fred Rogers. They are in some ways similar, and in many ways extremely different.

	I am so confused with your take here. How is the left going to provide a counter to the ‚Äúaggrieved victimhood narrative‚Äù when they are the primary users and beneficiaries of it themselves?! It‚Äôs like the foundation of the intersectional coalition where you pull together all of the aggrieved groups and unify them by promising them hope and change.

	‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre black you‚Äôre a victim.‚Äù

	‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre Hispanic, you‚Äôre a victim.‚Äù

	‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre LGBT, you‚Äôre a victim.‚Äù

	‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre Muslim, you‚Äôre a victim.‚Äù

	‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre poor (but not white), you‚Äôre a victim.‚Äù

	‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre in debt, you‚Äôre a victim.‚Äù

	‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre young, your a victim of the greedy boomers.‚Äù

	I‚Äôm not arguing for or against any of these specific views, but this is exactly the playbook that has been in effect since at least Obama.

	I guess, however, you‚Äôre looking for a response to young white males feeling left out of the coalition, and thus being courted by the right. I would say there is no response without risking the narrative with the rest of the coalition.

	I have no interest in changing the view of someone who is perceptive.  The left truly has dropped the ball because they can't get out of the desire to blame based on identity or consider any reality that doesn't allow them to sate this desire.

	These men aren't running to the right because they are being taken advantage of.  They are actively running from a group of people that refuse to allow them any dignity.  No part of the leftist ideology allows these people to be anything but immature oppressors that can only hope to be considered pathetic children at best.  No part of leftist ideology will ever allow them a seat at the table unless they condemn anyone that they can identify with.

	You won't be able to educate your way out of this.  You have to allow them some kind of future where they don't just have to claim to be reformed oppressors.... Playing second fiddle to the identities you do think are worth a damn.

	For about a decade (right when radical wokeness started) I have been saying this and I warned against this, but again, the emotional left does what the emotional left does best: double down and rage downvote while providing zero sensible or reasonably rational arguments. As I predicted, people would eventually begin to believe me, but it would take a while. It is like this with many things, I spot the pattern, I warn people, people get angry and lash out at me, then my prediction comes true in saying that a thought/ideology/thing is going to cause harm and it does, then people slowly begin to realize this. A few years ago for example, the OP would not have even been allowed on reddit, it would result in an instead permaban. This is still the case for most mainstream subreddits, but at last SOME are now beginning to act somewhat sane by allowing these civil discussions. 

	I tell them that doubling down and yelling at the other side does not help. That logically, if there is a problem, it has a root, and doubling down and yelling harder is not going to fix the issue. But then they call me vague straw man labels like "misogynist" or "inc3l!!!" to anyone who does not 100% agree with their pre-existing subjective beliefs.. I say this is a word you are saying, how does it help calling someone that, did it ever change anything? And what do you even mean by it? Why don't you address my argument instead? But they just double down and yell straw mans and vague words/labels louder. 

	You can't convince people who have been brainwashed to believe things like "there are no biological differences between men and women". They are so oblivious that there are no words to describe it. They are in this victim bubble, as propagated by society and the media, that they are totally oblivious to the practical reality, and any time you try to engage in a discussion, they double down. 

	Reddit and other online media is a huge enabler, because they censor anybody and everybody who goes against the mainstream status quo. So you can't even have a civilized discussion without being censored and shut down. Therefore, logically, the problem still persists.  

	The reason Andrew Tate is big is BECAUSE of the left: when you SHUT DOWN and CENSOR ALL AVENUES and ignore ALL concerns, where do you expect people to go? This causes more radicalization, not less. But again, the left is totally oblivious to this and will keep doubling down and saying bizarre straw mans like "you just indicated support for Andrew Tate therefore you are a misogynist. I do not interact with misogynists." Bizarre.

	I think you're right that there is no one on the left explicitly saying we have to help young men.

	However, the left is very clear that the patriarchy hurts both men and women. That the solution to many of our problems is not individualistic ("competition in the sexual market") but rather collective and systemic. Title IX helps men as well as women. 

	In the teaching sphere, there is plenty of attention on specifically Black \*boys\* because they are uniquely discriminated against by teachers. They are profiled as violent and face far harsher punishments than anyone else. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8450170/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8450170/)

	So maybe there is a more tailored area of study emerging that focuses on men and particularly young men and boys, and you're right that we need it. 

	I also don't completely agree that it is Steve Bannon or Jordan Peterson turning men toward the right wing. I think they are already being brought up in a culture that hates women, that hates gay people, that is racist and xenophobic. 

	We don't need like a Steve Bannon for the left to tell young men to be nicer to women. We need to continue to chip away at this white supremacist, patriarchal culture. And that entails all of the things the left is working on. It includes improving economic conditions for everyone, winning rights for women and immigrants, winning racial equality, protecting gay and trans youth, and so on. The change will happen through the culture. When men are growing up believing different things and placing themselves differently within society, the words of Bannon and other right wingers will not hit the same way.

	Hi leftist here. 

	Consider the fact that absolutely everything you just said, has absolutely zero relevancy to upholding "feminine values" with regards to the left. 

	The left doesn't give an image of what's a good guy because it doesn't give an image to anybody being"good". Not women, not pocs, not trans people, not gays, not even the proliteriate. 

	Likewise a member of these identities can easily still be a cop, imperalist, capitalist, nationalist, theocrat, reactionary etc. And therefore their identity doesn't save them, contrary to what Boomer McKaren might say in her Minion memes. 

	I think being a good-whatever is an individual pursuit not under scrutiny by society at large. When we talk about societal oppression, we refer to the fact that there are obstacles that exist to prevent us from reaching out own version of good. Not this kind of preserved "good" collectivised by Jordan Peterson and the likes who already grant a definition, outside from oneself. 

	For example Jordan Peterson likely wouldn't give an answer to "what is a good transgender person." He would say that by virtue of being trans you are: bad, incorrect, something in the "shouldn't exist" camp. 

	In contrast, no feminist is going to be upset that a consentually respectful man is drowning in poon. No socalist is going to call another socialist a hypocrite just because they like their job, even though it exists under capitalism. 

	Those versions of "goods" aren't the point. They're an individual's ends. The means are collective.

Everyone except this self appointed chosen few where told they were institutionalize garbage. You reap what you sow.

	As a person who is a leftist and has worked in both men‚Äôs advocacy and feminist spaces, one of the difficult parts of getting more men on board is that progress to equality is seen as a double edged sword, and by all technical definitions, that‚Äôs not *untrue*. The fact of the matter is that men are harmed by patriarchy and in extremely significant ways (emotional development, parental skills, mental health, assumption of being a ‚Äúprovider‚Äù, lack of support for sexual assault victims, etc) and one of those is the assumption of being default dangerous by women, which can lead to the struggle of men to approach women, even if they mean well. 

	The issue is that to fix this, to help boys and men, the *advantages* that patriarchy gives them also need to be dismantled. This is an issue whenever a group who generally has societal privilege needs to get involved in activism that breaks down the framework that they‚Äôve benefitted from their entire lives. This is why it was difficult to recruit more white people into the Civil Rights movement, why it‚Äòa difficult to recruit the ultra rich into economic equality movements, etc. 

	These are tough conversations to have for men because society does not place a burden on them to understand the way patriarchy both benefits and harms them. No one really enjoys being told they‚Äôve been passively or even sometimes actively unfairly benefitted by a system, especially when you (more than anyone else) know that you‚Äôre struggling so much in life. It can be really hard for anyone to acknowledge that to make things better, hard work needs to be done that isn‚Äôt always comfortable. Progress is not a zero sum game. Progress for another group does not automatically mean a detriment for other groups.  

	I do think that there‚Äôs *better* ways to get men involved in leftist movements that can provide relief from the restrictions of patriarchy, but the answer isn‚Äôt pandering like the right does. That‚Äôs the ever difficult part of being a leftist ‚Äî being conservative is easy, just keep things the way they are, zero inertia. Change is hard, it‚Äôs uncomfortable, it can be bloody, it can be deadly at the worst of it. Women died for their rights, Black Americans died for their rights, LGBTQ+ died for their rights. We need not ask men to die for the cause, but we can‚Äôt sugarcoat the situation. Change may be hard, but it must be done.

		This is interesting, but I'm not sure I follow how the former (men by default being considered dangerous, and the burden of both approach and seeing safe being placed upon them), would be fixed by the latter (dismantling advantages associated with the patriarchy).
		
		How would that actually play out, as men will likely always be more of a physical threat, and would logically be perceived as such?
		
		There's also the fact that the "patriarchy" also benefits many women in relationships, in that the more traditional model is for men to approach, and its still expected from many/most who consider themselves progressive, as well as wanting men who are tall, earn more than their salary even as their salaries rise, etc.
		
		How would women need to adjust to the loss of some of these advantages or expectations of a better "value" mate --which may have biological impetus as much as "patriarchal" sociological influences-- to "lower their expectations" on certain factors, as weird and uncomfortable as that sounds?  I think it would be a tough sell to many women to relinquish many of those advantages or expectations.  Many of those women consider that "dating down".
		
		What would this fixed system look like, because it would be drastically different for both men and women, and would affect things that they both currently enjoy and are negatively affected by-- and how do we know it would truly be a better arrangement ultimately without more problematic knock-on effects?
		
		A maybe-relevant tangent, but what I find interesting is that in spaces where a lot of the more familiar regulating "patriarchy" has less influence, like Tinder where women can choose and will get much higher response than men of their literal pick, the dynamics end up looking more like ancient harems-- many women to a few men-- than the patriarchal nuclear families the left sometimes rails about disparagingly.

			You make good points! I always tell folks I work with that no woman should expect the process of dismantling the patriarchy to be comfortable, just as much as I say it about men. The ways that certain women benefit from their proximity to patriarchy is actually a huge reason why the early feminist movement was so racist ‚Äî white middle and upper class women wanted rights, but also knew that keeping some proximity to white men would give them benefits, and they weren‚Äôt keen on extending those benefits to Black women, or really any woman of colour.
			
			However, in terms of dating, there needs to be special care taken into account because neither men nor women alive right now (speaking mostly about cis/het men and women, I myself am queer) have ever been able to function on a completely equal footing, without the simultaneous risk and reward of patriarchy, without the power imbalance that is inherent to the system.
			
			The issue is not of ‚Äúlowering‚Äù expectations, it is changing them. The dismantling of the cis/het framework is a *massive* undertaking because it comes with a lot of facets. Compulsory monogamy, jealousy over male/female friends, financial decisions, sex and other intimacy, the split of domestic labour, etc. In short, that‚Äôs a whole couple of theses worth of information and discussion that is ongoing!
			
			And the online dating sphere is an interesting one. I actually worked for a dating app for some time, and have experience of my own as a user as well. I find it‚Äôs brought up often that women ‚Äúhave their pick‚Äù of men, and while that may sound like a good thing to men (who are the majority of people on the app), this doesn‚Äôt often actually pan out that way. Sure, we have the ability to get more matches, but the issue is not of quantity, it‚Äôs *quality*. I and many other women/AFAB folks can tell you with intricate detail how much of our experience on dating apps is weeding through *awful* prospects ‚Äî and I don‚Äôt just mean men they‚Äôre not attracted to. Nobody is universally attractive/date worthy to literally everyone. I mean extremely troubling messages, severe sexism, threats, and more. One of the conversations I have frequently with male clients of mine is that most men on a first date are looking for compatibility; women are on high alert for safety, *then* they‚Äôre looking for compatibility. 
			
			This is also connected to the aspects of sex ‚Äî it‚Äôs often said that women could get basically any man they want, while men have to work much harder, often mentioning biological essentialism based arguments. The issue is, again, quality over quantity. The orgasm gap is a *hefty* piece of evidence to say that women are often given the short end of the stick when it comes to heterosexual relations, and this isn‚Äôt even to speak of the very unfortunate fact that many women were coerced into sexual acts, said yes just to avoid a potentially violent reaction, etc. 
			
			Unfortunately, due to the patriarchy enforcing that men must be providers, must be physically strong, be stoic/less emotional, and embody aspects of masculinity that often have toxic roots, many men are not ready for the reality that those requirements are no longer sufficient for a good relationship. Women, for much of modern history (mind, this is not applicable to certain societies where gender equality was more sustained), needed men simply to survive. There was little choice. Now that women have fought for their rights and gained a lot of ground on equality, they now no longer *need* men, but can *want* them instead. 
			
			The distinction is important ‚Äî one should not seek to be *needed*, it‚Äôs restrictive, hierarchical, and often results in resentment, divorce, or worse. Women can now choose living single over partnership with men; I often say that men are no longer competing with each other for women‚Äôs attention, they‚Äôre competing with a woman‚Äôs solitude, with her loved ones, with her aspirations, and more. When you are *wanted*, that is specific to *you*. Back in the day, you really just needed *a* man in order to provide for the family. You really only needed *a* woman to have children with. It‚Äôs boilerplate, blank slate, any man or woman will do, and you often had little choice. Lastly, the unfortunate fact that still continues today is that the man most likely to harm a woman is her significant other. It‚Äôs hard to explain to men that we can and do love them dearly, but are also *always* aware of that outcome, even if we believe the men in our lives would never do that. That weight is so so so heavy, and it has hindered relationships between men and women for far too long.
			
			What I hope to instil in the men I work with is that allowing yourself to break out of the patriarchal bonds will *help*, not hinder, their ability to befriend, romance, and/or be close with women. The last and final point I try to make is that if a woman is dead set on a six foot tall, six figures, six inches man, and you don‚Äôt fit that qualification ‚Äî that is normal. No one will ever fill the place of universally loved and adored and perfect. Women are not a monolith, men aren‚Äôt a monolith. If someone isn‚Äôt your preference, or you‚Äôre not someone else‚Äôs preference, that is as normal as the sun rising. Moving on from that is *key*. There will always be people who find you unattractive. There will always be people who do find you attractive. The former group is, simply, people you don‚Äôt need to spend time on. 
			
			This was a RAMBLE, I‚Äôm so sorry! I‚Äôve done talks and speeches on this before so I always go overboard haha.

	The alternative to feed them is instead of reducing women's rights; we must take power from the people who control our society.

	They engineered the conditions that keep you tired, lonely, and broke for a couple of bucks. Dont blame women. Blame fat cats in suits. Blame billionaires.

	I draw the parallels due to the ability to tap into anger. Both seek to answer the same question. One blames women (fellow workers), the other blames the class that profits from the material conditions that create the atomization and loneliness.

	The left has provided a counter.  It's called "patriarchy hurts men too".  It has provided a vision of healthy masculinity - using their male privilege to stand up for the suffering, the marginalized, the oppressed in our society, and developing their own talents and just themselves as individuals.  It is not the left's fault if cishet men refuse the necessary self-introspection and consideration to see the left's point of view and instead fall for the carnival barkers on the right.  Feminism is here to stay, and they will simply have to adjust.

	Patriarchy hurts men on the individual level - by saying they need to suppress their feelings, be stoic, tough, never show vulnerability, etc.  It paints them as powerful yet dangerous, and therefore unsuitable for "caring" professions or nurturing children.  It says the ultimate goal of life is domination - "winning".  These expectations squeeze the humanity right out of them.   It tells them women are less than - and while they can bask in their privilege it doesn't do wonders to one's personality to regard half of humanity as less than human.  And now it hurts men on the societal level by failing to deliver on its promises - patriarchal expectations still exist but the rewards no longer do - you aren't guaranteed a decent job with just a HS education and you certainly aren't guaranteed a relationship and sex.  But these are of course self-inflicted - the former problem is the direct result of the neoliberal economic policies these men support, and the latter problem is simply a lack of self-introspection: no one is guaranteed these things, and patriarchy was lying to them by pretending to promise them.

	And there is a crying need for people to help marginalized people of all types: disabled children, trans children, homeless, BIPOC people, etc. in many capacities.  Taking on a bullshit corporate job is a personal choice.  But there are plenty of men that are doing these things, and their job satisfaction is just so much higher.

	As far as I can see, these young men don't feel left behind, they're just latching onto the first thing that appeals to their feelings; which is usually reactionary nonsense. Without sitting them down and giving them a clip, I'm not sure what anyone else can do when they're not helping themselves. And let's be real, there's some real common traits between these 'left behind' folks that predispose them to entitled, impatient and self-important attitudes.

	Helping those kids is going to take a very find scalpel, and I just don't know if it's worth the time and resources to focus on. There are already good role models, it's up to them to seek them.

	Maybe we could iron-clad our arguments and come to a strict consensus on exactly what we mean, policing the living hell out of our own speech and sanitising it to a point where the right-wing microbes die of starvation, but that's a damn difficult task. Lefties tend to be very, well, multi-everything by our very nature.

		Because the onus remains on men to be the ones to make the first move and approach women, they are the ones who suffer the most *in this very specific* situation. 
		
		But like I think the problem is the atomisation and lack of empathy combined with gender ideals. 
		
		So for me the fix is more simple. More social society, less rigid expectations, less loneliness. 
		
		I think the only issue I think is immediately fixable is just empathy, more empathy for everyone. I find it somewhat difficult for a people‚Äôs who‚Äôs politics looks at systems and structures and their influence over individuals, and then say that a clearly very widespread statistical issue is just all individuals fault.

	Your argument seems to be that the left doesn‚Äôt provide specific, tentpole examples of being a ‚Äúgood man‚Äù for young men to model themselves after. Seeing as the vast majority of politicians including every president the US has ever had (I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre American) has been a man that‚Äôs pretty bold. Obviously these men are extremely fallible, but if you‚Äôre looking for Superman to sweep in from Kansas and teach boys how to be men in some simple 12 step program it simply isn‚Äôt going to happen. 

	Growing up is hard. Being a good person to any degree is hard, regardless of gender or race or sexuality. It‚Äôs not like anyone else on the left has specific examples to model themselves after- everyone is doing their best with what they have and trying NOT to put anyone too high on a pedestal because it rarely ends well. Young men have to decide who they want to be and then work towards it. Like everyone else. 

	The idea they‚Äôre being left behind by society is, in my opinion, based a lot more on the emotional and moral laziness of a group of people that are historically used to having everything specifically catered to them, and when the opportunity got spread around a tiny bit more some (not all, honestly a vocal minority) men responded with anger and resentment instead of adapting. They‚Äôre holdouts of a time that, with any luck, isn‚Äôt coming back. So could men do with better role models? Absolutely. But why is that the job of a political party, especially one that does not provide that service to anyone else?

	I think the crux of this problem is that the solution is often complex and it takes a lot of work combined with painful introspection.

	People like Bannon, Jordan Peterson and others are spewing out answers that are much easier to digest. They're wrong answers but they're easier to understand and digest
