This **history of central banking in the United States** encompasses various [bank regulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_regulation_in_the_United_States "Bank regulation in the United States"), from early [wildcat banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcat_banking "Wildcat banking") practices through the present [Federal Reserve System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System "Federal Reserve System").

### Bank of North America\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_central_banking_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Bank of North America")\]

Some [Founding Fathers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States "Founding Fathers of the United States") were strongly opposed to the formation of a national banking system; the fact that England tried to place the colonies under the monetary control of the [Bank of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England "Bank of England") was seen by many as the "last straw"<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability"><span title="The material near this tag needs to be fact-checked with the cited source(s). (May 2014)">verification needed</span></a></i>]</sup> of oppression which led directly to the [American Revolutionary War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War "American Revolutionary War").<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (February 2016)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

Others were strongly in favor of a national bank. [Robert Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Morris_(financier) "Robert Morris (financier)"), as Superintendent of Finance, helped to open the [Bank of North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_North_America "Bank of North America") in 1782, and has been accordingly called by [Thomas Goddard](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thomas_H._Goddard&action=edit&redlink=1 "Thomas H. Goddard (page does not exist)") "the father of the system of credit and paper circulation in the United States".<sup id="cite_ref-:0_1-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_central_banking_in_the_United_States#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</a></sup> As ratification in early 1781 of the [Articles of Confederation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation "Articles of Confederation") had extended to [Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress "United States Congress") the sovereign power to generate [bills of credit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_banking_in_the_United_States#Early_attempts_to_create_a_national_bank "History of banking in the United States"), it passed later that year an ordinance to incorporate a privately subscribed national bank following in the footsteps of the Bank of England. However, it was thwarted in fulfilling its intended role as a nationwide national bank due to objections of "alarming foreign influence and fictitious credit",<sup id="cite_ref-:0_1-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_central_banking_in_the_United_States#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</a></sup> favoritism to foreigners and unfair policies against less corrupt state banks issuing their own notes, such that Pennsylvania's legislature repealed its charter to operate within the Commonwealth in 1785.

### First Bank of the United States\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_central_banking_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: First Bank of the United States")\]

In 1791, former Morris aide and chief advocate for Northern mercantile interests, [Alexander Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton "Alexander Hamilton"), the [Secretary of the Treasury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_the_Treasury "Secretary of the Treasury"), accepted a [compromise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise_of_1790 "Compromise of 1790") with the Southern lawmakers to ensure the continuation of Morris's Bank project; in exchange for support by the South for a national bank, Hamilton agreed to ensure sufficient support to have the national or federal capitol moved from its temporary _Northern_ location, [New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York,_New_York "New York, New York"), to a "Southern" location on the [Potomac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potomac_River "Potomac River"). As a result, the [First Bank of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Bank_of_the_United_States "First Bank of the United States") (1791–1811) was chartered by Congress within the year and signed by [George Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington "George Washington") soon after. The First Bank of the United States was modeled after the [Bank of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England "Bank of England") and differed in many ways from today's [central banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank "Central bank"). For example, it was partly owned by foreigners, who shared in its profits. Also, it was not solely responsible for the country's supply of [bank notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_banking_in_the_United_States#1837%E2%80%931863:_%22Free_Banking%22_Era "History of banking in the United States"). It was responsible for only 20% of the currency supply; state banks accounted for the rest. Several founding fathers bitterly opposed the Bank. [Thomas Jefferson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson "Thomas Jefferson") saw it as an engine for speculation, financial manipulation, and corruption.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_central_banking_in_the_United_States#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> In 1811 its twenty-year charter expired and was not renewed by Congress. Absent the federally chartered bank, the next several years witnessed a proliferation of federally issued [Treasury Notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasury_Note_(19th_century) "Treasury Note (19th century)") to create credit as the government struggled to finance the [War of 1812](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812 "War of 1812"); a suspension of specie payment by most banks soon followed as well.

### Second Bank of the United States\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_central_banking_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Second Bank of the United States")\]

After five years, the federal government chartered its successor, the [Second Bank of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Bank_of_the_United_States "Second Bank of the United States") (1816–1836). [James Madison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison "James Madison") signed the charter with the intention of stopping runaway inflation that had plagued the country during the five-year interim. It was essentially a copy of the First Bank, with branches across the country. [Andrew Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jackson "Andrew Jackson"), who became president in 1829, denounced the bank as an engine of corruption. His destruction of the bank was a major political issue in the 1830s and shaped the [Second Party System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Party_System "Second Party System"), as Democrats in the states opposed banks and [Whigs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whig_Party_(United_States) "Whig Party (United States)") supported them. He was unable to get the bank dissolved, but refused to renew its charter. Jackson attempted to counteract this by executive order requiring all federal land payments to be made in gold or silver, in accordance with his interpretation of [The Constitution of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Constitution_of_the_United_States "The Constitution of the United States"), which only gives Congress the power to "coin" money, not emit bills of credit.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_central_banking_in_the_United_States#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> The [Panic of 1837](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1837 "Panic of 1837") followed. The Bank then flatly denied a subpoena to examine its records and its chief, [Nicholas Biddle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Biddle "Nicholas Biddle"), bemusedly observed that it would be ironic if he went to prison "By the votes of members of Congress because I would not give up to their enemies their confidential letters".<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_central_banking_in_the_United_States#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> Despite congressional corruption, Biddle was eventually arrested and charged with fraud. The Bank's charter expired in 1836.

## 1837–1862: "Free banking" era\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_central_banking_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: 1837–1862: "Free banking" era")\]

In this period, only [state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._states "U.S. states")\-chartered banks existed. They could issue bank notes against specie ([gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold "Gold") and [silver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver "Silver") [coins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coins "Coins")) and the states heavily regulated their own [reserve requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_requirement "Reserve requirement"), [interest rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate "Interest rate") for [loans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan "Loan") and [deposits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposit_account "Deposit account"), the necessary [capital ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_ratio "Capital ratio") etc. These banks had existed since 1781, in parallel with the Banks of the United States. The [Michigan Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michigan_Act&action=edit&redlink=1 "Michigan Act (page does not exist)") (1837) allowed the automatic chartering of banks that would fulfill its requirements without special consent of the [state legislature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_legislature_(United_States) "State legislature (United States)"). This legislation made creating unstable banks easier by lowering state supervision in states that adopted it. The real value of a bank bill was often lower than its face value, and the issuing bank's financial strength generally determined the size of the discount. By 1797 there were 24 chartered banks in the U.S.; with the beginning of the _free banking era_ (1837) there were 712.

Privately issued note, 1863

During the free banking era, the banks were short-lived compared to today's commercial banks, with an average lifespan of five years. About half of the banks failed, and about a third of which went out of business because they could not redeem their notes.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_central_banking_in_the_United_States#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> (See also "[Wildcat banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcat_banking "Wildcat banking")".)

During the free banking era, some local banks took over the functions of a central bank. In New York, the [New York Safety Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_York_Safety_Fund&action=edit&redlink=1 "New York Safety Fund (page does not exist)") provided deposit insurance for member banks. In [Boston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston "Boston"), the [Suffolk Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffolk_Bank "Suffolk Bank") guaranteed that bank notes would trade at near par value, and acted as a private bank note [clearinghouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearing_house_(finance) "Clearing house (finance)").<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

## 1863–1913: National banks\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_central_banking_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: 1863–1913: National banks")\]

The [National Banking Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Banking_Act "National Banking Act") of 1863, besides providing loans in the [Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War "American Civil War") effort of the [Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War) "Union (American Civil War)"), included provisions:

-   To create a system of [national banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_bank_(United_States) "National bank (United States)"). They were to have higher standards concerning reserves and business practices than [state banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_bank_(United_States) "State bank (United States)"). Recent research indicates that state monopoly banks had the lowest long run survival rates.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_central_banking_in_the_United_States#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> The office of [Comptroller of the Currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comptroller_of_the_Currency "Comptroller of the Currency") was created to supervise these banks.
-   To create a uniform national [currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency "Currency"). To achieve this, all national banks were required to accept each other's currencies at par value. This eliminated the risk of loss in case of bank default. The notes were printed by the Comptroller of the Currency to ensure uniform quality and prevent [counterfeiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterfeiting "Counterfeiting").
-   To finance the war, national banks were required to secure their notes by holding [Treasury securities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasury_security "Treasury security"), enlarging the market<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vagueness" title="Wikipedia:Vagueness"><span title="This information is too vague. (November 2016)">vague</span></a></i>]</sup> and raising its<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vagueness" title="Wikipedia:Vagueness"><span title="This information is too vague. (November 2016)">vague</span></a></i>]</sup> liquidity.

As described by [Gresham's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_Law "Gresham's Law"), soon bad money from state banks drove out the new, good money;<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (May 2017)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> the government imposed a 10% tax on state bank bills, forcing most banks to convert to national banks. By 1865, there were already 1,500 national banks. In 1870, 1,638 national banks stood against only 325 state banks. The tax led in the 1880s and 1890s to the creation and adoption of [checking accounts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checking_account "Checking account"). By the 1890s, 90% of the money supply was in checking accounts. State banking had made a comeback.

Two problems still remained in the banking sector.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (May 2017)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> The first was the requirement to back up the currency with treasuries. When the [treasuries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security "United States Treasury security") fluctuated in value, [banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank "Bank") had to recall [loans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan "Loan") or borrow from other banks or [clearinghouses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearing_house_(finance) "Clearing house (finance)"). The second problem was that the system created seasonal liquidity spikes. A rural bank had [deposit accounts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposit_account "Deposit account") at a larger bank, that it withdrew from when the need for funds was highest, e.g., in the planting season. When combined liquidity demands were too big, the bank again had to find a [lender of last resort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lender_of_last_resort "Lender of last resort").<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (May 2017)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

These liquidity crises led to [bank runs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_run "Bank run"), causing severe disruptions and depressions, the worst of which was the [Panic of 1907](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1907 "Panic of 1907").<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (May 2017)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

National banks issued [National Bank Notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Bank_Note "National Bank Note") as currency. Because they were uniformly backed by US government debt, they generally traded at comparable values in contrast to the notes issued during the Free Banking era in which notes from different banks could have significantly different values. National bank notes were not however "lawful tender", and could not be used as bank reserves under the National Bank Act. The Federal government issued [greenbacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_dollar "US dollar") which fulfilled this role along with gold.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_central_banking_in_the_United_States#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>

Congress suspended the gold standard in 1861 early in the Civil War and began issuing paper currency (greenbacks). The federally issued greenbacks were gradually supposed to be eliminated in favor of national bank notes after the [Specie Payment Resumption Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specie_Payment_Resumption_Act "Specie Payment Resumption Act") of 1875 was passed. However, the elimination of the greenbacks was suspended in 1878 and the notes remained in circulation. Federal debt throughout the period continued to be paid in gold. In 1879, the United States had returned to the [gold standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard "Gold standard"), and all currency could be redeemed in gold.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_central_banking_in_the_United_States#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>

### Panic of 1907 alarms bankers\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_central_banking_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Panic of 1907 alarms bankers")\]

Early in 1907, New York Times Annual Financial Review published [Paul Warburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Warburg "Paul Warburg")'s (a partner of [Kuhn, Loeb and Co.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuhn,_Loeb_and_Co. "Kuhn, Loeb and Co.")) first official reform plan, entitled "A Plan for a Modified Central Bank", in which he outlined remedies that he thought might avert panics. Early in 1907, [Jacob Schiff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Schiff "Jacob Schiff"), the [chief executive officer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer "Chief executive officer") of [Kuhn, Loeb and Co.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuhn,_Loeb_and_Co. "Kuhn, Loeb and Co."), in a speech to the [New York Chamber of Commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Chamber_of_Commerce "New York Chamber of Commerce"), warned that "unless we have a central bank with adequate control of credit resources, this country is going to undergo the most severe and far reaching money panic in its history."<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_central_banking_in_the_United_States#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> "The [Panic of 1907](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1907 "Panic of 1907")" hit full stride in October. \[Herrick\]

1908 cartoon arguing that an elastic currency is needed

Bankers felt the real problem was that the United States was the last major country without a central bank, which might provide stability and emergency credit in times of financial crisis. While segments of the financial community were worried about the power that had accrued to [JP Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JP_Morgan "JP Morgan") and other financiers, most were more concerned about the general frailty of a vast, decentralized banking system that could not regulate itself without the extraordinary intervention of one man. Financial leaders who advocated a central bank with an elastic currency after the [Panic of 1907](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1907 "Panic of 1907") included [Frank Vanderlip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Vanderlip "Frank Vanderlip"), [Myron T. Herrick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myron_T._Herrick "Myron T. Herrick"), [William Barret Ridgely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Barret_Ridgely "William Barret Ridgely"), [George E. Roberts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_E._Roberts "George E. Roberts"), [Isaac Newton Seligman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton_Seligman "Isaac Newton Seligman") and [Jacob H. Schiff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_H._Schiff "Jacob H. Schiff"). They stressed the need for an elastic money supply that could expand or contract as needed. After the scare of 1907 the bankers demanded reform; the next year, Congress established a commission of experts to come up with a nonpartisan solution.

### Aldrich Plan\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_central_banking_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Aldrich Plan")\]

Rhode Island Senator [Nelson Aldrich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Aldrich "Nelson Aldrich"), the Republican leader in the Senate, ran the Commission personally, with the aid of a team of economists. They went to Europe and were impressed with how the central banks in Britain and Germany appeared to handle the stabilization of the overall economy and the promotion of international trade. Aldrich's investigation led to his plan in 1912 to bring central banking to the United States, with promises of financial stability, expanded international roles, control by impartial experts and no political meddling in finance. Aldrich asserted that a central bank had to be, paradoxically, decentralized somehow, or it would be attacked by local politicians and bankers as had the First and Second Banks of the United States. The Aldrich plan was introduced in the 62nd and 63rd Congresses (1912 and 1913) but never gained much traction as the Democrats in 1912 won control of both the House and the Senate as well as the White House.

Woodrow Wilson signs bill creating the Federal Reserve System, December 24, 1913

### A regional Federal Reserve system\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_central_banking_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: A regional Federal Reserve system")\]

The new President, Woodrow Wilson, then became the principal mover for banking and currency reform in the 63rd Congress, working with the two chairs of the House and Senate Banking and Currency Committees, Rep. [Carter Glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Glass "Carter Glass") of Virginia and Sen. Robert L. Owen of Oklahoma. It was Wilson who insisted that the regional Federal Reserve banks be controlled by a central Federal Reserve Board appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate.

### Agrarian demands partly met\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_central_banking_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Agrarian demands partly met")\]

[William Jennings Bryan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Jennings_Bryan "William Jennings Bryan"), now Secretary of State, long-time enemy of Wall Street and still a power in the Democratic Party, threatened to destroy the bill. Wilson came up with a compromise plan that pleased bankers and Bryan alike. The Bryanites were happy that Federal Reserve currency became liabilities of the government rather than of private banks—a symbolic change—and by provisions for federal loans to farmers. The Bryanite demand to prohibit interlocking directorates did not pass. Wilson convinced the anti-bank Congressmen that because Federal Reserve notes were obligations of the government, the plan fit their demands. Wilson assured southerners and westerners that the system was decentralized into 12 districts, and thus would weaken New York City's Wall Street influence and strengthen the hinterlands. After much debate and many amendments, Congress passed the [Federal Reserve Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Act "Federal Reserve Act") or _Glass–Owen Act,_ as it was sometimes called at the time, in late 1913. President Wilson signed the Act into law on December 23, 1913.

## Since 1913: The Federal Reserve\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_central_banking_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Since 1913: The Federal Reserve")\]

The Federal Reserve System, also known as the Federal Reserve or simply as the Fed, is the central banking system of the United States today. The Federal Reserve's power developed slowly in part due to an understanding at its creation that it was to function primarily as a reserve, a money-creator of last resort to prevent the downward spiral of withdrawal/withholding of funds which characterizes a monetary panic. At the outbreak of [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I"), the Federal Reserve was better positioned than the [United States Department of the Treasury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury "United States Department of the Treasury") to issue [war bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_bond "War bond"), and so became the primary retailer for war bonds under the direction of the Treasury. After the war, the Federal Reserve, led by Paul Warburg and New York Governor Bank President [Benjamin Strong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Strong_Jr. "Benjamin Strong Jr."), convinced Congress to modify its powers, giving it the ability to both create money, as the 1913 Act intended, and destroy money, as a central bank could.

During the 1920s, the Federal Reserve experimented with a number of approaches, alternatively creating and then destroying money which, in the eyes of [Milton Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman "Milton Friedman"), helped create the late-1920s [stock market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market "Stock market") bubble and the [Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression "Great Depression").<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_central_banking_in_the_United_States#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>

After [Franklin D. Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt "Franklin D. Roosevelt") took office in 1933, the Federal Reserve was subordinated to the [Executive Branch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Branch "Executive Branch"), where it remained until 1951, when the Federal Reserve and the Treasury department signed an [accord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1951_Accord "1951 Accord") granting the Federal Reserve full independence over monetary matters while leaving fiscal matters to the Treasury.

The Federal Reserve's monetary powers did not dramatically change for the rest of the 20th century, but in the 1970s it was specifically charged by Congress to effectively promote "the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates" as well as given regulatory responsibility over many consumer credit protection laws.

Since the [Global Financial Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008 "Financial crisis of 2007–2008"), central banks globally (including the Federal Reserve) have implemented several experimental [Unconventional Monetary Policy Tools (UMPS)](https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2018/december/review-of-unconventional-monetary-policy/) in order to achieve their monetary policy objectives.
