## Visualizing the American Workforce as 100 People

In 2022, the U.S. population stood at **333 million**. Of that, roughly 60% [were employed](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2022/employment-population-ratio-at-60-0-percent-in-july-2022.htm) in various jobs, positions, and sectors in the U.S. economy.

But where did all these people work? What jobs did they do and what positions did they hold? Where do most Americans do their nine-to-five?

Using [data](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm) from the National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates (2022) put out by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), we reimagine the employed American workforce as only 100 people, to find out answers.

Interestingly, the data contains a mix of information demarcations. Some are job-specific (type of work), some are based on position (like Management), and some are broken down by industry (Transport and Health).

## The Most Common Jobs In the U.S.

By far, most of the American workforce (13 out of 100) are employed in **Office & Administrative** work. This includes a mind-boggling variety of jobs: receptionists, payroll clerks, secretaries, proof-readers, administrative assistants, and customer service representatives to name a few.

Notably, any sort of management role is absent from this, as well as any other job categories, since the BLS categorizes managers in their own class.

The industry which employs the second largest group of people is **Health**, accounting for 11 people from the 100. This category is a combination of two sectors listed in the original dataset (healthcare practitioners and healthcare support) and covers the entire industry: from physicians, surgeons, veterinarians, nurses, and therapists to technicians, assistants, orderlies, and home and personal care aides.

Here’s a quick look at all the major sectors most of America’s workforce actually works in.

Showing 1 to 7 of 21 entries

The third most common job is actually a tie between **Transport**—cargo moving workers, pilots, truck drivers—and **Sales**—retail and industry sales agents, counter clerks—with both sectors employing nine of the 100 people. In the Sales category, two of the nine people are cashiers.

Ranked fifth is **Food**, with eight people, ranging from private chefs to serving staff at fast food restaurants.

Another six all belong in some kind of **Management** role (across industry, and including legislators) with two of those six being “top level executives” like a CEO, a general manager, a mayor, or university president. Management shares its spot with Business & Finance, Manufacturing, and Education, all at six each.

The following jobs or industries also employ the same number of people:

-   Construction & Extraction along with Mechanics & Installation, at **four** each.
-   Data & Tech, with Custodial jobs, with **three** each.
-   Protection, Hospitality, Architecture & Engineering, and Social work, all at **two** each.
-   Artists & Athletes, Scientists, Legal, and Farming, Fishing & Forestry are all **one** each.

## Quirks of the Job Data

From the numbers, some fascinating nuances of the American workforce are revealed. For example, there are more cashiers (2) in the economy than artists, writers, designers & athletes (1). There are the same number of customer service representatives as the entire Scientific and Legal fields put together (2).

But perhaps the most interesting quirk comes from how few people are employed in the **Farming, Fishing & Forestry** industry, a critical primary sector. In raw data, the BLS estimates only slightly more than 450,000 farm, fish & forestry workers.

Importantly, it’s worth noting the BLS only collects data from “nonfarm” establishments, explaining the low estimate for their category, which is almost **one-sixth** of what the USDA estimates. Please see the data note at the end of this article for a full explanation.

## Which Jobs Have the Highest Wages in the U.S.?

Meanwhile, the top 20 highest paid jobs (by annual average wages) **all belong to doctors** (usually specialists or surgeons), with two exceptions: CEOs and athletes.

The lowest-paid jobs are a mix of entertainers, and service and retail staff.

As a broader category, however, **Management** makes the most money, followed by Legal and then Tech. Workers in Food, Health Support, and Custodial jobs have the lowest wages.

Analyzing the data throws up a few correlations between number of employees and wages. The top three sectors with the most jobs (Admin, Transport, and Sales) are in the **bottom 10** categories when it comes to pay.

On the other hand, three sectors in the bottom 10 of employment numbers, (Data & Tech, Architecture & Engineering, and Legal) are in the **top five** highest paid sectors.

The **Health sector** sees a big divide in pay between practitioners (doctors, nurses, therapists) ranked 5th and support staff (assistants, aides, & orderlies), ranked 21st, or second-to-last.

## How is the American Workforce Changing?

Over the last five years, the American workforce has not stayed static. Of the listed 22 groups, 13 saw [growth](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-20-fastest-growing-jobs-in-the-next-decade/) in employment numbers, nine saw a decrease, and one stayed flat since 2018.

![[3adbf67beea16fcd2d0244fcdd106397_MD5]]

The top gainer by far is **Health Support** (medical assistants, care aides, orderlies, etc.) which grew by 65%. Looking at the timeline of growth does not paint a steady picture: employment jumped between 2018 and 2019, briefly fell in 2020, and has since risen again in 2021-2022.

Another top gainer is **Transport**, rising from the 4th to 3rd biggest employer, beating out Sales in 2022. Business & Finance and Management have also seen steady increases since 2018.

On the other hand **Hospitality** saw a staggering 48% drop in numbers, not all together surprising given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the rise of tech companies like Airbnb.

Meanwhile, **Office & Admin** work saw a 15% loss in employees, even though this category is still the biggest employer in the country by a significant margin. Although jobs in this group saw steady declines from 2018-2021, it registered a slight uptick in workers between 2021 and 2022.

Here’s a full list of top-level sectors and how they changed.

Looking ahead, questions about the future of the American workforce loom large, especially in the [wake of the AI revolution](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/generative-ai-explained-by-ai/) that has swept imaginations, and quite possibly, soon the economy. People who hold administrative jobs—the largest category—are most vulnerable since many office tasks can be automated with increasingly sophisticated AI tools.

Will AI be as dominating a factor as the Industrial Revolution on the global economy? Will it cause as big a shift as the offshoring of manufacturing from the U.S.?

Or will AI blend seamlessly into the current make-up of the American workforce, merely enhancing productivity and profit?

**Data note 1:** Categories from the original data were modified slightly for better readability. Some have been renamed all together. They are:

-   Production, listed as **Manufacturing**.
-   Installation, maintenance and repair, listed as **Mechanics & Installation**.
-   Computer and mathematical operations, listed as **Data & tech.**
-   Building and groundskeeping, listed as **Custodial.**
-   Personal care and service, listed as **Hospitality.**
-   Life, physical, social science, listed as **Science.**

**Data note #2:** OES data is a combination of surveys conducted by the BLS and estimates are produced for over 800 jobs in the country. The survey collects occupational employment and wage data from establishments **in nonfarm industries only** and doesn’t survey the following: Crop production, Animal production, Timber tract operations, Forest nurseries & gathering of forest products, Fishing, hunting, and trapping, Forestry support activities, and Private households.

The survey also does not cover the **self-employed, owners and partners in unincorporated firms, household workers, or unpaid family workers**.

**Data note #3:** On the calculating end, due to rounding of each category and the 100 workers total, some categories can have slightly more or less workers, depending on the method use. In 2022, both Management and Business & Finance employment can be rounded up to 7 workers each. On the other hand, Farm, Fishing and Forestry can be rounded down to 0. Our rounding was done to provide as wide a scope of the economy as possible, while also maintaining accuracy.

Finally, percentage change in employment per sector was not adjusted for general population or employment growth from 2018 to 2022.
