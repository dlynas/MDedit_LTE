<table><tbody><tr><td>W:</td><td>&nbsp;Words *MAKING RESPONSIBLE FINANCIAL DECISIONS* will be on board for entire unit to keep the big idea relevant.&nbsp; Students will write it on their folders designated for the unit as well.&nbsp; Group discussion on consequences of irresponsible financial decisions will be held as well as rewards of responsible financial decisions.&nbsp; Performance task is unveiled as a simulation involving: budgeting for a month as an adult assigned a job and respective salary, paying various bills, and dealing with whatever life throws at them along the way (illness, accidents, lottery winnings, birthdays, holidays, etc).&nbsp; The final expectation will be for students to write a reflective paper about their experiences with the unit and create a collage to visually represent their month of financial independence.</td></tr><tr><td>H:</td><td>&nbsp;Ask students, do you want to live with your parent’s decisions your whole life or be able to make you own and live independently?&nbsp; Students who complete their work and stay out of debt will go to an “Office Party” on the last day of the unit.</td></tr><tr><td>E:</td><td>&nbsp;Mini lessons on topics such as salary, budgeting, leases/rent/mortgages, loans, health insurance, unions, checking accounts, savings accounts, interest, paying bills, etc. will occur throughout the week long unit.&nbsp; Simulation work such as paying bills, dealing with life problems (car accident, health problem), renting apartments, and procuring insurance will occur after each respective mini lesson daily.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>R:</td><td>&nbsp;<p>Whole class discussion about how to make responsible financial decisions based on your income, expenses, and budget.&nbsp; Think-pair-share amongst students who made different choices (buy car vs. take public transportation) and their reasoning behind their decisions will occur.&nbsp; Writing in daily reflection journal about decisions made in the simulation that day will also occur.<strong></strong></p></td></tr><tr><td>E:</td><td>&nbsp;Students will individually read journal entries to class and provide constructive criticism on that student’s financial decisions.&nbsp; Students will one another’s drafts of reflection essays and complete peer edits, and refer to rubric in order to compare their current standing to their goal/my expectations.</td></tr><tr><td>T:</td><td>&nbsp;<p>Mini lessons before simulation work include group readings and questioning, mini lectures, videos, group work, and graphic organizers<strong></strong></p></td></tr><tr><td>O:</td><td>&nbsp;Teacher led mini-lessons on budgeted items such as insurance, rent, and car payments are followed by students making their own financial decisions on those topics based on their budget, income, and expenses.&nbsp; They will complete portions of the simulation each day and reflect in their journal daily.</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Instructional Procedures

Mini lessons on topics such as salary, budgeting, leases/rent/mortgages, loans, health insurance, unions, checking accounts, savings accounts, interest, paying bills, etc. will occur throughout the week long unit.  Simulation work such as paying bills, dealing with life problems (car accident, health problem), renting apartments, and procuring insurance will occur after each respective mini lesson daily.  

Whole class discussion about how to make responsible financial decisions based on your income, expenses, and budget.  Think-pair-share amongst students who made different choices (buy car vs. take public transportation) and their reasoning behind their decisions will occur.  Writing in daily reflection journal about decisions made in the simulation that day will also occur.

Students will individually read journal entries to class and provide constructive criticism on that student’s financial decisions.  Students will one another’s drafts of reflection essays and complete peer edits, and refer to rubric in order to compare their current standing to their goal/my expectations.
