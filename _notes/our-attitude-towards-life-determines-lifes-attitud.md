"On my best days, I know exactly who I am.
Let's say there's a certain day where,
again, most of this stuff is internal,
but a certain thought crosses my head
that feels like it is, like if I could chip
on my shoulder about something.
I've learned to really mitigate that,
shake the chip off,
because I've learned that that doesn't do anyone any good,
definitely doesn't do me any good.
Where I am now is the understanding
that I am a very powerful and important source
of energy in human form,
but I'm also like, things are not that deep sometimes.
You can just chill.
I don't have to take myself all that seriously every day.
You know what I mean?
That part's hard.
It's harder than it sounds.
Especially when you've made your artistic pursuit
something that has a lot of weight to it,
and that meaning is something that I believe is profound.
But, you know, and making this album
is really what did it for me, man.
It has to be fun, too."
