## YSK: There are two costs to everything

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/1bntqso/ysk_there_are_two_costs_to_everything/](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/1bntqso/ysk_there_are_two_costs_to_everything/)

> Why YSK:  The costs for any purchase can affect your long term financial condition.  The two costs are: the purchase cost and the maintenance cost.  Any purchase you make, you should ask yourself: Can I afford to buy this?  And further: Can I afford to keep this?
  
> 
  
> Like it or not, fair or not, there are different tiers of lifestyle.  The tier you belong to is the one that is supported by your recurring income.  Having a windfall of any reasonable magnitude does not elevate you to a higher lifestyle tier.  There are countless examples of how you can outpurchase your current lifestyle.
  
> 
  
> A Corvette will cost more than a Camero in purchase price, but also in gas, insurance, tires, and maintenance.
  
> 
  
> A 5 bedroom house will cost more than a 3 bedroom in heating/cooling, insurance, taxes, cleaning, and maintenance – expenses that do not end.
  
> 
  
> A mechanical Rolex watch will cost more than a quartz Seiko due to required maintenance and service – unless you want the timepiece to lose its value.
  
> 
  
> This also applies to business transactions.  You can purchase a website with many additional features, but can you afford the staff that will need to maintain those features?  You can afford a bigger storefront, but can you keep it stocked?
  
> 
  
> If you purchase things beyond your pay grade, they simply become anchors that drain you of the available funds for basic necessities.  If you instead place your windfall in an income producing investment, you permanently increase your recurring incoming and thus raise yourself to a higher lifestyle tier.

	The opposite can be true to a degree. Investing in a good set of tools and taking time to learn how to fix your belongings can save thousands of dollars in a few years. 

	Edit: not to say this is a permanent or all encompassing countermeasure. Merely that certain things decrease future costs.

			Unless you're a requisite motorhead, you can get the most fun from a small (car-top-able) sailboat.  So quiet you can sneak up on wildlife for excellent views.  Can be stable (on inland waters, i.e., no significant waves) in gale-force winds -- in which you'll be flying along.  Great fun.

		You're likely being facetious and people are likewise trying to be funny in the replies, but it is an important question and should be taken seriously.
		
		There are significant future cost to a tube of Pringles.
		
		You have a set budget of calories you can to eat in a day. If you eat more than that, you get fat. If you eat within your calorie budget, you won't get fat, but if a significant portion of that is nutritionally poor junk like Pringles, you're not getting enough nutrients you need, so you're getting unhealthier in other ways, both of which leads to increased medical costs and overall reduced quality of life.

	Live close to a repo yard.  The number of almost new campers, motor homes, newer vehicles, motorcycles, etc. is crazy.  One stumble on your income (kid needs braces, dog got hit by a car, fridge broke, car needs a new transmission, cost cutting company lays you off) and it's off to the repo yard where you never get it back, your credit is in shambles. Their dumpster is always overflowing with everything that was in those because once they hook them and tow them, you get nothing back.

		It does kind of depend. If you can't afford buying the expensive thing twice you probably can't afford buying the cheap variant ten times either- and for necessities, that's the alternative. If the higher expense cuts maintenance costs, like a good pair of shoes lasting decades vs a cheap one lasting months, it might be worth it anyways.

	I just wanna throw a really quick example of this out there that most people are already aware of:

	Inkjet printers.

	Oh is that printer on sale for $39.99 and AND it comes with free ink?

	Too bad that ink is going to last you a whopping 5 prints. Also the printer will periodically "clean" itself wasting electricity and ink as well. Also you can't print individual colours without having ALL the colours refilled at all times. Also each individual cartridge costs $50.

	Oh, and it'll still only last you 5 prints. Enjoy!

* 🟩 **[sailingosprey](https://www.reddit.com/user/sailingosprey)** ⬆️ 5 _(2024-03-26 08:16:43)_

* 🟩 **[AlcoholPrep](https://www.reddit.com/user/AlcoholPrep)** ⬆️ 4 _(2024-03-26 11:59:08)_

	"The costs for any purchase can affect your long term financial condition. The two costs are: the purchase cost and the maintenance cost. Any purchase you make, you should ask yourself: Can I afford to buy this? And further: Can I afford to keep this?"

	Excellent advice.

	However, if you're an oil refinery or the like, the real issue becomes, "Whose budget has to come across with this money -- mine or someone else's?"  True story:  Some major business build a plant like an oil refinery with lots of pipes and valves.  The valves were all welded in -- no bolted flanges to provide for changing out bad valves.   When valves ultimately started failing, the repair crew had to cut out the valves, weld in flanges, and install flanged valves.  "Why not just build the plant with flanged valves in the first place?" I hear you ask.  Well, the welded valves kept the costs down for construction and got the project approved in the first place.  Repair costs were on someone else's budget!

	While this situation will seldom if ever apply to an individual, the lesson is worth noting.

* 🟩 **[frockinbrock](https://www.reddit.com/user/frockinbrock)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-03-26 11:56:29)_

	I feel like this is a lesson I sort of learn every few years, even though it’s almost always part of my decision making.  

	It’s especially useful for the big purchases; a house, a vehicle, a boat.  

	  

	It made me really scale down the type of house I was looking for, and I’m really glad to have a reasonable payment since home insurance, taxes, electric, other upkeep have all doubled, tripled, or more since 2019.   

	I highly recommend a good budgeting app and become an expert at your income and finances before a large purchase. I personally now use Monarch and I’ve been very happy with it, I can map out future budgets and include a buffer for the unexpected.  

	  

	Even having done that, I never expected the other required costs to go up the way they have the past 3 years, so it’s worth being generous to your future self and making a very informed and difficult but realistic decision when buying today.

	The total of the two is often called "total cost of ownership". That's an important metric for big purchases, especially when the operating/maintenance costs are different.

	That's what makes electric car purchases make sense often, even with higher upfront costs, for example.

	This is a continued expression of the Theory of Karma. You get results based on your actions. If you extract results undeservedly, sacrifice is perforce taken from you by Nature as compensation. This simple phrase reminds us that there's always a cost associated with every decision we make and every action we take. Every opportunity comes with its own set of costs, whether they are monetary, emotional, or in terms of time. Every action we take, every decision we make, has a price.

	I don't think people ever really consider those maintenance costs. Sold parts for Dodge and some things were just crazy expensive. You could have either halogen or LED tail lights. If you need to replace the whole assembly it was either $80 or $300. A Hemi requires 16 platinum spark plugs. The diesels had 2 fuel filters that were expensive just individually. The rear break pads on a Promaster were $300 because they had a sensor in them. The HID bulbs for projection headlights, $300. Hell, there is a generation of Dodge pickups where everything is ran through the TIPM (fuse box under the hood.) If your blinker stopped working it wasn't a $2 relay that needed replaced, the TIPM needed replaced for around $1200. 

	Finding all the hidden costs of a vehicle before you purchase is no joke. Owners manuals have maintenance schedules in the back. Look up all the parts it talks about plus any commonly damaged components (lamp assembly, mirror, windshield) and make sure they are reasonably priced.

	This is generally good advice but I disagree about the "everything" part. The vast majority of consumer purchases that almost all normal people make are items that will not be maintained. They will wear out and then be replaced. How long that takes should definitely be a consideration.

	For most people, the only purchases they will make in their lives where this should be considered are cars and homes.
