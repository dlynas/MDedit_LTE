	Organize. Two avenues: workplace and your house. The goal is to seize the land, and the means of production. 

	If you dont have a union at your workplace, just talking to other workers to build a community is an important first step. You can talk about the grievances, benefits, etc.

	You also got to organize around your house/local community. Check if there are already any organizations/ngo's working on it. I also struggle with this since I'm a forever renter and the bourgeoisie system has ensured (with their layoffs) that I don't stay at the same place long enough to do any meaningful contribution.

	Once your start talking about it/organizing, the goal is to have comrades (your coworkers and your neighbors) having each others backs against the establishment. You got to find common goals to work towards and in the case of contentions against landlords/bosses you got to back up each other. 

	Now, this is easier said than done. Especially with rampant unemployment in this economy, unless you are middle manager/labor aristocrat, most proletariats are forced to shuffle jobs every 1-2 years. But we got to try.

	There are some online resources you can find around union organizing, housing/homelessness in your neighborhoods, etc.

	Once you get the conversation going, share your success/failures here and we can try to build on those.

		I went through 4 weeks of labor organizing with a union shortly before becoming a manager and therefore no longer being technically eligible to organize a union. I never told anyone but I did meet a lot of my coworkers I might not normally have and heard about a lot of problems. I hope it’s caught on but I can’t tell. 
		
		In general there are a lot of good aspects of learning how to organize a workplace. It’s not about striking or whatever you see in movies or tv, that’s really just the last resort. It’s more about building relationships and solving problems together. 
		
		For neighborhood organizing there are so many options. Usually contingent on local issues. Is there a tenants union in your city? There’s one in mine and the cool thing about it is that it doesn’t matter if you move, fellow renters will help solve housing issues (usually slumlords / mass evictions) by working together. But it could be a lot of things: community fridges, food co-ops, working against destructive environmental issues like pipelines cutting through the neighborhood, waste incinerators in peoples’ backyards, setting up internet connectivity or digital literacy, language exchange programs, crumbling infrastructure, etc., organizing against groups trying to come into the community like the klan / Proud Boys / oathkeepers, etc. Just whatever makes the most sense and what people complain about the most in the neighborhood. 
		
		It’s just important to strike at the root. For instance, complaints about “graffiti” signify deeper issues. Fighting graffiti with buff squads and cops is counterproductive and further isolates creative youth who lack creative outlets.

		* 🟧 **[strike_slip_](https://www.reddit.com/user/strike_slip_)** ⬆️ 6 _(2024-03-24 16:21:23)_

			Someone who doesn't own the means of production but benefits from the exploitation of proletariat. Think of this as a class that the bourgeoisie has "bought off" to quell uprisings.

				This is the function, yeah. Another material way to look at it is that the proletariat have their surplus value stolen. In other words, they do not keep most of the value they create, and only a sliver of the excess is put back into pro social programs. Most of it is stolen by the ownership class as profit.
				
				A labor aristocrats ‘also’ works for a wage and does not own the means of production. But for whatever reason, they are paid the full value of their labor or close enough to it that they keep more in wage than their boss gets in profit. Meaning a worker cooperative or socialist model wouldn’t actually increase their take home. They already enjoy many of the benefits the revolution would give them.
				
				This is why the interests of one section of the working class can align with capital.
				
				On the flip-side are the lower portion of the petit bourgeoisie. These are usually small business owners or struggling farmers who, despite being part of the ownership class, have overlapping interests with the proletariat. But they rarely recognize these as they’ve been propagandized to identify with the bourgeoisie (even though they are the people the real bourgeoisie most readily cannibalize at the first opportunity.)
				
				So basically, the upper end of the working class share interests with the ruling class, and the lower end of the ownership class share interests with the workers.

			The modern internet exists to facilitate consumption, obfuscate information, and spy on you, its reason for its creation was as a military communications tool.  
			
			The internet is not a viable avenue for organizing, or creating the collective cohesiveness required for any kind of movement.  
			
			The revolution will not be televised (or live streamed, tweeted, or shared, you will not get a Facebook event invite to the revolution, the revolution will not be “just a prank, bro”, a cope, or cringe, the revolution will not feature subway surfers aired above it, accompanied by a speed up version of a popular early 00’s hit, the revolution will not be limited to 280 characters)

				hey thanks for engaging w me. My point of view is that we workers are facing a capitalist/imperialist power that is very much global and interconnected, apart being incredibly strong and resilient.
				To fight it with some chance to win, today in 2024, we ought to use what technology we can at our favour. I don't agree with your view of the internet, it's actually a pretty free and democratic technology, compared with others anyway. 
				it could be used to help with governance and decision making amongst comrades, so to be global too. One global socialist party

	In addition to organizing, building key structures to support and workers and people is crucial to allowing them greater leverage over ruling capital, ultimately forcing it to engage in a bloody civil war or to capitulate quietly.

	To explain this concept with an example: A prolonged general strike would deal a crippling blow to the ruling capital in the United States. What's stopping the workers there from engaging such a strike? Contrary to those who claim it's because workers in the imperial core have no class counsciousness, the majority of the American working class lives paycheck to paycheck and thus have no significant leverage against ruling capital because they would go hungry faster than ruling capital is willing to budge. Thus, to mitigate this issue, we would have to open community soup kitchens and gardens, out of control of the state or ruling capital to supply the workers and strikers with food so that they can outlast ruling capital in a general strike. This would also address several other issues in the United States as well (food deserts, malnutrition, etc.)

	Additionally, the structure of these community soup kitchens and gardens provides an important praxis experience that will be crucial in the post-capitalist world Americans will find themselves living in soon.

	History has shown us that any movement that is "revolutionary" in scope, that is set in motion by populist and/or extremist impulses, and then pushes the society it takes place within too swiftly and causes extreme disruption or displacement to existing frameworks is very likely to fail in achieving it's goals. 

	Get involved. In Ohio, the citizenry rose up and had a constitutional amendment passed over the issue of women's health care. "Revolution" sounds like a good idea, but slow change is more stable. This current younger generation is more informed than any generation before it. But that doesn't mean that apathy can't hurt the cause. Again - get involved.

* 🟩 **[fecal_doodoo](https://www.reddit.com/user/fecal_doodoo)** ⬆️ 7 _(2024-03-24 12:08:51)_

	Things are already in motion. True consciousness is raising within the working class more and more each day inside the imperial core, all while the intelligentsia/class collaborators/academia/revolutionary lumpen raise class consciousness from without. There is no stopping it, you just have to be ready for your moment when the time comes. We don't really get much say in our part in history at the end of the day. We step into our roles, and time keeps flowing.

	I imagine the turmoil in this year's election will kick it off to some extent. Outside forces are coming down to bear on the west as we speak. The people of the imperial core are going to have some decisions to make as far as who their enemy truly is. Will we unite against imperialist liberal forces (China Russia US)  while tackling our own ruling class in the heart of capital? Or will we fall to fascism and will that fascism spark a more militant left wing here in the core? 

	The proletariat in the west needs to rise and take their rightful place. America, and the tensions brewing has probably the best shot at sparking meaningful international revolution against the global bourgeois if the chips fall favorably.

			Yeah, organizing was *tough* in the Bush era. The birth of community fora was at once a boon but also a major hindrance to in-person organizing. The protests were fun but in my personal experience, my best initiatives came when my online community was able to surreptitiously plan real life operations. The roots of the occupy movement started in earnest around 2006 as we anticipated the financial crisis because we really had a lot of great minds coordinating on research. 
			
			I’m optimistic for the future. So much misinformation out there but young people are savvy and always getting better at figuring it out. All this data about Gen Alpha boys being more conservative misses the point in that they still make up a tiny percentage of that generation, counterbalanced by the leftism of the women.

	Organisation is the main one.  

	promote unionising and militancy within the union. the more the merrier as they say you want enough workers in that union to have solidarity so the bosses threats and tactics don’t scare them instead you scare the bosses. teach anyone you know about marxism DiaMat and other forms of thought and encourage them to unionise. 

	Also joining your nearest org or party. engage in protest and acts of activism. spread marxism as much as you can. once people start figuring out they’re being exploited it becomes much easier to make them open to marxist ideals. i’ve managed to convince a few of my friends who were formerly progressive liberals to become communists and join orgs. find out who’s active in your area if there isn’t anyone try and find likeminded individuals to create one together. find out where protests are and attend them usually there’ll be an org present.

	Without our participation capitalism will fail, it will collapse on itself. It's a faith based cult and a fragile house of cards.

	We should prepare ourselves emotionally and physically for armed defense, but the FIRST necessity for a revolution is to establish a robust network for food and medical care. We can make an alternative economy, capitalism can not compete with love.

	Many of us cling to our LARPing fantasies of armed rebellion but it's very possible violence will be minimal or unnecessary.

		We've heard the "Capitalism will collapse on itself" line since the days of Marx. In fact, so certain was Marx that the great Capitalist collapse would happen in his lifetime, he would read and discuss whatever the current economic crisis of the day was with a sense of borderline giddy excitement... It never happened.
		
		Capitalism, it seems, is quite a bit better at avoiding self-destruction than Marx has predicted. 
		Work has been done since the days of Marx, and we now understand that very often Capitalism will pivot in times of crisis, either to fascism or neoliberalism. Either they tighten the fist on the working class, or they loosen it.

	against a global capital and imperialism the revolution has to be global. The organisation of the revolution has to be global. Has also to follow democratic rules to take power or else you are fried on the spot. 

	The revolution need to find new ways of governance among marginalised communities and their allies around the globe and establish a global party. Then build national parties from the same global party and try to get seats like Galloway did in England. Because capitalism is at its ropes and more and more people even in our western countries feels not to defend the status quo anymore, you may win. If you been truthful and you showed some integrity along the way, you may keep winning.

	“To build a truly solid mass base requires an organization where workers can democratically exercise political direction over their own conditions — political councils made up exclusively of the working and oppressed classes. It is workers’ councils that provide the platform for revolutionary democratic control by the working class.

	This is where the efforts of a communist party become pivotal. It is the communist party, through the means of agitation, education, organization, and inoculation, which draws workers in and helps them to form workers’ councils.

	The communist party works tirelessly to build workers’ councils, which serve as the instrument of the workers' revolution. The party provides the political education needed to concentrate the revolutionary energy of the working class directly at the weak points of the capitalist state. Without this education, direction, and structure, the energy of the working class would be scattered and sporadic — leaving the revolution to the whims of spontaneity. Such disorganization is the short road to defeat.”

	"Bringing on the revolution" is done by a triggering event and it is difficult to say what that will be.  The 1905 revolution in Russia was brought on, if I remember correctly, by women demanding more bread and things escalated from that.  The events that triggered past revolutions in other countries were caused by the situations in *those* countries at *those* times.  The next ones will be different.

	But what turns such an event into an actual socialist revolution is having the knowledge and organization *already in place* in sufficient numbers to take advantage of the situation.  This is where education comes in.

	I don’t think radicals can “make” revolution happen. We should prepare for crisis as well as potential revolution.

	As I see it, revolutionaries need to do what we can subjectively to increase class self-organization, class independence, and class consciousness. 

	Then in crisis or war workers are able to more effectively fight to at least defend themselves and possibly towards duel power in severe crisis. And without external capitalist crisis, if there is enough class struggle and consciousness, the class movements become a crisis for capitalism in of itself and revolutionary defense or insurrections might take place.

	Probably not very satisfying to hear... that’s probably why lots of people tend to get drawn to shortcuts, dictators, insurrection larp-fantasy, reformism or just give in and retreat to fatalism.
