		Agreed, I feel like this is just cherry picked moments of the guy stuttering, they didn’t really show him explaining anything at all as seemed he was going to. Wouldn’t the answer to the question be “because printing money causes  inflation which is only bad when there’s too much of it and it isn’t leveraged properly.”

			Agreed.  And if you actually spend time learning about MMT in general or Stephanie Kelton in particular, it’s all nonsense.  
			
			Yes we know that printing money allows us to spend more but we are limited by inflation, as we have seen in the last few years.  There is no magic money cheat code.

					I agree with a lot of what you wrote but you seem to be talking past /[u/tall](https://www.reddit.com/user/tall)-log-1955/, who is also right. 
					
					The problem might be the phrase “magic money cheat code”, and how this phrase means something different to you than it does to Tall Log. 
					
					Tall Log seems to mean that there are consequences when you print money, and a balance needs to be maintained, whereas some people pretend that there are no consequences.
					
					I suspect that you’d agree with that.

				I don’t think thats the point… the point to me is that the US economy is actually beyond our control and basically its a pyramid scheme. People are so afraid of allowing growth to slow or even accept economic shrinkage that profit is in fact the driving force of our entire nation. 
				
				They think (probably incorrectly) that if the shark stops swimming forward it will die. 
				
				No one wants to be the politician who says “hey, everyone can only have one car, one or two houses, a new smartphone only every three years and your milk has to come in glass bottles”. Saving the country/world is a career killer. This is why i call it a pyramid scheme though I’m sure theres a better word.
				
				Ive been seeing a version of this in local politics of late. Hardly an old story but the city i live in has become very popular. The mayor has given huge incentives to businesses and builders to move/build here. Property taxes are going up, public services are shrinking, people are forced out. Quality of life has gone down for most, while city revenue has skyrocketed. This is considered a big success. Success in politics doesn’t stem from improving the quality of life of citizens, its tied to tax revenue. 
				
				This local example scales all the way up to the GDP. Personally I think even the way we measure the economy is just a way to hide the truth that all the money is flowing in one direction. This is a way to explain how “the economy is showing record growth” cab exist simultaneously with most people feeling like they have lower quality of life and less buying power.

				It would be a start for the magic money cheat if we the people get the interest of the lended money.
				
				A so called full money system.
				
				In the old times printing giral touchable money was also done. But it was borrowed by the central institution (king, FED, EZB, some institution). So the interest of ALL the capital went to the state.
				
				
				Now with untouchable fiscial money we still print some. But the majority is creates by bank subsidiary. We the people get over institutions only the security deposit of 3% (up to 10% for cash equivalents).
				
				So we only get the interest of 3% instead of 100%.
				
				Banks pocket in the 97% because we have a legal loophole that doesn't apply the giral money printing rules to the new fiscial digital money!
				
				
				That's the magic money cheat code - just that it's for bank and not the people.
				
				Swiss voted about the implementation last year, but the topic is not well understood how we get rug pulled.

				The value is representative tho. There are others to structure an economy. But they result in drabber choices for products. For example you have shitty cars meant for transportation not a barrier for interests in driving types. Houses would all look the same. There would be the same outfits everywhere. That is if society provided you with everything. There would not be competition to drive innovation.

				...Which is something the MMT economists have always acknowledged, as anyone who has actually spent any time learning about MMT or Stephanie Kelton would know.
				
				It's true that online MMT advocates often come at it with an annoying "this one neat trick" attitude, but it's pretty unfair to judge the theory based on its worst representatives. IMO the theory itself isn't even that groundbreaking. Kind of obvious, really, but I respect academics like Kelton for digging into the implications of it.

			It’s lent against the future size and value of the economy so that as long as the economy grows and expands the value of the daughter only drops a little bit as they balance against economy size and growth vs printed representative value of the dollar. But if you print faster than the economy grows or if your economy stops growing and you print at the same rate, the value of the daughter starts to drop in a curve instead of a straight steady hard to notice line. 
			
			It’s like what happens in a star. It’s value always collapses but not a big deal if there is fuel to push out against the collapse. But cut off the fuel and you will eventually collapse into a black hole. The fuel is the economy the surface is the value of money.

			Printing more money doesn’t inherently cause more inflation.   An increasing amount of academic research is being done into the idea that the government can print, then spend on tangible assets and not cause inflation. Lincoln did exactly that during the war, to a limited extent.  Borrowing is not inherently non-inflationary either.

				Yes but you have to remember, one man’s spending is another mans income. If more money is printed or spent then someone somewhere is earning more. That money needs to be properly distributed among the middle and lower class and not hoarded by the wealthy. If that can be balanced then gradual inflation shouldn’t be too much of a burden. I believe that is a huge problem we’re facing now.

				* 🟪 **[RizzoStaxx](https://www.reddit.com/user/RizzoStaxx)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-05-03 23:28:55)_

					Sort of right. They print money people borrow it and buy assets. Which in turn makes other assets more valuable. However it devalues the currency. This works out for those who own assets but unfortunately for the poor all they have is dollars so they get poorer

				* 🟪 **[dbudlov](https://www.reddit.com/user/dbudlov)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-05-04 08:21:31)_

					Yes but that also means resources are being misallocated from those producing and earning currency to those using the force of the state to obtain that currency 
					
					Also govts claim the unequal right to force society to fund and obey them, the only reason anyone requires that power is if they're trying to force those people to pay for it to things they wouldn't choose to do voluntarily, meaning wealth is being wasted every time govt prints currency

						Sure but If the money is redistributed properly into the hands of the people through gov programs or a higher minimum wage the economy as a whole will profit as people will spend more and hopefully lead to increased living standards. That’s the point. 
						
						The system we have allows the wealthy to reinforce their wealth with more wealth without really giving any mind to those which helped to build that wealth. (The workers) How much money can only one man alone make without the help of others?

						* 🟫 **[dbudlov](https://www.reddit.com/user/dbudlov)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-05-04 09:55:35)_

							It won't be though govts never distribute away from those that benefit then to help the average person, never have, never will and the only reason any institution needs to force people to pay for things is to make them pay for things they didn't want use or value
							
							How would govt programs help, or worse minimum wage laws? That just prices people out of the market and allowed the biggest corporations to consolidate more dominance in the market (or did you mean subsidizing low value work?) ending the income tax would do more to stimulate the economy and help the poor than any of this
							
							Wealth is built by successful entrepreneurs and their employees, it isn't all produced by workers alone, unless you Believe the fallacy of the labor theory of value? Which is hope not as it's demonstrably untrue

							* ⬛️ **[FinesTuned](https://www.reddit.com/user/FinesTuned)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-05-04 10:42:02)_

								I believe that’s the problem with things as they are right now, that the government doesn’t do enough to help middle and lower income classes. That they could do more to close the wealth gap and with that I do believe things can change with the right politicians and businesses cooperating. Of course this is an ideal but definitely a possibility. 
								
								Government programs could help make things more affordable, if the government could put forth more into say health, or housing, education, essential needs, then people have less needs they have to pay for. Their standard of living increases and they’ll have less to worry about and can put forth their money to other things. Of course, this all has to come with a change in mindset. 
								
								Sure, if you believe ending income tax (maybe until a certain income bracket?) would help more than increasing minimum wages in the long run I’d be all for it. The policies I’m recommending are all simply a means to an end, so long as people are able to live comfortably while still maintaining a strong economy. 
								
								And yes, I agree but what I’m saying is a successful entrepreneur cannot do it alone simply because how much work can one person actually do? I don’t believe one person by themselves can run a large business because how can they fulfill 10,000 orders in a short period of time. But as the business grows the employees usually are not compensated in relation to the growth of the business. Not that it’s totally unfair if they’re still doing the same amount of work but that the system only rewards those at the top who may or may not be already wealthy. I see the economy as more than zero sum in that everyone can have piece of the pie if the leaders are willing to share it.

					> Come on, do some research.
					
					"As the nation’s central bank, the Federal Reserve derives its authority from the U.S. Congress. It is considered an independent central bank because its decisions do not have to be ratified by the President or anyone else in the executive or legislative branch of government, it does not receive funding appropriated by Congress, and the terms of the members of the Board of Governors span multiple presidential and congressional terms. However, the Federal Reserve is subject to oversight by Congress, which periodically reviews its activities and can alter its responsibilities by statute. Also, the Federal Reserve must work within the framework of the overall objectives of economic and financial policy established by the government. Therefore, the Federal Reserve can be more accurately described as “independent within the government."

					The government provides the authority and directive for the Fed, just as the government controls what you pay in taxes. 
					
					You might as well say that the government doesn't build roads because it uses contractors to build the roads.
					
					It doesn't matter if the Fed is private or not; in terms of controlling money flow, they operate as the government's executive agent, independent of the whims of the executive branch. Congress tells them, through statute, what their goals are, and the Fed uses their expertise to process towards those goals. 
					
					This is by design, to avoid situations where short term benefits that help the current political powers in charge are executed at the cost of long term strategy.

	We borrow instead of printing to maintain the value of the dollar. If we just printed a ton of money (which we did) our currency would lose value in a phenomenon known as inflation (which proceeded to occur). There are other factors involved in inflation certainly, but that is the answer to the question posed.

	Nobody seems to have answered the question, so here’s my poor, oversimplified attempt:

	Q: Why does the government even borrow?

	A: Government borrowing in one’s own currency can help to drive up the value of the currency, which in turn increases the country’s power and wealth.

	Done. That’s it. I’m all done here, thanks, time for a nap.

	But if you’re a masochist and you want an explanation for how that works, here’s a terrible, rambling answer:

	Let’s focus on dollars and the USA, but this is true for several countries that print their own currency and repay debt in the same currency. 

	Let’s say that people in the US want to buy something from another country, such as car components made in China.

	If the value of the dollar is high compared to the Chinese yuan, that means that people want dollars more than they want yuan. So the US can use dollars to get a lot of stuff from China for cheap, which means that the US is richer because their money is way more valuable. 

	This also means that in general, people want to work for the US more than they want to work for China, because the pay in dollars seems way more valuable than the pay in yuan.

	The more that people want to work for you, the more that people will do what you want to pay them to do for you. Which in turn means that you have way more power than the competition, and you can demand more favorable terms for yourself.

	But if the value of the US currency were low compared to others, it’d be difficult for the US to buy things from other countries and attract skilled labor, and the US would be poorer and weaker. (Such an oversimplification, I know.)

	So how does debt drive up the perceived value of the currency?

	A few ways:

	So if you buy debt, you do so because you’ll earn more money. That’s a win for you.

	If you want to buy US debt, then you have to buy it in dollars, which drives up the value of the dollar because there’s now more demand for dollars. The more that you want to buy that debt instead of other things, they higher the value of the dollar.

	But then you eventually get repaid in dollars, and you have more dollars than before, so you might think “doesn’t more of something decrease the value of that thing?”

	And you’re at least partially right, but what are you going to do with that currency?

	You can’t really eat it, or clothe yourself with it, or take shelter in it, or really do much of anything with it except:

	You can stick it in a box and do nothing with it, or you might lose it, or you can exchange it — give it to someone else to get something in return.

	Let’s focus on the exchange option and how that increases the value of the currency.

	With your dollars, you could buy US goods and services. You have dollars, they take dollars, there’s no additional currency conversion fee, win-win-win.

	But you’re smart and you realize that the money supply is still inflated even if you spend it, because the money still exists. Still bad for the value of the dollar right?

	But then here’s what happens:

	Taxes. 

	US citizens and other US residents have to pay taxes, and they have to pay those taxes in dollars. So that drives up the value of the dollar. 

	In order to keep the money supply under control and uphold the value of the dollar, the US has to take a bunch of its currency out of circulation on a regular basis. And one way that it does so is by taxing people and corporations.

	This isn’t the only way that the government removes dollars from circulation, and there are constraints so this is not an unlimited power, but it’s a big one.

	And really, this explanation is only a fraction of what’s going on, and I thank all the wiser people like you who are probably thinking “and XYZ is also a major factor”, and “there are pros and cons to everything listed here”. You are correct.

	So yes, it seems weird for a government to give itself debt at first glance.

	But managed debt helps to drive interest in US goods and services, it increases the value of the currency and makes the country richer and more powerful, and the government can erase a bunch of the debt that it creates.

	The US dollar is used as the standard reference that all currencies measure themselves against. Mostly for convenience, and because of the US’s traditionally strong credit rating.

	He is having a hard time answering the question, because it is a retarded question. “Who is this Mr. Blue in the sky, and why is it raining?” Makes about as much sense

	You can’t just print money to get out of debt, because cash doesn’t provide or store value. It only REPRESENTS it. Having more cash in flow would lead to more inflation, which is the last thing we all want.

	We just have to be smart &amp; frugal, recessionary times come and go and there is nothing that can prevent them. Like war, it is human nature

	Modern monetary theory is hard to explain, but not very hard to conceptualize. The problem is the terminology that triggers most people about sound fiscal policy. Yes, we can print money. There’s no way to say that without a ton of people losing their damn minds over it, so you wind up trying to find a more suitable way of saying it that won’t derail the conversation, but there often isn’t one. Yes, we can print money with little to no issue so long as the money funds domestic projects that leads to greater economic activity. Don’t print so fast that inflation runs away, but don’t print so slowly that you miss out on golden projects that can stimulate the economy and protect us militarily.

			No, that’s not MMT. There’s no “as much as it wants”.
			
			In MMT, it’s critically important to maintain the perceived value of the currency, so it’s not a free-for-all where you can spend unlimited sums with no repercussions. The author completely misunderstands how MMT works.
			
			If MMT has been “debunked” somewhere, this ain’t it.

				Ok so what limits the spending, ultimately govt can spend whatever it chooses but all costs are forced into society which means it's a transfer of wealth from productive society to the state and politically connected, worst setup possible for any society working towards being peaceful and civilized

					Inflation is a good indicator that spending levels have reached their limit. And people that support MMT are most concerned with the giant sucking noise that is the 1% funneling all the wealth of the country into their pockets from the middle and working classes. 
					
					MMT gives the finger to the scarcity mindset, more than anything. Part of why I like it. We have plenty of materials to take care of everyone, yet we choose to pamper the rich and let others starve. No thanks.

						Right but there's no way to not have inflation if govt is expanding the currency supply, so according to that any currency expansion is a sign you need to stop expanding the currency, if that's your position I agree but that makes mmt impossible
						
						The wealth is being funneled from society by and to the state and politically connected rich, that is what all currency expansion does since it's spent by the state and whoever it hands it out to, before prices rise for everyone Else due to the printing
						
						You can't ignore reality or scarcity, they're very real, the best we can do is free society to create wealth as freely cheaply and easily add possible and not steal it through taxes and inflation, which means preventing govt controls, taxes and currency expansion

							A little inflation is a good thing. It helps the economy grow. Most of our current inflation has been caused by supply chain disruption and corporate profiteering. McDonalds has raised their prices by 100% since 2014, and they just posted the first quarter of losses in q long time over it, for instance. 
							
							And before you say it was government spending, the Inflation reduction act raised taxes on corporations to 15% minimum, and IMO has had a much more intense effect on the quick down draw of the overall inflation rate from the high watermark of 9% in June 2022. The Fed messing with the rates has had minimum effect on slowing the economy. Further, most of the government spending was on infrastructure, which has an ROI unlike tax cuts for the 1%, and government spending that is actually investment in America pays dividends and is not inflationary in the long run.

								Or isn't a little inflation is still a little artificial raising of prices, consumers get less goods and services for their money over time instead of increasingly cheaper prices
								
								I agree on supply chain disruptions, especially under govts COVID policies, but no inflation isn't caused by corporations like mcDonald profiteering that's an effect of inflation sometimes, of prices are going up due to inflation some businesses may be able to increase profits due to that, generally most businesses are forced to raise prices due to higher costs though, this is why we also see smaller businesses failing and larger politically connected corporations doing better, they can afford to cover the cost more easily 
								
								Govt spending is always detrimental to the economy, no one needs the unequal right to force people to fund it obey them unless the things they're forcing you to pay for our do are things you wouldn't fund or do voluntarily, politicians and their special interests, including banks and politically connected corporations are pricing themselves the worst humanity has to offer, the political corruption should be obvious to everyone at this point

									Inflation is indeed caused by corporations raising their prices. When individual corporations raise their prices? They run the risk of being outshone by the competition. When the entire industry does it, as all of fast food has done in the past couple of years?
									
									Yeah I can get a restaurant quality burger in my area for less than McDonalds. I can get restaurant quality tacos for nearly the price of Taco Bell. 
									
									Now that fast food is more expensive than mom and pop restaurant quality? You can bet that their sales are going to drop. Starbucks has raised it prices far beyond the inflation rate as well. 
									
									Greedflation is real, and absent any laws or regulations to fight it, the only way to combat it is for consumers to just stop buying things. 
									
									Government spending is not detrimental to the economy. Every federal dollar that’s spent turns over six times in a local economy. Government contracts and government spending are how the money supply is introduced into the economy. 
									
									If we have too little money supply we have a whole different set of problems. 
									
									Taxes helped create juman civilization and they can be used to help a huge aggregate of society. Most of our tax dollars are used to take care of the elderly, of which there is no shortage in this country. 
									
									Ending the welfare state would be an economic disaster. Just look how badly we are affected by homelessness? We don’t have a good government program to combat homelessness either. Until social security, elder poverty was one of the worst demographics.

										Yes all corporations get together and go from not being greedy to suddenly being greedy and raising their prices in union lol, sorry but no one is stupid enough to believe that unless they're just listening to the excuses made by their preferred politicians trying to push blame onto others and ignoring logic and facts entirely
										
										Corporations will take advantage of any currency printing from govts that flows to them, but that typically is only the biggest most politically connected corporations not small businesses
										
										All govt spending is detrimental to the economy is taken by force through taxation preventing consumers costing freely what they find or taken through expanding the currency supply stalling purchasing power from those earning it to benefit those printing it and getting access to the newly printed currency
										
										In a free market under sound currency, govts cannot stall from society through inflation to benefit themselves and the big banks and corporations and prices go down over time measured in those fixed dollars which benefits society at large, ie all consumers

					It doesn’t make any substantial points, from my reading of it. It argues along the lines of “AOC, you remember, the bartender, supports this”. That’s not an economic argument. 
					
					That a conservative think tank is arguing that this current bout of inflation is caused by government spending and not supply chains getting completely rocked for two and a half years? Doesn’t bode well for their credibility either. 
					
					This same website write articles about how the minimum wage is a bad thing, among other abhorrent economic policy positions, so I don’t hold their credibility up very high.

						It's pointing to all the inflation caused from COVID stimulus spending and the wealth inequality, societal damage and suffering that's causing
						
						It isn't conservative lol, they're specifically pointing out Republicans and Democrats went along with mmt policies and their destroying the economy for the average person paying out of control prices now
						
						Minimum wage is definitely a bad thing you can't impose wage controls by violence without negative economic consequences, why do you think only the biggest corporations support minimum wage laws? They can afford it but their competitors can't, they win that battle and small businesses lose, so we lose because it kills competition and leads to consolidation of market share into the hands of fewer and fewer big corporations

							Inflation wasn’t caused by stimulus spending, especially if that spending was an investment in infrastructure, which gas massive ROI. 
							
							No ROI with government spending like the Trump tax cuts that just inject cash into the bank accounts of the very rich who just hoard the money after they receive it? Yeah that will cause inflation. 
							
							But to blame 9% inflation in the summer of 2022 on $6000 worth of stimulus checks isn’t mathematically significant enough to do what you say happened. 
							
							The IRA, CHiPs and the BIL all made major investments in infrastructure.

								Of course it was all expansion of the currency supply is inflationary, arguing otherwise it's ignoring the basics of economics entirely, supply and demand

									Biden paid for his big spending packages with raising taxes on corporations. The government still has to put more money into the money supply from time to time, and if that spending is balanced out, as most CBO parliamentarians require, then you have to blame the huge hole in revenue that the Trump tax cuts have created for the 1%. 
									
									The government controls the money supply. The print and they tax (or raise rates if they want to control the money supply haphazardly). 
									
									But insofar as basic economic principles are concerned, there was a lot more demand than usual due to the global supply chain being completely fucked, there was more money on hand because of stimulus funding, and thus a perfect storm was born. 
									
									But I reject that government spending automatically causes inflation as an old hat wives tale invented by scaremongering supply side economists.

										Temp tax cuts? Trump did the same as Biden and expanded the currency supply spending trillions, the experiment in mmt has failed Everytime it's tried regardless who is doing it
										
										Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon, any expansion in the currency supply will drive prices up relative to that increase all else being equal, all govt spending is paid either directly through taxes or indirectly through higher prices and it's very obvious that's exactly what we're seeing now

		the fed has private shareholders but it could not exist without the govt authorizing its existence and imposing it onto everyone through force of law, the banksters got their foot in the revolting door of politics because theyre powerless without it... no private citizen has the right to counterfeit currency legally like govts and central/commercial banks do, because govt only allows those who benefit it to do it... so we shouldnt really call it private as it isnt, its more of a fascistic arrangement, a public/corporate partnership where govt gives insiders special deals no one else gets
