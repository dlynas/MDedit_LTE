## Books on strategy but in-depth and not cringe?

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/149cjzo/books_on_strategy_but_indepth_and_not_cringe/](https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/149cjzo/books_on_strategy_but_indepth_and_not_cringe/)

> So I wanna read a book on strategy (i leave it broad bc im simply curious about the recs I will get, but military tactics&strategy especially with real historical examples etc. would be particularly good) but I dont want it to be like lame self-help or alpha male grind mindset capitalism lets eat each other yeyy kind of stuff. Something in-depth, that truly has insights about strategy, power, life, etc.
> 
> I have already read Art of War and Five Rings. Eagerly waiting for your suggestions!

	Nice to see Liddell-Hart mentioned in these replies. I sure didn't expect that. Good job thar mate.

	I agree Sun-Tzu is entrancing/exotic at first but yeah, ultimately just something for one's coffee table. Too fluffy and airy.

	Machiavelli is also a good rec (further down in the responses). Tip: he has other books besides 'The Prince' which deal more **directly** with tactics and strategy. 'The Discourses' is arguably better for politics  and 'On War', (as I recall) is his military manual. [Help me out anyone, if I am mangling the titles here.]

	Clauswitz! Interesting rec. I myself plunged into 'ole Carl Von, at one point. The problem is, his writing is just not very friendly or readable. It's dense, turgid, unenlivened. And then there's the debate over "whether Clauswitz is just codifying what Buonaparte demonstrated" in real life.  If so, then why not just read more about Buonaparte? With Clauswitz as dull as he is, I'm not sure but that I would agree. What a slog. Napoleon himself, has his own manual after all; and there's plenty of other accounts of his exploits.

	Enough. Now for some of my picks. Instead of Sun-Tzu, try 'The Book of Five Rings'. A work of fighting tactics written by legendary Bushido swordsman Musashi. [EDIT: Oops, sorry I see you already know'd it.]

	Read up on then, on Vauban, the French defensive genius who helped Louis XIV (Sun King) rule Europe for almost a century. Lots of fun diagrams and visuals, usually accompany any study of Vauban.

	Erwin Rommel's 'Infantry Attacks'. Taken from his experiences in WWI when he was just a lieutenant. Perhaps its too technical, but still fascinating.

	Roman: 'Gallic Wars' by Julius Caesar, Annals of Tacitus, and even that thing written by Vegetius. 

	Ah --here's a really good one: Martin Van Creveld's "Supplying War: Military Logistics from Wallenstein to Patton". Contemporary; very readable and engaging. Highly recommended.

	Let's see ...there was one other one I wanted to cite ...something about gun emplacements and fields-of-fire. And some civil war cavalry stuff too. Nathan Buford, the Swamp Fox? Ach, I no canna recall.

		Do you read any of Col John Boyd's works ?

		* 🟧 **[Bruno_Stachel](https://www.reddit.com/user/Bruno_Stachel)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-05-06 11:58:14)_

			Unfortunately, nope. I don't follow air combat very closely. My fave air book is probably just one title: 'Phantom Over Vietnam'.

				John Boyd lectured about way more than air combat..He studied the Nature of War,
				
				and determined that some of the intrinsic values in warfare are often the most overlooked: Cohesion, Psychological Ambiguity, Tempo, Surprise, Shock and Awe,
				
				The Leadership, etc...... Moral Factors

					I defer to you on all things related to John Boyd; as I'm only faintly familiar with him. Will bear in mind what you've emphasized here. Thank you sirrah.

	Clausewitz's *On War* is considered a must read. Caveat I have not read it  (though I have a copy on my shelves)

	Here is a nice article by the author of Military Strategy: A Very Short Introduction recommending five books about military strategy and talking about their merits:

	[https://fivebooks.com/best-books/military-strategy-antulio-echevarria/](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/military-strategy-antulio-echevarria/)

	I think this is the kind of thing you're looking for, though I'm not sure!

	EDIT: And if this is interesting, check out all of the ['Military History' recommendations at FiveBooks](https://fivebooks.com/category/history/military-history/).

	Can't really beat The Prince, by Machiavelli.  Powerful people today still refer to it.

	* 🟨 **[bhbhbhhh](https://www.reddit.com/user/bhbhbhhh)** ⬆️ 2 _(2023-06-14 21:35:37)_

		Machiavelli only gives cursory attention to military affairs in The Prince. He gives all he has to say about soldiering in his other book titled The Art of War, not to be confused with the other Art of War.

	* 🟨 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 1 _(2023-06-14 14:35:57)_

		Was gonna say Art of War, but OP already got it. Definitely The Prince come second

		* 🟧 **[NoneOfThisIsFun](https://www.reddit.com/user/NoneOfThisIsFun)** ⬆️ 2 _(2023-06-14 16:35:24)_

			Art of War is for pretentious genZ-ers who think they know what it's like to struggle.

	Dixit and Nalebuff. 

	Very practical too.

	Fiction, but The Poppy War by R.F. Kuang is military strategy with some fantasy built in. Incredible book and trilogy based on China's actual history.

* 🟩 **[bhbhbhhh](https://www.reddit.com/user/bhbhbhhh)** ⬆️ 1 _(2023-06-14 21:37:12)_

	I would read The Second World War by John Keegan. Covers pretty much everything in fair detail, through example rather than theorizing.

	For a more modern take on military strategy, I recommend anything by Colin Gray. Fighting Talk and The Strategy Bridge are good places to start.

	Aurelius Meditations has some nice strategies for life in general.
