## AskHistorians Booklist is now also available on Goodreads

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3nhmqo/askhistorians_booklist_is_now_also_available_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3nhmqo/askhistorians_booklist_is_now_also_available_on/)

> People have been clamoring for a better Booklist for a long time, and we’ve been listening! We're happy to announce, after a month of tag-team mass data entry, that [the Booklist has been copied to Goodreads.](https://www.goodreads.com/askhistorians) Not everyone’s familiar with Goodreads of course, but the basic definition is that it’s a remarkably addictive combo of personal book database and social media platform. 
> 
> The main thing for us is that with the Goodreads Booklist **you can now do two key things people have been asking for: search the list, and easily find books about things other than a specific place and time, for example biographies, political history, women’s history, economic history, etc.** 
> 
> We hope you can now more easily use the 1000+ books recommended by the flairs of AskHistorians! 
> 
> #***Questions?***  
> 
> #Do I need a Goodreads account to use this list? 
> 
> Nope, our shelves are set to public. If you have an account you will have a slightly better experience though, and of course then you can build your own book lists, and friend us! 
> 
> #How do find books about a certain subject? 
> 
> Subject tags are called “shelves” on Goodreads, [so just browse our shelves!](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/46890061) (full list of shelves is on the left)   
> 
> #How do I search this book list? 
> 
> Use the small search bar on our shelves page, just be sure not to use the big search bar by the Goodreads logo. Big search bar searches the entire Goodreads catalog, little search bar searches just our books. 
> 
> #Can I find books that have been shelved under two subjects, like “Middle Ages” and “Economic History?”
> 
> Yes, you can do this, but Goodreads really doesn’t make it obvious: 
> 
> 1. Click on your first shelf.
> 2. Scroll to the bottom of the list of shelves. You will see tiny grey text saying “select multiple.” Click it. 
> 3. Plus signs appear by the shelves. Click the plus on your second shelf of choice. Or third and fourth! 
> 4. Books are filtered to your individual requirements. 
> 
> #Okay I found a book, how do I buy it or get it from the library? 
> 
> Goodreads makes both of these 1 or 2 click actions, no more copying and pasting to search! 
> 
> On a book’s specific record there are links to Amazon, Other booksellers, and then Libraries, which goes to Worldcat by default. If you have a Goodreads account you can actually customize these buttons to your preferred bookseller and even [your local library catalogs.](https://www.goodreads.com/book_link/create) (And if you have the means, I highly recommend adding in the search buttons for your library, it’s so choice. I’m talking 5 clicks to put a book on your request list.)  
> 
> #Does this mean you are deleting the wiki list? 
> 
> Nope. We made a copy on Goodreads for people who asked for a searchable booklist, because this was the easiest way to do it. 
> 
> #Are documentaries, databases, and all the other non-book things on the Booklist on here?
> 
> Unfortunately no, Goodreads only allows for books. Another reason not to retire the wiki list! 
> 
> #Hey there’s no books about [my favorite thing]! 
> 
> The Booklist is crowdsourced from the flairs, go sweetly ask your favorite subject expert to give it some books.

	WOOOO THIS IS AWESOME 

* 🟩 **[Mictlantecuhtli](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mictlantecuhtli)** ⬆️ 4 _(2015-10-04 17:22:17)_

	If we update the wikilist does it update automatically on Goodreads? Or does someone have to manually go into the Goodreads page to update it?

	* 🟨 **[jschooltiger](https://www.reddit.com/user/jschooltiger)** ⬆️ 3 _(2015-10-04 17:30:35)_

		Unfortunately, we'll need to manually update on Goodreads. I just went through and did the Latin America section on Friday (which I have a suspicion you contributed to, being much on West Mexico), so if you wanted to check it out and compare that would be awesome. Or if you edit the wiki, message the mods and one of us will update the books list. 

		* 🟧 **[Mictlantecuhtli](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mictlantecuhtli)** ⬆️ 2 _(2015-10-04 17:35:12)_

			I did and saw everything I added. I just wanted to ask in case others were thinking of adding something soon.

	* 🟨 **[caffarelli](https://www.reddit.com/user/caffarelli) (OP)** ⬆️ 2 _(2015-10-04 22:37:43)_

		We'll periodically go through and check the change history on the wiki, but if you add like 30 books on a dull Sunday, let us know and we'll get them in earlier. 

		* 🟧 **[kaisermatias](https://www.reddit.com/user/kaisermatias)** ⬆️ 1 _(2015-10-05 04:42:04)_

			In that regard I suppose I should go about and add a few more to the Caucasus list, so expect that to grow by next week.

			* 🟦 **[caffarelli](https://www.reddit.com/user/caffarelli) (OP)** ⬆️ 2 _(2015-10-05 08:46:03)_

				Go see the only book tagged under sports-history Mr. Hockey... 

				* 🟪 **[kaisermatias](https://www.reddit.com/user/kaisermatias)** ⬆️ 2 _(2015-10-05 09:13:50)_

					[Mr. Hockey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordie_Howe) I am not, but that will also be something I will work on in the coming days.

* 🟩 **[kaisermatias](https://www.reddit.com/user/kaisermatias)** ⬆️ 4 _(2015-10-05 04:41:03)_

	I think the most surprising thing here is that there are at least four books about Bhutanese history written in English, and that they are listed here.

	* 🟨 **[caffarelli](https://www.reddit.com/user/caffarelli) (OP)** ⬆️ 4 _(2015-10-05 11:10:25)_

		You know what's even weirder? 4 books on Bhutan, but only 1 book on the Vikings.

	Oh brilliant ! It's funny because I wondered if it would be a good idea for AskHistorians to have an account there and share it's book lists. I never took the step to ask a mod though if this was planned. Guess I got an answer ! 

	As always, great job. ( and now I should go and update my own profile there, since I did not visit the website for awhile )

* 🟩 **[texpeare](https://www.reddit.com/user/texpeare)** ⬆️ 2 _(2015-10-04 22:51:37)_

	Wow!  This is amazing!

* 🟩 **[minderbinder](https://www.reddit.com/user/minderbinder)** ⬆️ 1 _(2015-10-04 23:15:55)_

	Nice. Why not turn it "public"?

	* 🟨 **[Georgy_K_Zhukov](https://www.reddit.com/user/Georgy_K_Zhukov)** ⬆️ 1 _(2015-10-04 23:19:27)_

		Is it not showing up for you? Seems to be working fine for me when I view it.

		* 🟧 **[minderbinder](https://www.reddit.com/user/minderbinder)** ⬆️ 2 _(2015-10-04 23:44:16)_

			Im in the Phone, it ask me to log in

			* 🟦 **[caffarelli](https://www.reddit.com/user/caffarelli) (OP)** ⬆️ 2 _(2015-10-05 08:45:30)_

				I went on the mobile site and it does ask you to log in, and tries to strong-arm you into downloading the app as well, crappy. :( Try requesting the desktop version of the site? 

			* 🟦 **[Georgy_K_Zhukov](https://www.reddit.com/user/Georgy_K_Zhukov)** ⬆️ 1 _(2015-10-04 23:45:30)_

				Hmm... I'll look into it. You shouldn't need to have an account to view though, I don't think so at least.

* 🟩 **[superiority](https://www.reddit.com/user/superiority)** ⬆️ 1 _(2015-10-06 08:39:38)_

	No tag for labour history? Is it all grouped under "social history"? I think it deserves its own tag.

	* 🟨 **[caffarelli](https://www.reddit.com/user/caffarelli) (OP)** ⬆️ 1 _(2015-10-06 08:51:09)_

		It's mostly under economic I think, but I'd agree, there should be a labor tag. I'll probably be picking at it again this weekend since it's sparked interest in the booklist with the flaired users and we'll need to add more books in.
