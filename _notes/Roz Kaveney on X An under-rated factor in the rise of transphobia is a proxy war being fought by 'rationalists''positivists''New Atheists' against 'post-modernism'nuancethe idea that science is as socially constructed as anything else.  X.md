## Conversation

An under-rated factor in the rise of transphobia is a proxy war being fought by 'rationalists'/'positivists'/'New Atheists' against 'post-modernism'/nuance/the idea that science is as socially constructed as anything else.



In part this goes back to the Darwin Wars and Richard Dawkins' and his supporters' belief that Stephen Gould's arguments for 'punctuated equilibrium' etc. added unnecessary twiddles to pure Darwinian theory and weakened the struggle against anti-science religious fundamentalism.

This was exacerbated by Gould's belief that any fight between science and religion could be resolved by operating parallel and separate world views. (Gould was wrong about this because he underestimated the commitment of many fundies to Dominionism and absolute political power).

(Dawkins is at least equally politically naive in some of the alliances he has chosen to make.)

The New Atheists adopted a stance of aggressive rancour towards religion which failed to understand its psychological appeal and in its dealings with Islam could often look like quite crude racism and cheerleading for neocolonial war.

This tone of rancour got carried across to broader intellectual and academic areas via japes like the Sokal hoax. A key factor in all this was lobbying government for funding. (It's always about money and power...)

A sidebar here. I used to write for the NS a lot though I increasingly disagreed with Peter Wilby's anti-pomo editorial stance. I ended up having a row with Jason when he was literary editor over my positive review of a book about feral children.

By case studies from different epochs, the author made - I thought - a good case that scientific understanding of similar empirical observations will always be affected by the observer's political, religious and philosophic preconceptions. Jason disliked this view.

The conclusion of this was that Jason published my piece as I wrote it and I've hardly written for the NS since save for one piece about trans parenting for Helen Lewis and a poem when Neil and Amanda guest edited...

I mention this purely as an example of how seriously some people heresy hunt quite recondite intellectual matters. The trouble is that some things can't be nailed down precisely enough to satisfy hardline rationalists. And one of these things is trans people's sense of identity

Rowling's use of the slogan 'woman is not a feeling' is a slogan calculated to appeal to sceptics who might otherwise cavil at eg Jeffreys' claim that always and everywhere gender is a system of oppression based on biological sex class.

Via incredibly vague buzz words like 'gender ideology' and not being especially averse to bullying minorities, and a view that some ways of thinking are just better than others, a lot of sceptics have ended up in the same camp as the religious fundamentalists they despise.

This is because rationalism is as obsessed with purity as other belief systems. When Helen Joyce talks of trans people as a problem for a sane society, what she means is that we are an untidiness in a tidy society.

It's clear from her recent interview that her anti-trans views are part of a general distaste for what Helen sees as post-modernism.

So here's a perception... Mary Douglas in her seminal Purity and Danger talks of concepts of pollution as things crossing boundaries and being liminal and transgressive. The idea that transphobia is a rational position is possibly a category error.

The fear that has been cooked up about trans women in toilets is at this point not about facts and figures. It's an induced dread and I don't know how people infected with it are going to get back to normal.

Good I hope they win. By hamstringing science obscurantists usher in fascism by removing the ability to independently criticize authority.

It's best no one wins. Social constructionist obscurantism is less dangerous than experts infected by Scientism making confident assertions well outside their field and largely based on 'common sense' eg uninformed conventional prejudice.

A philosophy known as “Just War Theory,” rooted in Christian tradition, provides a framework for evaluating the ethical aspects of warfare. It seeks to reconcile the necessity of self-defense with the moral obligation to protect human life.

I was arguing with a transphobe yesterday- they raised the point that we specifically are anisogamous, which is true, but that’s apparently also justification for “just two sexes”. Honestly I didn’t know what to say in response, so I really want to know what \*should\* I have said?

"rationalists" tend to oppose transphobia, on the grounds that choosing to categorize society this way vs that way is social construct-y. E.g. see link related. [slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/21/the](https://t.co/iICJDcG0da) (Facts ofc are \*not\* just social constructs. Gravity doesn't care if you believe in it.)

This is a debate near and dear to my heart as a recovering philosophy PhD student who studied with Derrida, but ended up a unique combination of Kant, Marx and Foucault with some presocratics thrown in for good measure…

Roz we would really love to have your perspective in the ecosocialist/eco feminist academic journal Capitalism Nature Socialism. It could be an article or could maybe one of us interview you?

The situation reminds me of the debates about 'no platform for racists' in the 80s and early 90s. Only this time we have state actors stirring the pot. The job of those 10,000 paid trolls working for Putin is to create division. Trans issues are one of the buttons they push. 1/
