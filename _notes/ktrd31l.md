	American Psycho has remained consistently relevant since the book. Though I don't personally agree with your reasons why. For me, it's because the Bateman character type entered the culture during the 80s. Not the yuppie nor the Wall St trader, but the young, aspirational male increasingly confused and detached about what it means to be male in a post-manufacturing, western capitalist environment.

	He obsesses over brands, clothes, skin care, list making, gym culture, business cards as ontology, restaurant reservations (not eating), his appearance. He's utterly lost about what it is to me male in a culture that was evolving beyond classical ideas of masculinity. And this morphs into a kind of hyper-misogyny and fantasy existence based around sex and violence. 

	Easton-Ellis, as a fairly straight-coded homosexual man, was perfectly placed to witness how the culture of middle-class straight men was adopting the tropes of gay male lifestyles by osmosis.

	In a way, Bateman is the evolution of Richard Gere's character in Schrader's much-underrated American Gigolo: a man who believes himself to be the apex of masculinity and in control of who he is and his environment, but is in actual fact deeply confused and delusional about his place in the world. 

	It presciently predicts how lost men were about to become in a culture that increasingly had no use for the masculine traits of old. He's a proto Andrew Tate.

		Well there‚Äôs a bigger thing than just Bateman. The world Bateman lives in is Reagan‚Äôs trickle down economics. A world where the rich are richer and the poor are poorer. The whole time Bateman thinks he‚Äôs slick but in a twilight zone level twist he realizes that the people he‚Äôs surrounded by, generationally rich reptilian blue bloods- don‚Äôt actually *care* if he‚Äôs killing people. It doesn‚Äôt matter if Bateman is killing people because the people in his circle have no empathy.

			Yeah, that's in there too.
			Another milleu Easton-Ellis was well placed to observe. 
			
			Most of his books operate in that sphere to a degree. He was also pretty prescient again in the late 90s by eviscerating the Prada-Meinhoff set that inhabits fashion, media and the arts in Glamorama. 
			
			They're all still with us in numbers today too. Posturing social causes to keep the wheels of capitalism turning. That book is probably even more relevant now than American Psycho. Someone should take a crack at adapting it. But it's unlikely to get greenlit as it perhaps hits too close to home for the entertainment industry...

		While masculinity is a motif in American Psycho, I think that's a reductionist and retrofitted way to interpret the film. The film is much more broadly about superficial consumerism and conformity, I'm not sure they could be any clearer about that.
		
		The main character's pathologic obsession with fitting is an attempt to relieve his chronic emptiness and resentment, as are his killings. Again, the film practically breaks the fourth wall to get this point across in an almost essay-like fashion. Reducing Bateman to a 'sigma male that hates women' really doesn't capture his motivation to kill. He does hate women, but really he just hates people--above all himself--and the modern society that produced them. I mean he spends about half the movie killing men.
		
		As a final thought experiment, try to remake American Psycho where the protagonist is a similarly miserable 1980s rich white woman who secretly kills people with poison or something. How about if the protagonist is a 1980s black guy secretly axing people to death. I reckon one of those choices would be inherently easier to capture the themes of the original film.

			In both your hypotheticals, you're taking someone subjugated to some extent, and replacing a protagonist who embodies what the struggle near the top of a patriarchal hierarchy is supposed to look like, who looks and sounds the way someone at the top of the hierarchy is supposed to.

		What dovetails this sentiment is Bateman's core want to "just fit in" and how he talks about his social mask slipping all the time. To me this was never about his being a serial killer which is either imagined or real, but unremarked by the world around him so to him not really a concern socially, but his want to fit in as a young businessman in modern capitalist NY culture is core to all his interactions and the undercurrent of his monologue. He can spend pages and pages of the book waxing lyrical about shampoo brands and Genesis, but despite knowing all the 'right' things and meeting all those social responsibilities with his yuppie mates, he never fits in with his friends, he never fits in with his girlfriend, he never fits in at his job. He's in perpetual anxiety and insecurity, which the movie doesn't quite portray to the level of the book where his inner monologue is farcical. That idea of a man unable to know his identity or place in the world is very very real nowadays, and certainly is prime picking for grifters like Andrew Tate, ready to tell these confused men and boys what their identity is -- all their worst insecurities and impulses, a Patrick Bateman.
		
		We need to rebuild man's identity because it's become clear the old ideas of masculinity and "being a man" are all bound up in hurtful toxic bullshit. But as yet we haven't been able to articulate any clear replacement for men to strive to be and model themselves around. And any time we do undoubtedly people come out to either deflate any ideas or offer counter-arguments to any new identity for men in society. Bateman really was the personification of that concept -- a man with no identity, lost and passively experiencing the world around him, unable to connect or feel anything.

			Re-watching Malcom in the Middle and Hal has a lot of crazy inspirational and aspirational qualities. He has a big heart and the craziest confidence. He's more about ensuring himself and the people around him are having fun and feel comfortable. He's not the smartest but he's not insecure about it and he respects and admires those who are. He's not inherently violent or abusive but he's willing to be in the name of what's right (although this is arguably his worst trait since he could probably be a little less quick to react). When he has arguments with his partner it's always resolved fairly quickly and amicably and with a lot of self awareness and he isn't afraid to admit when he is wrong.
			
			In season 1 he has a conversation with a bathroom attendant who thanks Hal for "making eye contact with him". Hal's response is to invite him to come and have a lobster dinner with him at his table.
			
			He's not perfect. Like all of us he is flawed. But God damn if he doesn't try his best. Men should try and be like Hal. I'm sure someone has a better rebuttal for my half cooked theory but right now I'm sticking by it.

				The issue with Hal is he married a controlling narcissist wife and so he and the entire family is permanently in her grip. Hal tries but unfortunately he cannot see that the woman he married tears him and his kids down on the regular, so he will never be able to properly stand up for himself or be happy. A remarkably common dynamic in real life dysfunctional households, an otherwise kind and warm parent marries a cold calculating narcissist and through being legally wedded and not having insight is sort of locked in their own mental prison there. Then they pretty much lose their own sense of self in giving over to the narcissist.

					That's the mentality you're supposed to have towards Lois when you're a child and in that sense I understand but as an adult you could not be more wrong. She couldn't be further from narcissistic because if she was she would have left the family to live out her life as Consuela. Lois is the only one keeping the family together and looked after. Without her there would be no show because all the children would literally be dead from starvation. I would suggest watching the show as an adult because Lois is the one doing more than anyone else in the show and she clearly loves her family so much. Her being the villain is the child mentality.

			I agree with you wholeheartedly.
			
			It was absolutely necessary for us to deconstruct the tenets of masculinity and examine the problems that lay within. However, there's been no real attempt, or apparent desire, to reconstruct it into a definable model or fully-functioning state after the comprehensive demolition. The result has been a vacuum filled by bad faith actors and grifters selling shoddy philosophies and placebo palliatives. This is a very sorry state of affairs.
			
			For those of us who never really bought into the manufactured constructs of traditional masculinity in the first place, this isn't too much of a problem - our sense of self remains intact and we operate seamlessly within evolving cultural environments whilst still retaining a sense of what it means to be male. But for others, and especially those coming of age in this environment, it's much more complex.
			
			Personally, I've always been in agreement with Beth Gibbon's lyrics in Portishead's Glory Box: Don't you stop being a man, just take a little look, from outside, when you can.

		No, narcissists and psychopaths have existed as long as people have (and a disproportionate amount of people on Wall Street and in the financial industry, including CEOs, stock traders, sales &amp; marketing, etc, are psychopaths who cannot feel empathy or guilt or remorse). Corporations behave like parasitic psychopaths because in the 70s, conservative economist Milton Friedman said ‚ÄúThere is one and only one social responsibility of business‚Äîto use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits.‚Äù Putting profits over people comes instinctively to psychopaths, because psychopaths cannot care about people, so they view other people as marks to be exploited and taken advantage of.
		
		Although the 80s certainly popularized making quick money in the stock market. The fictional character Gordon Gekko in the film Wall Street (1987) said ‚Äúgreed is good‚Äù (although before that, Ayn Rand said [selfishness](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Virtue_of_Selfishness) is the greatest virtue.)
		
		[This](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/attraction-evolved/201910/are-psychopaths-sexy) says ‚Äúmen who scored higher on the psychopathy questionnaire were rated more desirable by women‚Äù, and the conclusion of many studies is typically that psychopaths may make better hunters or warriors. It could be because low empathy due to psychopathy exhibits similarly to low empathy due to high testosterone.¬†
		
		>He obsesses over brands, clothes, skin care, list making, gym culture, business cards as ontology, restaurant reservations (not eating), his appearance.
		
		Because Patrick Bateman is a narcissistic psychopath, and narcissists crave attention and status.
		
		>He's utterly lost about what it is to me male in a culture that was evolving beyond classical ideas of masculinity. And this morphs into a kind of hyper-misogyny and fantasy existence based around sex and violence.
		
		Psychopaths don‚Äôt care ‚Äúwhat it is to be male‚Äù, because they don‚Äôt even know what it feels like to be human, and they are ‚Äúlost‚Äù because they are empty and hollow, with a moral void or moral vacuum, so psychopaths don‚Äôt think anything is morally wrong, and psychopaths cannot feel guilt for inflicting violence. Narcissistic rage doesn‚Äôt turn people into misogynists, it means everyone is a potential victim, and psychopaths see people as objects or obstacles or tools to be used and discarded.
		
		Testosterone suppresses the empathy hormone oxytocin, competition also decreases empathy (which explains why so many online gamers are insufferable assholes), and [psychopathy](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24059750/) and [autism](https://www.nature.com/articles/mp201477) can both be caused by different mutations to the [oxytocin receptor gene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxytocin_receptor) (OXTR) on chromosome 3, and oxytocin is the empathy hormone, love hormone, the trust hormone, the bonding hormone. So it‚Äôs common for people with ASPD (anti-social personality disorder) or ASD (autism spectrum disorder) to have empathy deficits (which is not to say that all people with autism have zero empathy).¬†
		
		>Easton-Ellis, as a fairly straight-coded homosexual man, was perfectly placed to witness how the culture of middle-class straight men was adopting the tropes of gay male lifestyles by osmosis.
		
		Freud said homosexuality in males is rooted in narcissism, and I can‚Äôt say he‚Äôs wrong, and [studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20063233/) have supported his hypothesis, since ‚Äúhomosexual students score higher in both measures of narcissism and lower on the self-esteem measure, compared to their heterosexual counterparts.‚Äù Autism is also frequently marked by empathy deficits, and [Autistic People Are More Likely to Identify as LGBTQ](https://sparkforautism.org/discover_article/autism-lgbtq-identity/).
		
		>It presciently predicts how lost men were about to become in a culture that increasingly had no use for the masculine traits of old. He's a proto Andrew Tate.
		
		Andrew Tate operates under the assumption that women prefer ‚Äúbad boys.‚Äù Which isn‚Äôt a false assumption, since [this](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/attraction-evolved/201910/are-psychopaths-sexy) says ‚Äúmen who scored higher on the psychopathy questionnaire were rated more desirable by women.‚Äù If violence turned women off then no soldier or boxer or MMA fighter or gangster would ever get laid by a woman, and no woman would ever listen to Chris Brown. Meanwhile, socially awkward losers who become mass shooters, like the Parkland shooter or Aurora shooter, receive fanmail in prison from women.
		
		Donald Trump is also a narcissistic psychopath, who tens of millions of women voted for (despite being a rapist), and he is the ‚Äúbad boy of American politics‚Äù (as disgusting as that is to say).
		
		It‚Äôs quite a stretch to say we live in a ‚Äúculture that increasingly had no use for the masculine traits of old‚Äù, when ‚Äústrongman‚Äù leaders and authoritarians like Putin are seeing a recent revival, and Trump‚Äôs entire schtick is his bullshit macho act ‚Äî acting like the alpha male of the group in every situation ‚Äî and he‚Äôs still getting away with it. And Trump voters will not abandon him unless someone stronger topples him ‚Äî until Furiosa kills Immortan Joe, like in Mad Max: Fury Road (2015).

			This is exactly why I'm so uncomfortable with interpreting American Psycho as a gender film. He *tells* you while the opening credits are practically running that he's not a man that we can relate to in any meaningful way because he's not a *human being*. How people can expect anyone to watch Bateman chainsaw a woman to death and have us leaving the theatre saying "oh man, I need to treat women better" is a little astounding.
			
			American Psycho is a film about male issues inasmuch as Silence of the Lambs is a film about transgender issues; they are plot elements but focusing on them kind of loses what drives the characters.
			
			Otherwise, would we ever be able to recognize the evil inside Patrick Bateman if it inhabited a different human vessel? Or are we as oblivious as the doorman or dry cleaner and everyone else staring evil right in the face? I fear that we are.

			A well-written and comprehensive rebuttal which addresses the continued popularity of the "psychopathic personality type" within certain sectors of society. I'm frankly quite honoured that you have gone to such great lengths, citations included, in reply. Thank you. And much of what you say is not untrue.
			
			However, for me, much of this can be attributed to a reaction by a subsection of society - often of a more conservative or traditional bent - to what they perceive as the "feminising" of the American male and the culture at large. 
			
			Parallel to the emergence and adoption of more liberal and socially enlightened ideas in popular culture over the last decade or so, a counter movement has emerged - not entirely organically and predominantly in the political sphere for obvious reasons - that is under the impression that their "way of life" is threatened by progressives. This is continually stoked by those with a vested interest to do so.
			
			These are the American Psychos of today. These are the Batemans of our time. Not the stokers of fear - they're an entirely different breed who's sense of self never waivers - but the ones that feel lost, threatened and confused. They lionize ridiculous demigogues like Trump or Tate in the vain hope they will strongarm the culture back to where they want it to be - a return to a mythical time of picket fences, American hegemonic dominance and domestic security.
			
			We've witnessed this kind of political revanchism countless times before however and we know where it leads. 
			
			Bateman is not actually a psychopath. He wants to be a psychopath. Because he thinks it makes him more interesting, admired and in control. It's all empty posturing though. He's a phoney. This is what he shares with many today: posturing in the face of confusion about who they are and their place in society.
			
			Online has been the perfect incubator and amplifier for this exact kind of low-self-esteem-powered narcissism. There are now legions of Batemans living out their psychopathic fantasies online. And sometimes it births a genuine one. More or less than before? Who knows. But most remain secluded within their adolescent Fantasyland of macho braggadocio.
			
			I honestly enjoy that you disagreed with me and took the time to construct your measured response. This is an interesting conversation, even if we don't especially see eye to eye. In fact, it's all the more interesting to me because of that.
