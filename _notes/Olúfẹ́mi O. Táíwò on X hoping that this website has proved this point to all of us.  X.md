hoping that this website has proved this point to all of us.

Quote

No communication can help someone who’s committed to misunderstanding you. Being a good communicator also means knowing when to stop talking.



this applies to more than academic and/or political conversations obviously, but since i spend so much time in those spaces, worth pointing out an underdiscussed question: what norm should replace "debate me bro" energy in a healthy intellectual knowledge culture?

we should all in principle be accountable to any and everybody but this app is a constant testimonial of the pitfalls of the most obvious ways of trying to operationalize that principle (responding to whoever shows up in your mentions for as long as there is a back and forth)

some guesses: - stronger norms against dishonesty / bad faith (e.g. "I like pancakes" > "oh so you hate waffles") - stronger norms valuing curiosity - much more explicit trust networks (identifying specific people/orgs/books etc that champion positions folks should address)



What’s the TLDR on climate progress? We’re making more of it than you think.

detached curiosity, ala Pyrrho/Zhuangzi
