## When you live in a world ran by yt supremacy üôÑ

If we were to redirect our focus away from the pursuit of wealth and material possessions, we could cultivate a spirit of resistance and liberation. By challenging the oppressive structures of capitalism, we recognize its role as the driving force behind numerous forms of injustice experienced by Black communities worldwide. It‚Äôs time to reject the notion that our purpose is to labor for the benefit of others while we are left impoverished and marginalized. Instead, we must harness our talents, resources, and knowledge to uplift our own communities and break free from the cycle of exploitation. Our collective strength lies in our ability to advocate for BIPOC liberation and to forge a path towards a more just and equitable society.

Message from @liberationinc_  on black history course:

We believe in standing up for all those who are oppressed. We believe that in order for anyone to have true freedom, they must be freed from all forms and barriers that would take away their freedom, give them partial freedom, or simply not complete freedom. We believe in the liberation of the oppressed through re-education and revolution. 

We provide wrap-around opportunities that focus on the whole person, whole family, and whole community through the actions of drug use, crime, and poverty prevention outreach programs‚Äìin order to uplift in the form of political involvement, economic growth, social strength, health and wellness, and an increase in educational opportunities. 

We aim to redefine blackness. To redefine our self-image. To unite all of our people in the name of Liberation.
