## Biography [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Ing&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Biography")

Ing received a B.Comm. from the Faculty of Commerce and [Trinity College](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Toronto "Trinity College, Toronto") at the [University of Toronto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Toronto "University of Toronto") in 1980, and in 1982 an MBA from the [Kellogg School of Management](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kellogg_School_of_Management "Kellogg School of Management") at [Northwestern University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_University "Northwestern University"). He was a doctoral student in business strategy at the Faculty of Commerce and Business Administration at the [University of British Columbia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_British_Columbia "University of British Columbia") from 1982 to 1984, which he stopped in favour of continuing research in a corporate business setting. In 2003 he restarted a Ph.D. program in Industrial Engineering and Management at the [Helsinki University of Technology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki_University_of_Technology "Helsinki University of Technology"),<sup id="cite_ref-ADI_2-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ing#cite_note-ADI-2">[2]</a></sup> which has evolved to become the [Aalto University School of Science](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aalto_University_School_of_Science "Aalto University School of Science").

Ing started work at [IBM](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM "IBM") Canada headquarters in 1985 as a business analyst modelling [econometrics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econometrics "Econometrics"). In 1987, he became a retail industry marketing specialist, working in [decision support systems](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_support_systems "Decision support systems") with retail and consumer packaged goods customers. From 1992, he became a senior [management consultant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_consultant "Management consultant") in a series of promotions through IBM Consulting Group, IBM Advanced Business Institute in [Palisades, New York](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palisades,_New_York "Palisades, New York"), IBM Business Innovation Services, IBM Business Consulting Services, and IBM Global Business Services. From 2006 he was a [business architect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Architect "Business Architect") with IBM Software Group, in pre-sales consultative selling roles with the Industry Business Value Assessments North America team,<sup id="cite_ref-ADI_2-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ing#cite_note-ADI-2">[2]</a></sup> and then Websphere Technical Sales through 2012. He opted for an early retirement from IBM after 28 years of service.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ing#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

### Personal [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Ing&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Personal")

He received his primary and secondary school education in [Gravenhurst, Ontario](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravenhurst,_Ontario "Gravenhurst, Ontario") before studying at the [University of Toronto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Toronto "University of Toronto"). After his graduate studies in [Evanston, Illinois](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evanston,_Illinois "Evanston, Illinois") and [Vancouver, British Columbia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver,_British_Columbia "Vancouver, British Columbia"), he has been a resident of [Toronto, Ontario](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto,_Ontario "Toronto, Ontario") since 1985.

## Work [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Ing&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Work")

### Marketing science [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Ing&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Marketing science")

From 1988 to 1993, David Ing was assigned by IBM to roles in market development of decision support systems with retail industry customers. In this role, he developed prototype applications in merchandise planning and [category management](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_management "Category management") on the [Metaphor Data Interpretation System](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor_Computer_Systems#DIS "Metaphor Computer Systems"), as it evolved to become an IBM product. This experience led to his joining [IBM Consulting Group](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Global_Services#IBM_Global_Business_Services "IBM Global Services") in 1994 as IT Strategy Consultant, and then leading a [First-of-a-Kind](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOAK "FOAK") project with [IBM Research](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Research "IBM Research").

In 1990, Ing was a cofounder of the Canadian Centre for Marketing Information Technologies at the [University of Toronto Faculty of Management](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotman_School_of_Management "Rotman School of Management"), with Andrew A. Mitchell and Ray Serpkenci. This led to his teaching an experimental second-year MBA course for two years on "Marketing Information Technologies" as well as his co-authorship of two chapters published in _The Marketing Information Revolution_.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ing#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>

### Sense-and-respond support system [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Ing&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Sense-and-respond support system")

According to Haeckel (1999), a business "has the two options to make offers to customers or to respond to their request. The essential difference separates the make-and-sell from sense-and-respond organizations. At the enterprise level, these two require fundamentally different organizing principles. The make-and-sell company is conceived as efficient machine for making and selling offers, while the sense-and-respond company needs to respond as an adaptive system anticipating unaccepted requests".<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ing#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

Sense-and-respond systems became increasingly necessary as their technologies and principles advanced. Working with Ian Simmonds in 1998,<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ing#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> Ing developed a sense-and-respond support system specification which was not tied to any particular technology platform. It demonstrated the following key features:<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ing#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>

-   A complete representation of the firm's organizational context
-   Support of collaborative decision processes
-   Status tracking of commitments using protocols

The declaration of an organizational context and commitment protocols were influenced by the [Language Action Perspective](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Action_Perspective "Language Action Perspective"), as developed by [Fernando Flores](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Flores "Fernando Flores") and [Terry Winograd](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Winograd "Terry Winograd"). The collaborative decision processes were influenced by the design of [inquiring](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquiry#Inquiry_in_the_pragmatic_paradigm "Inquiry") systems as described by [C. West Churchman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._West_Churchman "C. West Churchman") and [Ian Mitroff](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Mitroff "Ian Mitroff"), and through the collaboration of [Vincent Barabba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Barabba "Vincent Barabba") with [Gerald Zaltman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Zaltman "Gerald Zaltman").

### Business architecture, organization and technology [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Ing&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Business architecture, organization and technology")

Between 1997 and 2001, David Ing was assigned as adjunct faculty to the IBM Advanced Business Institute, located in Palisades, New York, as [Stephan H. Haeckel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephan_H._Haeckel "Stephan H. Haeckel") was writing the _Adaptive Enterprise_ book. During this time, Ing collaborated with Ian D. Simmonds at [IBM Research](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Research "IBM Research"), on [shearing layers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shearing_layers "Shearing layers") approaches to the design of organizations and information technologies, based on the idea of the evolutionary view of [How Buildings Learn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Buildings_Learn "How Buildings Learn") by [Stewart Brand](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Brand "Stewart Brand").

In 2009 he was researching relational governance in business alliances, and methods for systemic change in organizations.<sup id="cite_ref-ADI_2-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ing#cite_note-ADI-2">[2]</a></sup>

### Service systems science [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Ing&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Service systems science")

David Ing was early in the development of research into [service science, management and engineering](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_science,_management_and_engineering "Service science, management and engineering"), due to his affiliation with [Jim Spohrer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Spohrer "Jim Spohrer") since the ISSS 2005 Cancun<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ing#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> meeting, and through communities internal to IBM.

On service systems, Ing has been most influenced by the Theory of the Offering developed by [Richard Normann](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Normann "Richard Normann") and Rafael Ramirez. He is known for bringing the perspectives of [systems thinking](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking "Systems thinking") and [systems sciences](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_science "Systems science") to designing and managing services.

Through [Kyoichi Kijima](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoichi_Kijima "Kyoichi Kijima"), David Ing has been a visiting scholar to the [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Institute_of_Technology "Tokyo Institute of Technology") in the development of their Service Systems Science Research in 2012,<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ing#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> 2011, 2010, 2009<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ing#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> and 2008.<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ing#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup>

In 2006 through 2008, Ing was a researcher on Rendez research project on business innovation implementation<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ing#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> in Finland, funded by [Tekes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tekes_(agency) "Tekes (agency)"). In parallel, he was co-developer and instructor in the master's degree Program in Service Business Management<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ing#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> at [Helsinki Polytechnic Stadia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki_Polytechnic_Stadia "Helsinki Polytechnic Stadia").

In the period between 2001 and 2006, this research into services systems science was shaped by Ing's position in [IBM Business Consulting Services](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Consulting#IBM_Global_Business_Services "IBM Consulting") as a senior management consultant.

### Open Innovation Learning [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Ing&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Open Innovation Learning")

Open Innovation Learning book launch (2 of 3), presentation by David Ing, 2018

Seven cases involving IBM between 2001-2011 with [open sourcing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source "Open source") communities into [open innovation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Innovation "Open Innovation") were synthesized into new theories through a multiparadigm inquiry method.<sup id="cite_ref-openinnovationlearning_1-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ing#cite_note-openinnovationlearning-1">[1]</a></sup>

Three [descriptive theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_theory "Scientific theory") streams are proposed alongside 3 [paradigms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm "Paradigm"):

-   a theory of [Quality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(philosophy) "Quality (philosophy)")\-generating sequencing, in a paradigm of Architectural problem seeking;
-   a theory of [Affordances](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance "Affordance") wayfaring, in a paradigm of Inhabiting disclosive spaces; and
-   a theory of [Anticipatory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticipation_(artificial_intelligence) "Anticipation (artificial intelligence)") appreciating in a paradigm of Governing subworlds.

Three [normative theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normative_ethics "Normative ethics") streams are proposed along a paradigm of co-responsive movement:

-   a theory of Innovation learning **for** (based on enskilling attentionality and [episteme](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episteme "Episteme"));
-   a theory of Innovation learning **by** (based on weaving flows in form-giving, and [techne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techne "Techne"));
-   a theory of Innovation learning **alongside** (based on agencing strands, and [phronesis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phronesis "Phronesis")).

[Teleonomy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleonomy "Teleonomy") learns from [teleology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology "Teleology") in a philosophy of [alternative stable states](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_stable_state "Alternative stable state").
