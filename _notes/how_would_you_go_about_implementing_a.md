## How would you go about implementing a non-capitalist society in an mmo? 

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/nzpd8/how_would_you_go_about_implementing_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/nzpd8/how_would_you_go_about_implementing_a/)

> Not necessarily communism, any alternate economic system would do. Eve is often touted by economists as an interesting model of a hyper capitalist state, so I have been thinking about whether it would be possible to use games to simulate other systems, that we might learn from the process. Has anything like this been done?

	Probably the best you could do would be a state-run system. 

	Food, clothing, weaponry, housing, provided by the state according to each person's needs and current levels.

	Trade and barter between players would be completely prohibited.

	So then, to be fair, you should probably make it true to life and allow the creation of a black market system between players. And also have the state-run system always trying to shut down the black market (or ignoring it if it's low-level enough). Even having some players that were a politburo of sorts trying to arrest those running the black market, and offering rewards in-game for snitches.

	That would be pretty fun, actually. That way everyone gets some basic supplies and whatnot, and you have to take risks to get anything better.

		This sounds a lot like the tabletop game Paranoia, and sounds incredibly fun.
		
		Death needs to be incredibly easy and permanent in a game like this -- if you get caught, you will be executed, and you won't get to keep anything you've earned. The player-police would presumably have factions devoted to secretly keeping the resources of dead players, and that would create a lot of infighting between groups of players. And of course, you'd need a lot of high-powered NPCs who are all part of this system of deception.
		
		With really good support for factions and secret trading and an incentive to turn in criminal players, this would be basically perfect.

			Levels do not represent a commodity, they represent your character's "Experience."  So if this were to be a parallel to real life, you would not implement controlled distribution of experience and levels.

			Nah, it doesn't follow like that with levels - levels are *intangible* assets gained through skill and effort, and as such, are unregulatable via a central authority. 
			
			A perfect real-life example: someone learns how to read. The state can't magically take away the *ability* to read - just the books. 
			
			The ability to read is a skill, and the better you are at reading, the higher your "level." 
			
			The books to be read are the items which the state could regulate, but the state couldn't magically force you to unlearn how to read. 
			
			So it follows that leveling up should be allowed, just like any mmo.

			What do you mean by a player's skill and knowledge? Do you mean something like a character's XP and/or level or the player's raw ability and talent (and whatever you could look up on a wiki)?

			* 🟦 **[Doeke](https://www.reddit.com/user/Doeke)** ⬆️ 12 _(2012-01-02 12:12:17)_

				I meant the last. This would mean designing the combat mechanics to allow for a high skill ceiling (no automatic aiming, sword fighting like mount&amp;blade, etc). You could also make the characters abilities/spells combine in certain ways (combo bonuses, or the way magicka does casting).
				
				As for crafting, you could make the way items are created somewhat different for every player, to discourage looking things up on a wiki, or think of something else to make this harder.
				
				I think there aren't enough games that actually require a lot of practice and skill to be able to play at a normal level (Of course, any game becomes much harder at competitive level), and the ones that do, keep using the same sets of mechanics (shooters, strategy, etc).

				* 🟪 **[babada](https://www.reddit.com/user/babada)** ⬆️ 20 _(2012-01-02 12:39:25)_

					Interesting. When pondering what such a system would look like... I am not imagining anything close to the MMOs I have played or seen. Here is a short list of my thoughts; how well do they line up with your ideas?
					
					* **Eliminate the XP and leveling systems.** These systems tilt the advantage toward those who have played the game *more* not those who have played the game *better*.
					* **Make rewards skill based.** If you do well, you get a reward. No rewards for grinding; no event driven quest lines that require you to just click through.
					* **Skill trees are open.** Skills, talents and abilities are the equivalent to stock car racing; everyone has the same set of restrictions. This may even go so far as to remove the class system (but keep deep trees); just put abilities on the table and let the players optimize the numbers. When a combo appears broken, balance it.
					* **Items are game changing.** I think it would be interesting if the items were (a) unlockable through challenges and (b) the rough equivalent of modern class systems. Instead of items simply adding numbers to stats they are one of the first things you look at when you meet a new character. I think balancing this would be a bitch... but it provides a progression system that replaces the XP leveling system I suggested taking out.
					* **Farming resources is impossible.** I don't really know how this would actually work... but my best guess is to just remove the traditional resource systems. No gold; no minerals. Resources and trading are based on something else entirely... but I cannot imagine what that would be.
					* **PVP is balanced against PVE.** Monster and player stat blocks and abilities should scale together in difficulty. Rewards from either side are balanced with each other. An example of *not* doing this is WoW's Resilience stat. The purpose of this is learning your character and class; optimizing for PVE should be relatively similar to optimizing for PVP. (It won't be identical, naturally, but it should be close. The differences should be due to player skill versus AI; not player characters versus mobs.)
					* **Teamwork is powerful.** The mechanics of the game should allow for combos at both the individual level and the group level. Make challenges and rewards that are both solo and group challenges.
					* **Encourage build creativity.** Post-release, game balances should be delayed to encourage people looking for broken combos and experimenting with new ideas. Balances should be small and tweaking not nerf-batting. This is a pure culture issue but I think it would help.
					* **Difficulty is expressed in rank and not level.** Use a system similar to ELO or TrueSkill to determine monster and player strength.
					* **Make the monsters not fair.** Make monster fights *hard*. Don't make *dungeons* hard; make *monsters* hard. Monster design should essentially be focused on training the player how not to suck. Ranking up against monsters involves both learning the monster's behavior and getting better at playing. Monster difficulty rankings should auto-adjust against player skills a la the standard ranking system.
					
					There are huge problems in the above list but hopefully it presents a good starting point. One noticable gap is the lack of crafting or professions. I don't know how these things would fit well in a competitive, skill-based game without breaking the balance toward longer playtimes. People who have completed more challenges get more rewards and this will correlate with longer play times but this is still a reflection of skill. Crafting... how would crafting be a reflection of skill? Does it *need* to be?

							Point by point:
							
							* **Eliminate the XP and leveling systems:** Pretty much.  Takes a few hours, top, to reach the max level.
							
							* **Make rewards skill based:** Titles are still all grind, but nothing affecting gameplay is.
							
							* **Skill trees are open:** As open as they can get.  Still divided into classes, but the skill system is one of the main draws of the game, imo.
							
							* **Items are game changing:** Noting of the sort, since all progression is essentially cosmetic.
							* **Farming resources is impossible:** Resource farming is a big part of PvE still.  No impact on PvP though.
							
							* **PVP is balanced against PVE:** Not at all.  They tried, but to really make this idea work, it would take seriously amazing AI.  Now, they have separate balance for PvE and PvP, with some skills preforming differently in each.  Since it takes about a second to change from PvE to PvP builds, it's not too much of an issue though.
							
							* **Teamwork is powerful:** Everything in the game is group based.  There are solo farming builds for specific areas of PvE, but besides that, you won't accomplish anything without a group.
							
							* **Encourage build creativity:** It has seen some power creep over the years, but for the most part they try to keep the game well balanced.  It would probably be better to allow some respected members of the community to assist with balancing though, to prevent some of the balance mistakes.
							
							* **Difficulty is expressed in rank and not level:** Guilds have ranking systems.  Other than that, no.
							
							* **Make the monsters not fair:** Most of PvE is pretty easy with the proper build, but that's more or less inevitable with a skill system as flexible as Guild Wars'.  Some of the top end areas though (UW, DoA) still manage to be pretty hard though.  No dynamic difficulty changing, but there is an optional Hard Mode for better rewards.

									If you're capable of getting those titles, you don't need the advantage they give. The ones worth mentioning are the EotN and NF titles, especialy Lightbringer. I enjoy the EotN titles because you can rank up really high just from your initial run-through of the expansion, and the titles generally aren't so powerful that they make or break your build.
									
									LB ranks were too powerful, since you actually got excluded from groups without a high rank. Luckily most of the rest of the game doesn't follow suit.

						> **Eliminate the XP and leveling systems.**
						
						Agreed. Of course there are some problems, like not being able to play well with friends are just not as good at the game, or how you progress once you stop getting better at the game.
						
						> **Make rewards skill based**
						
						Good point, there should still be easy quests and challenges as well, though.
						
						> **Skill trees are open**
						
						I actually planned to do something similar for my next game, but it would be more like a shooter with spells/abilities. I also have not decided whether to remove classes entirely, or distribute the skills across classes. What about: skill trees vs. picking any combination you like vs. picking a fixed number of abilities from each of several categories? Of course, having many possible combinations of abilities makes balancing *hard*.
						
						> **Items are game changing.**
						
						Not sure about this, but MMOs *do* need some way to progress your character.
						
						> **Farming resources is impossible.**
						
						What kind of resources/craftables would exist in your MMO?
						
						> **PVP is balanced against PVE.**
						
						Yes. (Heh, reslience).
						
						> **Teamwork is powerful.**
						
						If you give players access to the same sets of abilities, and have certain powerful combinations between those abilities, teamwork becomes useful automatically.
						
						> **Encourage build creativity.**
						
						Severely nerfing things is never fun, but losing because of balance issues isn't either. Unfortunately, balance is not easy to get right.
						
						> **Difficulty is expressed in rank and not level.**
						
						Yes. This would be the only way to get fair PvP, and it's also why arena in WoW was awesome.
						
						> **Make the monsters not fair.**
						
						Monsters should have a much larger variety in abilities and AI, compared to the usual MMO.
						
						And I'm not sure if crafting has to be entirely skill-based as well.

						The thing is, leveling is important.  It adds a sense of accomplishing something.  Now, it doesn't have to give a huge advantage, but it should still be there.  If you look at Alien Swarm, 'leveling' gives you a new item.  If the flamethrower/shotgun or *required level weapon* wasn't so broken, it would work out perfectly.

						* 🟫 **[babada](https://www.reddit.com/user/babada)** ⬆️ 1 _(2012-01-02 18:05:35)_

							But then why call it a level? I suggest making the rewards attached to quests/challenges. Those quests and challenges have a difficulty rating but the traditional concept of a level doesn't need to be there.
							
							Essentially, levels are good for restricting the amount of information people see at once; that is good. Levels also give a stronger advantage to people who play the game more than people who play the game well. That isn't inherently bad but an MMO like Doeke was thinking about should probably drop that if at all possible.
							
							Progression is still possible with a number noting your level. With items being more powerful than average and the rewards attached to more and more difficult challenges there will be a natural progression. This progression will be based on (a) how many you complete and (b) how many you *can* complete. (a) is still going to advantage people who play the game more but (b) puts the ultimate progression cap on player skill.
							
							I should also make it clear that I am not trying to suggest this MMO would be fun; I am just treating this as a thought experiment. :)

									This is why a non-capitalistic MMO won't ever exist. Trading is one of the primary modes of interaction between players. Take money away, and you're left with TF2 hat trading, where most important transactions take place outside of the game with _real_ money because it is pointless to try to get anything done with the obtuse bartering system provided by Valve.
									
									And if the game distributes all items without players having to produce them, that's not an "economic system." That's just magic.

					Unfortunately I don't think skill games would pan out over persistent worlds where the main allure is character progression. High ceiling skill games tend to be short, arena based games (Quake, DotA, CS, Starcraft) rather than persistent worlds. I think the main reason for this is, what the heck do you do in between fighting? There's no progression so there's not a whole lot of incentive to do non-fighting tasks, and players expect to get right into the action. Whereas in most MMORPGs, there's always an incentive to do the next quest or hang around the auction house. I don't think aesthetics are enough an incentive to keep a persistent world alive in a game with no character progression.

						Another issue is that not everyone is skilled. Everyone likes to imagine themselves as skillful but then there's the issue of the bell curve. In an mmo, a less skilled player has no incentive to play, assuming knowledge of the game is equal. I don't think the population of the mmo would be stable. People would just get frustrated.

	Within EVE Online, though, there are different economic systems than the pure laissez-faire hypercapitalism found in high security space. Goonswarm espouses a unique brand of communist dictatorship it calls Space Communism, and the system of renters (or "pets") and owners in nullsec is strongly feudalistic.

	e: I don't think that "alternate economic systems" could exist in games without the very simple, minimalist framework of pure capitalism. First of all, there are very few (if any) games besides EVE Online that have enough players on a single shard to make it work. Second, any attempt by developers to regulate the economy they design would have to be automated; as in real life, there is simply no way to model a complex economic system without some players quickly figuring out a way to exploit it.

		Well, much of Eve takes place in a "right-makes-might" situation. People often say that capitalism "is what happens when you leave people alone", but I'd say that a key tenet of capitalism is probably that property rights are collectively enforced (or enforced by some strong actor). Without such a system in place, you could, of course, still enforce your property rights yourself. But you can enforce anything you have the power to anyway. I think that such systems tend to converge around something resembling feudalism, where peoples flock to (or a conquered by) a force which has the strength to provide them with protection. It's what naturally happens after the collapse of centralized authority, as the fall of the Roman empire and subsequent rise of feudalism shows. And that's really what you start to see in Eve. And since "might makes right", communism is right as well, as long as you have the power to keep such a system running. It isn't necessarily a state of complete subjugation to one person; in order to keep stability in your realm, you often have to make concessions to the people. There's no such thing as absolute power.

			In this way at least, nullsec works the same as the real world. I think your comparison of nullsec to the Dark Ages in Europe is spot on -- Feudalism is a very simple and easily maintained power structure. Goonswarm has sustained a system of governance more complex, I believe, only because it has so many members with a shared culture and identity from outside the game. There is a sense of inherent superiority (somewhat justified) that, combined with exclusivity, keep Goons working together toward the goal of making the rest of EVE quit the game.

	That question is interesting enough for me to believe it will never, ever happen in an MMO.

	But it's probably a lot simpler than it sounds for an MMO.

	Basically, the problem is the reward system, the motivation for playing. As long as there are items more valuable than others, people would be willing to trade and certain items would become a "currency" and have a RL value no matter whether you call them a currency. It's often surprising how stable prices for items in MMOs can get.

	So one way would be to remove any form of trading.

	There would have to be *some* kind of reward structure and it would have to come from a central authority (otherwise *someone* would exploit the power). That's pretty much the default for most MMOs as they are run by a company with total control over the servers, admin rights, etc. For a social society, any act benefiting others or the community as a whole could be rewarded stronger than personal achievements.

* 🟩 **[name_was_taken](https://www.reddit.com/user/name_was_taken)** ⬆️ 56 _(2012-01-02 07:50:35)_

	I think you first need to identify *why* Eve is hyper-capitalist.  Is it something the creators did, or is it the natural tendency of the market?

	In a world where selling and buying things *is* power, I think it's the natural state.  So to create a game with another system, you need to modify that.

	In Eve, virtual goods are treated as physical goods, where each item is unique and only 1 of that exact item can exist.  (Items could have the same stats, like in real life, but be physically separate.)

	So what if all items were virtual?  Infinitely copy-able with no monetary investment.  It wouldn't take any more than the time than what it would take for the user to do the copy.

	I think one of 2 things would happen:

	1)  Items would be hoarded and traded for other good items, for the most part.

	2)  Items would be freely given to anyone who asks, with the expectation that everyone else do the same.  

	It's possible that a hybrid of the 2 happens, though:

	3)  Items are hoarded for a while, then released to the public when newer, better items are found.

					It might be interesting to see a game where old content degraded continuously until it disappeared or became useless. You could make items degrade faster or slower based on how many people had them/how many times it was copied.

It could even vary from item to item, everything decays with use, but some things decay slower if you share them, and some decay faster.

				In this game though, all items are readily available to everyone. Or at least that's what I'm getting. In that case, there would be no point to hoarding the items, since getting the better ones is a matter of walking up to the nearest item pile or whatever. The problem is then player incentive. Why will players want to play the game if everything is readily there? Of course, it would depend on the MMO. Something like an MMORPG would need to be careful because people like to play it for the reward system of cooler items, rarer gear, etc, which wouldn't really exist in this hypothetical game.

		That still seems like a trading-based capitalist system with some slightly different tuning. What if we try to skew it into a [gift economy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_economy)?
		
		The game would need a rich and subtle crafting system, where players create a blueprint that's used to create an object. (For example, it could be something like SpaceChem - to craft an object, you need to design a machine that assembles a molecule. The shape and contents of the molecule will determine the object's properties. The complexity of the machine and the time it takes to do its job determine how expensive the object is to manufacture, and how long the process takes.)
		
		Once you've made a blueprint, you can publicize it in a reddit-style database; given the blueprint, anyone can manufacture the corresponding object, for a reasonably low cost. When they do, you, as its creator, receive XP (or some reward of that kind).
		
		The creator can also choose whether to make the blueprint "open source" or "closed source": A closed source blueprint can only be used to manufacture that one object (and give the creator XP). An open source blueprint can be read and changed by anyone, and used as a base to make new blueprint (so people can recreate its structure without giving the creator XP).

		I think this could Team Fortress 2 *Mannconomy* as an example. Where most items are infinitely found, craft, or bought. Most typical items (older weapons, scrap metal) are given out pretty easily. The only reason people don't disperse them on a socialistic level is the crafting system to which they can use infinite resources to possibly craft newer items of more value.  However, promotional items or the limited edition items as well as recently released items are often hoarded and sold at extremely high cost. Example would be the recent Halloween update. Costume pieces were "found" through competetive nature in maps and typically horded by most and sold for as much as a full refined (54 found weapons crafted down.) After the update, and the demand was down, the pieces fell to prices like a scrap or two each. 

	* 🟨 **[psygnisfive](https://www.reddit.com/user/psygnisfive)** ⬆️ 3 _(2012-01-02 12:16:06)_

		It's something the creators did, of course. But only because they're steeped in a capitalist system. Of course, this is parasitic on the fact that selling and buying things is itself the essence of capitalism, so the creators didn't have to set out to make "a hyper-capitalist game", rather, they just set out to make a game about trading and getting rich in space, etc. etc. perhaps not realizing that this is exactly the seed of a hyper-capitalist society.
		
		But that said, I'm not sure that EVE is inherently capitalist. I mean, think about what makes it capitalist: you pretend to be the boss of a corporation, and your employees do all the hard work of mining, navigating ships, whatever (where your employees are simulated by the game AI or whatever). Ok, but you're also doing things no CEO would actually do, you're intimately connected with things like planning and strategizing low level things like where to mine, or who to trade with or whatever. So the sense in which you're playing the CEO is somewhat artificial. It's entirely possible to view things differently. For instance, if EVE were communist in economic philosophy, the view would be that you're playing the role of the collective will of the workers of the corporation.
		
		Another sense in which EVE is capitalist, however, is the interaction with other players, and this is where it really matters, because this is where EVE is not inherently capitalist in any sense. How you interact with other players is *entirely* up to you as player. You can pay other players to do this or that for you, or you can collectively manage things. This is of course entirely possible as it is within EVE, it doesn't require a new game.

	Well, you could probably easily simulate fascist corporatism. Each class would belong to a guild (an economic sector), and the guilds administered by the server (the state). All your class needs are met by your guild according to its standards. The state does what is necessary to ensure each guild is given due importance.

	The guilds lobby the state for nerf/buff changes. The players just play with what the guilds give them.

	Fun, eh?

		Oh god no. The vast majority of players are pretty clueless when it comes to balance. It is a rare sight indeed to see a player with a thorough understanding of the mechanics behind their class or the system they're discussing. Could you imagine a large portion of the WoW playerbase having that kind of power? It would be a disaster.

			While I agree with you, a sharded system where each shard makes its own decisions like that could be very interesting indeed.  Allow each to have a government, and let the players run things within it.
			
			With enough players, you could run multiple servers for each government type, and even a few anarchy servers that get to decide their own government, and police it.

	Some ideas:

	**Social Democracy** - Player's loot, trades and purchases are all taxed at a certain rate that is voted on by the game community.  This tax amount is then either used to run special programs like new player gifts or free health potions for all.  Alternatively, that money could be redistributed to all players as a form of welfare.

	**Caste System** - When you create an account you are automatically given a role.  You must stay in this role no matter what.  Some roles are very profitable while others will never amount to much.  This role also dictates which parts of the game world your character is permitted to be in.  There is no way to get a new role.

	**Communism** - All loot is taken by the community and sold to NPCs.  The community then votes as to what items to purchase from a general store and how to distribute them.

	**Feudalism** - Players own regions of the game.  They can set a tax and/or require service from those that are inside of their region.  Part of this money is used to purchase NPC mercenaries to conquer other regions and/or defend against other PC warlords.  Full PvP and perma-death is on.

	**Barter** - There is no currency in the game.  You find items and can only trade items.  Item weight and transportation become very important.  If you have 10 sheep and you want to bring them to the market you have to herd them there yourself.  If you want to trade 10 hams for a new sword you will probably need to make about 3-5 trips.  NPCs are only interested in trading for things that they can actually use, so the weapon smith is not interested in the ores that you mined.  

	**Realistic Hyper-Capitalism** - You get 1 character and they start with very little money.  Your character requires food, water and shelter just to stay alive even if you are logged off.  All spawn and resource locations are already owned by other players.  All in-game economic skills take a significant amount of time (for example turning wheat into flour might take a PC 1 in-game hour at the mill).  You must negotiate with the players who have resources to trade your in-game time for money.

	* 🟨 **[thoomfish](https://www.reddit.com/user/thoomfish)** ⬆️ 5 _(2012-01-02 14:41:13)_

			Social democracy would work if the developers played along.  For example if the players wanted an Auction House at location X they would have to collect 1,000,000 gold pieces in tax revenue.  If they wanted to open a new mine at location Y it would require 500,000.  These types of projects could be a lot of fun, especially if the developers were open to new ideas from the fan base.  A 10% tax on all player revenues would hardly be noticed and people would love having that type of control over the game content.
			
			Communism might work for small player bases using the same concept.  Imagine that each server only has 50 people and they live in a savage world.  They must work together in order to build basic things like houses, walls and hire NPC guards.  In a small community it might work, again with developer support.
			
			Caste would probably suck, but Star Wars tried something a bit like this with force powers.  If I recall correctly that turned into a disaster.
			
			Barter could also work, the game would just not be heavy on the economy.  Imagine a low tech, low magic world where it was hard to amass wealth.  There could still be plenty of fun quests and adventures to be had.
			
			Hyper-capitalism is a bit like Project Entropia, without the option of adding real money of course.
			
			In any case, I agree that none of these are the most viable business models.  There is a reason that MMOs all gravitate towards the same model and that is because it attracts paying customers.

	You would do that by not instituting any form of economic model, but instead leaving it up to the players to create the systems. You simply provide the resources within the game world, a method of extraction of those resources, limitations on the availability of those resources, methods of manufacturing items, methods of creating various kinds of currency(Do not provide a universal currency), maybe some rudimentary form of a bartering screen to provide some transaction security(This relies on how the rest of the game is designed), and that's it.

	Within this structure the players are free to create any form of economic system that they wish, and may have numerous ones in different areas.

	You cannot have a socialistic game like this until you require basic needs.

	If we changed WoW from its current vision to include the following:  Every day you have to drink 1 liter of clean water, and every day you have to eat 3kg of food.  Every night you have to sleep in a sufficiently warm bed with protection during 6-9hours so you don't get assassinated.  If you die you lose everything and never respawn.

	Now we have to protect farms, land and water sources.  Now see how many people survive their first day, month?

	Games already are EXTREMELY socialistic.

	Universal healthcare? Yep (respawn, no sickness (very rare?), easy to cure)

	Free food? Yep (never have to eat/conjure as much as you want)

	Unlimited resources? Yep! (monsters keep spawning, ore keeps spawning)

	Essentially this is orgasmic for /r/politics.

	Naturally I took some liberty with definitions (e.g. the absence of coding food requirements = not having to worry about food = socialistic)  but , games are much more social than you think because you don't have to worry about basic needs.

			The game as a whole is, but I bet you still find microcosm's of other forms of government.  Guilds are a perfect example.  I run my guild, essentially, as a benevolent dictator with an oligarchical council as a backstop.  All gear is apportioned out by the group, and the average raider's only choice is to accept it or leave.  The guild takes possession of all epic gems, all BoEs, etc, and gives them back to the community in the best way to help the guild.  It very much is a socialist setup.

	I suppose with a game like Planetside it would be entirely possible to have a system whereby any single player couldn't have money per-say, but everything they earn goes into a centralised bank for their faction. This could then be allocated on the back of a budget or perhaps based on the effectiveness of a personal character (Kills, objectives completed etc).

	I can't say whether it would practically work, but it would sure emphasise the whole 'team' mentality. More money for the faction = better weaponry for the indervidual.

	A [**post scarcity society**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_scarcity) would be easiest to implement. Just give everyone access to everything. The key to game play then is choosing the right tools that complement your character's skills and your own play style to overcome challenges. Make it so the only cost is time to make the items needed. (They have to be extruded, ala Diamond Age by Stephenson) The only restriction on gear is carrying capacity, however you want to do that. 

	Items would still have to be usable based on skills you know and encounters could require more items than a single person could carry to complete. Say carrying an advanced healing kit takes up 60% of your carrying capacity and carrying an advanced repair kit takes up 75% of your inventory. Your mission is to drop onto a colony where the reactor has been attacked and destroyed. You have to fight off the attackers, repair the reactor, and heal the injured. Your 5 man team is a medic, an engineer, and a couple infantry. Go. 

* 🟩 **[Sharp398](https://www.reddit.com/user/Sharp398)** ⬆️ 3 _(2012-01-02 16:34:37)_

	I'm seeing people having the right idea of how pure socialism works in theory, but in practice, it has never worked out that way.

	In the Soviet Union, for example, people DID earn wages. My father had a job that happened to pay a little bit better than other jobs. Granted, the wage was set by the government. But the point is is that the government sets the wage that you earn as part of your employment. No matter what job you have, this money is enough for the basic necessities: food, shelter, water, clothing. If you have a job that pays better, you can earn more than the basic necessities.

	While the Soviet Union never paid someone enough to buy a car every day for a year and still live a comfortable life, there were people who simply earned more money because they were doing the more difficult or important jobs.

	If I were to make an MMO based on this economic style, I would have a wage that a player earns based on several factors. These factors might be level, number of quests completed, and if you're in a faction or guild or something like that, if the faction is huge and you play a large role in the faction, your wage will be much higher than the player that started playing the game 5 minutes ago. However, we are never talking to the point of wage where one person earns in 1 second what other people take a week to earn.

	All extra goodies that players can buy are sold by NPCs that are owned and controlled by the state, and in this case, the developers. When a player manages to replace something or decides he/she no longer needs something, this person can trade with other people either for more money, or in a barter system. Or, to TRULY eliminate inter-player capitalism, force the players to sell their goodies back to the State for a smaller return. Therefore, players must make a careful investment in equipment instead of just looking at something and say "I'm sure I can sell this back later for just about the same cost!"

	As I said, wage would be set based on various factors. The value of each of these factors would have to be set by the developers of the game. However, to keep it as a fair and balanced system, the values of the factors cannot be too high. Everybody must kept on a relatively level playing field.

	Trades.

	Every item can be "bought" by trading any item. The merchant would stick with the traded item afterwards. That would make you think before buying something, so you don't ruin other people's gameplay.

	Eventually the NPC would make the items he sold, when he met the right amount of given items (3 Pork Ribs + "Edna's Sauce" + 1 Charcoal traded = Delicious Pork Ribs with BBQ sauce, for example). You can imagine all kinds of items, not only consumables.

	Of course those would have to be made at a certain time so you wouldn't use a charcoal when there is someone after it.

	One idea would be to implement a barter system, and it would get complicated fairly quickly.

	Say the general shopkeep will buy ANYTHING at a 'value' of 10gp. and will sell to you at whatever 'price' he happens to think it's worth. so you could give him 100 gold coins (or 50 gold coins and 50 boars hides, whatever, or even 99 gold coins and one epic piece of equipment) to get that awesome piece of armor.

	... or you could go next door to the armormaker, where boars hides are much more valuable, and his armor is 'cheaper' because he has a surplus of it.

	But the thing is, you'd never see the monetary values. You'd just pull up a barter screen, say "I want that", and then throw stuff from your inventory onto the table until the shopkeep says "Okay, I'll take that deal."

	Each shopkeep (behind the scenes) would have to have a list of items and what they consider the 'value' of each item to be. It might be easier to sort them into categories (example: armor keep: armor mats * 5, armor itself *.5, general items * .5, everything else 0) but it'd still be a pain from a dev (and game balancing) standpoint.

	It could be interesting and engaging, or it could become a VERY tiresome minigame.

* 🟩 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 2 _(2012-01-02 13:53:29)_

	You could have a "karma" system where you have a variable karma rating that gives you access to effectively unlimited items of a certain level, and the more you contribute (doing quests, helping craft, raids, etc) the more powerful items you are given access to. Cooldowns, stack limits, and level requirements for use could largely limit the abusive nature of such a system.

Even language does not include possessive pronouns, calling a person's handkerchief "the handkerchief that I use" as opposed to "my handkerchief."

	Implementing something like this in an MMO would be difficult, though. Every player would have to immediately relinquish any item they held to anyone who asked. They might not be able to use it due to leveling, but that is how it would have to operate.

	This probably nullifies any attempt at an auction house.  It'd be more like a flea market, or swap meet kind of thing.

	Item for item trade between players would still be capable though (not sure how you'd really prevent that anyway, short of simply not programming the game for player trades; or everything's "bind when pick up").

I think it would also help to keep players' interactions mostly limited to a small-ish circle (say, 150 people) so that the idea of credibility within a community is fostered in traditional ways (e.g. gossip rather than advertising).

	With the small-ish communities, you've also got a recipe for clan alliances and conflict.  Make sure there's no shared currency between those clans (including no single item in the game that's broadly useful to everyone in unlimited quantity) and exchange can happen via barter.

	Many of the current MMORPG's aren't as capitalist as they might seem. To avoid introducing boring grinding, it has to be relatively easy to acquire goods. However, if people can trade those goods afterwards, the market will be flooded and everything will be essentially worthless. Even extremely difficult to acquire goods will go down and down in value as time progresses. You will have reached the [post-scarcity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_scarcity) that futurists often dream of. To insure a game in which this doesn't happen, most games (even Eve) employ money sinks, which do nothing but destroy. I'd argue that if you seriously tried to realistically emulate the circumstances in life that make our economy how it is without money sinks, it would be incredibly boring for the average player. This system allows most people to dive into the game and feel relatively successful and fulfilled.

	One possible mechanism would be participatory economics. 

	To simplify it for game play:

	Councils made up of game citizens decide what they want to consume and how it will be produced. Membership on the councils is widespread with the most productive, the most useful, members of the game having a higher order of precedence for membership in said councils.

	Guilds would handle the actual manufacturing of the goods or the doing of the work, e.g. Killing a dragon. The workers in those guilds have a voice in the decisions the guild makes directly proportional to the effect the outcome of the vote would have on them.

	For instance everyone in the guild would vote on who is going to lead a raiding party over all but a member of a distinct party would have more influence on who their own leader would than a member of another party.

	Currency would not exist, instead each player would have a personal worth or credit based on how much the game society has benefited from their efforts and how difficult or dangerous the work is. For instance someone making bread for 8 hours might not receive as much credit as someone that hunted dangerous creatures for 8 hours. If no one wanted to make bread, if there was a shortage of bread, then the bread making job would become more "valuable" until people wanted to do it instead of hunting.

	Game citizens can spend their worth on goods and services but they are not allowed to transfer those credits to anyone. They can buy something and trade it for other good or services but there is no transfer of raw credits so there are no banks. Loans would have to be approved by a council of citizens but would be interest free.

	I'd call this game EverVote: The Boring Game Where you Vote on Stuff but Never Actually Do Anything! It's Got Electrolytes! ™

	The first thing to do is to get rid of any Market. In a market, prices are dictated by supply and demand. That's where you get speculation and the use of currency as Capital.

	So no auction house and no trading. You can only buy from (NPC) vendors and sell to vendors. Vendors follow a uniform schedule of prices.

	The second thing to do is to change the loot reward system. Have all loot that a player collects be transferred to the State (to be resold through vendors). Players receive currency as a daily/weekly allowance.

	I remember at least one MMO that follows this scheme almost exactly: Shattered Galaxy. A really fun game for the time.

	Depends on the exact setting.

	But I'd probably aim for something akin to the reputation economy of the outer system in Eclipse Phase.

	In an economy like WoW you could create a communist guild. The stipulation of joining is that you put all money and loot earned into the guild vault and the guild officials distribute it accordingly. 

	I can see this type of system actually being incredibly convenient once you have a variety of professions and level capped players. Beginning players would probably also benefit.

	Whenever you find something in a dungeon, the game flags it and you have to hand it in to a state depository within a set amount of time or police NPCs start coming after you.

	If you want non-capitalist you just have every single item that drops be soulbound.  No trading. Anything you craft, only you can use.  If you need materials, you must farm them yourself.  Let vendors sell a much larger range of good quality, usable items for various currencies.

	If you want non-monetary, you're going to have to go further and either remove all gear from the game and give everyone a level playing field or go the other way and provide everyone with the same set of gear, which is functionally identical to the first idea.  The only difference in the second could be gear upgrades available through achievement.

	Interesting idea, but boring after a few days.

	Well, Capitalism is essentially ownership of scarce materials you create or develop and the trading of that property. So either have a system where private property is not protected or a system where that property cannot be traded.

	Capitalism works in games because it's competitive. At the end of the day, a competition drives some of the fun of MMOs. The way to develop a non-capitalist society would be to do something like Goonswarm in Eve. You need a large, self-sufficient group of players that provides goods/services/resources/wealth to a central group that then doles that out to the general members.  

	It's hard to do on many games. If you look at the WoW model, a guild just provides a framework to do higher end content to get geared. You see some meritocracy there outside of capitalism, but at the end its hypercompetitive to provide to people.  

	What would probably work best is a sort of feudal system, with low level people working for higher level people - the low level people provide a certain portion of their wealth to the higher level people in return for protection and perhaps some other benefits that might be out of their reach.

	This doesn't really address the Capitalist question, but I think it would be very interesting to construct a game that uses an alternative currency mechanism, such as mutual credit systems, or ripple-type currency.

	In particular, time banks (a popular mutual credit mechanism) often impose a restriction on the maximum negative *and positive* credit an individual may have. If players can have unlimited rates of spending, but hard saving caps it will likely give rise to a very interesting economy.

	As far as non-capitalist goes; that's a huge question! One of the basic tenets of marxism was that worker should own the means of production, you can imagine a straightforward implementation of this; every player in a guild gets an equal share of the guild's profit.

	I cannot think of a way to impletment an MMO with a communist / socialist style economy and *have it be fun*. That's the caveat - I'm sure you can do it, but capitalism, especially the free market, works because it rewards individuals / groups who exploit others. This creates a dynamic of strife in a game environment that is incredibly more compelling than what a non-capitalist economy could produce (imo).

	Subscription-based MMOs have one and only one goal, making you spend as much time as possible within the game and for as long as possible, it's a timesink.

	Thus, acquiring ressources, gear, power or xp makes the player think he's advancing forward and that if he's not playing, he'll fall behind other players. If you get rid of everything and make every player equal, I don't think there is any incentive for people to play for long amounts of time as even if you work your ass off to make acquire ressources or money, you'd have to ... share with other people ?

	Even when money becomes useless (see Steam coals, TF2 hats or Diablo 2 trading), people will find ways to acquire what they want by getting rid of what they don't and end up richer (either by possessing more of the game's currency or more status items which show that you're a more dedicated player than others). 

	Even the fact that players have access to a dumbed down version of the content (Wow's Looking for Raid difficulty which makes the current raid easy to explore if you're not looking for any challenge) seems to make people rage and spew all of their hatred onto the forums (yes, the idea that other people are having fun in another way than you do seems unbearable for some) and you want everybody to have access to every item available, regardless of how dedicated they are ? Good luck \o/

	I think you could very easily design a mutualist MMO. Hell, there probably already are unwittingly mutualist MMOs.

	A communist MMO would be a bit tougher. A community pool system simply wouldn't be functional on that scale, and industrial communist models require the individual to have knowledge of transactions in order to know when exit is warranted. Also, I can't see a communist MMO being much fun, to be honest. It works in real life because it eliminates toil, but that's not the goal of a video game.

	I'm sure it has been said before, but here is the solution:

	1) Do not allow trading, item transfers, or even item drops.

	or

	2) Do not allow players to own items

	from reference.dictionary.com

	cap·i·tal·ism

	   [kap-i-tl-iz-uhm] Show IPA

	noun

	an economic system in which investment in and ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange of wealth is made and maintained chiefly by private individuals or corporations, especially as contrasted to cooperatively or state-owned means of wealth. 

	I don't know EVE, but looking at WoW, the economy is composed of individuals who own the means of production (ie. own the means of farming and crafting). The investment bit somewhat applies too, but not in the traditional sense since you don't get to buy the means of production *from others*. So the concept of capitalism technically fits to the WoW situation.  

	To change this you would need a system where there would be no "free range" farming grounds and anvils or whatever were not freely available. Everything would be owned by some non-player entity and you would not only require permission to access it, but the outcome of the farming/crafting would go to some resource pool instead of your inventory.
