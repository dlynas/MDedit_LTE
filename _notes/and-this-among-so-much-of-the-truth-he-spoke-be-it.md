## And this, among so much of the truth he spoke - be it with humor or otherwise - is why I consider Richard Pryor the GOAT üêê

Quick story: it was a Saturday Night Live tradition to have the guest host choose their musical guest. When Richard was invited on SNL, he chose us - Gil Scott-Heron, Brian Jackson and the Midnight Band (!)

For some reason, someone at the top didn't want that to happen and they asked him to choose another band. Rich said, "Is this SNL, where the guest host gets to choose their musical artist? And you're telling me that, out of all the other comedians appearing on this show, when I come on here, that rule doesn't apply? Tell you what - if I don't have the rights everyone else has, I'll tell you who else won't be on this show - ME."

And that, my friend, is the story of how GSH appeared on SNL. Being on such a popular show gained us opportunities that we might not have otherwise realized. 

So Brother, just as you said you wouldn't have been there without the folks you were addressing, I wouldn't be where I am without you. 

And so it goes. 

And so we rise. Still. 

Peace and blessings, Brother Master Richard Pryor.

PS: For the record, the first song we did was "Johannesburg." So yeah. üòú

"to sit there and take abuse and be spat upon,
hitting the head with clubs, stone, ugly words thrown at you,
and keep your dignity and remain non-violent.
I was one of those people who said that if anyone ever did that to me,
I'd stab them in the eye.
I'd hit them in the head with a brick,
but that's because I was frightened.
I was too frightened to go down to Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia.
I was too scared to sit in the church at night and play in meetings.
I was too frightened to be a part of that.
But if it wasn't for you people who were down there and did that,
believe me, I know in my heart that I wouldn't be here today."
