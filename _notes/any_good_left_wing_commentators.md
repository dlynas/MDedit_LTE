			Yeah, even though my views are more radical than second thought and I dissagree with some of his views, I truly admire the guy. He is openly criticising capitalism and the 2-party system, and he is very radical for american standards.
			
			I also like the fact that he supports other, more radical chanels through colaborations

	I would suggest Cody Johnston (Some More News) for catching up on the news in America in a lighter, more comedic tone. If you want to understand/discuss theory in more serious manner i suggest Hakim on YouTube. On twitch I can suggest Hasan Piker for solid leftist takes (he has called him self a revisionist marxist) and it's also a bit more entertaining.

	You probably know him/her/them but Jim/Stephanie Sterling is probably the biggest left wing commentator, on the gaming industry and also a critic of capitalism in general... She has strange liberal positions on Russia and China but other than that, she's pretty solid. They have a verry mercurial style that's heavily inspired by 1990's british satire.

		Great find - do they only cover issues that allude to monetary flaws in the gaming industry, or are there any videos out there which touch on wider reformation of society in general etc.

		* 🟧 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 1 _(2021-04-19 08:57:34)_

			He's a gaming journalist, so even if it's broader social subjects, like gambling addiction or sexual misconduct, it's going to be in relation to the gaming industry... There's still plenty of radical material, but I understand that it could be of moderate interest for someone who doesn't really associate with the gaming subculture.

	Why Dem-Soc and not just Socialist? 

	Anyway, there's the gravel institute, shaun, beau of the fifth column, Democracy at work, philosophy tube. I'd recommend Yugopnik and Hakim, but they're not dem-soc, have some good entry level vids about capitalism though. 

	Would also highly recommend the podcast Citations Needed, I'm not exactly certain of their particular brand of Socialism, possibly further left than Dem-Soc, but they cover specific issues that I'm sure a Democratic Socialist would appreciate.

	Largest left wing twitch streamer is HasanAbi (Hasan Piker)

	There are a wealth of Breadtubers you would probably like. If you're looking for specifically economical, I would start with the eminent prof. Richard Wolff at his channel: Democracy at Work. An extremely well-researched channel that covers international politics is The Empire Files. I would also recommend you check out Mexie, and her related channel, Positive Leftist News. Contrapoints also streams sometimes on Twitch.

		I actually agree with all three. I was distraught over the last 4 years. The constant stripping of LGBT rights down to Trump's last day. When I read they were stripping the rights away for same-sex couples to adopt I cried all day. All I want in life is a family. 
		
		Vaush and Hasan were one of the few leftists to defend my position when it came to the election. My friends and I understood that we were voting against our economic and foreign interests but we all wanted a future with a family.

			I did not vote for Biden, but I don't blame anybody who voted for him out of concerns for their own human rights being taken away. Imperialism must be stopped, but I understand why Black and LGBTQ+ communities came out in droves to vote against Trump, and for who they saw as the only alternative.
			
			Not the take you expect from a Marxist-Leninist huh?

				No, not really. I currently live in a small city so we have a big tent coalition. The MLs that I know obviously don't agree with me but they are respectful. They never attack me or try to denounce me as an ally. It's only an online thing which is sad.
				
				Edit: Thanks for the positive reply though.

				> chauvinist
				
				This is probably the rudest and most hurtful thing someone has said to me. How could you even come to this conclusion when I pointed out that I don't support the economic and **foreign** policies. I only wanted to protect my right to have a family. The LGBT are used as political weapons and our rights are threatened on a daily basis.

						You're not even reading my posts. I was only talking about adopting and having a family. Apparently saving a child from the horrid system makes me a western chauvinist. Would you prefer they rot in there?
						
						You are rude and condescending so I won't be responding any further. Please read people's posts in full before responding.
						
						P.S Nice strawman argument trying to pretend like I agree with any of that when you have no knowledge of my organizing.

							all i need to see is your democratic-socialist flair and support for vaush and other vehemently racist breadtubers. i am 99% positive you are white based on your posts and people with your beliefs and values are not welcomed in bipoc organizing spaces at all. stay in your DSA circles and talk about your admiration for vaush et. al

			All three of these people, especially vaush, bring a lot of people away from the far right. but if you don’t want them in your movement I’m sure you know best

					Obviously we have to work on organizing and helping marginalized communities. How is it detrimental to the movement if we also include people that pull others from the right and generally grow our numbers?

	check out [DDN](https://www.doubledown.news/), who regularly put out articles on YouTube regarding UK. Not an individual commentator, mind.

* 🟩 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 1 _(2021-04-19 18:46:39)_

	Would **Thought Slime** count? He's one of the best commentators I know of on Youtube.
