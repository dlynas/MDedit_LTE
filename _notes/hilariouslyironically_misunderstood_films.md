## Hilariously/Ironically Misunderstood Films

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/flicks/comments/m2snkj/hilariouslyironically_misunderstood_films/](https://www.reddit.com/r/flicks/comments/m2snkj/hilariouslyironically_misunderstood_films/)

> What got me thinking about this, was realizing the similarities between Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World and Fight Club. These films are both obvious satires of the characters they portray (nameless worker with a hyper-masculine power fantasy, and selfish entitled simp), are incredibly popular and yet it feels like so few people are in on the joke. 500 Days of Summer is a good example where the misunderstanding makes the film's message more poignant. I feel like with the films I picked, most of the misunderstanding is age/maturity-based (except Fight Club, arguably) but I know there's a lot more interesting examples out there that I can't put my finger on. 
> 
> What are some other (preferably slightly mainstream) films that are often loved for the wrong reasons? Why do you think said film was so misunderstood? Do you think audience misunderstanding should be considered a fault in the films' messaging?

	Glengarry Glen Ross. If you go to youtube and look at the comments under the Alec Baldwin clips, it's a pretty even split between people who understand that it's a satire on a truly awful type of human being, and people who look at that character as a source of personal and professional inspiration.

			When I was 18 I worked at a call center where the managers made everyone watch Boiler Room and Glengarry Glen Ross and also held a poker night on paydays so they could hustle employees. The job was pretending to be Search and Rescue soliciting donations for a made up Search and Rescue charity that didn't actually exist. Worst job I ever had. Lots of guys on work release. One dude got sick on the job, was doubled over in pain and needed to leave but the manager kept saying "Three more sales, bro! I just need three more and you can go!" He ended up actually making those sales and drove straight to the ER where his appendix burst.

	Starship Troopers comes to mind immediately. The irony of people loving it as a lazy/cheesy action fest is great, and echoes the films sentiment.  

	People getting upset at the end of Inception for not having definitive conclusion about what is and isn't real, and completely missing the point the film is trying to make about the illusion of reality is also a similar situation. Thats without even interrogating the meta elements of the audience (knowingly) watching the film as a false reality but enjoying it more than their real life.

		I remember I was talking to couple of coworkers about random movies. I think Robocop (they didn't know it was also directed by Verhoeven) came up and lead to Starship Troopers. They were saying how stupid it was but liked it as mindless, fun ultra-violent popcorn action flick, the topic of the conversation was how films used to be so violent and over the top back in the day.
		
		I didn't want to be *that* *guy* so I kept my mouth shut but it's kind of crazy how certain shots/scenes are **so so** obvious yet it didn't get through to some people. I mean...if nothing else get you to think 'hold on...' those "broadcast" segments should've been dead give away.
		
		But viewing the film again recently after having that conversation, it got me wondering at the possibility of someone reading the film as sincere attempt, not knowing filmmaker's body of work and style. I don't know. In anycase, I guess that's the guiness of the film. It was a satire and the target of its satirical message at the same time somehow. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

			Starship Troopers is the most meta thing ever. The best way to view it IMO is as an artefact from the world portrayed in the film, as a piece of fiction produced by a fascist society. Verhoeven was trying to show just how *stupid* fascism is, how it flattens art. How obsessed it is with violence, suffering and physical beauty, but with zero catharsis, empathy or even eroticism. Starship Troopers is the film the society in the film would make. It's kind of like a feature length Stolz der Nation, the fictional movie from Inglorious Basterds.

				The trap Verhoven and most filmmakers fall into is when depicting fascist evil they to a fault always resort to using the visual language that the fascist created for their own propaganda, and that imagery still works today. Very few films depicting fascism can escape this. Come and See I feel is one such film. Il Conformista as well to some lesser extent. Can’t think of many more.

					I actually think the story is very well written, it's such a total and complete storyarc for Johnny Rico, he goes from someone who enlists to stay with his high school sweetheart, and learns from every experience he has until he becomes a battle-scarred war hero.
					
					I think it's also purposely meant to be a little hammy to be reminiscent of propaganda films from WWII or so. Everyone is supposed to be a "swell guy", plus there's also the subtext of eugenics or something going on since pretty much everyone looks like a model, and there's a bunch of white Americans living in Buenos Aires. The best way to describe it is as if the Nazis won WWII, or if anything, the US became fascist and dominated the world.
					
					I will criticize it for the ending that feels like it doesn't match up with the rest of the movie's tone and doesn't play out "ironically" like the rest of the movie at all. I want to assume it's studio interference, but who knows.

				This is what gets me about Starship Troopers. Sure, it's satire. That's not a free pass for being overall pretty crummy. Ebert summarized it well:
				
				> What's lacking is exhilaration and sheer entertainment. Unlike the "Star Wars'' movies, which embraced a joyous vision and great comic invention, "Starship Troopers'' doesn't resonate. It's one-dimensional. We smile at the satirical asides, but where's the warmth of human nature? The spark of genius or rebellion? If "Star Wars'' is humanist, "Starship Troopers'' is totalitarian.

					As much as I usually feel him, I feel like Ebert didn't get what the film was trying to accomplish. The point is that, despite the coming-of-age cliches, there is no real warmth or humanity in the world of Starship Troopers, and the ultimate goal of this civilisation is dominion over one's enemies, and we all play our role to achieve it.

					We are quick to forget the impact of such wonderful critical thinkers. Specifically for me it was Ebert. Whether I agreed with him or not (hello Blue Velvet) I always found his views compelling and impactful. To paraphrase, Show me something original! 
					
					Love or hate Starship Troopers, you cannot help but to give thought to Ebert’s brief and well reasoned quote.

			I think a lot of the "people didn't understand Starship Troopers at the time" were "myself and my social circle saw it at a pretty young age and the commentary went over our heads." I know there is an idea that the general movie goer is some slack-jawed mouth breather than can't understand subtlety, but audiences were able to understand Starship Troopers. It is a pretty heavy handed satire.

	Wolf of Wall Street is another common one.

	The first 80% is so much fun that a lot of the audience felt like the point of the movie was "lol this guy is awesome, I'm really rooting for him"

	I'll agree that Fight Club and Scott Pilgrim Vs The World often experience a similar "the first two-thirds are so much fun, I won't focus much on the lesson at the end".  But if your takeaway from Fight Club was "it's an obvious satire of the main character's power fantasy" then I think you're one of the people who misunderstood it too.

	What Palahniuk (and then Fincher) was getting at, I believe, was more like:

	For men growing up at the time, they felt a deep dissatisfaction and frustration.  They felt like their masculinity was being suppressed and devalued by a society that just wanted them to be neutered, obedient drones and consumers.  So this nihilistic "none of it matters, just be a man, get in a fight, burn it all down" ideology was deeply tempting/appealing to them.  It seemed like the answer they were seeking - and indeed it resonated with tons of the movie's audience.

	But it's a dead-end.  Nihilistic self-destruction isn't actually going to solve your problems or fix society or make you feel more fulfilled.  I think Palahniuk (and to some extent Fincher) are trying to say "I get it, I feel for you, I understand why you want to take this path, but don't."  Rather than "satire" of power fantasy.

			I personally don’t think Scorsese did enough to show how Belfort destroyed thousands of lives (if not more) for personal gain. Right now they can still say “this guy was awesome until he abused his wife”. 
			
			No, stealing from the middle-class to become a multimillionaire is not “cool”. I don’t think the film portrays this enough.

			* 🟦 **[whytho____](https://www.reddit.com/user/whytho____)** ⬆️ 25 _(2021-03-11 14:57:19)_

				Couldnt agree more with this. WoWS is a failed film in my opinion. Belfort was idolized when it came out and I bare witness to every freshman and sophomore changing majors to finance to be like him. Not to mention the countless parties that were thrown with WoWS themes.
				
				They never show the victims of the people he stole from. This is unlike most of Scorsese’s others films (Goodfellas, Casino, Taxi Driver) where we see the character reaching a point of darkness and we, as a collective audience, understand the character is highly flawed. This DOES NOT HAPPEN in WoWS because there is an over saturation of decadence. The film ends on a note of Belfort being admired for weathering the storm and still getting out alive and well.
				
				Marty was booed by most of the Hollywood elite after showing this film IIRC because they very much felt the same, he glorified a psychopath who ruined millions of lives and then revived his career.

				* 🟪 **[dicknixon2016](https://www.reddit.com/user/dicknixon2016)** ⬆️ 8 _(2021-03-11 17:19:00)_

					While they don't show the victims of his schemes, Belfort is an absolute monster throughout the movie. The domestic violence and DUIng w/ a baby on board is obviously when it goes real dark, in a story structure way, but there is really no point post-McConaughey in which Belfort is a good guy. The idea that it ends with Belfort being lauded is kind of bonkers to me. The pen selling bit is almost anticipating the guys who would go on to make Leo-as-Belfort Epic Success memes. The one point in which I will concede was an unrepentant act of promotion was an ad Leo did for Belfort's speaking services, but that seems to have been scrubbed from the web. 
					
					&amp;#x200B;
					
					Scorsese makes three hour movies in which the protagonist is a monster for the majority of the running time. If people think they're heroic because we live in a diseased culture, I am not sure you can blame Marty.

					* 🟥 **[whytho____](https://www.reddit.com/user/whytho____)** ⬆️ 9 _(2021-03-11 17:39:48)_

						I absolutely blame Marty, he’s an experienced director who knows what he’s doing. He failed to show what this person did by layering on comedy and giving this POS a platform again. Nobody held a gun to his head and said make this movie. He chose to make it and he has final cut. This 100% on him.
						
						As I’ve said in other comments, he has told stories very similar to this MULTIPLE times and has made sure to show the protagonist being held accountable to some degree. This did not happen in WoWS.

				* 🟪 **[lobbyboy1996](https://www.reddit.com/user/lobbyboy1996)** ⬆️ 8 _(2021-03-11 16:46:06)_

					The point is perspective. You're not watching it as someone who got ripped off by Belfort, the movie is pretty exclusively from the perspective of Belfort and demonstrating the cost of excess. Not only does this hurt others; it's a lifestyle that will suck the soul out of you. And that shot at the end is VERY purposeful.

					* 🟥 **[whytho____](https://www.reddit.com/user/whytho____)** ⬆️ 4 _(2021-03-11 17:02:54)_

						It was not effective. As a film, it failed. It encouraged people to take up this lifestyle as opposed to showing them what it can do to you.
						
						Nobody walked away from Goodfellas or Casino thinking “man I should be a gangster.” Sure there are scenes we can all relate to if not emulate but those films were from the perspectives of monsters and showed the dark downfall. WoWS featured a monster as well, but no dark downfall was shown.
						
						In fact I was with friends who right after seeing it in theaters went and changed their majors to finance. They thought he was “awesome” and they “wanted to live life like that.”
						
						This is not a matter of perspective nor is a matter of opinion, it is a fact. The movie encouraged AND inspired people to move into financial sectors. The only way this can be understood is that the film failed to show the audience the negatives of stealing money and defrauding people. Scorsese sucked off Belfort and refused to show him in a negative light, as filmmaker Scorsese should be ashamed.

							I strongly disagree. The movie is all about crazy, insane excess, and it wears out the viewer that way. And you can't just say, "This isn't a matter of opinion, " because it absolutely is, as all things regarding art are. Just because some people were moved that way by it doesn't mean it was intentional nor that everyone who saw it, or even the majority who saw it, felt that way. I think it's a great movie.

							* ⬛️ **[whytho____](https://www.reddit.com/user/whytho____)** ⬆️ 2 _(2021-03-11 17:47:22)_

								It doesn’t wear out the viewer and it hasn’t worn out the viewer. I’m sorry but this isn’t a matter of opinion at all, this man has been celebrated since the movie came out. His career is back on. He is no longer a pariah. I’m not talking about art persay I’m talking about the effect the art had on society and that affect is palpable. A man who stole MILLIONS and then hid the money so he didn’t have to pay it back, this man is now CELEBRATED and idolized because of WoWS.
								
								It’s a fun movie. It’s well acted. But that isn’t what I’m talking about. I’m talking about the effects of media such as WoWS. Media affects people, it alters perception. We are at a point where we need to understand what we are watching and what affects it will have on society. As far as I’m concerned this was incredibly irresponsible of Scorsese far as storytelling goes. Full stop. Sure it’s fun to watch if it’s a fiction but it isn’t, this is a real story. People lost savings. People lost parents. People lost family. People lost themselves. It is absolutely pathetic to take a story that has done so much damage to a country and shrug it off as “bro it’s just excess chillllll.” It’s not. Showing one side of the story is akin to what FOX or CNN does by telling one side of the story. It’s wrong if it’s based on true events. Fiction has no bounds, but cmon, you can’t sit there and say if your family was destroyed by a con man that you’d be ok with this movie catapulting the criminal back into the spotlight.

									Your perspective on this is so massively screwy there's no way I'm going to change your mind. My perspective is that the effect a movie has on society is not a contributor to its quality. Joker, if it had started what so many were deathly afraid it was going to start, still would be however good it was before that hypothetically happened. Also, entering finance is not an inherently awful thing.  I've seen WoWS maaaaany times, and it wears me out every time. Many others reported the same, because it is EXCESS. As for Jordan Belfort's celebrity, he's entitled to it for all I care (as I don't).  He's a free man now, and it can be interesting for some to hear his thoughts on topics. I don't think WoWS celebrates Belfort anymore than Goodfellas celebrates gangsters or Network celebrates television executives.

					Way to go to miss the point of the movie. Belfort's career was revived way before the movie. His career was revived the minute he stepped out of prison and everyone wanted to be him. The movie isn't a critique of Jordan Belfort. The movie is a satirical critique of a society and capitalist system that makes him thrive and makes everyone want to be him and want his lifestyle (even the FBI officer in the movie that hates him) and makes everyone idiolise him, eventhough he's a piece of shit. The guys you're talking about who came out of the movie loving Belfort are the same guys at the end of the film who are there looking at Belfort in awe, eventhough the guy had just come out of prison and they all knew he ruined a shitton of people's lives. Scorsese didn't fail here. He knew exactly how the audience was going to react to the movie and played around with that.

			* 🟦 **[NedryWasFramed](https://www.reddit.com/user/NedryWasFramed)** ⬆️ 6 _(2021-03-12 00:25:37)_

				But I do think that’s the point. Millionaires don’t face the same consequences and the final shot of the audience watching Jordan in anticipation was a critique of the audience of the movie as well as society. Watching Jordan go nuts was fun and his wild lifestyle was both immoral and appealing. The moral of WoWS was essentially that people aren’t really driven by moral behavior. 
				
				To me the point wasn’t that this one guy got what he deserved, it’s that he didn’t and we, a society that respects money, are the reason that millionaires aren’t  ultimately held accountable.

					That's a fair point, but the audience wasn't given the opportunity to see the damage done - only the opulence. Art reflects society but society also reflects art. This could have been a great way to show people the damage done by the ultra wealthy, but Scorsese decided not do to this. I disagree with that decision.

		You’re definitely right.
		
		Furthermore - Goodfellas is a film that gets so misunderstood. It’s a film about toxic masculinity at its absolute worst. One moment you’re living the high life at the Copacabana getting wined and dined and the next moment you’re digging a shallow grave for a guy your psychopath friends just butchered.
		
		And yet it constantly gets interpreted by dudebros as some kind of positive message about masculinity, about brotherhood and, you guessed it, being “good fellas”. It never fails to astound me how much these people miss the point of the movie, as it’s not exactly subtle.

			>yet it constantly gets interpreted by dudebros as some kind of positive message about masculinity, about brotherhood and, you guessed it, being “good fellas”.
			
			This partially what makes The Sopranos so brilliant. Tony wants so desperately to be a paragon of masculinity like his father's generation; to be "the strong silent type, like Gary Cooper" but his efforts don't give him an outlet for his feelings and anxiety. So, he winds up in therapy, terrified of what the dipshit Goombas around him might think if they found out. The show fucks with that archetype in such an interesting way, showing Tony as the typical mob movie character when he's conducting business, then showing him in therapy as he grapples with the reality of his lifestyle and the bullshit machismo facade he has to hold up at all times.

							It wasn't the first television show to take a more cinematic approach to television (David Lynch's Twin Peaks comes to mind) but it was one of the most successful and provided a proof of concept for networks that uncompromising, mature stories with adult themes and persistent characters were viable. Being on HBO allowed it to explore ideas and have content that were mostly off limits at the time it was made and everything from the writing to the performances was top notch.

		Don't forget Palahniuk was writing from a *gay* male perspective as well. That adds to the homoerotic subtext as well as the ideas of masculinity like how men engage in toxic masculinity for other men's approval. The toxic masculinity fuels that sense of entitlement that left the men so angry. They felt like they were owed a debt by society whether that be through money, women, or respect. 
		
		I think the added context of Palahniuk's identity lends credibility to the view of masculinity and how it can create that frustrated power fantasy of destroying everything.

	I recently re-watched American Pie and holy shit did I not pay attention to what the movie was actually about when I was a teen. The movie is about how, on it's own, sex is not as fulfilling as a real emotional relationship with someone. I just thought it was about how if you're a teenage boy with a brain full of cum, you must trick women into having sex with you. Carried that idea with me for a good fifteen years after watching the movie too.

	I do think that's a fault with the film's messaging, but I don't blame the filmmakers for wanting to make a movie that would sell. Teenage boys want to see boobs and think about sex. I don't know many "horny boy" teen movies that have good messaging. Porky's and Meatballs come to mind.

	Not a film, but *Breaking Bad*. I've heard from fans too many times that it's about an everyman who gets crushed by his society, and finds a way to fight back and win.

	No. Not even close.

	*Breaking Bad* is about a man who is fundamentally evil, but doesn't know it, until he's given an opportunity to find out. From the very start, he makes all the worst decisions, when he has many better ones. He makes the decisions that hand him the power he's always craved but never been able to enjoy, because he's always played by the rules. The moment he elects not to, the thrill is intoxicating for him.

	For awhile, he bumbles around trying to be the person so many fans seem to think he is -- a basically good guy who was just forced by circumstance into doing bad things. But once he embraces the evil, it consumes him wholly and he becomes a superman, the purest realization of his id. A super-villain. And he loves it.

	At the end, he has a moment of clarity about it all, and finally understands what he really is -- and was, all along. And he decides to destroy that person. Which means destroying others like him, and trying to redeem his greatest failure, the enslavement of his sidekick. Which he can only do by risking it all, which he does. And pays the price. He even gives his former sidekick the opportunity to wreak his own revenge upon him, but the offer is declined. And he accepts that. It validates what he now knows, that he's not redeemable, even in death, that there is no justice powerful enough to undo the evil he's wrought.

	The Fountain. Most discussion around the film is from people thinking the movie is about reincarnation or time travel or whatever. 

	There's nothing actually sci-fi about the plot. It's about a woman who is dying of cancer and writing a fantasy story about reincarnation themes, the fountain of youth, etc to come to terms with her own death. She knows she won't finish the book before she dies, so she asks her husband to finish the story for her. 

	The 'conquistador' scenes from the past are her parts of the book. Present day scenes are reality. The sci-fi 'spacey' parts come from her husband - a scientist, not a 'romantic' like her - finishing the book for her, and himself coming to terms with death. When she showed him the Xibalba nebula through a telescope, and told the story about the Mayan reincarnation myth (that people would be reborn there), his 'scientist brain' took her meaning literally, so his contribution to the story is the 'conquistador' literally flying the tree of life (representing his wife) through space so she could be reborn there. 

	The movie got mixed reviews, with people calling the whole thing 'pretentious' while also completely misunderstanding the film. It's a really beautiful and sad movie about coming to terms with endings and finality and loss, and how people cope and find understanding in different ways. It was maddening to see people give it a poor review while simultaneously saying it was about time travel or literal reincarnation or whatever. I usually avoid saying that a movie didn't do well 'just because people didn't get it', but in this case it is frustratingly true.

	Edit: here's a quote from one of the first reviews I pulled:

	>Hugh Jackman plays a time traveller who first pops up as a 16th century conquistador seeking the Fountain Of Youth. He then transports to the modern day as a scientist trying to cure his wife’s terminal illness before playing a 26th century scientist who floats around the heavens with a tree in an enormous bubble. Think I made that last bit up? If only I had, because aside from being ludicrously affected, The Fountain is also as dull as hell. In fact, you might want to take your own time machine along so you can fast-forward yourself to the end credits.

	>As far as the plot goes, I’m at a loss to explain exactly what it’s about – and whoever wrote the press notes didn’t seem to have much of a clue either. As far I can tell, it’s about how we’re all, like, too busy worrying about death to live, yeah? So we should all just chill out a bit and accept that one day we’re going to pop our clogs. Deep, huh?

	That last paragraph, jesus. 'I didn't get it, so it sucks. Deep, huh?'

	Makes me irrationally angry.

	People like to point at The Room and laugh at its stilted dialogue and shitty plot lines but the film actually carries a lot of important themes, most notably about the modern American male.

	Look at Johnny, with his confident attitude, caring nature and active sex life he’s the atypical American Man that people should aspire to, but he’s not, he’s an outsider, an unknown entity in this world, Tommy’s accent wasn’t just for fun, it showed how the masculine male struggles to fit in modern society.

	By comparison Mark has the masculine look down to a tee, he’s blonde, ruggedly handsome and he plays football, but he’s a backstabbing piece of shit who sleeps with Lisa because he has no loyalty. Now you could expect Mark to represent Toxic Masculinity but Tommy does is he subverts those expectations you having Mark shave his beard later in the film. Mark represents the rise of metrosexuality, which is fighting with Johnny’s traditional masculinity for dominance over society. 

	This is why Lisa sleeps with Mark, the values that Johnny holds dear; love, bravery, commitment, can’t fit into modern society if they’re in battle with the softer, sneakier manners of this new breed of males emerging in America. But rather than being completely cynical about it, Tommy takes a bittersweet notes with Johnny’s suicide by having Mark break up with Lisa following Johnny’s death. The ending shows that we are close to losing the Alpha Male, and we need to save what we can before a shock to the system takes it away from us.

	Josie and the Pussycats. Fluffy on the surface, but its primary theme is how unchecked commercialism not only stifles creativity, but is so predatory that it permeates every aspect of our society without us even noticing. 

	To underscore this, every scene has blatant product placement in nearly every shot. McDonald's arches in the shower, Target logo on the plane, etc. It's so ramped up that it becomes absurd, and in effect makes the whole concept of product placement look ridiculous. 

	But because they are using actual brand logos, a good number of people think the film is a hollow shell used to Trojan-horse corporate branding into their film... Except the film explicitly comments on it and demonizes those brands in the process.

		I’m on board for that interpretation of midsommar. The whole film revolves around the relationship that is barely clinging to life, but she fights to save it because she’s so isolated. The cult is where she finds her community and people that actually empathize with her (see the imitation scene where she’s screaming and all the cult followers are echoing her every emotion) giving her the courage to break off the relationship. I’m not advocating that you murder your partner instead of breaking up with them, but the film is essentially a slasher movie, how tf else are you going to portray the climactic breakup that the whole movie has lead up to

		All thay said, the sequel reminded me of a lot of 1970s and 1980s cop movies that promote facism by having this lone good cop go to extraordinary measures to "do the right thing" in the face of a system that can allow criminals to slip through the cracks. The rise of Bolsanaro made a lot more sense to me after seeing that film.

			I disagree. The central conflict between lefty liberals and fascistas is immediately established in the opening sequence, and reinforced by the emotional conflict between Nasciemento and his wife’s boyfriend. Ultimately Nasciemento has to concede and justice is achieved through democratic engagement. I would argue this has a much more negative take on brute force than the original (I.e. the son getting shot) and openly condemns militarization of police

			I get where you are coming from. It is a tenuous line between “humanizing” the villain and justifying him. And if the audience gets the message wrong, it is probably the film’s fault.
			
			However, the film works perfectly fine for me. I never thought the protagonist was the good cop. Quite the opposite, he was violent towards his own family, tortured and killed “suspects” many times during the film. 
			SPOILERS AHEAD:
			The neo-fascist tv presenter on the sequel (who is a satire to a famous one here in brazil) is shown to be hypocritical and corrupt.
			The sequel starts with the protagonist criticizing a human rights activist, but in the end the protagonist acknowledges his merits and joins forces with him.
			The most obvious one is the last shot from the first movie. It shows one of the cop characters pointing a shotgun at the camera (the audience) and pulling the trigger, then the credits roll with a song where the lyrics scream “elite squad will also get you”

				I appreciate this. It's been a while since I watched the film and as an American who have very little knowledge of the political history of Brazil I contextualized the whole thing through 70s and 80s American cinema with some similar themes. I don't even remember whether the song that rolls during the closing credits was subtitled on the American blu ray so I think I missed out on that closing bit altogether, at the very least, I didn't remember the lyrics.

I like the projected arc of David being connected to this descendants.  Without the future segment, we stay in the present timeline of the film and do not glimpse how important David was in the bigger picture of life in the universe.

	Taxi Driver. Many people unironically agree with Travis Bickle and see him as a heroic figure. This of course glosses over Travis's negative characteristics, mainly that he's a pathetic loser who projects an image of hypermasculinity in order to compensate. Even the iconic "you talking to me" scene is just some guy alone in his apartment flashing his guns in front of a mirror and pretending to act tough. Ironically, Travis is very much like the kind of person who would idolize him: someone who engages in violent masculine posturing in order to make up for the fact that they have no aims or direction in life.

	Let's get spicy here, and say that anyone who says that "Let the past die" is the central theme of The Last Jedi is dead wrong. The character who says that is the villain. He can't even do it himself, becoming so obsessed with destroying the past that he can't even complete the goal right in front of him. Meanwhile, the rest of the characters respect the past, but aren't completely defined and dominated by it. Rey keeps the ancient Jedi teachings, but chooses to let the parts that are flawed fall away. Luke chooses to use his mythos and the power that it creates to do good rather than surrendering to hubris. 

	Likewise, I'm making anyone who says some mockingly capitalized nonsense about subverting expectations at me watch the prequels and Rise of Skywalker in palindrome order. Killing Snoke builds on Kylo Ren's character arc, allowing him to grow in an interesting way, hobo Luke is the only logical follow-up from the breadcrumbs TFA dropped and Rey being no one actively refuses to give her what she wants thereby advancing her character by forcing her to seek identity and validation from somewhere other than family history while setting her up as a symbol of what is earned rather than given by birthright and pushing her into an interesting conflict with Kylo Ren whose character is partly built on his obsession with birthright and what he is entitled to as heir to the Skywalker legacy. 

	And before you say anything about how the trilogy should've been planned ahead of time, no, all that was necessary was for them to not chicken out in the final movie and orbitally bombard the film with retcons and fanservice rather. Maybe, like, finish the story they were in the process of telling. Remember, the original trilogy wasn't planned out ahead of time either, and [you can tell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-GPKo8q2Xc&amp;ab_channel=mylingar). 

	Rian Johnson isn't telling you that you should feel bad for liking Star Wars. The way this film uses music and editing tells me that Rian Johnson likes Star Wars too (There's a particular edit that's used in the scenes where people talk through the Force where instead of hard cutting to standard shot-reverse shot, it very quickly and subtly fades - you can see it in the scene where Kylo Ren is considering whether or not to fire on the bridge of the escaping Rebel ships and Leia reaches out to him. I picked up on it after a few watches and when watching Empire, was stunned to realize the same technique is used in the scenes where Luke and Vader are communicating after he escapes Cloud City - TLJ is also ***way*** more respectful of John Williams' music than Skywalker, which is just a mess in how it uses classic themes that represent very specific characters like it ain't no thing. TLJ is really deliberate with how it uses older music) 

	This misconception has annoyed me since the hissy fit started, but I've been even more upset about it since Skywalker came out and was probably the most cowardly film I've ever seen, walking back every unpopular choice that TLJ made and doing everything it could to soothe the enflamed tensions in the fans.

			The subtext of the Yoda and Luke finale is so unsubtle it's practically text but a lot of people completely miss it. "Yoda was just acting like a crazy goofball" was a shockingly common complaint I saw.
			
			With the lightning, Yoda is calling Luke's bluff (made plain by how he teases him by still calling the now-old man "young Skywalker"). Despite the fact that *he himself* was "going to burn it down", Luke's first reaction to the blazing tree is one of shock and panic to save the books (which Yoda is aware that Rey has taken, hence "that library contained nothing that the girl Rey does not already possess").
			
			And of course both have valid points about the failure of the Jedi! The Jedi Order of the prequels *completely* fucked up handling Anakin and Sidious and paid a horrific price - Yoda explicitly states in III that he "failed". But just as he overcame his hesitations and past failures to train Luke he points out that Skywalker has done the same to Rey, and encourages him to take the next, final step to save the Resistance. Not by going SSJ God and obliterating the First Order with raw power but in a way that makes sense with the Force and the characters ("wars not make one great", after all).

				One of the more ridiculous smaller complaints, usually something like "Yoda only acted like a weird guy before Luke knew who he was!". And it's like, if you actually watched the damn movies you'd know that even after that Yoda still would crack jokes and mess with Luke seemingly just for his own entertainment sometimes.

		I think people's issue boils down to Rian Johnson challenging Star Wars in a way that people weren't really looking for from their favourite light-hearted space fantasy romp. When Luke mocks Rey for thinking he can just face down the entire First Order with a lightsaber, he's in effect mocking many of the fans who \*want him to do exactly that\*. The Mandalorian is a great example of this, because as well-done as it was the storytelling itself was extremely safe and simplistic. It's like Favreau and Filoni took a script they wrote when they were 13 and just ran with it, and it works because that's exactly what fans seemed to want.
		
		Frankly, I think Rian Johnson's biggest issue is that he was playing around with sacred cows. Do a Star Wars story in that same vein but NOT fucking around with Luke Skywalker and I think fans would have been a lot more receptive to the themes he was playing around with.

			All that said, hobo Luke displays the same flaws as Original Trilogy Luke pretty strongly and I love the interpretation of the character. I think Johnson got a career-defining performance out of Mark Hamill. But I agree that the portrayal of Luke is probably at the root of why people so viscerally hate it. Most of the things they complain either are total misinterpretations of the film or things that have been part of the franchise for a long, long time.

			I think that's oversimplifying what people's criticisms with TLJ and TLJ Luke are. Disliking Luke's portrayal in TLJ and wanting him to face down the entire First Order are different things. My frustrations with TLJ Luke is that he gave up on the Force and saw that as the right thing to do. I don't really like the idea of him attempting to kill his nephew (and I find what is shown on-screen to not be a convincing course of action for a Luke 20 years older than RotJ Luke), but I guess that could be a mistake in a single moment. I just don't see Luke consciously deciding to give up on Ben, the Jedi, and the Force completely, especially since he had a hand in the creation of Kylo Ren. 
			
			Regarding Mandalorian, yes that was very fan service-y (and along with the other cameos made S2 really all over the place), but the nice part of it for me was that Luke was a Jedi who was on the road to training other Jedi, not that he was kicking ass and taking names.
			
			I do agree that TLJ would be a lot less polarizing if it didn't fuck around with Luke Skywalker.

			> When Luke mocks Rey for thinking he can just face down the entire First Order with a lightsaber, he's in effect mocking many of the fans who *want him to do exactly that*.
			
			The thing is though, it's a fair thing to mock. There was this big, completely out of nowhere, desire from a lot of fans for Luke to be essentially the most awesome old badass of the entire series. And we got that, kinda, but what they wanted was for Luke to be the hero of the movie and that's just a ridiculous expectation.
			
			They would never be satisfied with him just playing the role of Yoda, even though that's exactly what he did. He even does save the day at the end through the most Jedi thing we've seen anyone do in the movies, but that same group was mad that he didn't actually get to laser fight Kylo Ren and I guess an entire army by himself.
			
			The ironic part is these are the same fans who likely complained about Yoda fighting in AotC, and the same ones who think that the prequel Jedi were all flashy fights and no substance.
			
			A reasonable person when confronted with a movie directly saying "hey look this would be ridiculous what are you thinking?" would go "oh, maybe I should reexamine my expectations?" and not "this ruins Star Wars"

			It’s because TLJ didn’t dwell on nostalgia and things we’ve seen before. Star Wars has a huge problem with cramming ‘memberberries into its stories. After the first three movies, there’s been so much copied beats and iconography that not doing that feels almost as if it’s insulting the material. Don’t get me wrong, sometimes it works and makes sense (clone/first order troopers looking like stormtroopers and most of The Mandalorian, for example) but the series can be way too self referential.

			Kinda why I point out the fade edits all the time. It’s a really subtle thing that you don’t pick up without watching the original trilogy a lot and paying close attention. To use that shorthand indicates that someone there was watching the original trilogy closely and paying attention to its cinematography and editing. For all the callbacks in TFA, I didn’t see any details that were so baked into the filmmaking itself. It basically looked like Stephen Spielberg directed a Star War. Not a bad thing, of course, but I feel like Johnson’s approach with techniques like that indicates he really does understand these films.

		TLJ, to me, is sort of about letting go of your past, but different characters talk about it in different ways.
		
		Yoda &amp; Luke are like, we grow from our mentors, etc.
		
		Kylo takes the extreme approach and says burn it all down (also what Yoda did, but Yoda acknowledges to learn from your mistakes).
		
		The movie is really big on "don't meet your heroes" and, by extension, don't get hung up on nostalgia. 
		
		So "let the past die" is sort of a fragment of what the movie is juggling, but that's only one aspect of it, and clinging onto that by itself misses how every other character reacts to that idea.

		* 🟧 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 3 _(2021-03-11 12:38:40)_

			Yep. 
			
			The movie strikes me as sort of a meta-examination of the legacy of Star Wars, its relationship with nostalgia and what the franchise needs to do in order to move forward. 
			
			It’s worth noting that it does sometimes indulge in nostalgia, but never in a way that isn’t extremely intentional and never in a way that doesn’t have an impact on the characters and story. We get a scene of Luke looking at the original Leia recording, but it’s a motivated scene. It has a reason to be there and an impact on Luke. Fresh off Rogue One, which I genuinely like a lot about but really pissed at how often the film throws callbacks in that are meaningless to any of the characters and only matter to the audience, I found Johnson’s approach way better. Seeing Luke have a last conversation with Leia and face down Kylo Ren at the end of the film felt so incredibly earned. It kind of reminded me of how David Lynch used nostalgia in Twin Peaks: The Return. Sparingly, but always in a way that mattered.

				That's a loaded question for me; it's something I've thought about a lot. I've tried to think about TLJ as a standalone movie, TLJ as a follow-up to TFA (which I didn't like for very different reasons), TLJ as a Star Wars movie, and TLJ as a part of the Star Wars franchise. For a franchise movie like TLJ, I have trouble looking at it simply on its own merit. At the very least, how much a movie works as part of the franchise is part of how much I like it. I haven't reconciled everything, I'm still trying to organize my thoughts, and I don't know if I can convey them well. I also concede that on some level, I may just be a petty EU-reader looking for reasons to hate TLJ.
				
				When it comes down to it, I don't like how Luke is portrayed, I think the plot of TLJ is weak, and I think TLJ is as much a storytelling black hole as the other sequel movies.
				
				It's hard to separate being critical of TLJ alone versus being critical of both TFA and TLJ because TFA writes TLJ into a bunch of corners, but that's not TLJ's fault. TLJ is forced to start immediately where TFA left off, and that both breaks the form of previous SW movies and writes Luke into a corner. I agree that the most logical reason that Luke is hiding away is because he purposely exiled himself, but I think there are solutions that could have Luke in hiding and not have abandoned the Force. The spitballing thoughts I had leading up to TLJ were that maybe Luke was weakened after a confrontation with Snoke so he had to recuperate or he was hiding with his surviving students to shield them from Snoke's influence (though that would mean new characters introduced in TLJ).
				
				Narratively, I don't like Luke's confrontation with Ben and the destruction of his academy being told in flashback. I've argued this before, but I think the structure of the OT and PT is part of what gives them a consistent feel. Each movie shows the pivotal moments of the characters' lives, or in other words, the important stuff happens to them on-screen. Luke having a confrontation that leads him to abandon Ben, the Jedi, and the Force is something that should have been a movie on its own. For me, the subverting of expectations with Hobo Luke is as much a narrative issue as a character one because it breaks the structure of the previous movies. A consequence of stuff happening on-screen is that where each character starts at the beginning of each movie follows what happened at the end of the previous movie, even when there are big time gaps.  The last time we see Luke, he's completed his Jedi Trial of confronting Vader, brought Vader back to the light, and revealed to Leia that she can become a Jedi (so it sets the expectation is he'll start a new Jedi Order). So when we see him at the end of TFA/beginning of TLJ and find out he's given up on the Force, it feels cheap IMO because it breaks the storytelling standards of previous movies. This is probably a weak argument when looking at TLJ as a movie on on its own, or maybe it's weak in general, I dunno. But it's part of the reason TLJ Luke doesn't work for me.
				
				I'm (unsurprisingly) not a fan of Luke's characterization also. I've seen people paralleling his about-to-strike-down-Ben flashback with ROTJ about-to-streak-down-Vader, but I think there are fundamental differences. In ROTJ, Luke was in the Emperor and Vader's arena (and it always seemed to me that there was a Dark Side aura aspect to it along with the trash talking). Then Vader goaded him by bringing up Leia, and he reacted with his emotion before stopping himself. In the TLJ flashback, Luke's at his academy, confronting Ben on his own terms, and he's at least 20 years a Jedi. Maybe Snoke somehow influenced Luke in the moment where he raises his lightsaber on Ben, but I don't remember textual evidence of it. There's just too little of it shown on-screen to convince me that that's something Luke would do to a pre-Kylo Ben when he never gave up on Vader even though he only knew Vader as Vader. 
				
				Then, if I accept that that's what happened, I don't believe Luke would decide that giving up on the Force and exiling himself is the best option for saving the galaxy, especially when he had a hand in creating Kylo Ren. I've seen parallels about Yoda warning Luke in ESB, but Yoda's mindset was that Luke needed to be stronger before he could face Vader, not that he should hide away forever. I just don't buy Luke choosing a course of inaction over intervention, based on what we got to see.
				
				Back to Snoke, in the scene where Kylo kills him, he comes off as a wannabe Emperor/pretender to the throne, but then he was supposed to be so powerful that he had been influencing Ben for years. If he's weak, all the more reason Luke should have found a way to save Ben. If he's strong, killing him off in the 2nd movie without giving him background undermines his strength and makes him just an obstacle for Kylo. [Also the fight scene choreography was meh](https://youtu.be/qyzwBWsqqw8). In general, I never really had a sense of scale with the First Order and how imposing they were.
				
				As I recall (perhaps incorrectly), the First Order in TFA was portrayed as a small faction of the old Empire, and TFA ended with the Resistance destroying the Starkiller Base. That seems like it should have been a huge blow since a small faction of the Empire presumably doesn't have the endless resources that the Empire was portrayed to have. Yet TLJ starts with the Resistance on the ropes and the First Order as powerful as ever. Yet they're big enough to rule the galaxy but small enough that they don't have other options for flanking a small Resistance fleet, so they're stuck in a low-speed chase. 
				
				The chase set-up also immediately seemed like an [inferior version of a similar thing in Battlestar Galactica](https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/star-wars-the-last-jedi-exploring-the-films-chase-structure/). It's supposed to be this claustrophobic-feeling thing, but somehow Finn and Rose are able to escape entirely and later come back. The stories of Canto Bight, Rey and Luke, and the slow chase all weaken each other, IMO. Finn gets distracted by the upscale whatevers while his friends are running for their lives with a 16 hour countdown. And meanwhile Rey is training with Luke for what seems like just a day. Yes there are parallels to ESB, but in ESB, the Falcon didn't have the Empire constantly on its tail, it had an asteroid field to hide in, and it had a broken hyperdrive that left the amount of time Luke was training with Yoda to be vague.
				
				The 16-ish hours of fuel reserves, the Canto Bight detour, and the Holdo maneuver shine a light on the fuzzy nature of hyperspace and the passage of time. The OT and PT have always been vague about hyperspace, how it actually works, how long it takes to travel anywhere, etc. The fuel reserve countdown and the Canto Bight detour lock how fast hyperspace travel is in the ST. The Holdo maneuver raises questions about why hyperspace hadn't been weaponized beforehand. I think Star Wars has always been intentionally vague with its rules (a soft magic system), but the way TLJ uses hyperspace as a plot device calls attention to it, and that makes me uncomfortable with how it fits within the SW movies/franchise.
				
				Probably running out of comment space and getting sleepy so random thoughts: I don't get what Luke was trying to do on Crait and what he actually succeeded in doing except distract the FO for a couple minutes, but I am fuzzy on those details. Finn should have been a Jedi. The Poe-Holdo plot was frustrating. Phasma should have been more significant. In the end, maybe I'm being nitpicky with the plot. I just can't assess the movie on deeper levels when it doesn't work for me on simpler levels. 
				
				When I mentioned a story telling black hole, I meant that in terms of the SW franchise as a vehicle for more stories. Obviously that doesn't matter when looking the movie on its own, but I am someone that has read SW books/comic books and played SW video games. With TLJ, the destruction of Luke's Jedi Academy and Luke's failure to train more Jedi kills a lot of interest I have in stories leading up to the sequel trilogy. On Leia's side, the failure of the New Republic is a similar killjoy, but that's more of a TFA thing.
				
				Anyway, those are some of my incomplete/incoherent thoughts.

		This is why people can't discuss this film. Even when you have written up a nice post about it, you still threw in an insult at people who disagree with you. When *everyone* stops doing that, there might finally be an actual conversation about this film on the internet.
		
		There are plenty of things to dislike about the film, just as there are things to like. There's no objectively right answer.

			I’m sorry I have a negative opinion of an Internet hate mob that willfully misinterpreted the film, harassed one of the stars off Twitter, spent a lot of the year following the movie’s release demanding it be erased from canon, called me an idiot many times and then continued to complain when the immediate follow up gave them everything they wanted, all because someone made a movie they didn’t like.

				That's exactly what I'm talking about. You generalise them all into a hate mob, they generalise you into a blind fanboy. Nobody wins that game, least of all those of us who like talking about films.
				
				You can say whatever you want about those people. A lot of people behave childishly on the internet. But the grown up thing to do is not to argue and throw insults over a star wars film, *regardless of the side you're on*.

					And I tried to treat them with respect. Debated honestly, openly, respectfully, told them they didn't have to like the film, just tolerate that other people did and not try to take it away from them. Still got called stupid and all sorts of other things. Condescended to almost every time I talked about it. Given only bad faith arguments much of the time. Just recently, someone accused me of trolling them and blocked me for saying I genuinely liked the film.
					
					I find the vast majority of the fandom that vocally hated this film - one I view as a loud minority - to be hostile and toxic and not worth the respect that I afforded them that time. Every olive branch I tried to extend got burned. I'm keeping the rest of those olives right on the tree.
					
					Edit to add that they made us all lose. I can't be the only one who's noticed that pretty much every major artistic choice Rise of Skywalker made catered to exactly what they asked for. Because of the toxic whining from people who claimed not to care, those of us who did wound up losing an end to a compelling story arc.

						Okay. As long as you know you're playing the same game when you throw insults and treat it as a fact that the film is good, you do you. Sounds like you spent far too much effort on a bad part of the internet, but I wouldn't know.
						
						And no, I think the trilogy was doomed from the start, really. Much like most franchise stuff produced recently, it was made with a committee and without a plan. It's amplified in the final one, but you see it in all of them (even TLJ).

								*It's a fucking Star Wars movie*. It's not some righteous crusade that you are desperately fighting for - you are arguing with a bunch of nerds on the internet. If you felt like you were being insulted, you can either deal with it or move on with your life. Don't hold grudges because someone insulted you over a film.
								
								*I tried* to be nice and civil when I first replied and merely say that using insults in conversations about film is unproductive and rude. I didn't insult you and I didn't defend anyone insulting you - in fact, I'm basically agreeing with you when I say that. You then doubled down on insulting *me*, trying to make out like I'm defending hate or bullying or 'pissing on your head'. I never said that. I said (and I'm saying again): "don't be so childish when you're trying to discuss a film online." That statement goes both ways.
								
								
								I sincerely hope that the irony of this conversation is not lost on you. I tried to make a (I believe) minor, rational point and you immediately generalised me into a group so you could insult people. You decided to insult people who disagree with you rather than consider what they have to say. Sound familiar?

			The well was irrevocably poisoned from day 1. The backlash from a not huge but hardly small group of fans with TLJ was monumental, downright historical in scale and vitriol.
			
			It wasn't just a "bad movie", it was the movie that ruined Star Wars beyond fixing, it was made to anger Star Wars fans by Rian Johnson who hates Star Wars, KMT's character said a bad line so she deserved to be harassed off the internet, it was so bad that they needed their own subreddit that did nothing but reveal in hating on the movie, they actually made multiple petitions to have the movie entirely remade.
			
			It's not that the movie didn't have negative aspects that aren't worth discussing, ask anyone who liked the movie what the flaws are, and odds are they can give you a decent list of genuine issues it had, it's that from go the bulk of negative views being put out on it were hyperbolic hateful messes of vitriol and excessive nitpicking that if applied to any other Star Wars movie would make it sound just as bad.
			
			You can't get offended over a generalization of the negative reaction when it WAS overwhelmingly a "hissy fit". You have no idea the amount of time I spent arguing about that movie for weeks, and months, after it's release. I can promise you that the nuanced takes from the "didn't like it" side were utterly drowned out in a sea of drummed up outrage.

				Agreed. It broke my heart when Disney basically gave that part of the fandom everything they wanted in Skywalker, frustrated me to no end when they couldn’t see that the trilogy’s abysmal ending had a ton to do with them and makes me in general really sad to see people write off every Disney era Star Wars film essentially just because Rise of Skywalker didn’t stick the landing when I actually really enjoy all but Skywalker and Solo.

				It's just unproductive to insult and be rude when talking about a film.

				I mean, sure, but it just sounds like you put a lot of effort into the wrong place. Also, note how that was a long time ago. I realise that your emotions might still be raw, but no one on this thread was being rude about TLJ. Instead, as soon as the discussion started, it was back to name-calling and ensuring that there wouldn't be a productive discussion.

	But one person who **did** get it was Roger Corman, in his knockoff, *Death Race 2000*. And he hadn't even seen *Rollerball* when he made that, but knew what it was about, and had read the story it's based on.

	A Very unpopular answer to this I have is Vampire Academy.  It’s pedigree is the guy who directed Mean Girls and the guy who wrote Heathers, and people treat it like a shitty Twilight bandwagon hack job.  It’s as clever as it’s forefathers, maybe too slick in than the satire is so hard to read you feel a sort of poes law as you’re watching it.  (“Did they earnestly mean that it was that a joke?”)

	The books fan base absolutely hates the movie as well which didn’t help things, as they were the ones most likely to watch it.

	Most of the movies in this thread are not movies that “need to be re-evaluated someday” but just Wolf of Wall Street and Fight Club style movies, where the general public saw it in mass but had split interpretations. Nobody saw Vampire Academy and EVERYBODY misunderstood it, sans a few critics.  It’s a much more subtle Austin Powers level parody of Twilight, Harry Potter, and Disney Princesses.

	*Hud*

	From Wikipedia:

	>Through the character of Hud, Ritt and Newman had intended to show the corruption of modern capitalism and the pitfalls of admiring an individual blindly, without observing his character.[39] Critics, however, did not universally echo this view. Life's review described Hud as "likable, smart, and [with] the potential to measure up to his tough, honorable father"[34] and Saturday Review called him a "charming, raffish monster".[40] According to Outlook, "Hud Bannon is a mean, unscrupulous man who never has even a momentary twinge of conscience or change of heart"; in the end scene, Hud "[p]ulls down the shade on the world of goodness and decency".[35] Pauline Kael initially described the film as an "anti-Western"; she called it an "anti-American film", which was "so astutely made and yet such a mess that it (was) redeemed by its fundamental dishonesty."[41]

	>Although Hud was conceived as an outwardly charming, but morally repugnant character, audiences, especially young people, found him likable, even admirable.[42] Paul Newman said, "We thought [the] last thing people would do was accept Hud as a heroic character ... His amorality just went over [the audience's] head; all they saw was this Western, heroic individual". Martin Ritt later attributed audience interpretation of the character to the counterculture of the 1960s which "changed the values" of the young audiences who saw Hud as a hero.[43]

	*A Clockwork Orange* (it’s *not* trying to glamorize violence)

	Here's an interesting one, Jurassic Park. I've been rewatching old Siskel and Ebert reviews and while they praise the effects, they shit on it. From the wikipedia page, some other reviews at the time:

	>Janet Maslin of The New York Times called it "a true movie milestone, presenting awe- and fear-inspiring sights never before seen on the screen [...] On paper, this story is tailor-made for Mr. Spielberg's talents [but] [i]t becomes less crisp on screen than it was on the page, with much of the enjoyable jargon either mumbled confusingly or otherwise thrown away."[164] 

	>In Rolling Stone, Peter Travers described the film as "colossal entertainment—the eye-popping, mind-bending, kick-out-the-jams thrill ride of summer and probably the year [...] Compared with the dinos, the characters are dry bones, indeed. Crichton and co-screenwriter David Koepp have flattened them into nonentities on the trip from page to screen."[165] 

	>Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, saying, "The movie delivers all too well on its promise to show us dinosaurs. We see them early and often, and they are indeed a triumph of special effects artistry, but the movie is lacking other qualities that it needs even more, such as a sense of awe and wonderment, and strong human story values."

	But now it's far and wide considered a perfect film.

	Also, as a bonus, when Ebert starting doing the show with Roeper, Roeper shit on Fellowship of the Ring so hard, and *immediately* changes his tune for their Two Towers review, then pretends like he always loved the franchise by Return of the King. It's so fucking funny.

		*Jurassic Park* is on my short list of most worthless and stupid films I've ever seen. It's utter, pointless trash, from end to end. There's not a single character I give the tiniest shit about, and I wish they'd all died -- of boredom, or exposure, or stupid accidents that had nothing to do with dinosaurs. Death by dino is too good for them. It's a feature-length demonstration of what at the time was cutting-edge animatronics, and serves as little more than advertising for that -- and, to me, an extremely disappointing demonstration that film audiences will watch just about anything that milks well-known psychological tropes to thrill and entertain. It's about as meaningful as a roller coaster.
