Wow. Wild how successful they've been at hiding in plain sight.

Fresno boy here. Corporate ag is the devil and Cargill is just one of a distressingly small cadre of mega agribiz that have captured virtually all American nutrition sources. They make sure that if want to eat food that won't make you sick in the long run you have to pay premium.

Imo villains like this aren't hiding. Via state violence etc. they are very blatently holding us hostage. They don't fear being glared dead in the eye because people have to look down the barrel of their gun to do so.
