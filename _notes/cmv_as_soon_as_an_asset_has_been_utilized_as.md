## CMV: As soon as an asset has been utilized as collateral to secure a loan, that asset's gains have been realized and should be taxed accordingly, and stock shares given as compensation should be taxed as regular income at the time of transfer.

> This pertains to how many ultra-rich in the US have effective tax rates lower than someone earning $40k a year in a W-2 position - they live off of loans secured with stocks that go untaxed at the time of transfer. To me, this is a disgrace off a system that remains in place because those ultra-rich are the individuals able to contribute large amounts of money to political campaigns. The only counter arguments are "the gains have not been realized" - and "what about Home Equity Loans?". Either confine this area of the tax code to financial instruments or restrict the collateral value to equal to or less than the value at time of purchase. Granted, there would have to be an international treaty to close the loophole or they would just go to other countries to secure loans, but why is this not platform that any politicians are pursuing?

	Getting a loan doesn't realize the value of an asset. You still own the asset, and it can still drop in value by the time you sell it. The loan isn't profit, you have to pay it back. 

	Plus what happens if I buy shares on margin? Do I need to mark them to market every day until I put the cash in my account? What if I buy a rental property with a mortgage? 

	Stock shares as compensation are complicated, but if you're after people like Jeff Bezos you should know that they've had those shares since they started the company from nothing and the shares were worth nothing

		All three of your points are pure misdirection. 
		
		First, nobody said the loan was profit, but the assets used to back that loan do include profit and loss and part of that profit is taxable and shouldn‚Äôt be available for the purpose of loan collateral. 
		
		Second, if you buy shares on margin, you should have to update the basis. If you want to produce additional cash with your assets then you are not holding those assets long term. Being able to generate cash with long term holdings is paradoxical and detrimental to the market. The basis and date should be updated whenever assets are used this way.
		
		Finally, the same is true with a mortgage, especially for a rental, which does not qualify for an exchange. The rules that qualify real estate for an exchange might serve as an exemption in that special case. 
		
		I shouldn‚Äôt be able to use profit to back a loan without paying income tax on the profit.

			You didn't use profit to back a loan. You put up an asset as collateral. There is no profit in that. You're trying to redefine an asset with appreciating value into "profit" so you can make a point, but thats not whats actually happening when you put up collateral for a loan.
			
			What if you default on the loan and lose your collateral? Not only do you lose your collateral, but you would also be forced to pay an additional amount in income taxes because you want the unrealized asset appreciation to be taxed as income the moment it's used as collateral?

				From an accounting standpoint, profit is not made when the asset is sold, it is made when you recognize a net increase in your books across all other accounts. In order to debit an increase in asset value, you must credit the profit/loss account.
				
				As such, it makes sense for profit to be recognized when you use something as collateral, otherwise you would be essentially claiming that you have both made a gain and also not made a gain. 
				
				>What if you default on the loan and lose your collateral? Not only do you lose your collateral, but you would also be forced to pay an additional amount in income taxes because you want the unrealized asset appreciation to be taxed as income the moment it's used as collateral?
				
				When someone defaults, they do not concede their collateral, it is sold as though it was theirs and they still have to pay capital gains on it. There's only an exception to this tax if you become insolvent. So, assuming the value of the asset is the same, there would be no effective difference in the tax.

					Is this right? After looking it up, this seems like you described economic profit. Accounting profit is definitely not the same thing. How is an increase in value considered revenue? I'm genuinely asking because I don't have an accounting background so I may be way off.

						There are certain events in accounting that require you to re-evaluate the value of your assets. Assets move up and down all the time and accounting standards believe it's overkill to worry about trying to determine the value every day, month, year (especially illiquid assets).¬†
						
						
						As such, when an acquisition occurs (most common one), you re-evaluate your assets based on what the new company paid for them (most recent valuation) and adjust the profit/loss on your p&amp;l.¬†

						Okay, well for the record I'm a Software Engineer and not an accountant, but I work on an accounting system for a fairly large car finance company and need to know a) how it works and b) how accounting works for car loans.
						
						The basic tent of accounting is double entry bookkeeping, which you can look up elsewhere, but the gist of it is that all accounts must always sum to zero (in accounting you would normally use debit/credit, but this is pointlessly confusing if you are not an accountant, and we just use positive/negative values.) Basically, whenever you add make some transaction across accounts, the total of the values changing should add to zero, which will keep the books balanced to zero.
						
						Let's say you receive $100 cash from someone, and that means you are going to need to add it to your "cash" account. However, just adding this on its own would cause your books to be unbalanced. You need to take $100 out of another account. Well, that's called the "income" account. You add $100 to cash, and subtract $100 from income (a negative income account means you received money.) This kind of account acts as an "explanation" of where the money came from, you are explaining that the increase in cash "came from" income.
						
						Likewise, when you want to account for an increase in the value of an asset, you need to subtract that increase from another account. You would normally use some kind of "appreciation/depreciation" account to do this; the increase in the value of assets "came from" appreciation.
						
						This is a great and very useful feature of accounting: you can track all of the different *kinds* of incoming and outgoing economic value seperately from the accounts that track your actual assets. Profit/loss is *effectively* just the sum of these "explanation" accounts. In real accounting we would empty these accounts into a profit/loss account at the end of each accounting period.
						
						However, there's a problem sometimes. In car finance, we pay out the cash for a car (let's say $10k) and then we also book the money owed to us as an asset (let's say $11k.) This difference needs to come from somewhere, which will *eventually* be profit/loss, but it doesn't make any sense to book a $1k profit on day one, nor does it make sense to book a $10k loss.
						
						So, what we actually do is we put the $1k difference in a special account used to temporarily hold the difference, and then we recognize a small amount of that asset every day as income. This then becomes profit/loss, and because we spread it daily. If a customer misses a payment, we recalculate everything start to book an immediate loss that will gradually accrue until they catch up.
						
						This way, profit/loss figures are actually very representative of our economic profit.
						
						Now going back to what I was saying before, I believe that it makes sense to tax people on using their assets as collateral for a loan, because in order to do so that higher value needs to be recognized on the balance sheet (it is being recognized by their counterparty.) In order to do this, they would need to book some kind of "profit" somewhere and it's not like this doesn't make complete sense from an accounting standpoint. Yes, it might not be *accounting profit* in a sense, but it *is* clearly the same thing as profit from a simpler view of accounting.
						
						In fact, from what I understand, mark-to-market accounting in this way is already pretty standard so it wouldn't be too hard to add a tax rule for this. "Historical value accounting" where you keep the asset at the value you bought it at is now frowned upon as it's been blamed for many big accounting failures.
						
						Also, remember that lenders should already be accounting for the fact that you would need to pay capital gains on the collateral if they were to force you to sell it, so you already need to be overcollateralized if you collateral is taxable. This would do away with that requirement, so you'd need to put up less collateral, but sell some (or borrow extra) to pay your tax bill.
						
						Finally, remember that capital losses can be used to offset your capital gains tax bill, including those from previous years. So, if you suddenly lost a of capital, your tax bill would be reduced by that same amount in future.

							> The basic tent of accounting is double entry bookkeeping, which you can look up elsewhere, but the gist of it is that all accounts must always sum to zero
							
							This is where it entirely disproves your entire idea though - if accounts must sum zero, but you still own the asset, then you cannot claim its value.  Using the same principle that you want to apply to other loans, a house, or car would need to be realized when purchased as income.  So you purchase a home and immediately need to claim hundreds of thousands of dollars as income because you used it as collateral.  But now you have a ledger that is hundreds of thousands of dollars in the black and not summing out to zero.  The same would be true of a loan in stock.
							
							If you do this with stock you run into the same issue.  You have an asset that you are claiming has "value that needs to be recognized" except that's not how collateral works.  Those assets are not turned into money.  When a bank gives you a loan for your house they don't sell your house to give you the money, just as they don't sell the stocks to fund a loan with stock as an asset.  Thus your books won't balance.

								>So you purchase a home and immediately need to claim hundreds of thousands of dollars as income because you used it as collateral.
								
								No, you only need to recognize additional "gains" if the value of the asset is higher than what you purchased it as.
								
								When you purchase the asset, there is no income or expense, because you did not lose or gain anything. The amount simply went from cash to asset. You would not need to pay any "collateral capital gains tax" because you did not make any capital gainst before using it as collateral.
								
								In order to pay the correct amount of tax, you would first need to revalue the item (which you need to do anyway in order to use it as collateral) and then you would need to recognize the difference as "capital gains."
								
								Basically, it's like you would be selling the stock to yourself. You would pay capital gains tax on any gains you made since you bought the stock, but now you get the write it down at the new value (so you won't need to pay that capital gains again.)

									> No, you only need to recognize additional "gains" if the value of the asset is higher than what you purchased it as.
									
									But that's not what you're claiming.  If I get a loan using my home as collateral, then you expect me to realize the full amount of my loan as "profit" plus I still have the value of my home.  You're double dipping.
									
									>When you purchase the asset, there is no income or expense, because you did not lose or gain anything.
									
									I gained a home...I now own an asset worth the value of the home AND had the same value in a loan.  
									
									>In order to pay the correct amount of tax, you would first need to revalue the item (which you need to do anyway in order to use it as collateral) and then you would need to recognize the difference as "capital gains."
									
									You just doubled back on yourself.
									
									>Basically, it's like you would be selling the stock to yourself. 
									
									Which violates the zeroing of the books.  If I am following your statement here, if I am selling the stock to myself, I have zero gains, because I lost and then reacquired the asset.  There is literally no way in which this makes any sense.

										No, you're just wrong here.
										
										You're thinking that I'm describing a system that taxes the loan as income by forcing you to recognize loan money as profit and then taxing that, but that's *not* what I'm describing.
										
										Under the proposal to tax capital gains when an asset is used as collateral, when you buy a house with a mortgage there would be *no* capital gains tax because the value of the house has not changed since you bought it (because you are buying it and using it as collateral at the same time.)
										
										There is no "double dipping" under this system, it only taxes the gains on an asset once: either when you sell it or when you use it as collateral. You do not need to pay tax for those gains ever again, because doing so effectively *resets* your purchase price to the new value.
										
										Selling yourself the stock is a good way to think about it, and it is balanced too. When you sell yourself the stock, you are not gaining or losing any stock or money, you are simply just paying the taxes on the gains since you bought it (or since you last paid it.)

					It's not a net increase... you've taken on debt. The collateral is only an assurance the loaning agency will be able to collect one way or the other. It has zero involvement with the loan unless you default. Taxing it as if you've sold it doesn't make sense... because you *haven't* sold it yet. You've just promised to if you default.

			So make sure I'm getting this right, you and OP basically want people to pay property taxes twice then? 
			
			Cause if I have something of value that I can use as collateral for a loan, then that object has already been taxed, first as sales if applicable, and secondly as property tax for the duration of my ownership, and in some cases for the duration of my possession, dependent on the details of how you obtained ownership. 
			
			And if the loan was for an object that would be generating income, I would also be already be paying the tax on that income. If the object isn't something that would be generating income, why should the loan itself be taxed as though it was income, when it isn't? 
			
			It's an expenditure to paid back over time, not me going out and getting 3rd mortgages and just pocketing the money. There's a reason that interest for some (not sure if all) loans is tax deductible. 
			
			If you make all loans count as income, the only thing you're going to do is crash the economy.

			At the time of receiving the shares, it's taxed and the capital gains are taxed when the shares are sold.
			
			
			For example (making the math easier), my salary was $100,000 with a 30% bonus. I paid taxes on $130,000. When sold, my shares were $60,000, so I paid captial gains on the additional $30,000.
			
			
			If I took out a loan with the shares at collateral, I still need to pay origination fees and I need to pay back the loan. Every month, I sell shares equal to my monthly payment, in which I'm paying the capital gain tax.
			
			
			In your tax loophole example, how are they paying back the loan? Be it from savings, income, or sale of stock, the money has been taxed at some point in time, or will be taxed (ie sale of shares; capital gains).

					Did you read this?
					
					How do you make the payments and maintenance on the loans? You have to pay them with income from some source, which will be realized and taxed. There's no getting around this.
					
					Even if you lived in a fantasy world where you could just daisy chain more loans to pay the initial ones, spending alot would mean you would quickly become too burdened debt-to-assets wise to get anymore until you paid them off with your own money. Theoretically you could do it indefinitely if you lived very frugally...but you would get the same result by parking your money in treasuries and paying income tax on the 5% coupon.

						> How do you make the payments and maintenance on the loans? You have to pay them with income from some source, which will be realized and taxed. There's no getting around this.
						
						You wait a period of time while the value of your assets grow faster than your interest on your debt.  Then you take out a loan on other assets (probably a slightly smaller fraction of your assets than were used to back the first loan due to appreciation) sufficiently large to pay off the first loan.
						
						So long as your assets appreciate at higher rate than your loan APR(s), you consistently have access to the cash value of a substantial fraction of your assets without ever paying tax.
						
						Is stock making money guaranteed?  Of course not, but unless we see a massive market crash, the trajectory is net positive for any decently diversified portfolio.
						
						It's about as safe as loopholes get, especially if you reserve enough liquid cash to service the debt for a limited period (just to cover off a recession of manageable length).  In the case of a genuine crash, you are the bank's problem rather than the bank being your problem.  The bank will certainly have plenty of other problems at the time besides.
						
						It would probably be in the long term best interest of a stable economy that growth for the sake of growth (or fiduciary duty to maximize returns for shareholders) takes a backseat to acting in the best interests of *stakeholders*.  
						
						But that's not the world we live in, and banking on consistent portfolio appreciation is entirely rational in our current economic and societal conditions.  In light of that, utilizing revolving loans to extract value from stocks and similar assets without selling or paying taxes is equally rational.

			But there is no loophole here.
			
			If you buy a house, you now *own* the house. You are using this asset to secure the loan. Do you need to now pay a significant *tax* because of this?
			
			If you buy a car, you do the exact same thing. You do want to pay a large tax on the car merely because you didn't pay cash?
			
			That is literally what you are advocating here. Taxing an asset used as collateral. 
			
			Apply it to a typical care. Say $25,000. The tax using capital gains rates which may be low is 20%. You want to charge a $5000 tax for using that asset as security because you consider it 'realized'. And - what makes it worse, if I can pay cash, *I don't pay anything*. 
			
			This is why this is a bad idea. Loans aren't income. They just aren't. They are LIABILITIES.

				I don't think these are comparable.  When you buy a car with a loan, that's the original basis of the asset.  There is no gain that occurs, and the item purchased is the collateral.
				
				When you buy a house with a mortgage, that's the original purchase price and basis for the asset.  Again, no gain.  There could be an argument with a cash out refinance, but isn't the scenario you provided.
				
				But let's say you have $100m worth of stock, with a $10m basis ($90m unrealized gain).  You then use this as collateral to take out a $50m loan to buy a mega yacht, instead of selling stock to do it.  You have now utilized the gains on the stock, but got around paying taxes on that.  OP's suggestion is a way around this.  Pay the capital gains tax, and increase the basis of the stock (so tax isn't double paid when the stock is sold).
				
				I think this is a better solution than a wealth tax

					Why is the value of the basis of asset important?
					
					The loan is tied to market value of the collateral, not what you paid for it. 
					
					I could have a house, own it, and opt to get a mortgage to pay for remodeling.  
					
					What your real complaint is people have assets with significant gains that they can use as collateral for loans. 
					
					It really smacks of you just not liking how people use things they own for their benefit.
					
					>I think this is a better solution than a wealth tax
					
					Taxing unrealized gains is likely going to be tossed by SCOTUS. That leaves only taxing ownership of assets - like real estate. This is not going to be popular for anyone as it it undermines the entire investment game. 
					
					Owning something now costs you money and there are major issues with that. 
					
					If you have a problem with transfer at death, which I think could use reform, address it there. One very easy solution is to limit step up in basis to below the estate tax threshold for transferring assets.

							Even worse, it could cost the government money. Because if you tax gains, you have to credit losses. It is a hell of a way to get the government to subsidize your losses. Take a loan, adjust your basis without having to sell while keeping the asset and getting uncle sam to give you money back.

							There is nothing about putting *an asset* up for collateral that 'realizes' it's gain. NOTHING. It is a private contract where the lender has agreed to hold specific assets as collateral. These assets would be liquidated to attempt to satisfy the outstanding balance in the event of default. Interestingly enough, if those *were liquidated, there would be a realization and tax event*.

									I encumber 100 shares of Amazon for a 2 year loan. It is worth $15k in stock (roughly) for a $10k loan. Lets say my basis was $5k. And realize, *the lender is going to care what my basis is*. 
									
									2 years later, I have repaid the loan, my stock is unencumbered. *My basis is still $5k, even if the stock is now worth $10k or $20k*
									
									If I were to default, the lender has the right to liquidate the securing asset and I would be liable for any capital gains tax then.
									
									Realization requires change in basis. There was no sale or realization of income here. It was an asset encumbered and the unencumbered.
									
									There is no difference here if I chose to use a house for a 2nd mortgage or a classic car. My basis in the asset is not being affected here.

			The bank absolutely would not let you get away with the extra $5k, if your collateral does not cover your remaining loan payment then you are still obligated to pay the remainder.

They may take money from accounts you have open with them, or sue, for example.

			Well first, the deficit.  As a function of GDP, it's not high historically.  It was way higher right after WWII (obvious reasons) but lower prior to stagflation of the late 70's.  It's been pretty flat since the 80's.
			
			Second, the top half of the tax payers pays 88% of all tax [revenues](https://www.heritage.org/taxes/commentary/1-chart-how-much-the-rich-pay-taxes).  The top 1%?  They pay 40%.
			
			Finally, there's some really easy tax amendments that could be made that would tackle things like NYMBY's and people holding wealth.  There's a little discussed part of the tax code called "State and Local Tax" Deductions.  AKA SALT deductions.
			
			I pay over 10K in property tax in NY.  I also pay way more than that in NY income taxes.  But the Federal government allowed me before 2017 to deduct that 100% against my gross income.  So it incentivizes people like me to hold onto real estate.  Why is that?  I could pass that through on my taxes.  If I own 3 rental properties and deduct the total of 18 grand against my gross income, I can possible drop tax brackets.  Add enough deductions, and it's quite reasonable *to pay no federal taxes.*
			
			What's this do?  It incentivizes people to hold real estate.  My plan is simple, by time I retire?   I'll hold enough real estate that deductions should offset a majority of gross income.
			
			Who was the biggest opponent of the 10K SALT cap that Trump passed?  Democrats.  Because blue states like I live in, rely on their heavy tax regimes to prop up inefficient local governments.  The SALT cap expires in 2025.  Allowing it to expire in 2025 has some estimate that the fed will lose over [600 billion](https://taxfoundation.org/blog/salt-deduction-analysis/).
			
			We don't have to enact crazy new tax laws, just clean up the ones we have now.
			
			I say this as a relatively well off tax payer.

Growth is not an absolute good, the finance industry needs to lose this grip on society in the same way that the NRA needs to lose its suffocating grip on society.

	This is such vibe based tax policy it‚Äôs ridiculous. The proposal is based on lurid headlines about how rich people allegedly live with no facts figures or any numbers attached. What is the net income tax being collected here? How many ‚Äúbillionaires‚Äù are you collecting from and how much?

	Because when I think of someone like bezos‚Ä¶ he ain‚Äôt spending billions a year. How much of his shares are encumbered by loans? 

	The problem is the unintended consequences will serve to drive all leverage out of the system. Some might say ‚Äúfine I don‚Äôt need it‚Äù, but we all benefit from leverage. 

	Especially home buyers‚Ä¶.

	For example, if you get a mortgage on buying a house, let‚Äôs call it a $100,000 mortgage‚Ä¶ congrats you now owe the government $25,000 (25%) for tax on the realized value portion of the house you own that you have collateralized to take out a loan to support your lifestyle (of owning the very same house.) 

	At this point you‚Äôll have to carve out some many exceptions to the policy to avoid nuking a wide swath of useful economic activity. 

	You might say ‚Äúwhatever advanced stock traders can suck it, margin/leverage is evil anyways‚Äù. But when commodity markets seize up because traders who reallocate risk can‚Äôt do what they do, and prices of basic things like grains, food, oil, etc go haywire you might care a lot more. 

	In closing: policy that‚Äôs based on vibes and have no relation to how the economy works is bad.

	When an asset is used as collateral, it's use specifically because it might be realized and then be used to pay off the loan in case of delinquency.

	If you tax the value as part of getting the loan, it means the value declines both in terms of current and future amounts, but also for the purposes of taxation.  It will reduce the values of everything and it would be a death spiral.

			It's not a loophole?  
			
			We don't tax unrealized gains.  It's one of the baseline foundations of keeping investment rolling.  You start taxing them, they lose value across the board. If they lose value, fewer people invest, and the value of the stocks plummet further.  Spiral.  Into death.
			
			What you're defending reverberates across *all* investments, not just the ones the rich take part in.  It means less money in banks. It means lenders reconfiguring how they handle other assets with unrealized gains.  It would absolutely crash the world economy, and it wouldn't take long to do so.

				Because the left and Reddit are obsessed with the idea that billionaires aren't paying their fair share of taxes. They attribute most social problems to this and believe if we could only wrest away that sweet sweet cash from those terrible billionaires, we'd solve everything. 
				
				Ami Horowitz has a video where he asks random people how much the rich should pay in taxes and they're surprised to learn they're already paying far more.
				
				Additionally, I guarantee you that they'd never think this should apply to them. If they got a tax bill for the unrealized capital gains on the 50 shares of Ford that they got for their high school graduation which has been sitting in a Schwab account for six years, they'd be furious.

					This isn‚Äôt even remotely why I support this idea. My problem is that this behavior produces additional incentive which is detrimental to the market. It happens to be an incentive which can only be exercised by those who have wealth. It amplifies wealth in small fractions, these small fractions compound, and wealth increases for the wealthy and does not increase for the poor. It is artificial wealth, not based on productivity or innovation.
					
					This policy would barely impact markets and have only a small impact on tax revenues (which would allow us to reduce other taxes), but long term, it would slow the widening of the wealth gap. I think we should do everything we can as a society to slow the widening of the wealth gap.
					
					Not having this policy creates a perverse system where asset prices continue to grow even in recession. The Fed is on the way back to zero percent rates and it‚Äôs going to have this same impact again, massively inflated P/E ratios which are out of control as people borrow against their assets at 3% while the investments they make with those proceeds return 11%. 
					
					This is a drop in the bucket compared to what we should do, but it is a step in the right direction. On a numbers basis, we should target P/E of ~12 the same way we target slow growth of inflation. Fixing our tax policy is the right way to get there, I‚Äôd personally make every change revenue neutral. I‚Äôm not interested in attacking billionaires specifically, but I do think the growth of the billionaire class is a strong indication that our policy is not working as it should.

					> Can you demonstrate the slope is that slippery? I see stocks losing value, but eventually levelling off under a proposed tax like that. 
					
					It's not that the slope is slippery.  It's that the economics are obvious. When you make an investment worth less than what it was before, fewer people invest as a result. If fewer people invest, the value drops further.  If the value continues to drop as a matter of policy choices instead of market forces, as proposed here, it becomes a spiral.
					
					This doesn't end with millionaires and billionaires.  They might be the only people who pay the tax, but they invest in the same things the rest of us do.  That means if their investments are losing value because they are no longer secure vehicles to hold wealth, and they reduce investment as a result, we all lose out. 
					
					> Which I don't see as a bad thing. Investors don't need to make as much money as humanly possible on every single stock.
					
					This is incredibly short-sighted.  "Ah, they don't need it."  When capital dries up, what then?  Investment is the lifeblood of the economy.  You don't have to like that it's true, but it's true.
					
					> People not making as much money doesn't mean they make no money. And investors making less money doesn't seem like the end times. Seems like it could be a good thing depending on how the taxes are used.
					
					Let's be clear here: there will be very few taxes collected if this were to somehow become law.  The end result would be that we would stop seeing loans on this collateral being taken, and less investment as a result.  This is nothing more than a wealth tax with extra steps, and it's an incredibly stupid way to try and claw money from the rich. 
					
					What is the actual goal here?  Is it to cut off a type of loan from a certain class of borrower?  Is it to extract more money from investors?  Is it to fund something in particular?  If it's truly the latter, there are much better ways to accomplish it, which is why I think this is really more a punitive measure than a serious proposal.

							I fundamentally disagree here. 
							
							The entire concept is about taxing the ASSETS people use for collateral. (out of jealously and ignorance of the tax code in my opinion). You are putting up an asset, the house, in order to get money to pay for it and own it. It is frankly no different than any other ASSET you put up for loans.
							
							You are attempting to wrangle theoretical 'gains' into this. If you accept that, take the refinance situation. Do you now pay taxes on the change in value of the house?
							
							At SCOTUS right now is a case about theoretical gains and taxation. Moore vs US. It is defining what is a taxable event for realization. I am predicting the concept of taxing 'unrealized gains' is going to tossed aside as *not income*. This is also not an 'asset tax' either. (real estate taxes are asset taxes).  
							
							There are ways you can make logical reforms to the tax code but this ain't it. The entire motivation is based on false ideas.
							
							If you don't like billionaires taking out loans rather than realizing gains, simple change the tax code on estates to where assets over say $1 million are not given a free step up in basis. Boom. Problem solved.

							The proposed plan would be to tax the value itself as though it were realized gains - the entire amount.
							
							So in normal circumstances (the loan not being taxed) when you buy the house it roughly equals out with the debt liability (0 gains).
							
							Under the proposed plan you'd owe a tax for the asset (the houses) value at time of closing (and again any time you refinance or take out a second mortgage).
							
							If you instead just apply it to financial interests the rich simply stop using stock as collateral while everyone who takes a loan out against their 401k (fairly common) get fucked up the ass with taxes.

								I don't get that interpretation reading the OP's post.  I don't know where you're getting that.
								
								My interpretation of the OP's proposal is that, every time you refinance, you reevaluate the value of the house (which is probably necessary for using it as collatoral), and pay capital gains tax on the gains since last evaluated.
								
								I don't see anywhere in the OP's post that implies that they think the value of the entire investment asset should be viewed as a gain every time it is used for a loan.

										the OP wrote "As soon as an asset has been utilized as collateral to secure a loan, that asset's gains have been realized and should be taxed accordingly"
										
										to assess gains of an asset, you subtract the value at purchase (or the value of the last time the asset was purchased or when the asset was inherited) from the current value and tax capital gains on that.
										
										The OP didn't say to tax the loan itself.  The OP said to tax the capital gains on the investment asset being used as collatoral.
										
										If that asset isn't stocks, maybe evaluating its current value is harder (that would be a shortcoming of the OP's plan).
										
										But, I don't see anywhere where the OP says to tax the loan.
										
										I don't know what you're reading.  But, what you're saying the OP is implying doesn't make any sense and doesn't appear to fit what the OP said,, at  least to me.

										I didn‚Äôt make any argument. I pointed out that adding an exclusion or limits where a law does not apply is a common practice. We do it with multiple kinds of taxes. It does not mean we‚Äôve ‚Äúmade it so this isn‚Äôt law‚Äù.

						Set a limit of only being able to utilize the balance sheet capital expenses of the company for collateral or pay tax on the difference between the hypothetical sell value and the capital expenses - or just confine this section of the tax code to stocks and financial instruments - the point being, how to fix the "Billionaires are paying effective tax rates of 10% or less" - in many cases.

	How exactly do you think stock prices work? They aren't set by fiat. A stock is worth a certain value because that's what someone is willing to pay for it. You can't tax unrealized value because you don't know what it is. If Jeff Bezos were to take a loan against Amazon stocks at their current value, it would be a massive tax hit. If Jeff Bezos were to actually sell all his Amazon stocks he might get that price for the first share, but dumping hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Amazon stock will tank their value. No one would be able to own a company, or anything really, because as soon as it were worth anything it would be taxed on an arbitrary inflated value. Those lines of credit are operating capital that keep businesses going, and growing. 

	There is absolutely no scenario where this makes sense. What if you take a loan, then pay it back, then take another one? You guys complain about billionaires "hoarding all the wealth" and then you simultaneously want to create a system that makes it impossible to spend any wealth. 

	And shares given as income are taxed as regular income when they're given. When you sell them, the growth is then taxed as a capital gain from the time since you received them.

	Using equity or asset as collateral only encumbers it. I can‚Äôt sell the asset without first paying the debt. Would you tax the amount borrowed? Would you tax earnings on leveraged assets higher? If they pay off the debt and then sell for the value placed when collateral was taken down you tax them on the same gains again? 

	Realized gains are un-encumbered cash, able to be spent. Collateralizing an asset is doing the opposite because they‚Äôre securing a product that prevents them from un-encumbering the cash.

	What documentation do you have that shows people are taking out loans collateralized by stock for day to day living expenses? That is one of the stupidest possible ways to use your money. 

	Anyone with real world financial sense could find any number of tax-free bond vehicles to produce an annual income that was well beyond "living expenses" and it would be the exact opposite of a loan to the individual.  

	There is this common misconception that "rich people" live off of loans. Where is there any evidence that they choose this completely inefficient, poorly devised method for buying groceries over something much more practical and commonplace like investing in tax free municipal bonds as an income stream?

	How much tax revenue are we actually losing with this "scheme"? 

	Serious question. You are about to make a major change to how realized gains are calculated.  So please provide a reasonable estimate of how much revenue this costs the public.

	Whem I have dug into this, I have been unable to discover...

	* a reasonable explanation why this "scheme" actually works, considering that the estate tax exists in most part to make up for the possibility that unrealized gains are untaxed.

	* a real-world based estimate of how much actual tax revenue is lost

	As far as I can tell, this "loan scheme" is a tool that is used on a small scale in specific situations, and not a decades long method to fully avoid taxation.

	* they still need to service the loans. Even interest only loans require payments. Where are the payments coming from? Income that would be taxed.

	* upon death, all loans would have to be settled, and the estate would pay capital gains on any realized gains used to cover the loans

	* after that, the estate tax would be assessed.

	So all I'm asking for is actual proof; I find it ludicrous to think we would make major changes like this simply because we are chasing a ghost that could exist, but I have never seen proof of. 

	Yes, there are Panama papers and other bullshit tax evasion schemes out there; that's a separate issue from the change you are suggesting. (and one we need to deal with, but this doesn't deal with that)

	The second part of your title statement is already true per the IRS (assuming US). 

	For the first part, I‚Äôm assuming you want to nullify billionaires taking loans against shares rather than cashing out. But you have to realize that every car loan and house mortgage is also a perfected security interest (collateral) for a loan. And not saying it‚Äôs right or wrong (though I‚Äôd argue heavily impractical), but you‚Äôd run into people being able to buy cars and take capital losses as soon as they drove off the lot (would be a major loophole since most cars immediately depreciate) and people living in volatile market homes being subject to boom and bust tax situations.

	The problem here is that it'd have to bite for losses.  You'd just start collaterlizing with depreciating assets like cars or stocks that are at a loss.  Then the wealthy would claim the losses.

* üü© **[squirlnutz](https://www.reddit.com/user/squirlnutz)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 5 _(2024-01-13 09:08:15)_

	It can easily be gamed the other way.

	In every portfolio, there are assets that have gained and assets that have lost. Wealthy enough individuals could just structure the loan to be against assets that have lost value over time (or just recently). If by taking out the loan you suddenly ‚Äúrealize‚Äù that gain/loss, they can then live off the loan AND write off that loss without having to actually sell and take the loss. 

	Or, even if they don‚Äôt need or want the loan for living expenses, they can just use taking out a loan against any assets that have underperformed as a way to realize losses in any year where doing so would be advantageous (e.g. to offset gains from a sale of assets). If, after paying of the loan, those assets gain in value, they‚Äôve come out ahead and having paid much less in taxes. You can see how this can be systematically done and would have the opposite of your intended goal, by opening up a whole new way for the ultra wealthy to lower their effective income and avoid taxes.

	E.g. I‚Äôm wealthy and have a chunk of my portfolio in gold based funds. One day gold takes a big hit. Odds are very high that it will go back up, maybe even tomorrow, but today I can quickly take a loan against my gold position and realize that loss on this year‚Äôs taxes. Then I pay back the loan over a few months, gold recovers, and I‚Äôm a big winner.

	Unrealized capital gains are when the stock rises in price but you still own it. If I buy AT&amp;T at $14 and it rises to $16, my unrealized capital gain was $2. If I sell the stock I actually get the $2 so of course that's taxed. However if I don't sell it, I never actually made that money so I shouldn't be taxed on it. If I use it to secure a loan and the price falls to $10, I still have to repay the loan.

	On a practical level, how would you even determine the tax on stock since the value can rise and fall each day?

	Taxing an asset's appreciation may be fair, but the impact is to reduce the capital stock available for investment. Business is the economic foundation of our economy, and capital investment is the foundation of business. Theoretically, you could tax all unrealized appreciation, but you are reducing your ability to create businesses which create jobs and wealth for the country. Investment capital is like the goose that lays the golden eggs, and taxing investment capital is like killing the goose: it provides one excellent meal, but you will no longer get eggs for eternity.

	The entire idea of living off of loans is stupid and is not a mechanic that actually works. On a fundamental level this does not make sense mathematically if you knew even the very basics. This is like trying to keep on rolling over credit card debt into new credit cards thinking that you will never need to pay back the debt. This is completely wrong headed phrasing of a real problem, and so ignorant that it's insulting.

	I just used my 401k as collateral for my first land purchase that I'm going to live in a camper on. Im not wealthy. I don't even have the cash to pay the taxes on my 401k if the gains suddenly became realized. Without my 401k and this "loophole", I would have never been able to afford this place.

	Do you feel like this would affect a lot of people and if so do you feel the money generated from this would be significant enough to affect real change?
