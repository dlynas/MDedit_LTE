BREAKING| Hamas: We reject and strongly condemn the report issued by the UN official Pramila Patten regarding the allegations and claims of "rape and sexual violence" committed by Palestinian resistance fighters during the events of October 7th. This report came after failed Israeli attempts to prove those false charges, which were confirmed to be baseless, aimed only at demonizing the Palestinian resistance and covering up the UN rapporteurs' report on compelling evidence of horrific human rights violations suffered by Palestinian women and girls by the Israeli occupation forces. Despite Mrs. Patten's claims and false accusations against Palestinian resistance fighters, her report did not document any testimony from what she calls victims of these incidents. Instead, she relied on Israeli institutions, soldiers, and witnesses selected by the Israeli authorities to push towards proving these false charges, which have been refuted by all international investigations and reports. Mrs. Patten's allegations clearly contradict the testimonies of Israeli women about the decent treatment they received from the resistance fighters, as well as the testimonies of released Israeli female prisoners who confirmed the decent treatment they received during their captivity in Gaza. This false accusation will not succeed in obscuring the horror of the Zionist crimes, which are being committed in the Gaza Strip, and which resulted in the killing of nearly 40,000 Palestinians, mostly women, children, and civilians, in a genocidal crime and ethnic cleansing, and a deliberate disregard for the decisions of the International Court of Justice and other international reports, which documented parts of the crimes and atrocities committed in Gaza by the new Nazis.

The Intercept article confirms that politicians lied after the confession of the spokesman for Kibbutz BE'ERI.

The one concerned with the matter and the witness to it is the most truthful. Politicians are only interested in misleading and manipulating minds.

Israel is the new Nazi Germany.

The report recycles the same lies propagated by the New York Times hit piece that was utterly dismantled by

thatâ€™s a lot of words coming from the condemned

No one believes them - more Israeli lies 

Until the Palestinians form a new government in Gaza that they won't be heard. Hamas isn't a legal outlet.

I neither trust the American led UN report nor any evidence that Israel provided
