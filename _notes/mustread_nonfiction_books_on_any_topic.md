## Must-read non-fiction books on any topic

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/uzpnt5/mustread_nonfiction_books_on_any_topic/](https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/uzpnt5/mustread_nonfiction_books_on_any_topic/)

> I'm looking for engaging non-fiction books on any particular topic, really. A book that puts forward any one idea in an innovative and unconventional way would be appreciated. It can be anything from science, economics, politics, self improvement, philosophy, anthropology, society, but something basic and targeted towards laypeople, as I'm looking to find my niche when it comes to topics I enjoy talking about with other people.
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> Books I've enjoyed: Atomic Habits, Moonwalking with Einstein, A Brief History of Time, Where Good Ideas Come From, The Power of Habit, Sapiens, The Sixth Extinction.
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> Any non-fiction you've read that you feel has "changed your worldview", as cliched as that sounds, feel free to suggest! Thanks in advance!
> 
> Edit: Wow! now I’ve got a list of books long enough to last me longer than a lifetime! Thank you to everyone who suggested!

		Merlin was featured in one of my fav books of all time, Underland by Rob Mcfarlane. He is the son of a great biologist/mycologist and his chapter is devoted to talking about the mycelluar network of roots that connect trees in forests and it was one of the most fascinating things I'd ever read.
		
		Talking about trees that are lacking nitrogen in their soil being given nutrients from other trees who were rich in the chemical in direct response to pheromonal signals given out by the trees. Amazing stuff. Definitely need to give Entangled Life a read.

		Loved this when it came out. Recently found my old copy in storage and reread it. 
		
		I absolutely adored how the first chapter talks about how we might be launching a probe to Pluto soon and it will take 10 years to get there, and even though we've never seen it, it's probably little more than a frozen iceball. Of course by now, we've been to Pluto learned all sorts of amazing things like it has a giant heart and geologic activity. We know what *the other side* of Pluto looks like and got a picture of its atmosphere as the planet was between the sun and the New Horizons probe. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Pluto
		
		Felt really cool to read that, like I felt the arc of progress and human accomplishment moving ever upward.

			At Home for me too. Short History just felt too much like a barrage of facts to me and not ones yuo remember. Just like things you think about for 4 seconds and then forget which thing was 1 billion times larger than the other thing

	{{Empire of Pain}} by Patrick Radden Keefe 

	{{Blood in the Water}} by Heather Ann Thompson

	* 🟨 **[goodreads-bot](https://www.reddit.com/user/goodreads-bot)** ⬆️ 14 _(2022-05-28 12:19:05)_

		[**Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43868109-empire-of-pain)
		
		(By: Patrick Radden Keefe | 535 pages | Published: 2021 | Popular Shelves: non-fiction, nonfiction, history, audiobook, audiobooks)
		
		>The highly anticipated portrait of three generations of the Sackler family, by the prize-winning, bestselling author of Say Nothing.
		> 
		>The Sackler name adorns the walls of many storied institutions: Harvard, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Oxford, the Louvre. They are one of the richest families in the world, known for their lavish donations to the arts and sciences. The source of the family fortune was vague, however, until it emerged that the Sacklers were responsible for making and marketing OxyContin, a blockbuster painkiller that was a catalyst for the opioid crisis.
		>
		>Empire of Pain is a masterpiece of narrative reporting and writing, exhaustively documented and ferociously compelling.

		[**Blood in the Water: The Attica Prison Uprising of 1971 and Its Legacy**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28007898-blood-in-the-water)
		
		(By: Heather Ann Thompson | 752 pages | Published: 2016 | Popular Shelves: history, non-fiction, nonfiction, true-crime, politics)
		
		>The first definitive account of the infamous 1971 Attica prison uprising, the state’s violent response, and the victims' decades-long quest for justice including information never released to the public published to coincide with the forty-fifth anniversary of this historic event.
		>
		>On September 9, 1971, nearly 1,300 prisoners took over the Attica Correctional Facility in upstate New York to protest years of mistreatment. Holding guards and civilian employees hostage, during the four long days and nights that followed, the inmates negotiated with state officials for improved living conditions. On September 13, the state abruptly ended talks and sent hundreds of heavily armed state troopers and corrections officers to retake the prison by force. In the ensuing gunfire, thirty-nine men were killed, hostages as well as prisoners, and close to one hundred were severely injured. After the prison was secured, troopers and officers brutally retaliated against the prisoners during the weeks that followed. For decades afterward, instead of charging any state employee who had committed murder or carried out egregious human rights abuses, New York officials prosecuted only the prisoners and failed to provide necessary support to the hostage survivors or the families of any of the men who'd been killed. 
		>
		>Heather Ann Thompson sheds new light on one of the most important civil rights stories of the last century, exploring every aspect of the uprising and its legacy from the perspectives of all of those involved in this forty-five-year fight for justice: the prisoners, the state officials, the lawyers on both sides, the state troopers and corrections officers, and the families of the slain men.

		The mass criticism is another reason to read it though. For better or worse, Diamond's work is widely influential which is why it has received so much criticism. OP should still def read GGS and then read some of its criticism, coming to a personal conclusion after that.

* 🟩 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 33 _(2022-05-28 11:58:15)_

	Finding The Mother Tree by Suzanne Simard. Part memoir, part scientific paper, but all heart. It’s a meditation on the natural world and intelligence, and it really makes you feel small, hopefully in a good way. It’s unequivocally changed how I see the world and how I think about the plants and animals we share this planet with, and what we’re taking from them.

	* 🟨 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 7 _(2022-05-28 12:46:03)_

		Added to my 'want to reads' because, in addition to your post, how much I loved and learned from *The Overstory*, a wonderful novel by Richard Powers. Highly recommended for those up for a story/meditation about our relationship with trees.

	* 🟨 **[Affectionate_Deer_19](https://www.reddit.com/user/Affectionate_Deer_19)** ⬆️ 7 _(2022-05-28 12:16:29)_

		Wish I could upvote this a hundred times. It’s such a beautiful book and I think a necessary read. More people have heard of/read The Hidden Life of Trees which touches on similar ideas but this one is far superior imo and written by a leading expert in her field. Dr. Simard is a gem

* 🟩 **[godminnette2](https://www.reddit.com/user/godminnette2)** ⬆️ 36 _(2022-05-28 16:30:47)_

	Instead of a recommendation, as I am seeing some good ones here. Whenever you finish a non-fiction book, please seek out criticism of it, and potential rebuttles to that criticism. It will help give you a deeper understanding of the material.

	* 🟨 **[the_geotus](https://www.reddit.com/user/the_geotus)** ⬆️ 4 _(2022-05-29 04:55:43)_

			Not OP and not a book I necessarily enjoyed but I think everyone who’s read *Sex At Dawn* needs to read *Sex at Dusk* which is a pretty thorough refutation of much of what’s in the original. I’d go as far as to say I think they should be sold as a package deal 😅
			
			Although I haven’t read either of these myself, I know *Guns, Germs, and Steel* and *The Coddling of the American Mind* have both been extensively criticized or debunked by academics and experts in their respective fields.
			
			*Why We Sleep* he been widely criticized as well. There’s a great episode of The Maintenance Phase podcast dedicated to it

					My sister was able to finish the whole thing and she said some of the assertions were too broad to be supported by the evidence given, and she thought they got some stuff wrong in her area of expertise. Personally, I'd take any book that purports to cover "everything" with a grain of salt, even though *Bullshit Jobs* caused me to reform my entire worldview.
					
					I haven't gotten around to reading *Debt* yet. I used to churn through non-fiction books almost two a month, but ever since the pandemic started, I've completely lost momentum.

	As an economist myself - I always recommend Freakonomics (as others have) it’s an entertaining and accessible way to learn the fundamentals that underlie economic theory and might spark more interest in economics.

	Similarly, I think Steiglitz’s The Price of Inequality is a really accessible but economically sounds analysis and explanation of the housing crisis in the US in 2008 and the role of inequality.

	*Destiny of the Republic: A Tale of Madness, Medicine and the Murder of a President* by Candice Millard

	>James Abram Garfield was one of the most extraordinary men ever elected president. Born into abject poverty, he rose to become a wunderkind scholar, a Civil War hero, a renowned congressman, and a reluctant presidential candidate who took on the nation's corrupt political establishment. But four months after Garfield's inauguration in 1881, he was shot in the back by a deranged office-seeker named Charles Guiteau. Garfield survived the attack, but become the object of bitter, behind-the-scenes struggles for power—over his administration, over the nation's future, and, hauntingly, over his medical care. Meticulously researched, epic in scope, and pulsating with an intimate human focus and high-velocity narrative drive, *The Destiny of the Republic* brings alive a forgotten chapter of U.S. history.

	I don't normally read nonfiction, I enjoy it best when it's written in more of a story format. I loved this book, I've recommended it to several people already.

	*In Cold Blood* by Truman Capote

	>On November 15, 1959, in the small town of Holcomb, Kansas, four members of the Clutter family were savagely murdered by blasts from a shotgun held a few inches from their faces. There was no apparent motive for the crime, and there were almost no clues. 

	>In one of the first non-fiction novels ever written, Truman Capote reconstructs the murder and the investigation that led to the capture, trial, and execution of the killers, generating both mesmerizing suspense and astonishing empathy.

	*  A great book about the history of genetics, and the human genome. 

	**Why Fish Don't Exist by Lulu Miller**

	* This book explains why from a Cladistic taxonomists perspective fish do not exist. It's also a biography for David Star Jorden, and autobiography of the author. This book had a profound effect on how I observe the world. Not because of the perspective on fish or the story of the author or Star. What changed my perspective was how fish could represent many of the labels used in the world today. 

	**The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York by Robert A. Caro**

A secret military SWAT team of soldiers and scientists is mobilized to stop the outbreak of this exotic "hot" virus. The Hot Zone tells this dramatic story, giving a hair-raising account of the appearance of rare and lethal viruses and their "crashes" into the human race. Shocking, frightening, and impossible to ignore, The Hot Zone proves that truth really is scarier than fiction.

	If you want something in finance, then "The Psychology of Money" by Morgan Housel is a must read! It talks about how our views on money are shaped by our surroundings, our upbringing,etc. It's really a top-notch book.

	{{The Immortality Key}} by Bryan Muraresku. Basically it’s about Psychedelics and their possible involvement in Ancient Mystery Cults. 

	It’s an idea that’s been around for decades but generally isn’t accepted by mainstream academia. This is a newer take just published in the last couple years and it’s very well researched and I think it’s worth a read.

		[**The Immortality Key: Uncovering the Secret History of the Religion with No Name**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51174256-the-immortality-key)
		
		(By: Brian C. Muraresku | ? pages | Published: 2020 | Popular Shelves: history, religion, non-fiction, nonfiction, philosophy)
		
		>A groundbreaking, controversial dive into the role psychedelics have played in the human experience of the Divine throughout Western history, and the answer to a 2,000 year old mystery that could shake the Church to its foundations.
		>
		>The Immortality Key connects the lost, psychedelic sacrament of Greek religion to early Christianity—exposing the true origins of Western Civilization. In the tradition of unsolved historical mysteries like David Grann's Killers of the Flower Moon and Douglas Preston's The Lost City of the Monkey God, Brian Muraresku’s 10-year investigation takes the reader through Greece, Germany, Spain, France and Italy, offering unprecedented access to the hidden archives of the Louvre and the Vatican along the way.
		>
		>In The Immortality Key, Muraresku explores a little-known connection between the best-kept secret in Ancient Greece and Christianity. This is the real story of the most famous human being who ever lived (Jesus) and the biggest religion the world has ever known. Today, 2.4 billion people are Christian. That's one third of the planet. But do any of them really know how it all started?
		>
		>Before Jerusalem, before Rome, before Mecca—there was Eleusis: the spiritual capital of the ancient world. It promised immortality to Plato and the rest of Athens's greatest minds with a very simple formula: drink this potion, see God. Shrouded in secrecy for millennia, the Ancient Greek sacrament was buried when the newly Christianized Roman Empire obliterated Eleusis in the fourth century AD.
		>
		>Renegade scholars in the 1970s claimed the Greek potion was psychedelic, just like the original Christian Eucharist that replaced it. In recent years, vindication for the disgraced theory has been quietly mounting in the laboratory. The rapidly growing field of archaeological chemistry has proven the ancient use of visionary drugs. And with a single dose of psilocybin, the psycho-pharmacologists at Johns Hopkins and NYU are now turning self-proclaimed atheists into instant believers. No one has ever found hard, scientific evidence of drugs connected to Eleusis, let alone early Christianity. Until now.
		>
		>Armed with key documents never before translated into English, convincing analysis, and a captivating spirit of quest, Muraresku mines science, classical literature, biblical scholarship and art to deliver the hidden key to eternal life, bringing us to what clinical psychologist William Richards calls "the edge of an awesomely vast frontier."
		>
		>Featuring a Foreword by Graham Hancock, the New York Times bestselling author of America Before: The Key to Earth's Lost Civilization.

		[**War and Peace and War: The Rise and Fall of Empires**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18246.War_and_Peace_and_War)
		
		(By: Peter Turchin | 416 pages | Published: 2005 | Popular Shelves: history, non-fiction, politics, war, nonfiction)
		
		>Like Jared Diamond in Guns, Germs, and Steel, Peter Turchin in War and Peace and War uses his expertise in evolutionary biology to make a highly original argument about the rise and fall of empires. Turchin argues that the key to the formation of an empire is a society’s capacity for collective action. He demonstrates that high levels of cooperation are found where people have to band together to fight off a common enemy, and that this kind of cooperation led to the formation of the Roman and Russian empires, and the United States. But as empires grow, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, conflict replaces cooperation, and dissolution inevitably follows. Eloquently argued and rich with historical examples, War and Peace and War offers a bold new theory about the course of world history.

Now I have a series of historical novels on Ceridwen the Dane.  I believe there are 8 books in the series.  I’m so looking forward to reading them.  Other than that, I like to read Barbara Tuchman or David McCoullough.  The Guns of August is instructive on WWI.

	Underland by Rob MacFarlane. Absolutely incredible. Flips your world on it's head and makes you stare it in the eyes.

	Imagine yourself at the top of the Empire State Building, looking down at the street. Everyone looks like ants and cars are slightly larger beetles. You lean over a little further and in your mind you can slightly infer the feeling of unease, skepticism in your movements being so close to the edge of such a high drop to Earth at the fate of gravity.

	Now, imagine yourself in an immensely deep, incredibly dark pit with no beginning and no end.

	Just you in an inconceivably umbral hole, with no senses other than touch, smell, and the faint sound of... A river flowing nearby? No ocular sensation whatsoever. 

	You feel dread. You can imagine the dread you would feel and the reptilian unease that your brain is designed to provoke in situations like this. It is inexorable.

	*THAT* is the very theme the book spearheads illustriously and gorgeously over the course of Rob's many adventures.

	From the Dark Matter Lab in the Bolby Potash mines of the North Sea to "Onkalo" a nuclear repository in Finland designed to house ~1 million tons of nuclear waste for 200,000 years whose only security is a sign written in 17 native languages including Inuit with a simple message I will briefly state: "don't fuck with this, this is humankind's WORST mistake."

	I can link to the actual quote if anyone cares, but it sends shivers down my spine whenever I read the words.

	I’m an American and these are some of the books I’ve read that made me go “Oh. So *that’s* why America is like this. Wow”:

	 *Goliath* by Matt Stoller: for understanding how monopolies and oligopolies have impacted American politics, specifically democracy and how corporate interests are actually reducing the freedoms of democracy that should be guaranteed to American citizens

	*Allow Me to Retort* by Elie Mystal for a wildly funny breakdown of the constitution, the rights it does and does not guarantee, and how many politicians are working to subvert constitutional rights. This is an especially enjoyable read if you are left-leaning, because it points out a lot of the logical fallacies used by right-wing politicians and how to understand what rights you are guaranteed despite what anyone might lead you to believe

	*Ramp Hollow* by Steven Stoll for a better understanding of the tragic history of the American Appalachian region and the wonderfully resilient people there who have been so neglected by the rest of the developed country

	*Heartland* by Sarah Smarsh for a deliciously intelligent and heartfelt memoir of how you can work your ass off and still be broke in the richest country on earth

	Will add more to this as I think of them, but these books were all eye-openers for me
