"You know, the basis of our democracy is supposed to be political dialogue and competition.
You know, 70 percent in a recent Wall Street journal poll, 70 percent of Americans said
they're not just fed up.
They are fighting angry with a political establishment that's thrown them under the bus.
So we shouldn't be in the business of silencing diverse political choices.
We need ranked choice voting to bring our values back into our vote."
