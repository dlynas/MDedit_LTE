On October 12, 1492, Italian explorer Christopher Columbus landed on the American continent. On July 20, 1969, American astronaut Neil Armstrong first walked on the Moon. On May 12, 2019, an anonymous user noclipped “out of reality” and ended up in the Backrooms. After Christopher Columbus’ pillars of Hercules and Neil Armstrong’s Kármán line, the threshold of the Backrooms represents now the furthest _end_ of the world.

At 10:07 PM on the 12th of May 2019, the anonymous user replied to a picture in a thread on 4chan’s /x/ section. The image, [posted](https://web.archive.org/web/20220201004253/https://archive.4plebs.org/x/thread/22661164/#22661164) in response to a call to “post disquieting images that just feel ‘off’” on imageboard website 4chan, depicted an empty office space with yellowish wallpaper and neon lighting.

In reply to the creepy image, the anonymous user wrote: “If you’re not careful and you noclip out of reality in the wrong areas, you’ll end up in the Backrooms, where it’s nothing but the stink of old moist carpet, the madness of mono-yellow, the endless background noise of fluorescent lights at maximum hum-buzz, and approximately six hundred million square miles of randomly segmented empty rooms to be trapped in.”

Four years after the anonymous 4chan post, 3D models of empty office spaces and shopping centers are reproduced endlessly by Internet users on Reddit, Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube. In analogy with the United States flag erected on the surface of the Moon, the green wallpaper and neon lights represent the reproduction of capitalism into the imaginary.

The Backrooms are an example of liminal space (the word _liminal_ is from the Latin _limen_, meaning “threshold”). However, in contrast to other liminal spaces, places of change and passage, such as doorways, escalators, lobbies, and hotels, the Backrooms are means _without_ end. The architecture of non-places as such.

As you noclip out of reality you do not get somewhere, but _nowhere_.

Further related to the above is the meaning of the phrase _no clipping_. In 1994 video game _Doom II: Hell on Earth_, the command IDCLIP enables the player to disable collision detection and, therefore, walk through otherwise solid objects and walls; then, the player is still inside the video game but outside of the gaming space. _To noclip_ thus means to go through the gameable space and, as a result, end up outside of the map and its reality altogether.

**No Escape-ism**

After the map takes the place of the territory, there is _nowhere else to go_.

On the one hand, the naive optimism of flat Earth theories which argue that the map of the world ends _somewhere_: one could swim or jump over it. On the other hand, the pessimism of the Backrooms’ architecture, for instance in Kane Pixels’ short-film adaptation, and its everlasting reproduction. The design of capitalist realism. According to the original 4chan post, the Backrooms are as small as three times the Earth’s surface area; in Kane Pixels’ found footage, the Backrooms are endless.

More than a dystopia and a utopia, the Backrooms are another topos of reproduction: the capitalist utopia of any dystopia.

Also, contrary to Marc Augé’s late-capitalist theory of space, where places are not effaced throughout, the Backrooms are the simulation of space too. The Backrooms do not represent the presence of another reality _elsewhere_ but, rather, the absence of reality as such. The Backrooms are reproduced as if in order to hide that there is no more difference between places and non-places, subjects and spectators. It is the utopia, the u-topos, the non-place, of the screens.

Kane Pixels’ _[Backrooms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITuGdHxHi0A)_ are nothing more than the 4D representation of an impossible exit from capitalism. Only _images_ exit the Backrooms. Yet, the images are not from the present time but a lost future: recorded in 1990 and 1991, and found in 1996… Lastly, uploaded to YouTube in 2022. The future is nothing more than the repetition of the past. Meanwhile, capitalism is the only imaginary able to reproduce itself. Kane Pixels’ found footage, where a research group (the A-Sync Foundation) is analyzing the Backrooms and their potential to produce _more space_ (A-Space™), will be soon developed into a feature-length film from Oscar-winning company A24. Everywhere is the spectacle and the spectacle is everywhere.

The dreams of the end are over. Yet, the nightmares never end. As the comments posted below the eerie images of the Backrooms also show, many people have been dreaming about places like the Backrooms much before the original 4chan post. It is hard not to think about Carl Gustav Jung’s blood-filled dreams and visions of war, a few months before the beginning of WWI. The exception is that, today, the collective unconscious has taken the form of collective informatization.[<sup>1</sup>](https://bluelabyrinths.com/2024/03/14/semiotics-of-the-end-the-backrooms/#sdfootnote2sym) Nightmares have taken the form of zeros and ones.

Kane Pixels’ footage from the Backrooms also feature a tripod-looking monster, known as Bacteria: the living form of the image itself, the viral structure of the hyperreal. It is the representation of everything that, logically, wants our death.

**Noclipping**

Above all, it is the closure of the system that produces fascination. As Jean Baudrillard writes in _For a Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign_: “What fascinates us is always that which radically excludes us in the name of its internal logic or perfection: a mathematical formula, a paranoic system, a concrete jungle, a useless object…”<sup><a href="https://bluelabyrinths.com/2024/03/14/semiotics-of-the-end-the-backrooms/#sdfootnote3sym" id="sdfootnote3anc"><sup>2</sup></a></sup> not to forget the capitalist system and the Kabbalistic conception of God. This is also the fascination that authors like Nick Land and Mark Fisher developed for capitalism: an abstract system that _does not need_ _you_.

The Backrooms are a closed system that is accessed by some fatal error: Internet’s hell. Again, in opposition to other liminal spaces, there is no exit. “_The Backrooms are the result of a threshold that has glitched and keeps on self-generating in a seemingly unstoppable loop_.”<sup><a href="https://bluelabyrinths.com/2024/03/14/semiotics-of-the-end-the-backrooms/#sdfootnote4sym" id="sdfootnote4anc"><sup>3</sup></a></sup> It is noteworthy that the Backrooms went viral during the COVID-19 pandemic: yet another liminal space that takes place in both space and time and reproduces itself endlessly in accordance with the logic of virality.

“When the concept of threshold,” the _limen_ in liminal spaces, “meets that of noclip, a simple boundary line can turn into a habitable place. The glitching threshold might lengthen to generate a space, and this space could switch from a transitory moment into a permanent prison.”[<sup>4</sup>](https://bluelabyrinths.com/2024/03/14/semiotics-of-the-end-the-backrooms/#sdfootnote5sym)

To noclip and get out of the gaming space of capitalism, then. In addition to images and video, the Backrooms are further accessed through simulation video games where players are able to explore and interact with the surroundings. To noclip away from empty offices and shopping centers into what are now only bleak spaces. “No clipping through reality” reads the intertitle of a simulation video game of the Backrooms.

Noclip through the hyperreal. Exit the gaming space and its hyperrealism. Enter noclip mode. _Collision detection_ is disabled. The player is altogether outside of the authorized map and within the same gaming space: the code-cheaters are always already more than players and non-players. There is no difference between function and error anymore. All that was closed by function is now opened to critical errors. Follow the bugs after the end of the world. Noclip into _another_ map. The critical race to whatever is after the end. That is the fascination of the closed system against the allure of the open system.

Later, the _error_ is fixed. The software is debugged. A new patch is installed. The command line is shut down. The imaginary is returned to the reproduction of more signs. Restart. Try again. Find a new cartography.
