The problem comes when there is a recession. People and businesses default on their loans, and lenders are less willing to issue new ones, which effectively contracts the money supply.

Central banks bail out bad actors which perpetuates the incentives that caused these actors to make bad decisions in the first place ("bad" meaning not optimal globally, e.g. selling bonds you know are worthless). If a gold standard was in use, this would simply be impossible. The government would need to increase taxes to bail out the banks, which would be rejected by citizens who are busy hoarding gold and cursing the banks, which means the banks that replaced the bad actors would be incentivized to avoid the mistakes their predecessors made. Alternatively, the GFC may simply not have occurred, because under a gold-standard the banks cannot assume they would be bailed out and this knowledge would cause them to be more risk-averse.

The 2 world wars were fought on debt and broke the gold standard[1]. All wars since have been debt wars [2]. Comparing gold to fiat is in my opinion similar to capitalism vs communism. Do people live on communism - yes. Does the system free up the market to chase efficiency - no.

Notice that you also end up owning 1% of the savings in the economy. If an enterprising individual increases productivity and his company produces more, the value of gold will go up, leading to unearned gains in the value of your savings. Since you own 1% of the economy and the gold standard artificially enforces this against the will of other participants, you will gain a 1% share in the improvements of the company even though you have contributed nothing and taken away potential income from the entrepreneur. If the invention caused the economy to grow by 1% then the entrepreneur would expect to receive a 0.9% in the economy. That share would require everyone to give up 0.9% of their savings. Meaning your savings must go down to 0.91% of the economy. Of course, this doesn't happen in a gold standard which massively hurts the productive economy and that is exactly why there is a constant need to mine out more gold, to let new entrants into the economy as the old ones don't want to give up their gold and let it circulate in the economy.

This is partially due to there not being government debt to help fuel high inflation. I don't know how well this reflects real world economics.</p><p>&gt;The other aspect that is missing from SimCB which could cause hyperinflation is the option for people in an economy to switch to another currency.</p><p>&gt;(…) Now I could still have allowed central bank losses in SimCB's model. This might have made sense especially given that SimCB doesn't have a government to amplify central bank moves by borrowing. Central banks taking a loss, instead of taxing reverse seigniorage, might have simulated government stimulus, allowing the negative interests to act as little helicopter drops of money. Real world governments often borrow and spend during conditions that warrant very low rates (or under any other conditions really) to help put money into circulation.

This dynamic is exaggerated in SimCB. What happens is that when an orchard goes bankrupt, that's ten percent of the economy going offline. Not only that but if that business had loans, those loans get reversed by a negative dividend imposed on people. In a real economy this would happen through banks or other lenders who would be forced to take the hit (since you can't default on the central bank). In any case this results in an instant shrinking of the money supply. The negative dividend acts like a one time tax, people have less money in their bank accounts, spend less on apples, prices drop quickly which makes the other businesses less profitable and go bankrupt.</p><p>In a real economy, usually not 10% of businesses would go down in one go and the central bank would have more time to react. Governments might also take on debt, implement bailouts etc. to help smooth out the situation. I could have implemented some kind of automatic government stabilizer. Or I could have made an economy with a hundred businesses instead of ten, so that these effects were more gradual. Some things to maybe try in future versions.

I think we should be wary of debating a highly technical topic as a layman - it's very easy to be wrong, and it's hard to get feedback from people more versed in these topics. For context - I wanted to be an Austrian economist when I started college, I was majoring in math (real analysis, etc) and econ with the intention of starting an econ phd. I fell in love with computer science instead. I look back on my libertarian / austrian phase as just me having too much time on my hands as a high schooler, being a pretty smart student, and there being a wealth of info online about it. It feels even better as a smart person to think that you know something others don't, including professional economists. I just want people online to be aware of the Austrian rabbit hole, because the von Mises institute is just a think tank in Alabama that's very good at creating an online presence that feels legitimate and scholarly, but it's not really. That's not to say there's not interesting arguments, I'll always be attracted to some libertarian ideas, e.g. some of Walter Block's Defending the Undefendable. But I think most people can relate to having strong convictions about something, growing older, losing the conviction, and then being wary of taking extreme positions in topics that they know little about.</span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="31809157"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="4"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="160"></td><td><center><a id="up_31809157" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=31809157&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D31785199"></a></center></td><td><br><div><p><span>Interesting, can you please share anything, besides that "professional consensus" is different, on what is the problem with the Austrian view of central banks?

You're both correct that I offer no substantive arguments against austrian economics, ABC theory, or their critique of central banks.</span></p><p>I'm not a professional economist. I honestly know very little about the subject (apart from taking intermediate micro / macro and having had an interest in the subject since childhood). I don't think I could argue against the view that "climate change is a hoax" either, because I don't really understand the science. There are many things in my life that I believe despite not being a PhD in the field - and yes, a lot of it relies on appeals to authority and my impression of the world, which we could disagree on. I'm just advocating that we all share a bit of humility when it comes to highly technical topics, and in doing so we should probably defer more to academic consensus. Otherwise, it's essentially like debating religions - fun perhaps, but no one really knows what they're talking about.</p><p>I think we can both agree with the statement that academic economists by and large dismiss Austrian economics. If not, let me know, and I'd be happy to debate that point. Of course, "Austrian" economists have made many meaningful contributions to the field, e.g. Menger's marginal revolution, Bohm-Bawerk's work, Schumpeter's creative destruction, etc. Hayek was a well regarded political and economic thinker.</p><p>However, modern day austrian economics is essentially a think tank that espouses a very hardcore version of libertarianism - claiming that modern economics is a farce, empirical methods are useless, and that inflation is the devil and we need to return to the gold standard. I remember reading Rothbard's The Case Against the Fed and parroting many of the points, having been impassioned by Ron Paul's 2008 presidential campaign. I remember railing against the Fed and its loose monetary policy, absolutely sure that inflation was coming post 2008 (it did not).</p><p>I can't really provide a detailed takedown of Austrian economics, again, because I'm not an economist. All I have is my life experiences of having believed in it ardently, and then not, and then asking myself why I was ever convinced in the first place. Bryan Kaplan, another extremely libertarian / ancap economist, has a critique here that some might find influential: <a href="https://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/whyaust.htm" rel="nofollow">https://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/whyaust.htm</a>. But most serious economists don't even address it, presumably because it's not a part of academic discourse at all. More pop economists from across the spectrum, like Krugman and Friedman, both disparaged it of course.</p><p>The thing to be wary about is that Austrian economics is essentially ignored by mainstream economists, but Austrian believers are extremely passionate and have built up a huge online presence - led by a handful of non-economist political bloggers. So if you google austrian economics, you'll find pages and pages of Mises Institute, Lew Rockwell, etc. It's very easy to fall down the rabbit hole. Meanwhile, academic economists are doing research, not creating pages and pages of "austrian economics is pseudoscience" articles. Listen, if you want to be a libertarian, that's fine by me - but upholding austrian economics to help justify your political beliefs seems a bit unnecessary to me.</p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="31788182"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_31788182" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=31788182&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D31785199"></a></center></td><td><p><span>&gt;Eg. on why any amount of money is always sufficient for any society (assuming it has at least enough precision for the basic needs of the agents).</span></p><p>Until the interest rate on capital falls negative and people start wars.
