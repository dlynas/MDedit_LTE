	"Let's talk about the TikTok van.
	I'm gonna say something controversial
	in your cognitive dissonance will deactivate your critical
	thinking the moment that you feel triggered.
	I'm not trying to offend you,
	but if you find yourself upset, self-reflect.
	I saw something from Cat Williams talking about a liar
	knows the lie that they told.
	If they hide something on their left,
	they're going to keep looking at their left,
	even if they told you that it was on the right.
	And then he went on to say,
	black people have forgotten their identity,
	what people have not forgotten,
	black people's identity.
	This is why we're always under attack.
	TikTok.
	Why is TikTok always under attack?
	Keep seeing videos on it and people are talking about
	because we're realizing we're in an impressive regime.
	And we're fighting back against our government
	because we hate them and we support Palestine.
	That's the tip of the fucking iceberg.
	I've been talking about banning TikTok,
	but this time they're not bluffing.
	And I wanted to know what was different.
	And I think it's because we did something
	that actually worked this time.
	Think about Starbucks, think about Kellogg,
	think about the fact that there's a list going around
	for how many other companies we plan on hitting.
	Instead of trying to eat the rich, we starve the rich.
	I'll have to remember, our government is like NASCAR,
	Congress, your representatives, your senators,
	the people that you think are working for you.
	They are bought and..."

	"privileged people who are part of an oppressed group, the way that you guys
	pervert oppression and marginalization and weaponize it to further push your
	privileged further.
	You call Taylor Swift out for her bad behavior. You're a misogynist. You call out a
	state for genocide and you're an anti-Semite. The way that when you when a
	particular group of people are have any claim to oppression the way that they
	weaponize it to further drive their privilege and minoritize minoritize a
	marginalized people. You will die from the irony. You will die from the irony. I've
	had this this this in me. I've been wanting to say it and I couldn't find the right
	words to say it without standing like something that I'm not. You to first
	understand this."

	"It's attempt to make tic-tac better tick tac toe a winner
	Tic-tac toe a winner
	No
	It's like
	Come on
	Yes, you really did it on
	No, you really did it on
	With that one bro a boss bitch doing boss
	They can't play with
	Don't play with"

	"America is afraid of Haiti, not the land obviously, the people.
	America needs Haiti, not the people obviously, but the land.
	Haiti is still one of the richest countries in the Caribbean, just not by financial stimulus,
	by land.
	Our land still has a lot of valuable resources that a lot of countries are seeking.
	But when you're saying free-hadi, free-hadi, free-hadi, you need to know why you're saying free-hadi,
	because free-hadi from who and free-hadi from what.
	Before I begin, let me just say I haven't done my due diligence, right?
	Because a lot of people have message me, Christina, you're a Haitian, and you seem to be within your
	culture. Why don't you speak about Haiti? Because I cry.
	Anytime I think about what's happening to my country and my people, I cry.
	When I listen to music back home, because a lot of our music talks about our culture or what
	these people have done to us, I cry. Because I'm heavily discouraged when I think about my country
	and what's happening to it.
	But anyway, let's give you a generic understanding, okay?
	And this will obviously involve race, right? Let's think about America for a second.
	A lot of Black Americans"

	"Jewish history is written from an Ashkenazi perspective.
	There is a Eurocentric perspective about Jewish history.
	The American Jewish historian, Salo Barro,
	and spoke about the lacrimal version of Jewish history.
	That is, Jewish history is a never-ending cycle
	of suffering, persecution, discrimination, violence,
	culminating in the Holocaust.
	And I'm prepared for arguments,
	sake, to concede that this is a reasonably,
	a reasonable account of European Jewish history.
	But I strongly deny that this history applies to us,
	the Jews of the Arab lands.
	And I now assert my right to narrate our own history,
	which is very different.
	It's a history of centuries."

	"CIA is Israel. They are one. The United States CIA is Israel. They are one and the same. The CIA was
	established in September 1947. In November 1947, two months later, the UN proposed the two state
	solution between Israel and Palestine. When Palestine refused, that is what kick started the Arab
	Israel War. By May 1948, the Nakhba had happened and they had displaced 750,000 Palestinians. Oh my
	gosh, my time I got Tunis. By the way, did you know that Masad, the Israeli intelligence agency,
	actually means Central Institute for Intelligence and Special Operations in Hebrew?
	The Central Intelligence Agency? The CIA was established for Israel and it is known to be so corrupt,
	so secretive."

	"Say the weird thing, people are desperately seeking realness.
	That's what the f**k is doing, that's what the f**k is doing all over the world."

	"are now going to start hearing the Biden-Harris Administration using the term ceasefire immediate
	ceasefire. This is really important to note because it does not mean that their intention
	actually has shifted. This is a very strategic communications move that is very much about
	supremacist ideology. This is just to mimic the act of aligning their values and their actions
	with the values and actions of the protesters which is making a difference in their electability
	etc. Don't be fooled by it. This happens. Remember when Justin Trudeau almost said it and
	then like had to dial it back and he said something else. That was the taboo work and now we're
	going to hear people in the government in the imperial court start using that terminology
	as a way to align. But they're not actually aligning. They're taking the usage of the word
	watering it down so that it doesn't mean what we're saying it means."

	"Okay, so here's some oppressed people math.
	In Palestine, they have something called Zanane,
	which is a drone that flies over the Gaza Strip 24-7,
	and it just buzzes.
	It makes a loud buzzing noise, and it's psychological warfare.
	It just keeps them up, it keeps them on their toes all the time, right?
	If we can admit that LAPD, NYPD, and SFPD,
	all these American police departments are trained by Israeli forces,
	is it a coincidence that LAPD flies over marginalized neighborhoods
	all day long in their helicopters, so close that it just shakes your house.
	Just let you know that they're still there, just know that they're watching.
	They do that all the time, and it's like not a coincidence, obviously."
