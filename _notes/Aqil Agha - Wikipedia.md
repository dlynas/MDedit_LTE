**Aqil Agha al-Hasi** ([Arabic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language"): عقيل آغا الحاسي, given name also spelled _Aqil_, _Aqila_, _Akil_ or _Akili_; military title sometimes spelled _Aga_) (died 1870) was the strongman of northern [Palestine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region) "Palestine (region)") in the mid-19th century, during [Ottoman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire") rule. He was originally a commander of [Arab](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab "Arab") [irregular soldiers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irregular_military "Irregular military"), known as the Hawwara tribe, in the service of the Ottoman governors of [Acre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre,_Israel "Acre, Israel"). His influence in the [Galilee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilee "Galilee") grew as he strengthened his alliances with the powerful [Beni Sakhr](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beni_Sakhr "Beni Sakhr") and [Anizzah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anizzah "Anizzah") tribes of [Transjordan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transjordan_(region) "Transjordan (region)"), and recruited unemployed [Bedouin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedouin "Bedouin") irregulars from [Egypt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt "Egypt") into his own band of irregulars, who thenceforth became known as the Hanadi tribe. He was known by his men and Western travelers to be courageous, cunning and charismatic, all qualities that contributed to his rise as the _de facto_ ruler of the Galilee.<sup id="cite_ref-DerSteen_1-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-DerSteen-1">[1]</a></sup>

Throughout his rule, Aqil remained at least nominally in service to the Ottoman Empire, which paid him for protecting the roads of northern Palestine from Bedouin [raids](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raid_(military) "Raid (military)") and for maintaining the security of this region. He also exacted his own tolls on the local population in return for ensuring their security. His friendly ties with the European governments were partially due to his protection of the local [Christian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Christian "Palestinian Christian") and [Jewish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jew "Jew") communities in the Galilee, including his protection of [Nazareth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazareth "Nazareth") from the [1860 massacres](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1860_Druze%E2%80%93Maronite_conflict "1860 Druze–Maronite conflict") that occurred in [Ottoman Syria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Syria "Ottoman Syria"). Aqil's relationship with the authorities was generally tense and he rebelled directly or indirectly against their local representatives. As a consequence of this frayed relationship, Aqil's employment would frequently be terminated when his activities or influence perturbed the authorities and then reinstated when his services were needed. By the time of his death, his influence had declined significantly. He was buried in his Galilee stronghold of [I'billin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27billin "I'billin").

While Palestine had been under Ottoman rule from the early 16th century, direct imperial administrative rule was challenged by a series of local leaders who exhibited vast influence over local affairs between the 17th and 19th centuries. With the Empire embroiled in the [Crimean War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_War "Crimean War"), the power vacuum created in the area in the wake of [Zahir al-Umar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zahir_al-Umar "Zahir al-Umar")'s rule in the Galilee (1730–1775), [Ahmad Pasha al-Jazzar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazzar_Pasha "Jazzar Pasha")'s rule (1776–1804), and [Muhammad Ali](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_of_Egypt "Muhammad Ali of Egypt")'s rule (1831–1840), was filled by Aqil.<sup id="cite_ref-Scholchp459_2-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholchp459-2">[2]</a></sup> Aqil's demise represented the end of the last local obstacle to Ottoman centralization in Palestine.

## Early life and family [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aqil_Agha&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Early life and family")

Besides anecdotes provided in the writings of European consuls, most of the information on Aqil's life indirectly traces back to a history of the man written by Mikha'il Qa'war, a [Nazareth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazareth "Nazareth") clergyman.<sup id="cite_ref-Scholchp462_3-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholchp462-3">[3]</a></sup> Aqil was born into a [Bedouin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedouin "Bedouin") family,<sup id="cite_ref-Scholchp199_4-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholchp199-4">[4]</a></sup> known later as the Hanadi tribe. The actual Hanadi were an unrelated tribe that came to [Palestine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region) "Palestine (region)") from [Egypt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Egypt "Ottoman Egypt") during Egyptian rule in Palestine (1831–1840) and around 1840 joined Aqil's Hawwara tribesmen, who also had migrated from Egypt.<sup id="cite_ref-DerSteen_1-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-DerSteen-1">[1]</a></sup> The name "Hanadi" translates in [Arabic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language") as "[Indians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_people "Indian people")" and the Hanadi irregulars were referred to as such by the inhabitants of Palestine because of their dark skin.<sup id="cite_ref-Finn414_5-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Finn414-5">[5]</a></sup>

Aqil's Hawwara tribesmen in the [Galilee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilee "Galilee") were not related to the well-known [Hawwara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawwara "Hawwara") tribe of [Upper Egypt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Egypt "Upper Egypt"), who were noted for their "bravery, horsemanship, and equipments" according to the [Palestine Exploration Fund](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Exploration_Fund "Palestine Exploration Fund").<sup id="cite_ref-PEF222_6-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-PEF222-6">[6]</a></sup> The Hawwara of the Galilee were actually from the Ainawiyeh tribe of the [Lower Egyptian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Egypt "Lower Egypt") desert region who had entered the service of [Ahmad Pasha al-Jazzar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazzar_Pasha "Jazzar Pasha") while the latter was based in Egypt in the late 18th century. They came with al-Jazzar to northern Palestine when al-Jazzar became the powerful [Acre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre,_Israel "Acre, Israel")\-based [Ottoman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire") governor of [Sidon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidon_Eyalet "Sidon Eyalet") after the death of the [Arab](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab "Arab") strongman of the Galilee, [Zahir al-Umar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zahir_al-Umar "Zahir al-Umar"), in 1776. Al-Jazzar honored the Ainawiyeh tribesmen by giving them the name "Hawwara" to associate them with the famed Hawwara of Upper Egypt.<sup id="cite_ref-PEF222_6-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-PEF222-6">[6]</a></sup>

Aqil's father, [Musa Agha al-Hasi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musa_Agha_al-Hasi "Musa Agha al-Hasi"), himself a commander of Hawwara irregulars in the service of Acre's Ottoman governors, had left Egypt for [Gaza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City "Gaza City") in 1814.<sup id="cite_ref-Scholchp462_3-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholchp462-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Scholchp199_4-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholchp199-4">[4]</a></sup> He was not directly related to the Ainawiyeh or Hawwara tribes, but claimed descent from the Hawwara as a matter of convenience and prestige.<sup id="cite_ref-PEF222_6-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-PEF222-6">[6]</a></sup> Musa originally hailed from the al-Bara'asa tribe of [Cyrenaica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrenaica "Cyrenaica") (modern-day eastern [Libya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya "Libya")).<sup id="cite_ref-Abujaber35_7-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Abujaber35-7">[7]</a></sup> Likewise, [James Finn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Finn "James Finn"), the British consul in Jerusalem (1846–1863), claims Aqil's family was of [Algerian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria "Algeria") or [North African](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_African "North African") origin.<sup id="cite_ref-Finn414_5-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Finn414-5">[5]</a></sup> Musa Agha resided in the Galilee around 1820 and married a [Turkmen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkmens "Turkmens") woman. Aqil was born to the couple in the Nazareth area.<sup id="cite_ref-Abujaber35_7-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Abujaber35-7">[7]</a></sup> According to historian [Adel Manna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adel_Manna "Adel Manna"), Aqil was born in Gaza.<sup id="cite_ref-Mattar347_8-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Mattar347-8">[8]</a></sup> Musa had two other sons, Ali and Salih.<sup id="cite_ref-PEF223_9-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-PEF223-9">[9]</a></sup> Musa died in Gaza in 1830.<sup id="cite_ref-Scholchp462_3-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholchp462-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Scholchp199_4-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholchp199-4">[4]</a></sup>

Aqil's power base consisted of his tribesmen and alliances with other Bedouin tribes, who inhabited both sides of the [Jordan River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_River "Jordan River"). Aqil's brother, Salih Agha, held substantial influence in the [Haifa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haifa "Haifa") region. Mary Rogers, the sister of the English [vice consul](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_consul "Vice consul"), described in detail a banquet in [Shefa-Amr](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shefa-Amr "Shefa-Amr") and a gazelle hunt at the invitation of Salih Agha,<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> while another traveler witnessed the lavish wedding between a son of Salih Agha and a daughter of Aqil Agha on "the plains of [I'billin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27billin "I'billin")", in circa 1857.<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> Aqil married off another of his daughters to a Bedouin [sheikh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh "Sheikh") (chieftain) in Gaza, paying the highest [dowry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowry "Dowry") registered at the time in Gaza: 11,000 [piasters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piaster "Piaster").<sup id="cite_ref-Scholchp206_13-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholchp206-13">[13]</a></sup> The governor of [Hebron](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebron "Hebron") was reported to be a brother-in-law of Aqil.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Sch1993p201_15-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Sch1993p201-15">[15]</a></sup>

### Consolidation of influence [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aqil_Agha&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Consolidation of influence")

Like his father before him, Aqil served various masters, among whom was [Ibrahim Pasha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibrahim_Pasha_of_Egypt "Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt"), the son of Muhammad Ali of Egypt.<sup id="cite_ref-Scholchp462_3-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholchp462-3">[3]</a></sup> Aqil defected from Ibrahim Pasha's army<sup id="cite_ref-DerSteen_1-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-DerSteen-1">[1]</a></sup> and joined local rebels in the [1834 peasants' revolt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peasants%27_revolt_in_Palestine "Peasants' revolt in Palestine") against Egyptian conscription and disarmament measures, leading his Hawwara irregulars in the Galilee.<sup id="cite_ref-Mattar347_8-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Mattar347-8">[8]</a></sup> At some point during the revolt, Aqil helped save the mostly [Druze](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Druze "Druze") village of [Isfiya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isfiya "Isfiya") from being destroyed by Ibrahim Pasha's troops after its inhabitants paid Aqil for protection.<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> As the revolt was suppressed, Aqil and his men left Palestine for [Transjordan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transjordan_(region) "Transjordan (region)"), where they sought the protection of that region's major Bedouin tribes.<sup id="cite_ref-Mattar347_8-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Mattar347-8">[8]</a></sup> During his time in Transjordan he strengthened relations with these tribes.<sup id="cite_ref-Manna199_17-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Manna199-17">[17]</a></sup> When the Ottomans regained control of Palestine in 1840–1841, Aqil returned to the [Lower Galilee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Galilee "Lower Galilee") and was commissioned as a [captain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(armed_forces) "Captain (armed forces)") of ten mounted irregulars.<sup id="cite_ref-PEF287_18-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-PEF287-18">[18]</a></sup> He recruited Egyptian irregulars from the Hanadi tribe and others who were left unemployed following the Egyptian withdrawal. Together with Aqil's Hawwara, they became a formidable local force.<sup id="cite_ref-DerSteen_1-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-DerSteen-1">[1]</a></sup> In 1843, Aqil became the chief of irregulars, known as _[bashi-bazouk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashi-bazouk "Bashi-bazouk")_, in northern Palestine,<sup id="cite_ref-Scholchp462_3-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholchp462-3">[3]</a></sup> and his command was expanded to fifty horsemen.<sup id="cite_ref-PEF287_18-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-PEF287-18">[18]</a></sup> Aqil's irregulars became known in the area as the Hanadi, although the group's tribal composition was mixed.<sup id="cite_ref-DerSteen_1-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-DerSteen-1">[1]</a></sup>

Aqil angered the _[kaimakam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaimakam "Kaimakam")_ (district governor) of [Acre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre,_Israel "Acre, Israel"), Muhammad Kubrisi, for his intervention in a dispute between two factions of the Catholic Church in Nazareth.<sup id="cite_ref-DerSteen_1-5"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-DerSteen-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-PEF287_18-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-PEF287-18">[18]</a></sup> One of the leaders of the Catholic factions, Sheikh Yusef Elias, had been dismissed by the church and subsequently entered Aqil's protection. He requested Aqil's intercession with Kubrisi, which was unsuccessful. When Sheikh Yusef decided to take matters into his own hands by raising a group of armed partisans in Nazareth, the church was compelled to restore his employment. Kubrisi believed Aqil had backed Sheikh Yusef's actions and accused Aqil of [sedition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedition "Sedition"). Kubrisi recalled Aqil and his Hawwara irregulars to Acre, verbally lambasted them and dismissed them all from service. Aqil was deeply insulted by Kubrisi's words and actions, and subsequently left for Transjordan where he sought the protection of [Emir Fendi Al-Fayez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fendi_Al-Fayez "Fendi Al-Fayez") of the [Beni Sakhr](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beni_Sakhr "Beni Sakhr") tribe.<sup id="cite_ref-PEF287_18-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-PEF287-18">[18]</a></sup>

Aqil secured a durable alliance with the Beni Sakhr, consecrated through his marriage to a woman from the tribe. From Transjordan, he and his band of irregulars raided areas on both sides of the Jordan River until he was invited back to the Galilee by Acre's _kaimakam_ in 1847.<sup id="cite_ref-DerSteen_1-6"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-DerSteen-1">[1]</a></sup> The latter had sought to neutralize Aqil and his allies' marauding activities, and thus pardoned Aqil.<sup id="cite_ref-PEF287_18-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-PEF287-18">[18]</a></sup> He was also given command of 75 _bashi-bazouk_ in the Lower Galilee.<sup id="cite_ref-Scholchp463_19-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholchp463-19">[19]</a></sup> Thereafter, he was commissioned with overseeing that region's security.<sup id="cite_ref-Mattar347_8-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Mattar347-8">[8]</a></sup> In particular, the successive governors of Acre entrusted him with protecting the Galilee's trade routes and maintaining general security in the area, which he did successfully. With time, he became an unofficial _[mutasallim](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutasallim "Mutasallim")_ (tax collector) for much of northern Palestine, including the [Jezreel Valley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jezreel_Valley "Jezreel Valley"), [Safad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safad "Safad"), [Tiberias](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberias "Tiberias") and Nazareth.<sup id="cite_ref-Manna199_17-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Manna199-17">[17]</a></sup> The tax he collected was not on behalf of the authorities, but rather a tribute payment (_khuwwa_) to receive his protection. While this unofficial system proved successful in guaranteeing local security, later historians criticized it as akin to a [protection racket](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection_racket "Protection racket").<sup id="cite_ref-DerSteen_1-7"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-DerSteen-1">[1]</a></sup>

### Encounter with William F. Lynch [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aqil_Agha&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Encounter with William F. Lynch")

 [](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:William_Francis_Lynch_wmm.jpg)

[William F. Lynch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_F._Lynch "William F. Lynch")

In 1848, Aqil assisted an expedition headed by [US Navy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Navy "US Navy") captain [William Francis Lynch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Lynch "William Francis Lynch") to the [Dead Sea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea "Dead Sea"), and became known in the United States and Europe through the publication of Lynch's book that year. Vivid descriptions of Aqil by Lynch are quoted at length in the works of Finn. Lynch's first encounter with Aqil was in the _[divan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divan "Divan")_ of Said Bey, the Ottoman _kaimakam_ of Acre, and is recorded as follows:

> But what especially attracted my attention was a magnificent savage enveloped in a scarlet cloth [pelisse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelisse "Pelisse") richly embroidered with gold. He was the handsomest, and I soon thought also the most graceful being I had ever seen. His complexion was of a rich mellow indescribable olive tint, and his hair a glossy black; his teeth were regular and of the whitest ivory, and the glance of his eye was keen at times, but generally soft and lustrous. With the [tarboosh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarboosh "Tarboosh") upon his head which he seemed to wear uneasily, he reclined, rather than sat upon the opposite side of the divân, while his hand played in unconscious familiarity with the [hilt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilt "Hilt") of his [yataghan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yataghan "Yataghan"). He looked like one who would be 'Steel amid the din of arms, and wax when with the fair.'<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Finnp415_21-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Finnp415-21">[21]</a></sup>

In this meeting, Said Bey had attempted to dissuade Lynch of his plans to travel to the Dead Sea, with Aqil remarking that the Bedouin of the Ghor (Jordan Valley) would "eat them up". Lynch's reply was that "they would find us difficult of digestion," but he suggested that as Aqil seemed to hold influence with these tribes, he would be prepared to pay him to make the trip a more peaceable one.<sup id="cite_ref-Finnp416_22-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Finnp416-22">[22]</a></sup>

After the meeting ended, Lynch pursued Aqil to speak with him alone. He showed him his sword and revolver, which Aqil examined and declared to be the "Devil's invention". Lynch described the weaponry at the disposal of his men and asked Aqil if he thought it sufficient to make the journey to the Jordan, and Aqil replied that, "You will, if anyone can." Lynch later secured Aqil's accompaniment on the trip to the Dead Sea, through the intervention of an ex-[Sharif of Mecca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharif_of_Mecca "Sharif of Mecca"), describing the latter as "our counsellor, sagacious and prudent," and Aqil as, "the bold warrior and the admirable scout."<sup id="cite_ref-Finnp416_22-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Finnp416-22">[22]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> Aqil and his Beni Sakhr allies quashed a party of [Adwan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Banu_Adwan&action=edit&redlink=1 "Banu Adwan (page does not exist)") Bedouin tribesmen when they attempted to rob Lynch's party.

### Hauran rebellion, imprisonment and escape [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aqil_Agha&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Hauran rebellion, imprisonment and escape")

Aqil's irregulars attracted the membership of local individuals and small clans. Along with his alliance with the two powerful tribes of the region, the Beni Sakhr and the [Anizzah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anizzah "Anizzah"), Aqil's autonomy in the Galilee was further strengthened, although he was nominally subordinate to the Ottoman authorities. He based himself in the [Zaydani](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Zayadina "Al-Zayadina") fortress of [I'billin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27billin "I'billin"), a mixed Muslim-Christian village between Acre and Nazareth that was previously fortified by the family of Zahir al-Umar.<sup id="cite_ref-DerSteen_1-8"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-DerSteen-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Scholchp463_19-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholchp463-19">[19]</a></sup> By 1852, Aqil ceased residing in I'billin, preferring the traditional Bedouin lifestyle, dwelling in encampments and among his livestock. At this point, he ruled the area between Shefa-Amr to [Beisan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beisan "Beisan"). He and his Hanadi tribesmen characteristically dressed in brown-striped robes.<sup id="cite_ref-DerSteen_1-9"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-DerSteen-1">[1]</a></sup>

In 1852, he was commissioned by the Ottoman authorities to prevent the spread of a Druze rebellion from [Hauran](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hauran "Hauran") to northern Palestine. He successfully satisfied this request, aided by his Bedouin allies.<sup id="cite_ref-DerSteen_1-10"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-DerSteen-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-PEF288_24-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-PEF288-24">[24]</a></sup> Among his assignments during the rebellion was the protection from Bedouin raiders of a supply route which the Ottomans used to send ammunition to their troops in Hauran. Aqil and his men accomplished the task successfully.<sup id="cite_ref-PEF288_24-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-PEF288-24">[24]</a></sup>

Despite his successes during the Druze revolt, the authorities, with whom he always had a tense relationship, grew wary of his strength and subsequently arrested him in a nighttime raid.<sup id="cite_ref-DerSteen_1-11"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-DerSteen-1">[1]</a></sup> He was sent to [Istanbul](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul "Istanbul") by sea and from there he was sent to serve a prison sentence at the [Widin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidin "Vidin") fortress on the [Danube River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danube_River "Danube River"). Aqil was apparently loaned some money from the [Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Patriarch_of_Jerusalem "Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem"), who had accompanied him on the ship ride to Istanbul, and Aqil used those funds to purchase a fake passport. With the passport and a disguise, he and an [Albanian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania "Albania") inmate named Hasan Agha escaped Widin in 1854 and reached [Salonica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salonica "Salonica"). From there, Aqil departed to [Anatolia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia "Anatolia") and then [Aleppo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleppo "Aleppo"). Aqil resumed his Bedouin lifestyle of raiding and nomadic dwelling.<sup id="cite_ref-PEF288_24-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-PEF288-24">[24]</a></sup>

### Reinstatement and Battle of Hattin [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aqil_Agha&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Reinstatement and Battle of Hattin")

 [](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hittin.jpg)

The [Horns of Hattin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horns_of_Hattin "Horns of Hattin") where Aqil and his men decisively defeated a Kurdish force seeking to oust him from the [Galilee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilee "Galilee") in 1857

At the time of Aqil's escape, the Ottomans were engaged in the [Crimean War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_War "Crimean War") with the [Russian Empire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire "Russian Empire"), which left a domestic security void in its provinces due to the large number of provincial troops deployed to [Crimea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea "Crimea"). To restore security in the Galilee, Aqil was reassigned to his powerful post in the region in 1855.<sup id="cite_ref-PEF288_24-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-PEF288-24">[24]</a></sup> On his return to Palestine, Aqil's Hanadi tribesmen abandoned their conscription orders to serve with the [Ottoman Army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Army "Ottoman Army") in the Crimean War and instead returned to Aqil's service. Aqil was once again charged with protecting the routes of rural Palestine and occasionally Transjordan. He was once commissioned to collect taxes from [Karak](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Karak "Al Karak").<sup id="cite_ref-DerSteen_1-12"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-DerSteen-1">[1]</a></sup>

In Aqil's absence, a garrison of Kurdish irregulars based in Damascus had been left in charge of security in the Galilee.<sup id="cite_ref-PEF288_24-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-PEF288-24">[24]</a></sup> They were commanded by [Shamdin Agha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamdin_Agha "Shamdin Agha"),<sup id="cite_ref-Yarmouk_25-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Yarmouk-25">[25]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-JAP_26-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-JAP-26">[26]</a></sup> but their employment was terminated by Aqil in 1855.<sup id="cite_ref-PEF288_24-5"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-PEF288-24">[24]</a></sup> Meanwhile, scores of Bedouin tribesmen from [Faiyum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faiyum "Faiyum") with kinship ties to Aqil's tribal irregulars had migrated to the [Levant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levant "Levant") as a result of their suppression by [Sa'id Pasha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%27id_of_Egypt "Sa'id of Egypt") of Egypt. Aqil welcomed their membership into his tribal band and their numbers subsequently swelled. He consecrated his relationship with the new arrivals by marrying a daughter of one of their _sheikhs_.<sup id="cite_ref-PEF288_24-6"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-PEF288-24">[24]</a></sup> In May 1856, he defeated the Abd al-Hadi clan of [Arraba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arraba,_Jenin "Arraba, Jenin") in a major clash that ended encroachments by the Abd al-Hadis on Aqil's territory.<sup id="cite_ref-Scholch466_27-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholch466-27">[27]</a></sup>

In 1857, the Beirut-based governor of [Sidon Eyalet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidon_Eyalet "Sidon Eyalet") agreed to Shamdin's request to eliminate Aqil, who, to the consternation of the Ottoman authorities, was ruling the Galilee autonomously by that time. Shamdin, who sought vengeance against Aqil for terminating his service in the Galilee, had complained to the Sidon governor that Aqil was committing treachery by collaborating with the Bedouin tribes against Ottoman authority. The Ottomans, whose dependence on Aqil had decreased with the end of the Crimean War in 1856, found in Shamdin's request a convenient way to end Aqil's growing autonomy.<sup id="cite_ref-PEF288_24-7"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-PEF288-24">[24]</a></sup> When Aqil visited [Beirut](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut "Beirut") to pay his respects to the governor of Sidon, he traveled with "the air of a sultan", according to the American missionary [Henry H. Jessup](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Harris_Jessup "Henry Harris Jessup"), bringing with him a large and heavily armed Bedouin entourage.<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup>

Shamdin's forces, amounting to 600–700 Kurdish irregulars, massed in Tiberias.<sup id="cite_ref-PEF289_29-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-PEF289-29">[29]</a></sup> They were commanded by Shamdin's sons Muhammad Sa'id and Hasan Agha.<sup id="cite_ref-Scholch466_27-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholch466-27">[27]</a></sup> Curious at this deployment, Aqil had requested an explanation from the _kaimakam_ of Acre, but received no response. Thus Aqil concluded that the deployment was part of a conspiracy to upend his rule. In response, Aqil assembled his entire force of irregulars, amounting to some 300–400 men, and marched towards Shamdin's troops. Other Arab tribes volunteered their service, but Aqil declined their participation.<sup id="cite_ref-PEF289_29-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-PEF289-29">[29]</a></sup>

On 30 March, the Kurdish irregulars confronted Aqil's irregulars and Bedouin allies at the [Horns of Hattin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horns_of_Hattin "Horns of Hattin"),<sup id="cite_ref-Yarmouk_25-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Yarmouk-25">[25]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-JAP_26-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-JAP-26">[26]</a></sup> near the village of [Hattin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hittin "Hittin"). For the most part, both sides were armed with swords and spears and to a lesser extent, rifles, rather than the modern weaponry at the Ottoman military's disposal.<sup id="cite_ref-Scholch470_30-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholch470-30">[30]</a></sup> Initially, the battle was going in Shamdin's favor and a portion of Aqil's troops began to flee. However, Salih Agha, Aqil's brother, led his group in a surprise attack against the Kurds.<sup id="cite_ref-PEF289_29-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-PEF289-29">[29]</a></sup> As a result, Shamdin's forces were dealt a decisive blow and commander Hasan Agha was among the 150 fatalities of that battle.<sup id="cite_ref-Yarmouk_25-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Yarmouk-25">[25]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-JAP_26-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-JAP-26">[26]</a></sup>

### 1860 events and protection of Christians [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aqil_Agha&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: 1860 events and protection of Christians")

 [](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nazareth_the_holy_land_1842.jpg)

Drawing of [Nazareth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazareth "Nazareth"), 1839 by [David Roberts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Roberts_(painter) "David Roberts (painter)"), published in _[The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holy_Land,_Syria,_Idumea,_Arabia,_Egypt,_and_Nubia "The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia")_. Aqil was honored by various European governments for protecting the Christians of Nazareth from the [1860 massacres](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1860_Druze%E2%80%93Maronite_conflict "1860 Druze–Maronite conflict")

Aqil had been previously courted by European powers to secure protection for their Christian and Jewish protégés.<sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup> During the [1860 Mount Lebanon civil war](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1860_Mount_Lebanon_civil_war "1860 Mount Lebanon civil war"), anti-Christian animosity spread to [Damascus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus "Damascus") where Christians were massacred by Druze and Muslim mobs. It appeared that the violence would spread to Acre as well, but Aqil issued direct orders to Acre's Muslim residents not to bring harm to the city's Christians, stating he would "chastise ... with his sword" anyone who violated the orders.<sup id="cite_ref-PEF289_29-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-PEF289-29">[29]</a></sup> Aqil also protected the Christian community of Nazareth from harm as their coreligionists elsewhere in Ottoman Syria faced massacres. Part of this protection included warnings to local Bedouin tribes to refrain from assaulting the town and warnings to its Christian and Muslim residents to prepare themselves militarily in case of attack. Aqil maintained a close friendship with Tannous Qawwar, a prominent [Greek Orthodox](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Orthodox_Church_of_Jerusalem "Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem") resident of the town.<sup id="cite_ref-33"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup>

In gratitude for protecting the [Christians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians "Christians") in Nazareth and [Acre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre,_Israel "Acre, Israel"), [Napoleon III](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_III "Napoleon III") of [France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France") presented Aqil a gun and the [Legion of Honor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legion_of_Honor "Legion of Honor") medal in April 1861 aboard his French vessel docked at [Haifa Bay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haifa_Bay "Haifa Bay").<sup id="cite_ref-Scholch468_34-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholch468-34">[34]</a></sup> [Edward, Prince of Wales](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VII "Edward VII") (later King of the [United Kingdom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom")) personally visited Aqil two years later to show his appreciation.<sup id="cite_ref-Manna199_17-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Manna199-17">[17]</a></sup> Aqil offered Edward four [Arabian horses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_horse "Arabian horse"), but Edward politely declined.

His protection of the local Christians and his reputed Algerian origins drew comparisons with [Abd al-Qader al-Jaza'iri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdelkader_El_Djezairi "Abdelkader El Djezairi"), the exiled Algerian rebel who saved many Christians from harm during the 1860 riots in Damascus,<sup id="cite_ref-Scholch468_34-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholch468-34">[34]</a></sup> and with whom Aqil developed ties.<sup id="cite_ref-Scholch471_35-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholch471-35">[35]</a></sup> Aqil realized that European protection would strengthen his position towards the Ottoman rulers.

### Decline of influence [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aqil_Agha&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Decline of influence")

The Ottoman [imperial government](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublime_Porte "Sublime Porte") adopted its [Tanzimat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzimat "Tanzimat") modernization reforms in 1862 and originally entrusted Aqil with enforcing the new law of the land in northern Palestine. Part of these measures were stronger efforts to suppress the Bedouin tribes and decisively end their raiding activities. Aqil was given orders to prevent them from setting up camps in the cultivated lands of the Galilee and forbade the collection of _khuwwa_ tolls from the local inhabitants. Aqil resigned from his post when he was informed that as part of his new assignment he and his men were required to don Ottoman uniforms. He objected to the requirement, insisting that as Bedouin, they were not accustomed to wearing uniforms. He was replaced by one of his Hawwara tribesmen, but Aqil compelled his successor to resign as well. Shortly after his resignation, the requirement of uniforms was canceled and Aqil resumed his assignment.<sup id="cite_ref-PEF289_29-6"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-PEF289-29">[29]</a></sup>

Aqil's closeness with the Europeans disturbed the Ottomans. His relations with the _kaimakam_ of Acre, who in 1863 was Hasan Effendi, were also deteriorating. Since his return to Palestine in 1854, he avoided setting foot in the city, instead assigning a resident representative who engaged the _kaimakam_ on his behalf. Hasan Effendi lodged complaints to the provincial governor in Beirut, Kapuli Pasha, about the misconduct of Aqil's men who extorted the local [peasantry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellahin "Fellahin"). Indeed, Aqil's protection was generally limited to those who could pay for his services or otherwise benefit his interests, including merchants, travelers, monks, pilgrims, Christians and Jews.<sup id="cite_ref-Scholch469_31-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholch469-31">[31]</a></sup>

The Tanzimat proved unpopular with large segments of the population and a Bedouin revolt broke out,<sup id="cite_ref-DerSteen_1-13"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-DerSteen-1">[1]</a></sup> with Transjordanian tribes launching raids against Tiberias and its countryside in the summer of 1863.<sup id="cite_ref-Scholch469_31-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholch469-31">[31]</a></sup> Aqil was unable to stop the raids,<sup id="cite_ref-Scholch469_31-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholch469-31">[31]</a></sup> and may have played a role in the revolt.<sup id="cite_ref-DerSteen_1-14"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-DerSteen-1">[1]</a></sup> In response, the Ottomans dispatched a 2,000-strong, artillery-backed force from Damascus and Acre to Tiberias. The presence of artillery caused the Transjordanian tribes to retreat. Aqil viewed this deployment as an attack on his jurisdiction and issued his resignation in protest, all the while hoping Kapuli Pasha would back down and reject his resignation. To that end, he had Jewish notables from Tiberias and the French consul of Beirut lobby on his behalf, but without success, as Kapuli Pasha, content to see the elimination of a local power such as Aqil, accepted his resignation.<sup id="cite_ref-Scholch470_30-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholch470-30">[30]</a></sup>

After resigning, Aqil left the Galilee for [Tell el-Hesi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tell_el-Hesi "Tell el-Hesi") in the region of Gaza.<sup id="cite_ref-PEF289_29-7"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-PEF289-29">[29]</a></sup> Around this time, Aqil married off a daughter of his to the leading Bedouin _sheikh_ of the area, Rabbah al-Wahaidi.<sup id="cite_ref-PEF290_38-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-PEF290-38">[38]</a></sup> Bedouin raiding, now with the participation of the smaller tribes of the Galilee, resumed not long after Aqil's resignation and concerns by the local merchants and European consuls were voiced to Kapuli Pasha due to the incoming harvest season for cotton and grain from the Galilee and Hauran. Hasan Effendi sought to stem the tide of looting by attempting to play one Bedouin tribe off of the other. Kapuli Pasha was doubtful of this policy's effectiveness and strove to use military force instead. He personally led a contingent of troops in the Galilee and ensured a peaceful harvest through the end of 1863. However, Kapuli Pasha determined that he could not keep a large, permanent military contingent in the Galilee and decided to reinstate Aqil to his former position after lobbying from the British consul of Haifa.<sup id="cite_ref-Scholch471_35-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholch471-35">[35]</a></sup>

Kapuli Pasha's successor, Kurshid Pasha, resumed the anti-Bedouin operations in the Galilee in 1864 and sought to establish in the eastern Galilee four heavily armed forts as a bulwark against further raiding.<sup id="cite_ref-Scholch471_35-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholch471-35">[35]</a></sup> Aqil entered into a conflict with the governor of [Nablus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nablus "Nablus") and member of the Abd al-Hadi family, who tried to arrest Aqil.<sup id="cite_ref-DerSteen_1-15"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-DerSteen-1">[1]</a></sup> Kurshid Pasha dismissed Aqil by the end of the year. Fearing his arrest or death in light of the Ottomans' subsequent deployment of 200 Kurdish irregulars to Tiberias and the presence of military forces from Acre and Beirut in the western Galilee,<sup id="cite_ref-Scholch471_35-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholch471-35">[35]</a></sup> Aqil fled to [Salt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt,_Jordan "Salt, Jordan") in the [Balqa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balqa_(region) "Balqa (region)") area of Transjordan.<sup id="cite_ref-DerSteen_1-16"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-DerSteen-1">[1]</a></sup>

Aqil later moved to Egypt. Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri and [Isma'il Pasha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isma%27il_Pasha "Isma'il Pasha") lobbied the [Ottoman government](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublime_Porte "Sublime Porte") on Aqil's behalf and he was given permission to return to the Galilee in 1866.<sup id="cite_ref-Scholch471_35-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholch471-35">[35]</a></sup> He subsequently inhabited the area of [Mount Tabor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Tabor "Mount Tabor").<sup id="cite_ref-PEF290_38-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-PEF290-38">[38]</a></sup> Despite his return and the reinstatement of a government salary, he was not able to restore his semi-autonomous authority in the region.

## Death and legacy [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aqil_Agha&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Death and legacy")

 [](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ibillin_daher_wall.jpg)

Remains of the [Zaydani](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Zayadina "Al-Zayadina") fortress in [I'billin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27billin "I'billin"). Aqil temporarily lived in I'billin, and the village served as his rural headquarters. He was buried there in 1870.

Aqil died in 1870, although his death was erroneously recorded by [R. A. Stewart Macalister](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._A._Stewart_Macalister "R. A. Stewart Macalister") to have occurred in 1867.<sup id="cite_ref-Scholch471_35-6"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholch471-35">[35]</a></sup> According to Macalister, Aqil died in the vicinity of Shefa-Amr.<sup id="cite_ref-PEF290_38-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-PEF290-38">[38]</a></sup> He was buried in I'billin, his previous Galilee headquarters.<sup id="cite_ref-DerSteen_1-17"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-DerSteen-1">[1]</a></sup> As of the early 1980s, descendants of Aqil still inhabited I'billin.<sup id="cite_ref-Scholch464_39-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholch464-39">[39]</a></sup>

Aqil's son Quwaytin succeeded him as the chief of the Hanadi tribesmen who continued to inhabit the Galilee and its vicinity.<sup id="cite_ref-DerSteen_1-18"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-DerSteen-1">[1]</a></sup> In the late 19th century, Quwaytin's tribe had some 900 members and was based in the northern Jordan Valley. Quwaytin donned the honor cross medallions given to his father by various European governments.<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup> However, Hanadi influence and strength in the region diminished under Quwaytin and was gradually suppressed by various Ottoman actors, eventually reducing the Hanadi to an ineffectual tribe.<sup id="cite_ref-DerSteen_1-19"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-DerSteen-1">[1]</a></sup> Quwaytin's son and successor Rida also entered into Ottoman service and held the title of _[agha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agha_(Ottoman_Empire) "Agha (Ottoman Empire)")_ like Aqil.<sup id="cite_ref-Abujaber36_41-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Abujaber36-41">[41]</a></sup> In the early 20th century, Rida Agha held the equivalent rank of a [lieutenant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant "Lieutenant") and served as commander of police in the [Balqa Sanjak](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balqa_(region) "Balqa (region)") in Transjordan.<sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup>

For nearly two decades Aqil had been a major local power in northern Palestine.<sup id="cite_ref-Scholch207-08_43-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholch207-08-43">[43]</a></sup> He asserted to other tribal _sheikhs_ that the land they roamed in belonged to the [Arabs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab "Arab") and that one day they would take it back from the Turkish Ottoman "conquerors".<sup id="cite_ref-Scholch465_44-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholch465-44">[44]</a></sup> According to Finn, Aqil may have ultimately envisioned forming an Arab confederation in the southern [Levant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levant "Levant") independent of the Ottomans and backed by [France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France").<sup id="cite_ref-Scholch465_44-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholch465-44">[44]</a></sup> However, despite these perceived intentions, Aqil ruled under the auspices of the Ottoman authorities, was paid by them, and was at least partially dependent upon their support. His ties with France and Europe contributed to his power,<sup id="cite_ref-Scholch465_44-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholch465-44">[44]</a></sup> but he lacked the necessary support from these countries to pursue any desire of independence that he had.<sup id="cite_ref-45"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup> Aqil's death marked the removal of "the last obstacle to the implementation of full centralized Ottoman rule" in northern Palestine, according to historian Mahmoud Yazbak.<sup id="cite_ref-46"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup> When full Ottoman centralization in the Galilee was realized, local powers permanently lost their influence over the region's development.<sup id="cite_ref-Scholch207-08_43-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholch207-08-43">[43]</a></sup> That power was instead passed on to wealthy businessmen from [Haifa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haifa "Haifa") and [Beirut](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut "Beirut"), ultimately leaving the [Sursock family](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sursock_family "Sursock family") of Beirut as the new "masters" of the Galilee, according to anthropologist Alexander Schölch; within another half a century, the area was sold to Zionist colonists in the [Sursock Purchase](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sursock_Purchase "Sursock Purchase").<sup id="cite_ref-Scholch207-08_43-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholch207-08-43">[43]</a></sup>

One of the factors Schölch attributes to Aqil's failure to secure an autonomous rule similar to that of the Arab _sheikh_ Zahir al-Umar was Aqil's refusal to accept a [sedentary life](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedentism "Sedentism").<sup id="cite_ref-Scholch472_47-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholch472-47">[47]</a></sup> While I'billin frequently functioned as a headquarters of sorts for Aqil, he did not take up permanent residence there, or anywhere. Instead it served as a symbol of his authority in the Galilee.<sup id="cite_ref-Scholchp463_19-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholchp463-19">[19]</a></sup> Aqil was adamantly a Bedouin and once remarked to William Lynch that it would be a "disgrace" to "till the ground like a _[fellah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellah "Fellah")_".<sup id="cite_ref-Scholch464_39-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholch464-39">[39]</a></sup> The nomadic, marauding lifestyle of Aqil ran counter to the modernization efforts of the Ottomans, which strongly encouraged settlement of the land and [centralization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centralisation "Centralisation"). These processes were eventually embraced by the peasantry and the urban notables, but resisted by the Bedouin tribes whose traditional livelihoods were at risk.<sup id="cite_ref-Scholch472_47-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholch472-47">[47]</a></sup>

Schölch asserts that Aqil contributed little to the socio-economic development of Palestine, and was not a "benefactor of the peasants".<sup id="cite_ref-Scholch473_48-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholch473-48">[48]</a></sup> However, Aqil is described in a mostly positive light by modern-day sources and in local tradition.<sup id="cite_ref-Scholch473_48-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholch473-48">[48]</a></sup> In the [Arab nationalist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_nationalism "Arab nationalism") political atmosphere that followed the Ottoman Empire's fall in 1917, Aqil's Arab identity and his struggles against the Ottomans contributed to the prevailing positive commemoration of his life. Palestinian Christians in particular remember him fondly for protecting Christians during his rule.<sup id="cite_ref-Scholch473_48-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqil_Agha#cite_note-Scholch473-48">[48]</a></sup>
