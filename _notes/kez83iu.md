## What can Biden do to genuinely win over Trump country or voters?

> European here, I'm watching polls on the US presidency with some fear and seeing that Trump is gaining ground in almost all polls. I know polling is early, but Biden will want to pull votes regardless, and it seems sensible to look at how the democrats can win over Trump voting citizens.

> Should Biden/dems try to get policy benefitting Trump voters through? Should they purely talk about how Bidenomics has been successful? Should they get real tough on the immigration so to take wind out of Trumps sails? Should they get dirty and just spread fake news and fight fire with fire? Are there other strategies that you think are effective?

> This question partly stems from my (limited) observation that the dems don't seem to really double down on Any of these strategies. Is it my lack of following US politics or are they occupied with world events and not focusing on campaining? What work is being done and how successful is it?

	There are three bins of voters in this country - republican faithful, democrat faithful, and independent/apolitical/moderate voters.

	In many ways, our elections reduce to getting your faithful to come vote, convincing the other guys faithful to stay home, and presenting the most palatable choice to moderates. The faithful on both sides will be compelled by party-related arguments (abortion, gun reform, blah blah blah) and all three groups will be compelled by the sort of “how are things going” narratives - war, the economy, migration, etc, as well as the universal “would I have a beer with this guy” argument.

	So, what we’re seeing now is that trumps faithful (who are VERY faithful, but represent like 30% of the electorate) are polling strongly for trump and have a lot of enthusiasm. Biden faithful are ambivalent about a lot of things - the youth feeling in many ways left out, Muslims feeling disillusioned with Biden’s support of Israel. Meanwhile, we’re coming off a period of high inflation that has left the lower class pinched and elsewhere, migration is going crazy - where if December rates continued, we’d be looking at like 3.5M illegal I mmigrants per year just from the Mexican border.

	Lastly, I’ll just say, in case you don’t know, the way us elections work, each state has delegates and the delegates elect the president…so, rather than a straight popular vote majority, candidates need to basically win a majority of the states…and since most states only vote red or blue, the election is usually decided by 5-6 “swing states” that tend to be more plastic.

	So what does any of this mean? It means today, republicans poll strongly, moderate are looking at inflation and the migration crisis, and democrats are flat.

	But some of these things are charting the right way. Inflation has stabilized, wages are increasing, there’s a huge bill in Congress that plans to tighten the border, the Israel conflict is likely to resolve in a few months at most. So, conditions will be more favorable for Biden. And no one except the loonies wants to have a beer with trump…and as the election approaches and media coverage increases, everyone is going to remember that. 

	The biggest problems Biden really has is that there are likely to be a few third party candidates (rfk, Cornell West, possibly manchin) and these candidates will hurt Biden. Specifically, they’ll hurt Biden in the swing states. One of the swing states - Michigan - has a large Muslim population…and they’re very upset about Israel/palestine. So, what Biden needs to do is just chart well, present an even image to voters next year, hope these brush fires are under control, and aggressively target the swing states. I’m genuinely worried about all the third party candidates…but you should look at polling in like Arizona, Michigan, Georgia, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Nevada…rather than national polling - especially right now, when republicans are so enthusiastic.

		How many swing states does Joe Biden need to win to win the election? All of them?

		* 🟧 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 1 _(2023-12-26 07:14:22)_

			It depends. But 4 out of those six I think…of the top of my head.

				I thought that it was 3? Ugh, that makes things so much more difficult.

					Looks like you are right - but which ones matters.
