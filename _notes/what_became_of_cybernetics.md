## What became of cybernetics?

> I came across this area recently and seemed pretty interesting and useful. It mixed all this math from information theory, stochastics analysis, and the concept of transformations, machines and applications to biological processes.
> 
> I don't want to make this post about politics, but every discussion i see about it is always related to socialism, mainly Chile's CyberSyn and Soviet research in this area. Even searching this sub, few results came up, and most were related to the USSR.
> 
> So, why no one talks about it today? I could see many fields which could benefit from it. Has it been replaced by "better" theories? Has people abandoned it because socialism?

	"Cybernetics was defined by Wiener as “the science of control  

	and communication, in the animal and the machine”—in a word,  

	as the art of steermanship."

	The field balkanized in the 90s because different fields had different goals. Engineers focused mainly on precisely controlling physical machines now call it control theory. Computer scientists who want to create generally intelligent agents now call it reinforcement learning. I'm not sure what the biologists do with it now. There's a lot of math in both those fields.

	I don't think it has been replaced, but the movement and the critical mass of people involved in cybernetics died out. There was such a brilliant critical mass of the likes of Wiener, von Neumann, von Bertalanffy, Koestler, Mandelbrot, etc. 

	It's not just Soviet and Chilean organizations that tried to push for cybernetics, it had a very successful version in America and was pretty apple pie as far as it went. 

	Right now there's the Santa Fe Institute and complexity theory which has taken over the space for cybernetics. 

	However, I do miss a unifying lobby around the rigorous application of computation and mathematics towards understanding complex processes, and the attempt to have that more or less as a single discipline. I think the last part (single discipline) is what really killed it: each field is already so complex that it's quite hard to pull off. In Computer Science, you have Operating Systems, Networks, Databases, Algs and Data Structures to rally around, but the industry tooling is very diverse. In complexity theory, there's very few common grounds like this that you can teach and put into a pipeline. 

	What it takes to get started again is for first-rate thinkers at the top of their fields to get back together and make a new push in this direction. It would greatly advance human progress.

	Cybernetics is just a name for certain engineering techniques. Just as machine learning (now AI), control theory, signal processing, optimization and statistical learning theory are all just names. The underlying methods are of course still being used, perhaps with new jargon.

	Do the projects OGAS (the "soviet internet"/centralized automatized economy management project), Cyc, Project Xanadu, The Semantic Web and the Japanese "Fifth Generation Computer Project" also fit the field of cybernetics? What are other projects you guys also know?

	I don't think it necessarily has to do with socialist ideology but state funding is vital to any long-term investment research like this (just like it was vital for space and advanced physics research and still is)...it seems the cold war and the idealism of soviet culture which encouraged these types of "out of the box" research (also the "sputnik fear" which always plagued the west) forced western governments to also invest to keep up with it...as the cold war died out, so did the field (and China doesn't seems nearly 1% as interested in this as the soviets ever were - it seems a bit cultural. Chinese people seem a lot more practical while Russians were always somewhat dreamers). 

	Maybe it has to do with socialism (or alternative cultures of state and economy management) in a sense research into anything that will only deliver profits after the next financial quarter is not exactly that much welcome in western libertarian/"neoliberal" capitalist culture anymore...as shareholder control of companies became more and more diluted (because specially of the stock market - instead of centralized in just one or few owners), decision-making in companies is getting much more complex, with much more parties to please, this makes companies at the same time more coward and conservative but also prone to hypes; capable of only doing what everybody else is doing and fearful of doing anything which is not mainstream. Any legendary "adventure capitalist" innovation-friendly culture our society had in the Gilded Age era seems to be long-gone and what is left is rentism and Elon Musk manipulating the stock market and generating hype over bullshit projects through his Twitter account to increase Tesla's stock bubble.

		But this association between this field and marxism is not uncommon. John McCarthy himself was a diehard commie when younger (inherited from his parents, which were also diehard commies) and atributed his fascination for the area to reading soviet "Popular Mechanics" type soviet magazines (but with a more "science fiction" turn haha) when still a kid...

	cybernetics is basically just dynamical systems applied to philosophy/other fields other than physics and engineering - not something generally mathematically rigorous but a method of analysis of phenomena in terms of interactions between agents

	何だこら…

	We have plenty of this at the graduate level across many unis: UCLA, NYU Courant, Stanford, MIT ORC, UNC STOR, Duke Stats, etc... Look at applied math and probability programs.

	I think deep learning has stolen a lot of brainpower despite being extremely mid from a maths standpoint. Coolest thing I've seen deep learning wise lately is that geometric DL text on the arxiv. Rest is blegh...

		There are most definitely good sources on ML techniques. The problem is that there's also so much BS out there it's difficult to sort through, especially using Google. That tends to happen in every field that gets significant attention from the general public though.

			General ML, sure. Cynthia Rudin's Labs is one of my favs (she mainly does decision tree and SVM-esque stuff). DL is boring.

	It was not only CyberSyn (which relied on Stafford Beer):

	>In 1949, Leontief used an early computer at Harvard and data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to divide the U.S. economy into 500 sectors. Leontief modeled each sector with a linear equation based on the data and used the computer, the Harvard Mark II, to solve the system, one of the first significant uses of computers for mathematical modeling, along with George W. Snedecor's usage of the Atanasoff–Berry computer. \[1\]

	It is pretty much evident to anyone who is not arguing in bad faith that the only way to rule (and yes, it's a hard word) a society of billions is leveraging highly-advanced mathematical models and general applied mathematics to make sure everyone gets the best possible life: around 2,000 calories per day, shelter, healthcare, not being afraid of the future, and so on. We have the mathematics, we have the machines, the models, what are they used for? To have around 80 million people at unfathomable levels of wealth, while keeping the rest in fear for their "jobs", if not outright starving. We use the models to generate absolute monstrosities such as Renaissance Technologies \[2\], and of course Jim Simons is not only a mathematician which will remain in history, but also probably a decent person, that's just an additional level of irony.

	Why we don't speak of cybernetics anymore? Because capitalism won. In the US you cannot even "do" your taxes without relying on third-parties, even if the IRS knows already what you owe, not to speak of payment processors fees \[3\]. If you could tell John von Neumann that we can write petabytes of data per second into distributed databases for pennies but we cannot transact money worldwide without paying "fees", he'd never develop the von Neumann architecture.

	At the level of corporations, of course central planning is the most important tool. Amazon will go bankrupt in a day without central planning. Some insight into what CyberSyn could have been can be seen in Google's Borg \[4\], the machine which runs, controls, and *is* Google. Running a bare metal Kubernetes cluster can further that insight: what could our societies be if instead of being stuck in these short-term loops for the benefit of the very few, we would employ all these tools for the benefit of many, if not all. Unfortunately, that's all that's left of cybernetics, playing make-believe in a Kubernetes cluster. Maybe it will change now, once the large language models will be able to be millions of times better than your $1,000/hour attorney, than whatever politically-appointed judge, than whatever ignorant, bought and paid for lawmaker, we shall see our civilization give one last test: become a rational, mathematically-powered eutopia, a place of good, or a boring dystopia, now with companies at $100 trillion market cap.

		Control theory is a much broader term than just its applications in cybernetics. Everything from stabilization devices to car cruise controls rely on control theory.

	The USA had resurgences of interest in operations theory and, separately, higher methods of algebra (eg category theory), which outcompeted cybernetics for the narrow supply of people who seek to go deeply into applied logic-heavy math.

	I think deep down it was rotten by undecidability. In order to control, one must first predict and compute. But we can't even predict if a computation is going to terminate... Cybernetics bite more than it could chew.

	Cybernetics once had a high place in library classification due to its perceived future importance. The Dewey Decimal System first put it somewhere in 006 in 1958 and later moved it up to 001.5 in 1971 before later slicing it up into different pieces and spreading them out. The Universal Decimal Classification still puts it in 007, but it's not a very active field. It's clear that the interest in the subject didn't really pan out in the end. It fragmented into control theory, informatics, robotics, and other disciplines. Control theory is the clearest analog to cybernetics, but it was already at DDC 629.8 even before cybernetics was added.

	It seems like a case where a new field might have been fruitful and produced lots of publications, but it wasn't, and it didn't.
