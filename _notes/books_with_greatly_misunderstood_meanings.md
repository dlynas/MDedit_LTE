## Books with greatly misunderstood meanings?

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mcxolg/books_with_greatly_misunderstood_meanings/](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/mcxolg/books_with_greatly_misunderstood_meanings/)

> Ray Bradbury said his famous Fahrenheit 451 story is NOT about government censorship but about "television destroys interest in literature." Yet even in school we were told this book is about government control and censorship. I even remember Tolkien hating his LOTR being compared to ww2 as an allegory to the nuclear  bomb being the One Ring. So what book do you know of that people completely miss the mark (I say completely because stories can have meanings other than what the author intended but some are so out there)

	If I recall correctly, Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle was intended to highlight the plight of lower class workers,but the scenes of men falling into sausage-making machines led people to think it was about food safety, and led to agitation for food-making regulations rather than an increase in wages as Sinclair intended.

			He wanted them to see the injustice to working people in the industry, but they choose to see the thing that affected their lives, the food quality and safety. If your arm meat doesn’t go into the grinder because the company put safety measures in place because otherwise the FDA would say its contaminated, well at the end of the day safety improved, if for different reasons than intended. Still terrible and still needs huge progress but nobody got ground into hamburger.

		There was a movement to look at food processing during that time because things were pretty shady. The book gave the final push since Sinclair mentioned having worked in those types of jobs for background info. Teddy Roosevelt rolled with the public reaction because he had his suspicions about canned meat during the Spanish American War. PBS released a good documentary about the food industry that mentions this, [The Poison Squad.](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/poison-squad/#part01) I highly recommend.
		
		EDIT: quick correction. It wasn't so much that Roosevelt rolled with it, but the reaction from the public and pure food advocacy groups finally gave the government the greenlight to send their own men to investigate undercover. While they didn't find issues similar to what Sinclair detailed in his book, there were enough shady practices to garner support for the creation of the FDA.

		It worries me that John Oliver's recent dive into food processing worker safety was so similar to The Jungle. Firstly that The Jungle was originally published over 100 years ago and the two are strikingly similar, and that a worker peeing while standing at the meat packing line is going to strike a chord as "ew gross food safety" rather than "holy fuck why isn't this man allowed to use a toilet!?"

			There were suspicions regarding the food industry for years. Children were dying (sickness/malnutrition from supposedly "good, wholesome food") and there were food advocacy groups pushing for corporate transparency. Sinclair mentioning that he worked in a meat packing industry for background info is what lit the flame for investigations and the creation of the FDA. Chemists found that the milk being sold was diluted with water and mixed with chalk.
			
			I really wish classes would mention the history at the time that made The Jungle blow up the way it did. I recommend the PBS documentary, [The Poison Squad.](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/poison-squad/#part01)

			People tend not to care that other people are poor, but people tend to care that there could be people in their food. It's like how there was an uproar about there being horsemeat in lasagna and burgers in the uk a few years ago, but no one really cared about the quality of life of the horses before they got minced.

				The issue with the horsemeat was that it was fraudulently sold as beef. Horse is worth 1/5th the cost of beef, and the food companies were pocketing the difference.
				
				Having eaten horse before, I can promise that it is perfectly edible. The issue wasn't that horse is inedible, but that it was fraudulently sold.

			Fun story: Vonnegut has long been one of my favourite writers. I went through a rough patch a few years ago and decided to see a therapist for a number of months. I got along really well with him and he became somewhat of a fatherly figure to me. During our last session I asked for some (more) books he could recommend. I’ll never forget his final recommendation: “oh, and this one is a bit weirder, my cousin wrote it. It’s called Slaughter-House Five”.

	The argument that LOTR is an allegory for the use of the nuclear bomb in WW2 is especially stupid considering that Tolkien started writing it in 1937, before the war began in Europe, and that it was mostly finished by the time the nuclear bomb was used in 1945.

	That said, it is true that while Tolkien did not intend the book as an allegory for war, some of its themes were shaped by Tolkien's experiences during World War 1. For instance, it's widely accepted among Tolkien scholars hat the landscapes of Mordor were inspired by No Man's Land at the Somme and that the industrial hell of Isengard was likewise inspired by the war machines of the first world war.

		Chuck Klosterman has an interesting observation/theory about how when we look at art in retrospect it is almost impossible for us to see it detached from the historical events that history has deemed to be the most relevant for that time. For example, it's almost impossible to imagine that any book written within +/- 10 years of the civil war would not be understood or analyzed according to its relationship to the civil war and the issues that led to it. So the books that get remembered and don't get forgotten by history are the ones that can have some connection to what we have retrospectively determined to be the important historical themes. This is completely separate from whether there was actually any connection in the author's mind, or even if the connection was understood at the time. So basically, it's possible that the reason LOTR has been so enduring is that because people in every decade have been able to make connections between the books and how they understood the WWII era.

	It's a poem rather than a book, but Robert Frost's ["The Road Not Taken"](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44272/the-road-not-taken) is not about being independent and not following the crowd. It's about the ways that small decisions change the course of our lives, the total inability to see where those other decisions might have led, and the narratives that we assemble post-hoc to help us believe we made the right choices despite not knowing.

	The big one I think of is Watchmen, which I know is a graphic novel, but Watchmen was meant to deconstruct aspects of the superhero / comic book genre. People generally take it at face value and hold it up as one of the best representations of the very thing it was critiquing. For example Rorschach is supposed to be viewed as mentally unhinged &amp; even reprehensible, the zealot who takes his ideas too far, whereas he was received well and became somewhat popular. It also influenced the genre heavily - it's been said that most of comics since Watchmen is trying to be Watchmen which is inherently strange.

	Another one I'd say is the Great Gatsby. People 'know' that the depiction is a critique of roaring 20's culture, but I feel like the critique is taken at face value and held up as fun or flirty. I would argue that idolizing what Fitzgerald critiques is a misinterpretation or at least misuse of his perspective, and to clarify I don't think his intent is to be curmudgeonly in regards to 'big parties are bad'. I see it more as 'what depressions and anxieties are hidden behind the performative pressure to be 'happy'', and should those be understood or examined as part of the human experience, do we destroy something in ourselves in chasing those normative constructs, among other things (very crude distillation so apologies for that)

		Frankenstein created something because he *could*, and that thing that he created somehow fell outside the bounds of his ill-defined intention.  Shelly's narrative argument in a nutshell is that Frankenstein believed he was clever enough to deal with the totality of his creation, that he was too arrogant to see the limits of his control, and that exact sort of behavior ultimately to blame for many of the monsters of the world.  Frankenstein only considered his responsibility - indeed the story only considers it - when he is well past any possibility of carrying out such supposed duties.

		* 🟧 **[goodreadsstan](https://www.reddit.com/user/goodreadsstan)** ⬆️ 849 _(2021-03-25 11:28:54)_

			i don’t fully agree with this interpretation, even though i know it’s a popular one. i think frankenstein is less a warning about “playing God” or arrogance and more an interrogation of injustice — i think shelley is more concerned about asking, “what do people owe each other? if we treat people like monsters, whose fault really is it when they act accordingly?” as jill lepore wrote [in a beautiful piece](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/02/12/the-strange-and-twisted-life-of-frankenstein/amp) in the new yorker about frankenstein’s 1818 edition, 
			
			>”Among the many moral and political ambiguities of Shelley’s novel is the question of whether Victor Frankenstein is to be blamed for creating the monster—usurping the power of God, and of women—or for failing to love, care for, and educate him.”
			
			lepore does a fantastic job of providing evidence for this reading of frankenstein, but notably does so by arguing that frankenstein’s creation largely follows the conventions of the slave narrative. (mary shelley was an abolitionist and made a point of reading pretty extensively about the slave trade, africa, and the west indies.) she does this by examining the creature’s education — how he learned to talk and read by observing a family and reading their discarded books: 
			
			>”[Frederick] Douglass realized his political condition at the age of twelve, while reading the “Dialogue Between a Master and Slave,” reprinted in “The Columbian Orator” (a book for which he paid fifty cents, and which was one of the only things he brought with him when he escaped from slavery). It was his coming of age. “The more I read, the more I was led to abhor and detest my enslavers,” Douglass wrote, in a line that the creature himself might have written.
			
			>Likewise, the creature comes of age when he finds Frankenstein’s notebook, recounting his experiment, and learns how he was created, and with what injustice he has been treated. It’s at this moment that the creature’s tale is transformed from the autobiography of an infant to the autobiography of a slave. “I would at times feel that learning to read had been a curse rather than a blessing,” Douglass wrote. “It had given me a view of my wretched condition, without the remedy.” So, too, the creature: “Increase of knowledge only discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was.” Douglass: “I often found myself regretting my own existence, and wishing myself dead.” The creature: “Cursed, cursed creator! Why did I live?” Douglass seeks his escape; the creature seeks his revenge.” 
			
			and THEN lepore makes the case that frankenstein was largely inspired by the haitian revolution (rather than the french revolution, which some people have argued over the years): 
			
			>”Much of “Frankenstein” participates in the debate over abolition, as several critics have astutely observed, and the revolution on which the novel most plainly turns is not the one in France but the one in Haiti. For abolitionists in England, the Haitian revolution, along with continued slave rebellions in Jamaica and other West Indian sugar islands, raised deeper and harder questions about liberty and equality than the revolution in France had, since they involved an inquiry into the idea of racial difference.”
			
			anyways this was my long-winded way of saying that i think frankenstein is much more complex and politically aware than a “beware of playing God” narrative — this is one of my all-time favorite books, and every time i read it i’m just blown away at mary shelley’s intelligence, boldness, and compassion.

There's so much in the text about, basically, parent-child relationship and the responsibility to nurture one's creation. 
				
				I though the Mary Shelley movie (saw it on hulu, staring Elle Fanning) was a really thoughtful exploration of these themes, especially in relation to Mary's relationship with Percy and her half-sister's relationship with Byron.

	I’d say Catcher in the Rye. Although maybe it isn’t misinterpreted but rather I don’t think people are seeing the “value”. I always see the criticism that Holden is a stuck up little shit who is a massive “phoney” whilst complaining about other “phonies”. 

	And like, yeah he is, but he is a kid who lost his brother, got shipped off to boarding school, and has potentially been sexually abused. And now, he’s booted out off boarding school, and is having a major mental breakdown in a big city in the middle of winter. He asks where do the ducks go when it snows. He’s asking for himself. Like, where the fuck is he meant to go now go when it snows? Homeless with emotionally removed parents, and with no time to grieve. 

	My main takeaway is that you’re meant to empathise with him, not purely base the experience on whether you agree or disagree with his opinions.

	* 🟨 **[nkh86](https://www.reddit.com/user/nkh86)** ⬆️ 430 _(2021-03-25 13:48:32)_

		Catcher in the Rye is a good litmus test for emotional maturity. A teenager reading it for the first time will identify with Holden Caulfield, because many of us go through the same phases and experience the same kinds of personality traits Holden does.
		
		In my 20’s as a lit major, a lot of people I knew swung to the other end. They still appreciated Salinger’s writing, but they vilified Holden and found him insufferable and condescending.
		
		Now that I’m in my 30’s, I have an easier time empathizing with Holden for the same reasons you listed: he was a child grieving the loss of his brother, shoved from place to place and school to school, possibly abused, and physically, emotionally, and mentally lost.

		Yeah and to add to that it’s clear with the way Holden’s written that he’s meant to be seen as an immature kid, shown by how accurately and maturely other characters are written as well as the way Holden is seen by others. Like J.D Salinger, as similar as he was to Holden was self aware enough to know he wasn’t this complete misunderstood genius. He also knew he was a dumb, angsty kid. But you can just as easily miss that and think Holden’s completely in the right (I relate and emphasise with him still but not the same as when I first read it) because of how so much of the story is his voice.

		The idea of "Who should I call" because you're so lonely and you have nothing to do is one I think many people won't relate to. Having nowhere to go, nothing to do and no real relationship with anyone is one of the most depressing things ever.
		
		And yes, he's an 'immature and pretentious'. However, I was borderline suicidal living in the middle of a big town. Being in a place where there are many people and being so alone is so alienating. You struggle to see things as anything other than a massive shit stain and this is why he talks down about everything. I was exactly the same. His traits reflect a deep seated loneliness and anger at the world, one which he can not comprehend.

		As a teenager who suffered from pretty bad depression and never really felt like I knew who I was, I loved the book and really identified with Holden.
		
		As a 20 something, I was far enough removed from my awkward teenage years and found him whiny and annoying, sometime I wanted to tell "ugh get over yourself and grow up" 
		
		After I became a mom... Well, I felt very much as you describe. I felt sorry for him. Sad for him. I wanted to give him a hug and tell him I was sorry that everyone he needed let him down.

		&amp;#x200B;
		
		One of the things that makes that book so rereadable is it's a different book depending on what age you read it. When I read it I was a young teen and totally got Holden's point of view. Some people read it as an adult and don't get to have that perspective. I reread it every couple of years and think new things about it each time

	Not a full book, but The Tortoise and the Hare. The moral isn't slow and steady wins the race, it's don't waste yourself by sleeping through life and assuming you'll eventually be a winner. In Aesops fables you are always supposed to learn from the arrogant animal. The lion who spares a mouse as a joke then gets saved by the mouse. The fox who can't reach the grapes will just insult them as spoiled. The other fox who thinks he's funny serving a crane a meal on a flat plate, until the crane serves him a meal in a vase. Etc.

	Lord of the Flies by William Golding. Sure, all the Hobbesian symbolism is there, but Golding's main intent was to show how boys in the British empire emulated the racism, classism, and destructiveness of the adults around them.

	It's an anti-imperialist read. Many readers forget that, or are too young to realize it when they're assigned the book for school.

It’s not; Hum is a despicable person, but he’s also relatable and charming in his way...you know, like actual pedophiles often are. Hum spends the whole book grooming you, the reader, just like he groomed Lo and her mother. Imo the best part of Lolita, and a bit I’ve never seen mentioned, is when Lo is talking about Quilty and Hum is like, “...the dentist?” Hilarious and characteristic of a book that is intentionally confusing, twisted, and full of word play.

People seem to think he was a nihilist, but he explicitly stated he hated nihilism and thought it was gonna be responsible for great strife in the next century.

					Nietzsche's work (especially Thus Spoke Zarathustra) is also one of the most misunderstood pieces of literature. Often people who read it tend to think that they are like Zarathustra, some misunderstood hero. But Nietzsche is talking about separation between human beings and what it is like to live as an individual. He wasn't a nihilist, but he was one of the main influences on existentialism. Nietzsche said that nobody can make choices for you. You just have to do it all by yourself. God is dead and you can't really trust on anybody else. You can only transcend and evolve with you own actions. And that should be the main goal of a human being.

		I take anything Hemingway said about his works with some heavy grains of salt. Dude was very conscious of creating and maintaining a public persona (which eventually swallowed him up, ala Hunter S Thompson). Claiming no symbolism protects him from critical analysis, and reinforces his tough guy, anti-intellectual image: me no write fancy, me write bulls and brawls and fish. 
		
		My take (to prove OP's point) on Old Man and the Sea is that it's a clear allegory for the author's creative process; you hook into this fantastic idea (huge, record setting marlin), but by the time you get it to the page (harbor), it's a shell (shark eaten, skeletal remains) of the original concept. Which, for me, is such a wonderful and true intellectual concept that I find applies to everyday existence. The garden that i planted last week definitely did not turn out like the marlin i had in mind!

	There's a great pod called "the Lolita podcast" where the host dissects all the awful moments in the book's history. Sooooo many people -- especially those who adapted it for film and stage-- view the victim,  Dolores/Lolita (a child!) as a seductress. It's a huge bummer. Nabokov did a great job of telling us the narrator is intentionally hurting this girl, so they're either dense or justifying their own pedo behavior.  To this day "Lolita" is a nickname for hypersexed female youths into older men as a way to make the victims of abuse look like the predators.  Not cool.

			My favorite [Thug Notes episode](http://teacherpress.ocps.net/wellsml/thug-notes-lord-of-the-flies/) was about Lord of the Flies.  He points out that the reason the British battle cruiser was out cruising about was because the events take place during WWII.  Even the adults couldn't keep their shit together without forming into groups and killing each other.  And it's similarly stupid and brutal.
			
			Edit:  apparently it wasn't WWII but a new worldwide war that leads to the fateful plane trip that sets off the events in the book.  I was thinking the plane was flying the kids out of the English cities to protect them during the Blitz, but then they wouldn't end up on an island in the middle of nowhere.  I actually haven't read the book or seen the movie since high school (incidentally the same time I'd borrowed Aerosmith's red greatest hits album from the library and listened to 'Dream On' on repeat while reading the book.

You need to position that novel in the period when it was written, which was basically the beginning of the end of the British Empire, a time when the English people still somehow saw themselves as inherently more "civilized" than the rest of the world. The novel punctures that self-perception.

	Every work of art is interpreted by its audience, and that interpretation is heavily influenced by the context of that audience.

	I remember (vaguely) how the Greek myth Antigone, about a woman who wants to bury her lover \[edit: her brother, no freudian slips here\] after he is refused funeral rites (sorry, terrible synopsis), has been interpreted as man versus the gods, man versus nature and man versus society, depending on when it was interpreted.

	I'm not saying there's no such thing as a bad interpretation, but a work of art lives independently of its creator and the creator's intention is not the ultimate interpretation.

	I am glad you included a bit about stories having meaning beyond an author's intention. I believe in his introduction to Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, Neil Gaiman said that an author is always right about what their work is about, but that is not all it's about. We should be wary of anyone who claims a book only has one meaning. I am not all for death of the author. If an author has an intended meaning, that is an important point to discuss. However, works of art can have meanings beyond what the creator intended. So, I don't think there are any wrong interpretations. Now, there are certain interpretations of books I think are weird.

	Personally, I think Bradbury's "television destroys interest in literature" is not an interesting interpretation of Fahrenheit 451. The analysis about government censorship and how that comes about because the public demands it is more interesting to me.

		Only read the book, but the entire point is that there was no top-down control of books. People stopped liking complex books, moved to reader's digests, then pamphlets, and on and on to even more condensed and empty forms of entertainment (and politics). Culture became much more homogeneous. Then public sentiment turned against the original, fleshed-out books because they represented things that make us different, so they organized into the fire brigades and destroyed them. This is a simplication, but the point is it was a bottom-up process and not an authoritarian stance to destroy or ban books.

	Primo Levi's *Survival in Auschwitz*.

	Most people read it like a survival narrative, like a "Auschwitz was very, very, very bad,.... but I survived" sort of thing.  And sure, that's there. 

	But Levi couldn't care less about that.  that's just suffering. 

	Far better is the original (Italian) title:  *If this is a Man*

	Levi's point was:   the Nazis built a camp--a death camp, a "factory" if you will--that was literally designed not only to kill people by the hundreds of thousands, but also to *crush their very humanity.*  And, in looking, unflinchingly, at what *was* crushed...because it worked.... we can actually see what "humanity" actually *is.*

	I think it may be debated that Machiavellis The Prince is the opposite of what we generally associate it with, ie. Machiavellianism.  Most read it as an manual for ruling in a very manipulative and exploiting way, but some scholars argue it was actual a satire of the contemporary rulers and the book was how *not* to rule.

	Not a book but a short story. Harrison Bergeron by Kurt Vonnegut. Everyone thinks it’s a condemnation of communism and that Harrison is some sort or heroic symbol of individualism. but really it’s a parody of American fears of socialism and also basically shows that totalitarianism is not a left wing or right wing thing - it’s an asshole thing.
