	There's a difference between peace and liberation as they're not
	You can have injustice and have peace
	Isn't that correct
	You can have peace and being slaved
	Yes, so peace isn't the answer
	Yeah liberation is the answer
	Yes, of course
	Okay, and that's what you should talk about never peace best white man's very peace liberation is our word
	Which you will one piece in the end. Yes, but you can't have peace until everybody's equal
	But you seem free at the moment. I

	You seem free. I think peaceful. There's a difference
