Tens of thou­sands of years ago, af­ter prim­i­tive hu­mans had fin­ished the ba­sic work of evolv­ing and in­vent­ing fire and fight­ing off tigers and stuff, some group of them be­gan to talk about moral­ity. They de­voted part of their pre­cious time and en­ergy to think­ing about why peo­ple do things, and tried to fig­ure out ways for them to do those things bet­ter, more justly, and more fairly. Be­fore those peo­ple died, the things they said were picked up and dis­cussed by other peo­ple, and then by other peo­ple, and so on and so on all the way to this very mo­ment—which means that for the last few dozen mil­len­nia, peo­ple the world over have been hav­ing one very long un­bro­ken con­ver­sa­tion about ethics.

Most of the peo­ple who’ve de­voted their lives to that con­ver­sa­tion didn’t do it for money, or fame, or glory—academia (and more specif­i­cally, phi­los­o­phy) is not the best route, if that’s what you’re af­ter. They just did it be­cause they be­lieved that moral­ity _mat­ters_. That the ba­sic ques­tions of how we should be­have on earth are worth talk­ing about, in or­der to dis­cover and de­scribe a bet­ter path for all of us. This book is ded­i­cated, with my ex­treme grat­i­tude, to all those who have en­gaged in that re­mark­able and deeply hu­man con­ver­sa­tion.

It’s also ded­i­cated to J.J., William, and Ivy, who mat­ter the most, to me.

# In­tro­duc­tion

To­day, you’ve de­cided to be a good per­son.

You don’t know _why_, re­ally—you just woke up this morn­ing full of vim and vigor and op­ti­mism, de­spite a world that of­ten seems hell-bent on bum­ming you out, and you hopped out of bed de­ter­mined to be a lit­tle bit bet­ter to­day than you were yes­ter­day.

This shouldn’t be that hard, right? You just need to make some small changes in the way you live. You walk out­side, see a plas­tic cup on the street, pick it up, and throw it away. That feels good! Yes­ter­day you might have ig­nored that garbage and kept on walk­ing, but not to­day, baby. To­day you’re _bet­ter_. At the gro­cery store you spend a lit­tle ex­tra to buy cage-free eggs and milk from hu­manely treated cows. It makes you smile to think of those cows munch­ing hap­pily on or­ganic grass in­stead of be­ing cooped up in some aw­ful fac­tory farm. Re­mem­ber­ing an ar­ti­cle you read about the im­pact of the beef in­dus­try on cli­mate change, you even pass on the ham­burger meat in fa­vor of veg­gie pat­ties. Now the cows are even hap­pier! Be­cause they’re not dead!

You’re do­ing great to­day. The New You is _crush­ing it_.

You take a quick jog around the neigh­bor­hood (for health!), help an old lady across the street (for kind­ness!), watch a doc­u­men­tary (for knowl­edge!), check the news (for cit­i­zen­ship!), and go to sleep. What a great day.

But then you lie in bed, star­ing at the ceil­ing. Some­thing’s nag­ging at you. How much “good­ness” did you ac­tu­ally achieve? You _feel_ like you did some good stuff, but then again you also felt like you could pull off wear­ing a ze­bra-print fe­dora to your of­fice hol­i­day party last year, and we all know how that turned out.

So now imag­ine that you can call on some kind of Uni­verse Good­ness Ac­coun­tant to give you an om­ni­scient, math­e­mat­i­cal re­port on how well you did. Af­ter she crunches the num­bers on your day of good deeds and the re­ceipt un­spools from her De­fin­i­tive Good­ness Cal­cu­la­tor, she gives you some bad news.

That plas­tic cup you tossed? It’s even­tu­ally go­ing to flow into the ocean, join­ing the Texas-size trash is­land that’s threat­en­ing ma­rine life in the Pa­cific. (You read about that when you checked the news be­fore bed, but you didn’t think _you_ had any­thing to do with it.) The veg­gie pat­ties were shipped to your lo­cal store from some­place very far away, ren­der­ing their car­bon foot­print mas­sive, and the cows you pic­tured _are_ in fact penned up in a fac­tory farm, be­cause the le­gal def­i­ni­tions of “or­ganic” and “grass-fed” are em­bar­rass­ingly loose thanks to shady leg­is­la­tion writ­ten by agribusi­ness lob­by­ists. The cows aren’t happy. They’re sad. They’re sad cows.

It gets worse: The sneak­ers you wore on your jog were made in a fac­tory where work­ers are paid four cents an hour. The doc­u­men­tar­ian who made the film you watched is a weird creep who likes to sniff strangers’ hair on the sub­way—nice work putting ten bucks in his pocket—and the stream­ing ser­vice you watched it on is part of a multi­na­tional con­glom­er­ate that also makes killer drones for the North Ko­rean air force. Oh and by the way, that old lady you helped col­lects Nazi mem­o­ra­bilia. “But she seemed so sweet,” you say. Nope! Se­cret Nazi. She was ac­tu­ally on her way to buy more Nazi stuff—that’s what you helped her across the street to do.

Well, great. Now you’re mis­er­able. You tried to be good, in your own small way, and the world smacked you across the face. You’re also _an­gry_. You had good in­ten­tions, and at least you put in the ef­fort—shouldn’t that count for some­thing?! And you’re _dis­cour­aged_. You can’t af­ford to do much more than what you did, be­cause you’re not a bil­lion­aire who can start some gi­ant char­i­ta­ble foun­da­tion, and given ev­ery­thing else we have to deal with in our ev­ery­day lives, who has the time and money and en­ergy to think about ethics?

In short: be­ing good is im­pos­si­ble, and it was point­less to even try, and we should all just eat hor­mone-filled cheese­burg­ers, toss the trash di­rectly into the Pa­cific Ocean, and give up.

That was a fun ex­per­i­ment. What now?

Most peo­ple think of them­selves as “good,” and would like to be thought of as “good.” Con­se­quently, many (given the choice) would pre­fer to do a “good” thing in­stead of a “bad” thing. But it’s not al­ways easy to de­ter­mine what is _good_ or _bad_ in this con­fus­ing, pret­zel-twisty world, full of com­pli­cated choices and pit­falls and booby traps and bad ad­vice from seem­ingly trust­wor­thy friends like stupid Wendy, who said the fe­dora was “ugly-cute” and con­vinced you to buy it. And even if you _do_ some­how nav­i­gate the mine­field of mod­ern life and suc­ceed at be­ing good, you’re just one per­son! This planet con­tains _eight bil­lion_ peo­ple, and a lot of them don’t seem to care _at all_ about be­ing good. There are cor­rupt politi­cians, and con­niv­ing CEOs, and peo­ple who don’t pick up the dog poop when their dogs poop on the side­walk, and evil dic­ta­tors, and stupid Wendy (what is her deal? Does she _en­joy_ mak­ing other peo­ple mis­er­able?), so it’s hard not to won­der if one per­son be­ing “good” even mat­ters. Or, to phrase it the way I did when I started read­ing moral phi­los­o­phy and think­ing about this enor­mous, knot­ted, tan­gled mess:

_What the hell am I sup­posed to do?_

This ques­tion—how can we live a more eth­i­cal life?—has plagued peo­ple for thou­sands of years,[^1] but it’s never been tougher to an­swer than it is now, thanks to chal­lenges great and small that flood our day-to-day lives and threaten to over­whelm us with im­pos­si­ble de­ci­sions and com­pli­cated re­sults that have un­in­tended con­se­quences. Plus, be­ing any­thing close to an “eth­i­cal per­son” re­quires daily thought and in­tro­spec­tion and hard work; we have to think about how we can be good not, you know, once a month, but _lit­er­ally all the time_. To make it a lit­tle less over­whelm­ing, this book hopes to boil down the whole con­fus­ing morass into four sim­ple ques­tions that we can ask our­selves when­ever we en­counter any eth­i­cal dilemma, great or small:

- What are we do­ing?
- Why are we do­ing it?
- Is there some­thing we could do that’s bet­ter?
- Why is it bet­ter?

That’s moral phi­los­o­phy and ethics[^2] in a nut­shell—the search for an­swers to those four ques­tions. And while the Uni­verse Good­ness Ac­count­ing De­part­ment had mostly bad news to of­fer us, here’s some good news: Philoso­phers have been think­ing about those ex­act ques­tions for a very long time. They have an­swers for us—or, at least, they have _ideas_ that may help us for­mu­late our own an­swers. And if we can get past the fact that a lot of those philoso­phers wrote in­fu­ri­at­ingly dense prose that gives you an in­stant ten­sion headache, we might arm our­selves with their the­o­ries, use them when we make de­ci­sions, and be a lit­tle bet­ter to­day than we were yes­ter­day.

I be­came in­ter­ested in moral phi­los­o­phy when I be­gan the work of cre­at­ing a TV show called _The Good Place._ If you’ve seen it, you’ll rec­og­nize many of the ideas in this book be­cause we ex­plored them on the show. If you haven’t seen it, (a) how dare you in­sult me like that, (b) I’m just kid­ding, and (c) don’t worry! Be­cause the whole point of this project is to take you on the jour­ney I went on, from a guy who knew al­most noth­ing about this sub­ject to some­one who could write a book about it. (Or at least, con­vince Si­mon & Schus­ter that I could write a book about it.) I fell in love with ethics for a sim­ple rea­son: Nearly ev­ery sin­gle thing we do has some eth­i­cal com­po­nent to it, whether we re­al­ize it or not. That means we owe it to our­selves to learn what the hell ethics is and how it works, so we don’t screw ev­ery­thing up all the time. We share this planet with other peo­ple. Our ac­tions af­fect those peo­ple. If we care at all about those peo­ple, we ought to fig­ure out how to make the best de­ci­sions we can.

An­other thing I love about ethics is: It’s free![3](#footnote-160) You don’t need to ap­ply for a li­cense to be eth­i­cal, or pay an an­nual fee to make good de­ci­sions. Think of the world as a mu­seum, and eth­i­cal rules as a vol­un­teer mu­seum worker, stand­ing silently in a green sport coat, hands clasped be­hind her back. We’re all walk­ing around the mu­seum look­ing at art (in this metaphor: morally con­fus­ing sit­u­a­tions), some of which we un­der­stand and some of which we def­i­nitely don’t, be­cause it’s all swirly and ab­stract and con­fus­ing. And when we see some­thing we don’t know how to in­ter­pret, we can just ask the nice lady in the green sport coat what we’re look­ing at and what it means, and she’ll tell us, for free! I mean, we could just nod thought­fully and _pre­tend_ we un­der­stand it—a time-hon­ored tra­di­tion, in both art mu­se­ums and life—but there’s just gonna be more con­fus­ing stuff in the next room, so we might as well get some help mak­ing sense of what­ever we’re look­ing at now.

Be­fore we get started, I have one more piece of good news. The very act of en­gag­ing with these ideas and ask­ing these ques­tions means we’ve al­ready taken a cru­cial step: we’ve sim­ply de­cided to _care_ about whether what we do is good or bad. Which means: we’ve de­cided to _try_ to be bet­ter.

That alone is a big deal. A quick glance around will re­veal a ton of peo­ple who have clearly de­cided they _don’t_ care about be­ing eth­i­cal, so they’re not re­ally try­ing. Part of me doesn’t en­tirely blame them, be­cause at­tempt­ing to be a de­cent moral agent in the uni­verse—a fancy way of say­ing “try­ing to do the right thing”—means we are bound to fail. Even mak­ing our best ef­forts to be good peo­ple, we’re gonna screw up. Con­stantly. We’ll make a de­ci­sion we think is right and good, only to find out it was wrong and bad. We’ll do some­thing we don’t think will af­fect any­one, only to find out it sure as hell did, and man are we in trou­ble. We will hurt our friends’ feel­ings, harm the en­vi­ron­ment, sup­port evil com­pa­nies, ac­ci­den­tally help an el­derly Nazi cross the street. We will fail, and then fail again, and again, and again. On this test, which we take daily whether we want to or not, fail­ure is guar­an­teed—in fact, even get­ting like a C-plus of­ten seems hope­lessly out of reach. All of which can make car­ing about what we do—or in the mod­ern par­lance, “giv­ing a crap”—seem point­less.

But that fail­ure means more, and has more po­ten­tial value, if we _do_ care. Be­cause if we care about do­ing the right thing, we will also want to fig­ure out _why_ we failed, which will give us a bet­ter chance to suc­ceed in the fu­ture. Fail­ure hurts, and it’s em­bar­rass­ing, but it’s also how we learn stuff—it’s called “trial and er­ror,” not “one per­fect trial and we nail it and then we’re done.” Plus, come on—the al­ter­na­tive to car­ing about our eth­i­cal lives is re­ally no al­ter­na­tive at all. We’re sup­posed to just ig­nore all ques­tions about our be­hav­ior? Phone it in, morally speak­ing? I can’t be­lieve that’s the right move. If we care about _any­thing_ in this life, we ought to care about whether what we’re do­ing is good or bad. (Later we’ll meet a group of very bleak French guys who be­lieved there’s no God and we’re just tiny flecks of noth­ing­ness float­ing on a big dumb rock in space—and even _they_ didn’t want us to just throw in the eth­i­cal towel.) This book is an ac­count of my own jour­ney through moral phi­los­o­phy, but it’s also about learn­ing to ac­cept fail­ure—or re­ally, to _em­brace_ it—as a nec­es­sary and ben­e­fi­cial by-prod­uct of our ef­forts to try, learn, and im­prove.

So. We’re go­ing to ask ques­tions about what to do in cer­tain sit­u­a­tions, and at­tempt to an­swer them us­ing some ideas that are 2,400 years old and some that were pro­posed ba­si­cally yes­ter­day. We’ll start off easy, to in­tro­duce those ideas—what they say, what they ask of us, how they claim to make us bet­ter peo­ple if we fol­low them. Then we’ll ramp things up, ap­ply­ing what we’ve learned to more gnarly and tan­gled is­sues, in­tro­duc­ing new ideas along the way. And by the time this book is done, we will know ex­actly how to act in ev­ery con­ceiv­able sit­u­a­tion, so as to pro­duce a ver­i­fi­ably max­i­mal amount of moral good. We will be per­fect. Peo­ple will gaze upon us with awe and ad­mi­ra­tion. All our friends will be so jeal­ous.

I’m just kid­ding—we’re still gonna fail all the time. But again, that’s okay! So, let’s start fail­ing. Or, in the words of Samuel Beck­ett:

Try again. Fail again. Fail bet­ter.

1. [^1] Well, let’s be hon­est: it’s plagued _some_ peo­ple. For ev­ery con­sci­en­tious cit­i­zen, there’s a whole bunch of cheaters and liars and _Wolf of Wall Street_ ma­ni­acs who see eth­i­cal rules as an­noy­ing ob­sta­cles to get­ting what­ever they want.
2. [^2] I, like many peo­ple, use the terms “morals” and “ethics” some­what in­ter­change­ably, over the ob­jec­tion of hard-core philoso­phers and lin­guis­tics nerds. If you en­joy se­man­tic rab­bit holes, you can poke around var­i­ous dic­tio­nar­ies and tease out the dif­fer­ences… and then join me as we blithely ig­nore those dif­fer­ences, be­cause life’s too short.
3. [^3] Mi­nus, I sup­pose, the cost of this book, if you chose to buy it. Also, I should add that ac­tu­ally _act­ing_ eth­i­cally of­ten re­quires us to spend money or time. I only mean to sug­gest that the ideas, or con­cepts, are freely avail­able.

    

## A Few Ques­tions Read­ers Might Have, Be­fore We Get Started

Do I need to know any­thing about moral phi­los­o­phy be­fore I read this book?

No. My goal was to write a book any­one could un­der­stand, re­gard­less of your fa­mil­iar­ity with the sub­ject. It’s in­tended as an in­tro­duc­tion to these ideas for rel­a­tive laypeo­ple—like I was when I be­gan read­ing up.

So, you’re not a philoso­pher? Or a pro­fes­sor? Or even a grad stu­dent?

No. I’m just, like, a guy. But that’s the point! Ev­ery­one hold­ing this book is “just a guy,” or “a lady,” or “some­one who’s con­cerned with how to be­have,” or “a per­son who was gifted this book on ‘how to be a bet­ter per­son’ by a friend and is only now re­al­iz­ing that maybe it was some kind of veiled hint.”[^1]

If I want to learn about moral phi­los­o­phy, why would I read your book in­stead of a break­down from some smarter, pro­fes­sor-type per­son?

First of all, that’s rude. But more im­por­tantly: I spent a lot of time study­ing this stuff and dis­cussing it with some very smart and funny peo­ple, try­ing to present it in a way that doesn’t give ev­ery­one a ten­sion headache. My goal here isn’t to rev­o­lu­tion­ize the field of moral phi­los­o­phy. It’s sim­ply to re­lay its nuts and bolts so we can all ap­ply it to our real lives.

Okay, you’re just some guy. Then who the hell are you to judge me?!

Yeah, I thought you might ask this ques­tion. So, lis­ten: This book is in no way meant to make you feel bad about what­ever dumb stuff you’ve done in your life. It’s cer­tainly not meant to sug­gest I _haven’t_ done a bunch of dumb stuff in my life, be­cause I def­i­nitely have, and con­tinue to. No­body’s per­fect. (As we’ll see in chap­ter 5, “moral per­fec­tion” is both im­pos­si­ble to at­tain and a bad idea to even at­tempt.) Again, the goal is to em­brace our in­evitable fail­ures and find a way to get some use out of them—to learn ways to _ben­e­fit_ when we make mis­takes in­stead of just stew­ing in our own guilt, doomed to make those same mis­takes all over again.

I am a smart pro­fes­sor-type per­son, and I’m fu­ri­ous. You only dis­cuss the works of a few of the great philoso­phers! How could you pos­si­bly ig­nore the work of so many im­por­tant thinkers?!

Moral phi­los­o­phy has been around for thou­sands of years, and ev­ery new the­ory re­lates in some way to the­o­ries that came be­fore it. Some­times you’ll be hack­ing your way through a dense philo­soph­i­cal tome, and you’ll come upon a sixty-page di­gres­sion where the au­thor dis­cusses some _other_ dense philo­soph­i­cal tome, and if you haven’t al­ready fought your way through _that_ tome you get hope­lessly lost, your eyes glaze over, and you just put the book down and watch _The Bach­e­lor_.[^2] If I had tried to cover all of moral phi­los­o­phy I would have done noth­ing but read books for sixty years and then died, and I have kids and a wife and I like to watch bas­ket­ball and stuff. Not to men­tion that some phi­los­o­phy I _did_ try to read was just in­com­pre­hen­si­ble to me. At one point I got re­ally ex­cited about meta­physics, which dates back to the an­cient Greeks and in­volves ques­tions about the very na­ture of ex­is­tence. Sounds fun! I opened a book called _In­tro­duc­tion to Meta­physics_ by the Ger­man philoso­pher Mar­tin Hei­deg­ger, and the very first sen­tence, with trans­la­tor foot­notes, looked some­thing like this:

> Why1 are2 there3 things4?
> 
> 1. “Why” is per­haps not even the right ques­tion; bet­ter to ask “how” or “to what end.”
> 
> 2. We are ob­vi­ously mak­ing a pri­ori as­sump­tions that there “are,” in­deed, “things.”
> 
> 3. Hei­deg­ger em­ploys the Ger­man word _Ich­schätzedieMühedies­nachzuschla­gen_, which has no di­rect trans­la­tion, so I have cho­sen the crude Eng­lish word “there,” which is a tragic and griev­ous mis­rep­re­sen­ta­tion of Hei­deg­ger’s in­tent.
> 
> 4. “Things” might bet­ter be thought of as “loci of ex­is­tence,” or per­haps the ne­ol­o­gism “es­sents,” mean­ing “things that have essence,” or per­haps a new word I just made up called “blerf,” which has no mean­ing at all, but is some­how in its non­sen­si­cal non­mean­ing the most ac­cu­rate word one can use to de­lin­eate the dif­fer­ence be­tween noth­ing­ness and some­thing­ness.

That’s a slight ex­ag­ger­a­tion, but only slight. I gave up af­ter maybe four more sen­tences. Later I found out that Hei­deg­ger was ba­si­cally a fas­cist, so I feel like I made the right call.

But there’s an­other rea­son I in­cluded what I in­cluded and ig­nored what I ig­nored: The works dis­cussed in this book are sim­ply the ones I _liked_ and con­nected with. They’re the ones that made sense to me, in a car­toon-light­bulb-turn­ing-on-above-my-head kind of a way. This sim­ple sense of con­nec­tion mat­ters with some­thing like phi­los­o­phy, which is a mas­sive and di­verse rain for­est of ideas. No one ex­plorer can map the whole jun­gle, so you end up grav­i­tat­ing to­ward cer­tain thinkers and away from oth­ers based on noth­ing more com­pli­cated than how much they res­onate with you.

My un­der­stand­ing of ethics (and thus: the crux of this book) is or­ga­nized broadly around a group of the­o­ries—virtue ethics, de­on­tol­ogy, and util­i­tar­i­an­ism—which are cur­rently thought of as the “Big Three” in West­ern moral phi­los­o­phy. That fo­cus marginal­izes some of the most fa­mous thinkers in his­tory, like Lao-tzu, David Hume, and John Locke, all of whose writ­ings over­lap with one of these Big Three the­o­ries but maybe aren’t _in­te­gral_ to them. Also, be­cause I wanted _The Good Place_ to be sec­u­lar, I shied away from re­li­gious thinkers like Saint Thomas Aquinas and Søren Kierkegaard. Should the ideas in this book pique your in­ter­est, and you grab a com­pass and head into the jun­gle your­self, it’s likely that some of the folks I mostly ig­nored will be­come your per­sonal fa­vorites. And then you can write your own book, and talk about why your peo­ple are bet­ter than my peo­ple!

I am a dif­fer­ent very smart pro­fes­sor-type per­son, and I must say you have _com­pletely_ mis­in­ter­preted [some­thing]. How could you have so bla­tantly mis­read [that thing]?

In 1746, a group of British book­sell­ers asked Dr. Samuel John­son to write a de­fin­i­tive dic­tio­nary of the Eng­lish lan­guage. Over the next eight years, he did just that—he _wrote an en­tire dic­tio­nary_. Us­ing only _his own brain_.[^3] Af­ter he was done, a woman ap­proached him, an­noyed, and asked how he could have pos­si­bly de­fined a “pastern” as “the knee of a horse” when it is ac­tu­ally part of the foot. John­son replied: “Ig­no­rance, Madam. Pure ig­no­rance!” So, if I got some­thing wrong, that’s the rea­son: pure ig­no­rance!

Wouldn’t it have been smart to have some­one help you with this? An ac­tual, you know, philoso­pher?

Ah, but I did—Pro­fes­sor Todd May, long­time pro­fes­sional aca­demic and au­thor of sev­eral ex­cel­lent books on moral phi­los­o­phy. We met when I asked him to help the writ­ing staff of _The Good Place_ fig­ure out what the hell any philoso­pher was ever talk­ing about, and he then agreed to col­lab­o­rate with me on this book—to “spot me,” as it were, and help me not screw up the schol­ar­ship so badly that I get sued by Jeremy Ben­tham’s great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grand­kids. So ac­tu­ally, now that I think about it, if there are any prob­lems with the phi­los­o­phy in this book, it’s not be­cause of my ig­no­rance. It’s Todd’s fault. Blame him.[^4]

## CHAP­TER ONE Should I Punch My Friend in the Face for No Rea­son?

No. You shouldn’t. Was that your an­swer? Sweet. You’re do­ing great so far.

If I sur­veyed a thou­sand peo­ple and asked them if they think it’s okay to punch their friends in the face for no rea­son, I’d bet all thou­sand would say no.[^1] This per­son is our friend. This per­son did noth­ing wrong. We should not, there­fore, punch our friend in the face. But the weird thing about ask­ing _why_ we shouldn’t do this, de­spite how ob­vi­ous it seems, is that we may stum­ble try­ing to for­mu­late an an­swer.

“Be­cause, you know, it’s… bad.”

Even sput­ter­ing out that sim­plis­tic ex­pla­na­tion is weirdly en­cour­ag­ing—it means we’re aware that there’s an eth­i­cal com­po­nent to this ac­tion, and we’ve de­ter­mined it’s, you know… “bad.” But to be­come bet­ter peo­ple, we need a stur­dier an­swer for why we shouldn’t do it than “be­cause it’s bad.” Un­der­stand­ing an ac­tual eth­i­cal the­ory that ex­plains _why_ it’s bad can then help us make de­ci­sions about what to do in a sit­u­a­tion that’s less morally ob­vi­ous than “Should I punch my friend in the face for no rea­son?” Which is just about ev­ery other sit­u­a­tion.

An ob­vi­ous place to start might be to say, well, a _good_ per­son doesn’t gen­er­ally do things like that, and a _bad_ per­son does, and we want to be good peo­ple. The next step would be to bet­ter de­fine what a “good per­son” re­ally is, and that’s trick­ier than it might seem. The ini­tial idea be­hind _The Good Place_ was that a “bad” woman, who had lived a self­ish and some­what cal­lous life, is ad­mit­ted to an af­ter­life par­adise due to a cler­i­cal er­ror and finds her­self tick­eted for an idyl­lic eter­nity along­side the very best peo­ple who ever lived—peo­ple who’d spent their time re­mov­ing land­mines and erad­i­cat­ing poverty, whereas she’d spent her life lit­ter­ing, ly­ing to ev­ery­one, and re­morse­lessly sell­ing fake medicine to fright­ened se­niors. Scared she’s go­ing to be dis­cov­ered, she de­cides to try to _be­come_ a “good” per­son in or­der to earn her spot. I thought that was a fun idea, but I also quickly re­al­ized I had no idea what it re­ally meant to be “good” or “bad.” I could de­scribe _ac­tions_ as “good” or “bad”—

- shar­ing _good_
- mur­der _bad_
- help­ing friends _good_
- punch­ing friends in the face for no rea­son _bad_

—but what was un­der­ly­ing those be­hav­iors? What’s an all-en­com­pass­ing, uni­fy­ing the­ory that ex­plains “good” or “bad” peo­ple? I got lost try­ing to find it—which is what led me to moral phi­los­o­phy, which then led me to pro­duc­ing the show, which even­tu­ally led me to writ­ing a book where I spend twenty-two pages try­ing to ex­plain why it’s not cool to ran­domly cold­cock your buddy.

Philoso­phers de­scribe “good and bad” in a bunch of dif­fer­ent ways, and we’ll touch on many of them in this book. Some of them do in fact ap­proach the con­cepts of good and bad through _ac­tions_—they say that good ac­tions obey cer­tain prin­ci­ples that we can dis­cover and then fol­low. Oth­ers say a good ac­tion is what­ever cre­ates the most plea­sure and the least pain. One philoso­pher even sug­gests that good­ness comes from be­ing as self­ish as we pos­si­bly can and car­ing only about our­selves. (Re­ally. She says that.) But the first the­ory we’re go­ing to talk about—the old­est of the Big Three, called “virtue ethics”—tries to an­swer the ques­tion that ini­tially stumped me: What makes a _per­son_ good or bad? Virtue ethi­cists de­fine good peo­ple as those who have cer­tain qual­i­ties, or “virtues,” that they’ve cul­ti­vated and honed over time, so that they not only have these qual­i­ties but have them _in the ex­act right amount_. Seems get­table, right?

Al­though… im­me­di­ately we’re hit with a hun­dred other ques­tions: Which qual­i­ties? How do we get them? How do we know when we’ve got­ten them? This hap­pens a lot in phi­los­o­phy—the sec­ond you ask a ques­tion, you have to back up and ask fifty other ques­tions just so you know that you’re ask­ing the _right_ ques­tion and that you un­der­stand _why_ you’re even ask­ing it, and then you have to ask ques­tions within _those_ ques­tions, and you keep back­ing up and widen­ing out and get­ting more and more foun­da­tional in your in­ves­ti­ga­tion un­til fi­nally a Ger­man fas­cist is try­ing to fig­ure out why there are even “things.”

We also might won­der if there’s a sin­gle way to de­fine a “good” per­son; af­ter all, as the au­thor Philip Pull­man once wrote, “Peo­ple are too com­pli­cated to have sim­ple la­bels.” We are all highly in­di­vid­u­al­ized prod­ucts of both na­ture and nur­ture—com­plex swirls of in­her­ent per­son­al­ity traits, things learned from teach­ers and par­ents and friends, life lessons we picked up from Shake­speare[^2] and/or the Fast & Fu­ri­ous movies.[^3] Is it pos­si­ble to de­scribe a set of qual­i­ties we _all_ have to have, in the ex­act right amount, that will make ev­ery one of us “good”? To an­swer that, we need to un­learn all the stuff we’ve learned—we need to re­set, take our­selves apart, and then build our­selves back up with a stur­dier un­der­stand­ing of what the hell we’re do­ing and why the hell we’re do­ing it. And to help us do _that_, we turn to Aris­to­tle.

### “A Flow­ing River of Gold”

Aris­to­tle lived from 384 to 322 BCE, and wrote the most im­por­tant stuff about the most im­por­tant stuff. If you want to feel bad about your­self and your measly ac­com­plish­ments, poke around his Wikipedia page. It’s es­ti­mated that less than _a third_ of what he ac­tu­ally wrote has sur­vived, but it cov­ers the fol­low­ing sub­jects: ethics, pol­i­tics, bi­ol­ogy, physics, math, zo­ol­ogy, me­te­o­rol­ogy, the soul, mem­ory, sleep and dreams, or­a­tory, logic, meta­physics, pol­i­tics, mu­sic, the­ater, psy­chol­ogy, cook­ing, eco­nom­ics, bad­minton, lin­guis­tics, pol­i­tics, and aes­thet­ics. That list is so long I snuck “pol­i­tics” in there _three times_ with­out you even notic­ing, and you didn’t so much as blink when I claimed he wrote about “bad­minton,” which def­i­nitely didn’t ex­ist in the fourth cen­tury BCE. (I also don’t think he ever wrote about cook­ing, but if you told me Aris­to­tle had once tossed off a four-thou­sand-word pa­pyrus scroll about how to make the per­fect chicken Parm, I wouldn’t blink an eye.) His in­flu­ence over the his­tory of West­ern thought can­not be over­stated. Ci­cero even de­scribed his prose as “a flow­ing river of gold,” which is a _very_ cool way for a fa­mous states­man and or­a­tor to de­scribe your writ­ing. (Al­though, also: Take it down a notch, Ci­cero. Com­ing off a lit­tle thirsty.)

For the pur­poses of this book, though, we’re only con­cerned with Aris­to­tle’s take on ethics. His most im­por­tant work on the sub­ject is called the _Nico­machean Ethics_, named ei­ther in honor of his fa­ther, Nico­machus, or his son, Nico­machus, or I sup­pose pos­si­bly a dif­fer­ent guy named Nico­machus that he liked bet­ter than ei­ther his dad or his kid. Ex­plain­ing what makes a _per­son_ good, in­stead of fo­cus­ing on what kinds of things such a per­son _does_, re­quires sev­eral steps. Aris­to­tle needs to de­fine (1) which qual­i­ties a good per­son ought to have, (2) in which amounts, (3) whether ev­ery­one has the ca­pac­ity for those qual­i­ties, (4) how we ac­quire them, and (5) what it will look (or feel) like when we ac­tu­ally have them. This is a long to-do list, and walk­ing through his ar­gu­ment takes a lit­tle pa­tience and time. Some of the thinkers we’ll meet later have the­o­ries that can be de­cently pre­sented in a few sen­tences; Aris­to­tle’s ethics is more of a lo­cal train, mak­ing many stops. But it’s an en­joy­able ride!

#### When Do We Ar­rive at “Good Per­son” Sta­tion?

It might seem odd to be­gin with the fi­nal ques­tion noted in the last para­graph, but that’s ac­tu­ally how Aris­to­tle does it. He first de­fines our ul­ti­mate goal—the very pur­pose of be­ing alive, the thing we’re shoot­ing for—the same way a young swim­mer might iden­tify “Olympic gold medal” as a tar­get that would mean “max­i­mum suc­cess.” Aris­to­tle says that thing is: hap­pi­ness. That’s the _te­los_,[^4] or goal, of be­ing hu­man. His ar­gu­ment for this is pretty solid, I think. There are things we do for some other rea­son—like, we work _in or­der to_ earn money, or we ex­er­cise _in or­der to_ get stronger. There are also good things we want, like health, honor, or friend­ships, _be­cause_ they make us happy. But hap­pi­ness is the top dog on the list of “things we de­sire”—it has no aim other than it­self. It’s the thing we want to be, just… to _be it_.

Tech­ni­cally, in the orig­i­nal Greek, Aris­to­tle ac­tu­ally uses the neb­u­lous word “eu­dai­mo­nia,” which some­times gets trans­lated as “hap­pi­ness” and some­times as “flour­ish­ing.”[^5] I pre­fer “flour­ish­ing,” be­cause that feels like a big­ger deal than “hap­pi­ness.” We’re talk­ing about the ul­ti­mate ob­jec­tive for hu­mans here, and a _flour­ish­ing_ per­son sounds like she’s more ful­filled, com­plete, and im­pres­sive than a “happy” per­son. There are many times when I’m happy, but I don’t feel like I’m _flour­ish­ing_, re­ally. Like, it’s hard for me to imag­ine a greater _hap­pi­ness_ than watch­ing a bas­ket­ball game and eat­ing a sleeve of Nut­ter But­ters, but am I _flour­ish­ing_ when I do that? Is that my _max­i­mum pos­si­ble_ level of ful­fill­ment? Is that the be-all and end-all of my per­sonal po­ten­tial? (My brain keeps try­ing to an­swer “Yes!” to these rhetor­i­cal ques­tions, and if that’s true it’s kind of sad for me, so I’m just go­ing to power through, here.) Aris­to­tle ac­tu­ally an­tic­i­pated this ten­sion, and re­solved it by ex­plain­ing that hap­pi­ness is dif­fer­ent from _plea­sure_ (the kind as­so­ci­ated with he­do­nism), be­cause peo­ple have brains and the abil­ity to rea­son. That means the kind of cap­i­tal-_H_ Hap­pi­ness he’s talk­ing about has to in­volve ra­tio­nal thought and virtues of char­ac­ter, and not just, to give one ex­am­ple off the top of my head, the NBA Fi­nals and a Costco bucket of peanut but­ter cook­ies.

If “flour­ish­ing” is still a bit slip­pery as a con­cept, think of it this way: You know how some peo­ple who are re­ally into jog­ging talk about a “run­ner’s high”? It is (they claim) a state of eu­pho­ria they achieve late in a long race, where they sud­denly don’t even feel like they’re tired or la­bor­ing be­cause they’ve “lev­eled up” and are now su­per­hu­man run­ning gods, float­ing above the course, buoyed by the power of Pure Run­ning Joy. Two things to say about this: First, those peo­ple are _dirty liars_, be­cause there is no way to achieve higher-level en­joy­ment from run­ning, be­cause there’s no way to achieve _any_ en­joy­ment from run­ning, be­cause there is noth­ing en­joy­able about run­ning. Run­ning is aw­ful, and no one should ever do it un­less they’re be­ing chased by a bear. And sec­ond, Aris­to­tle’s _flour­ish­ing_, to me, is a sort of “run­ner’s high” for the to­tal­ity of our ex­is­tence—it’s a sense of com­plete­ness that flows through us when we are nail­ing ev­ery as­pect of be­ing hu­man.

So in Aris­to­tle’s view, the very pur­pose of liv­ing is to flour­ish—just like the pur­pose of a flute is to pro­duce beau­ti­ful mu­sic, and the pur­pose of a knife is to cut things per­fectly. And it sounds awe­some, right? #Livin­gOurBestLives? Just to­tally ac­ing it? Aris­to­tle’s a good sales­man, and he gets us all ex­cited with his pitch: we can all, in the­ory, achieve this su­per-per­son sta­tus. But then he drops the ham­mer: If we want to flour­ish, we need to at­tain virtues. Lots of them. In pre­cise amounts and pro­por­tions.

#### What Are Virtues?

We can think of virtues as the as­pects of a per­son’s makeup that we ad­mire or as­so­ciate with good­ness; ba­si­cally, the qual­i­ties in peo­ple that make us want to be their friends—like brav­ery, tem­per­ance, gen­eros­ity, hon­esty, mag­na­nim­ity, and so on.[^6] Aris­to­tle de­fines virtues as the things that “cause [their] pos­ses­sors to be in a good state and to per­form their func­tions well.” So, the virtues of a knife are those qual­i­ties that make it good at be­ing a knife, and the virtues of a horse are the horse’s in­her­ent qual­i­ties that make it good at gal­lop­ing and other horsey stuff. The hu­man virtues he listed, then, are the things that make us good at be­ing hu­man. This seems kind of re­dun­dant, at first glance. If on day one of ten­nis lessons our in­struc­tor told us that “the virtues of a good ten­nis player are the things that make us good at ten­nis,” we’d likely nod, pre­tend to get a phone call, and then can­cel the rest of our ses­sion. But the analo­gies make per­fect sense:

|THE THING|ITS VIRTUES|ITS PUR­POSE|
|---|---|---|
|Knife|Sharp­ness, blade strength, bal­ance, etc.|Cut­ting things well|
|Ten­nis player|Agility, re­flexes, court vi­sion, etc.|Play­ing great all-around ten­nis|
|Hu­man|Gen­eros­ity, hon­esty, courage, etc.|Flour­ish­ing/hap­pi­ness|

We now know what we need (virtues) and we know what they’ll do for us (help us flour­ish). So… how do we get them? Do we al­ready have them, some­how? Were we born with them? Sadly, there’s no easy fix here. Ac­quir­ing virtues is a life­long process, and it’s _re­ally_ hard. (I know, it’s a bum­mer. When Eleanor Shell­strop—Kris­ten Bell’s char­ac­ter from _The Good Place_—asks her phi­los­o­phy men­tor Chidi Anagonye how she can be­come a good per­son, she won­ders if there’s a pill she can take, or some­thing she can vape. No such luck.)

#### How Do We Get These Virtues?

Un­for­tu­nately, in Aris­to­tle’s view, no one’s just born in­her­ently and com­pletely vir­tu­ous—there’s no such thing as a baby who al­ready pos­sesses so­phis­ti­cated and re­fined ver­sions of all of these great qual­i­ties.[^7] But we’re all born with the _po­ten­tial_ to get them. All peo­ple have what he calls “nat­u­ral states” of virtue: “Each of us seems to pos­sess his type of char­ac­ter to some ex­tent by na­ture; for in fact we are just, brave, prone to tem­per­ance, or have an­other fea­ture, im­me­di­ately from birth.” I think of these as “virtue starter kits”—ba­sic tools and crude maps that kick off our life­long quest for _re­fined_ virtues. Aris­to­tle says these starter kits are the coarse char­ac­ter traits pos­sessed by chil­dren and an­i­mals—which, if you’ve ever taken a bunch of ten-year-old boys to Dave & Buster’s, you know are of­ten in­dis­tin­guish­able.

We can all prob­a­bly iden­tify some starter kit we had as kids. From a very early age I was an ex­treme rule fol­lower—or maybe let’s say I was “in­clined to­ward the virtue of du­ti­ful­ness,” so I don’t sound like such a suck-up. It takes a tremen­dous amount of con­vinc­ing for me to break _any_ rule, no mat­ter how min­i­mal the po­ten­tial pun­ish­ment, be­cause my per­sonal virtue starter kit for du­ti­ful­ness came ex­tremely well equipped—_lots_ of tools in there. One of them is this lit­tle voice in my head—present as far back as I can re­mem­ber—that starts chirp­ing at me if _any­one_ vi­o­lates a rule, and it doesn’t stop un­til the rule is fol­lowed.[^8] When I was a fresh­man in col­lege, our dorm had a rule that all loud mu­sic had to be off by one a.m. If I was at a party at one a.m., _even in some­one else’s room_, that lit­tle voice would in­struct me to edge over to the stereo and nudge the mu­sic down a lit­tle. Be­cause _that was the rule_. You can imag­ine how pop­u­lar I was at par­ties.[^9]

But again, these starter kits rep­re­sent only our _po­ten­tial_ to be­come vir­tu­ous—there’s a huge dif­fer­ence be­tween that po­ten­tial and the real thing. Think of it this way: We some­times talk of cer­tain peo­ple be­ing “born” with cer­tain qual­i­ties—she’s a “born leader,” or he’s a “born bag­piper,” or what­ever. What we re­ally mean is that the per­son seems to have a nat­u­ral _ap­ti­tude_ for lead­ing or bag­pip­ing, and we of­ten say it in awe be­cause that skill doesn’t come nat­u­rally to us. We’ve never even _thought_ about try­ing to play the bag­pipes, so when­ever our friend Rob drags that floppy Dr. Seuss–look­ing con­trap­tion out of his closet and fires it up, we as­cribe his tal­ent to some in­ter­nal, in­ac­ces­si­ble set­ting that he seems to have mag­i­cally had from birth. Then, when Rob gets a full ride to Ohio State on a bag­pipe schol­ar­ship, we think, “Rob has ful­filled his des­tiny by cap­i­tal­iz­ing on his in­nate skill.” And we also think, “Ohio State has a schol­ar­ship for bag­pipers?” And then we think, “What the hell is Rob go­ing to do with that de­gree? How’s he go­ing to make rent money—just, like, play­ing at Scot­tish fu­ner­als?”

Rob didn’t come into the world with “The Bon­nie Banks of Loch Lomond” hum­ming through his head in con­cert B-flat. He was sim­ply _in­clined_ to­ward bag­pip­ing, in that mys­te­ri­ous way that some peo­ple are in­clined to­ward math or paint­ing or base­ball, which is su­per cool when it hap­pens to you or your kids and su­per ir­ri­tat­ing when it hap­pens to other peo­ple or their kids. And then he took his ap­ti­tude and de­vel­oped it, with many years of prac­tice, into a _skill._ He found some­thing he liked and felt nat­u­ral do­ing, and then prac­ticed for a mil­lion hours[^10] un­til he be­came an ex­pert.

And the same way we de­velop any skill, Aris­to­tle tells us, we be­come _vir­tu­ous_ by _do­ing vir­tu­ous things_. This is the “life­long process” part of the equa­tion: “Virtue comes about,” he writes, “not by a process of na­ture, but by ha­bit­u­a­tion.… We be­come just by do­ing just ac­tions, tem­per­ate by do­ing tem­per­ate ac­tions, brave by do­ing brave ac­tions.” In other words: we have to _prac­tice_ gen­eros­ity, tem­per­ance, coura­geous­ness, and all the other virtues, just like an­noy­ing Rob prac­ticed his an­noy­ing bag­pipes. Aris­to­tle’s plan re­quires con­stant study, main­te­nance, and vig­i­lance. We may have been born with those starter kits, but if we don’t de­velop them through ha­bit­u­a­tion—if we just kick back and rely on them as adults—we’re doomed. (That would be like some­one say­ing, “When I was a kid I loved play­ing with match­box cars, so I think I’ll hop into this For­mula 1 Fer­rari and run the British Grand Prix.”) Ha­bit­u­a­tion isn’t very dif­fer­ent from the “prac­tice makes per­fect” ethos that was drilled into us by high school bas­ket­ball coaches or mu­sic teach­ers: we get bet­ter at the thing by do­ing the thing, and if we stop do­ing it, we’ll get worse.

This ha­bit­u­a­tion, the prac­tice of work­ing at our virtues, is re­ally the whole she­bang here. And the great thing about Aris­to­tle’s sales pitch is that he says ha­bit­u­a­tion can work for _any_ virtue—even ones we seem­ingly _weren’t_ born with ap­ti­tudes for, ones where our starter kits are old, rusted tool­boxes that are miss­ing all their screw­drivers. This is im­por­tant, be­cause ap­ti­tudes are seem­ingly ran­domly as­signed to us. We all have things that come eas­ily to us, and things that we—to use a tech­ni­cal philo­soph­i­cal term—suck at. I, for ex­am­ple, have a ter­ri­ble sense of di­rec­tion. I do not know where I am at any given mo­ment un­less I am in a place I have been ten thou­sand times be­fore, and even then it’s dicey—I fre­quently got lost dur­ing the seven years I lived in Man­hat­tan, which is laid out in a _nu­mer­i­cal grid_.[^11] It cer­tainly feels to me that no amount of prac­tice could turn me into a good nav­i­ga­tor. Virtues seem to work the same way—I had an ap­ti­tude for du­ti­ful­ness, but not (for ex­am­ple) courage. You might re­call hav­ing an ap­ti­tude for gen­eros­ity but not tem­per­ance, or in­dus­tri­ous­ness but not mild­ness. In or­der to flour­ish we need to de­velop _all_ of these virtues, and Aris­to­tle prom­ises us that we[^12] can, re­gard­less of whether we are seem­ingly in­clined to­ward some of them more than oth­ers. With enough work, no one is doomed to be for­ever de­prived of mag­na­nim­ity or courage or any other de­sir­able qual­ity, the way I’m doomed to get lost ev­ery time I walk around a park­ing garage look­ing for my car.

Ha­bit­u­a­tion may be the most im­por­tant part of Aris­to­tle’s eth­i­cal sys­tem, but it’s not the only one. Just like we need a coach to get bet­ter at ten­nis or a mae­stro to help us learn the flute, we also need a good teacher to give us some flour­ish­ing lessons. The an­cient Greeks were kind of ob­sessed with how im­por­tant teach­ers (or “wise men”) are for ev­ery­thing—civics, ethics, sci­ence, and so on. Socrates taught Plato, and Plato taught Aris­to­tle, and Aris­to­tle taught Alexan­der the Great,[^13] so there’s a lot of fo­cus on the role of bril­liant in­struc­tors (and wise friends) in trans­form­ing peo­ple from un­formed lit­tle goobers into the civic-minded, flour­ish­ing peo­ple they want us all to be. And since they them­selves were of­ten teach­ers who founded acad­e­mies, ev­ery time they talk about the need for wise teach­ers it’s hard not to imag­ine them pointing to them­selves and clear­ing their throats.[^14] (The _Ethics_ some­times reads like an in­fomer­cial for Aris­to­tle’s acad­emy.)

To be clear, the wis­dom of wise teach­ers doesn’t _re­place_ ha­bit­u­a­tion. That ding­dong who liked toy cars and then tried to race Fer­raris prob­a­bly wouldn’t fare any bet­ter if he just read a book[^15] on torque or watched Dale Earn­hardt Jr. give a TED Talk. “Na­ture, habit, and teach­ing,” says Aris­to­tle, “are all needed.” Be­cause flour­ish­ing, you see, doesn’t just re­quire us to iden­tify and then ac­quire all of these virtues—it re­quires that we have ev­ery one in _the ex­act right amount_. We have to be gen­er­ous but not _too_ gen­er­ous, coura­geous but not _too_ coura­geous, and so on. The tough­est part of virtue ethics is iden­ti­fy­ing these amounts, and then pre­cisely nail­ing each one. Aris­to­tle called each of those mad­den­ingly spe­cific tar­gets: “the mean.”

#### “When Have We Ac­tu­ally ‘Achieved’ These Virtues?”

The mean, or “golden mean,” as it’s com­monly re­ferred to (though never by Aris­to­tle him­self[^16]), is the most im­por­tant cog in Aris­to­tle’s eth­i­cal ma­chine. It’s also, in my opin­ion, the most beau­ti­ful. And the most an­noy­ing. And the slip­peri­est, and the most el­e­gant, and the most in­fu­ri­at­ing.

Think of any of these qual­i­ties we’re seek­ing—gen­eros­ity, tem­per­ance, what­ever—as a per­fectly bal­anced see­saw, par­al­lel to the ground. If we sit right in the mid­dle, ev­ery­thing will re­main up­right, even, and har­mo­nious. That’s the golden mean of this qual­ity: that per­fect mid­dle spot, rep­re­sent­ing the ex­act amount of the qual­ity in ques­tion that keeps the see­saw level. Shift­ing to­ward ei­ther end, how­ever, will throw it out of whack; one side of the see­saw will plum­met to the ground, and we’ll hurt our butts. (In this metaphor, our butts = our per­son­al­i­ties.) The two ex­treme ends rep­re­sent (1) a _de­fi­ciency_ of the qual­ity, and, on the other side, (2) an _ex­cess_ of the qual­ity—way too lit­tle, or way too much. Ex­treme de­fi­ciency or ex­cess of any one qual­ity then be­comes a _vice_, which is ob­vi­ously what we’re try­ing to avoid. Philoso­phers some­times think of this as the “Goldilocks rule.” For ev­ery as­pect of our char­ac­ter, Aris­to­tle’s ba­si­cally telling us to be: not too hot, not too cold… just right.

As an ex­am­ple, let’s take mild­ness, which Aris­to­tle de­scribes as “the mean con­cerned with anger.” Peo­ple with a _de­fi­ciency_ of anger are those who

> are not an­gered by the right things, or in the right way, or at the right times, or to­wards the right peo­ple.… Such a per­son seems to be in­sen­si­ble and to feel no pain. Since he[^17] is not an­gered, he does not seem to be the sort to de­fend him­self; and such will­ing­ness to ac­cept in­sults to one­self and to over­look in­sults to one’s fam­ily and friends is slav­ish.

In other words: with­out _any_ anger, if we saw some­thing cruel—like a bully pick­ing on an in­no­cent kid—we might just stand there, slack-jawed and drool­ing, rather than re­spond­ing with an ap­pro­pri­ate amount of in­dig­na­tion. But if we have _way too much_ anger, we might grab the bully and drop­kick him into a lake and then grab his whole fam­ily and drop­kick _them_ into the lake and then burn their house down. The golden mean of anger—which, again, Aris­to­tle calls “mild­ness”—rep­re­sents an _ap­pro­pri­ate_ amount of anger, re­served for the _right_ sit­u­a­tions, to be di­rected at peo­ple who _de­serve it_. Like fas­cists, or cor­rupt politi­cians, or any­one as­so­ci­ated with the New York Yan­kees.[^18] So, “anger” is the qual­ity, and “mild­ness” is the dead-solid-mid­dle-point _virtue_ we’re seek­ing.[^19]

We can see the beauty of this idea, right? It’s all about har­mony and bal­ance and grace­ful­ness. It’s the “Si­mone Biles do­ing a per­fect dis­mount off the bal­ance beam” of ideas. But when we think about it for even a sec­ond, it gets slip­pery. For starters, how do we _know_ what’s ex­ces­sive or de­fi­cient? How do we know when we’re an­gry in the right amount, for the right rea­sons, at the right peo­ple? This is the most com­mon crit­i­cism of virtue ethics: _So, we just need to work and study and strive and prac­tice, and some­how mag­i­cally ob­tain this the­o­ret­i­cal “per­fect” amount of ev­ery qual­ity, which is im­pos­si­ble to de­fine or mea­sure? Cool plan_. Even Aris­to­tle has a hard time pre­cisely de­scrib­ing a mean some­times. Re­gard­ing mild­ness, he writes, “It is hard to de­fine how, against whom, about what, and how long we should be an­gry, and up to what point some­one is act­ing cor­rectly or in er­ror.” And then he shrugs: “This much is at least clear: the in­ter­me­di­ate state is to be praised, and… the ex­cesses and de­fi­cien­cies are to be blamed.” The en­tire sys­tem can seem a lit­tle like Jus­tice Pot­ter Stew­art’s fa­mous com­ment on “hard-core” pornog­ra­phy—that al­though he couldn’t ac­tu­ally _de­fine_ it, “I know it when I see it.”

That may seem like a ten­u­ous ba­sis for an en­tire eth­i­cal sys­tem. And yet: We kind of _get it_, right? We can prob­a­bly all re­mem­ber a time we got fu­ri­ous at some­one or some­thing, and later thought: “Ehhhh, I prob­a­bly got too an­gry there.” Or maybe a time when we let some­thing go, and then felt like we should’ve raised our voice a bit louder. If we take the time to mull over what we’ve done, if we re­ally com­mit to ex­am­in­ing both our own ac­tions and the ac­tions of those around us, we can even­tu­ally come to un­der­stand what’s too lit­tle, what’s too much, and what’s “just right.” We need to Know It When We See It, and we’ll only Know It When We See It if we’re al­ways look­ing for it.

This search for virtue can help us in other ways too. Once we start think­ing of peo­ple as col­lec­tions of these qual­i­ties, we can un­der­stand bet­ter what we like and don’t like about them. Some­times we’ll say, “Luis is the _nicest_ guy,” or “Di­ana is the _sweet­est_ per­son in the world.” But we don’t ac­tu­ally want our friends to be ex­treme. (The ac­tual nicest per­son in the world would be _so bor­ing_.) Think of peo­ple you once spent a lot of time with—ex-boyfriends or -girl­friends, maybe. The things you loved about them were prob­a­bly the qual­i­ties that were so bal­anced that they ap­proached virtues. (“Da­mon was al­ways there for me, but he also knew when I needed some time to my­self.”) The things that drove you nuts about them—that prob­a­bly turned them into exes—were the qual­i­ties in which they were wildly de­fi­cient or ex­ces­sive, and which they never seemed to mod­ify in or­der to get closer to the bal­ance you de­sired. (“Da­mon never used de­odor­ant, and clipped his toe­nails on the din­ing room ta­ble, and cleaned the Cheeto dust off his fin­gers by wip­ing them on my cat.”[^20]) We can find these golden means only by prac­tic­ing the art of find­ing them—by try­ing and fail­ing and try­ing and fail­ing, and by eval­u­at­ing our suc­cesses and fail­ures.

### Golden Means: They Make You Less An­noy­ing!

So now, at long last, we can loop all the way back to our orig­i­nal ques­tion and pro­vide a stur­dier an­swer.

We might have in­stinc­tively known it’s bad to punch our friend in the face for no rea­son, but now we un­der­stand _why_ it’s bad: in­stead of ex­hibit­ing the _mean_ of a virtue (mild­ness), it demon­strates a wildly ex­ces­sive amount of anger. That see­saw would be way out of bal­ance. We now also un­der­stand how to be­have go­ing for­ward: we may have been in­clined to­ward mild­ness, un­der­stand­ing in­tu­itively (thanks to a “mild­ness starter kit”) that mild is a good thing to be; but if we don’t _prac­tice_ mild­ness, learn how to fine-tune it, and reg­u­larly check in with our­selves about whether what we are do­ing is ap­pro­pri­ately mild, we might some­day end up drool­ing while other kids get bul­lied or punch­ing our friends in the face. Virtue ethics gives us the whole pic­ture: how we’re do­ing, how we can get bet­ter, and what we should avoid.

Let’s re­visit my own per­sonal ex­am­ple, with the virtue of du­ti­ful­ness (which, again, isn’t among those listed by Aris­to­tle). We might say the _de­fi­ciency_ of du­ti­ful­ness would be law­less­ness—break­ing all rules and so­cial con­tracts. The _ex­cess_ of du­ti­ful­ness would be mind­less obe­di­ence—the kind ex­hib­ited by sol­diers com­mit­ting atroc­i­ties be­cause they were “only fol­low­ing or­ders.” My per­sonal re­la­tion­ship to du­ti­ful­ness has at times tipped to­ward ex­cess. Just ask my wife, my friends, or any­one who has been at a party with me right af­ter the noise cur­few hit. I rinse my mouth with mouth­wash for thirty full sec­onds, be­cause _that’s what it says to do on the la­bel_. I drive with my hands at “ten and two” on the wheel, be­cause _that’s what my driv­ing in­struc­tor told me to do_. I’ve al­ways seen this be­hav­ior as vir­tu­ous and writ­ten off an­noyed re­ac­tions to it as un­founded—but af­ter I read Aris­to­tle I un­der­stood how an ex­cess of du­ti­ful­ness can neg­a­tively im­pact the peo­ple around me: I am con­stantly killing ev­ery­one’s buzz. (The look on my wife’s face when she tries to talk to me and then re­al­izes she has to wait thirty sec­onds for me to fin­ish my mouth­wash rou­tine would melt steel.) I’ve tried hard in the last few years to de­mil­i­ta­rize my over­abun­dant du­ti­ful­ness, but it ain’t easy! I’m forty-six, and I’ve lived this way all my life. I haven’t been look­ing for that golden mean, and thus: I can be kind of an­noy­ing.

But again, I’m not a lost cause. I was born with a good starter kit for the virtue of du­ti­ful­ness, which re­lent­lessly warned me against vi­o­lat­ing rules—I es­sen­tially did ev­ery­thing my par­ents and teach­ers told me to do, be­cause they were In Charge. Now, how­ever, if some­one in a po­si­tion of au­thor­ity told me to do some­thing iffy I wouldn’t just blindly obey, even if that per­son were wear­ing a uni­form with a name tag that said “Of­fi­cial Rule-Mak­ing Au­thor­ity Guy.”[^21] I might not have prac­ticed find­ing the golden mean as much as I should have, but at least I now have a greater un­der­stand­ing of the world, knowl­edge about so­cial in­ter­ac­tions, a sense of pro­pri­ety, and wis­dom shared with me by a bunch of wise men and women—all of which help me mod­u­late my in­cli­na­tion to fol­low rules. If I’d re­lied solely on my starter kit for my whole life, things could’ve turned out very badly. Given my predilec­tion to do what I’m told, I’m lucky that the cir­cum­stances of my up­bring­ing pushed me to only a mild ex­cess of du­ti­ful­ness that made me kind of an­noy­ing, and not an ex­treme ex­cess that made me, you know, a war crim­i­nal.

To me, this is the true value of Aris­to­tle’s virtue ethics—de­spite be­ing writ­ten so long ago, it’s re­ally on point when it comes to this one as­pect of the hu­man con­di­tion. If we’re not care­ful, our per­son­al­i­ties and habits slowly and in­evitably cal­cify over time. Un­til I was about thirty, I was an avid mu­sic lis­tener, in mul­ti­ple gen­res. Then I got mar­ried and had kids and dis­ap­peared from the cul­ture for a while, and now all I lis­ten to is the same late-nineties in­die rock and hip-hop al­bums, over and over. They’re fa­mil­iar and com­fort­ing, and play­ing them in my car has be­come an au­to­matic re­sponse. Our be­hav­iors cre­ate deep grooves in our per­son­al­i­ties, like a heavy chair form­ing im­pres­sions in a shaggy rug, and it be­comes harder and harder to es­cape them. The best thing about Aris­to­tle’s “con­stant learn­ing, con­stant try­ing, con­stant search­ing” is what re­sults from it: a ma­ture _yet still pli­able_ per­son, brim­ming with ex­pe­ri­ences both old and new, who doesn’t rely solely on fa­mil­iar rou­tines or dated in­for­ma­tion about how the world works.

Aris­to­tle scholar Ju­lia An­nas, a pro­fes­sor at the Uni­ver­sity of Ari­zona, wrote a book called _In­tel­li­gent Virtue_ in which she talks about the dif­fer­ence be­tween a _rote_ re­sponse to some sit­u­a­tion that tests our virtues, and a deeper, more “in­tel­li­gent” one: “The re­sult [of prac­tic­ing some­thing] is a speed and di­rect­ness of re­sponse com­pa­ra­ble to that of mere habit, but un­like it in that the lessons learned have in­formed it and ren­dered it flex­i­ble and in­no­va­tive.” What a won­der­ful idea—that when we prac­tice a virtue over and over and over, we be­come _flu­ent_ in the virtue, and our re­sponses emerge from a deep reser­voir of un­der­stand­ing about the virtue, so in­stead of re­main­ing stuck in a rut de­fined by our pre­vi­ous be­hav­iors, we have a fight­ing chance to make a good de­ci­sion re­gard­less of how weird the sit­u­a­tion might be. Be­cause again, most eth­i­cal ques­tions aren’t as easy to an­swer as “Should I punch my friend in the face for no rea­son?” They’re far more nu­anced and com­plex, so it stands to rea­son that the harder we’ve stud­ied, the bet­ter we’ll fare when some en­tirely new sit­u­a­tion arises to test our moral re­flexes.

This “flex­i­bil­ity” of re­sponse is ac­tu­ally a bit like comedic act­ing. There are plenty of skilled co­me­di­ans in the world who are funny and sharp and have good tim­ing. But oth­ers—of­ten com­ing from im­pro­vi­sa­tional com­edy back­grounds—seem more _thor­oughly_ funny. They’re ef­fort­lessly funny, in ev­ery di­rec­tion, all the time. They never strain, or flail, or panic, even when they have no script to work from or re­hearsal to pre­pare with. I sus­pect this is be­cause im­prov re­quires in­tense and con­stant train­ing; small groups of peo­ple per­form to­gether, day in and day out, in­vent­ing scenes out of thin air. It teaches them how to be at­ten­tive, loose, con­fi­dent, un­rushed—how to calmly fo­cus on all of the quickly mov­ing parts of a scene at once, to an­tic­i­pate each other’s ac­tions, and to avoid re­peat­ing them­selves. I re­mem­ber think­ing about Steve Carell and Amy Poehler[^22] that they knew their char­ac­ters so well the _Of­fice_ or _Parks and Recre­ation_ writ­ers could place them in any sce­nario, at any mo­ment, and they would know in­stantly how to be funny—they were _flu­ent_ in their char­ac­ters. They had prac­ticed the skill of com­edy so much, so of­ten, for so long, that their re­sponses to any un­fold­ing sce­nario were flex­i­ble and in­no­va­tive.

This is the full sales pitch for virtue ethics: If we re­ally work at find­ing the means of our virtues—learn­ing their ins and outs, their vi­cis­si­tudes and pit­falls, their pros and cons—we be­come flex­i­ble, in­quis­i­tive, adapt­able, and _bet­ter_ peo­ple. In fact, the search for golden means is cu­mu­la­tive—the closer we get to one, the more it can help us in our search for oth­ers. Ap­proach­ing the mean for kind­ness helps us get closer to the mean for gen­eros­ity, which helps us get closer to the mean for loy­alty, which helps us ap­proach the mean for tem­per­ance, and so on. Even­tu­ally we’ll truly flour­ish, achiev­ing a mas­tery over the ex­act bal­ances of hun­dreds of dif­fer­ent virtues. We’ll un­der­stand and adapt to any new sit­u­a­tion, able to see and de­ci­pher the very foun­da­tional code of hu­man ex­is­tence—like Neo at the end of _The Ma­trix_.

See? Be­ing good isn’t so hard. You just have to un­der­stand the world as com­pletely as Neo does at the end of _The Ma­trix_.

### Need­less Cru­elty: A Good Thing to Avoid

We now un­der­stand why punch­ing our friend in the face for no rea­son is _bad_—the per­son who does that fails to reach (or straight-up ig­nores) the golden mean of sev­eral dif­fer­ent virtues. But we also started with a de­lib­er­ately easy ques­tion, so let’s make a tiny mod­i­fi­ca­tion: “Should we punch our friend in the face _if he does some­thing we don’t quite like_?” Maybe this friend made fun of our new khaki shorts, caus­ing us some small pain, and now we have to de­ter­mine whether we are al­lowed to punch him in the face. A virtue ethi­cist would say that a punch to the face af­ter such a mi­nor slight ex­hibits the same ex­cess of anger that it would if we were do­ing it for no rea­son at all. But we can also look at this from an­other an­gle, thanks to Ju­dith Shk­lar (1928–1992), a Lat­vian philoso­pher who wrote ex­ten­sively about free­dom and lib­erty—top­ics near and dear to her, given her Jew­ish fam­ily’s his­tory. The Shk­lars had to flee Latvia to es­cape Stalin, and then had to keep flee­ing to es­cape Hitler, and af­ter fi­nally reach­ing Amer­ica, Ju­dith got a PhD from Har­vard and be­came the first woman ever tenured in Har­vard’s Gov­ern­ment De­part­ment. In her mas­ter­work, _Or­di­nary Vices_, she makes a com­pelling ar­gu­ment that cru­elty—not pride or envy or wrath or any of the other clas­sic “deadly sins”—is ac­tu­ally the worst hu­man vice, and should be placed atop the list of things to avoid. “To put cru­elty first,” she writes,

> is to dis­re­gard the idea of sin as it is un­der­stood by re­vealed re­li­gion. Sins are trans­gres­sions of a di­vine rule and of­fenses against God.… How­ever, cru­elty—the will­ful in­flict­ing of phys­i­cal pain on a weaker be­ing in or­der to cause an­guish and fear—is a wrong done en­tirely to _an­other crea­ture_.

When we think only of re­li­gious “sins” as the ul­ti­mate bad stuff we want to avoid, we end up man­u­fac­tur­ing jus­ti­fi­ca­tions for hor­ri­ble atroc­i­ties; her ex­am­ple is the Eu­ro­pean con­querors com­ing to the “New World,” en­coun­ter­ing its In­dige­nous peo­ples, and ra­tio­nal­iz­ing geno­cide as the will of a Chris­tian God. If we el­e­vate cru­elty—trans­gres­sions against other hu­mans—to the top of the “worst crimes we can com­mit” list, we can no longer find and ex­ploit any such loop­holes.

But Shk­lar has an­other beef with cru­elty, which helps us un­der­stand why we shouldn’t punch our friend af­ter he makes fun of our khaki shorts. Cru­elty, she says, is of­ten way out of pro­por­tion to the be­hav­ior that prompted it. A man com­mits a mi­nor crime (like in the fa­mous _Les Mis­érables_ ex­am­ple, steal­ing a loaf of bread when you’re starv­ing) and is then sent to prison, where his con­di­tions are _in­cred­i­bly_ cruel. It’s asym­met­ric: the cru­elty of the pun­ish­ment vastly out­weighs the crime he’s com­mit­ted. Pretty com­pelling ar­gu­ment, right? The mod­ern-day crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem has put count­less peo­ple in prison for ex­tremely mi­nor of­fenses—in­clud­ing some, like mar­i­juana pos­ses­sion, that are now widely le­gal. But it’s not just crim­i­nal acts that re­veal this prob­lem. Ba­sic, gar­den-va­ri­ety hu­man in­ter­ac­tions are rife with un­war­ranted cru­elty. If you don’t be­lieve me, make a YouTube video and say some­thing in­nocu­ous, like “Cheese is de­li­cious!” or “I love Michi­gan!” and then read the com­ments. (“Go back to East Lans­ing, you ugly curd-lov­ing mo­ron” is one ex­am­ple of what might hap­pen.)

Since our goal here is to be­come bet­ter peo­ple in our day-to-day lives, putting cru­elty first in our list of things to avoid seems like a re­ally good idea. Un­for­tu­nately, there’s a hefty price to pay: be­cause there is so much cru­elty all around us, think­ing of it as hu­man­ity’s worst vice takes a heavy toll on our psy­ches. “If cru­elty hor­ri­fies us,” Shk­lar writes, “we must, given the facts of daily life, al­ways be in a state of out­rage.” And she’s right! A quick glance at the news re­veals end­less cru­elty: racism, sex­ism, voter sup­pres­sion, laws con­structed to keep peo­ple in ab­ject poverty, mean YouTube com­ments—putting cru­elty first threat­ens to turn us all into mis­an­thropes, says Shk­lar, which might be why we’re tempted not to fo­cus on it. But there is a way to es­cape the scourge of cru­elty: knowl­edge. (Specif­i­cally: knowl­edge of cul­tural prac­tices other than our own.) Quot­ing the great En­light­en­ment philoso­pher Montesquieu, she tells us that “ ‘knowl­edge makes men gen­tle,’ just as ig­no­rance hard­ens us.” This is an idea Aris­to­tle would like, I think. The more we try to learn and un­der­stand the lives be­ing led by other peo­ple—the more we search for a golden mean of em­pa­thy—the less we will find it per­mis­si­ble to treat them with cru­elty.

We’ve cov­ered a lot of ground al­ready! We not only un­der­stand that we shouldn’t punch our friend in the face for no rea­son (or for a bad rea­son), we also have a deeper un­der­stand­ing of why that’s true. We know what we’re aim­ing for (golden means of var­i­ous qual­i­ties), and what it pro­vides us (a deep un­der­stand­ing of our ac­tions, ren­der­ing us “flex­i­ble and in­no­va­tive” in their ap­pli­ca­tions to other, more com­pli­cated sit­u­a­tions). We also un­der­stand why a cruel ac­tion (the wan­ton in­flic­tion of pain on an­other per­son) should be atop our list of things to avoid.

But again, come on—should we punch our friend in the face for no rea­son? That was a layup. The world, as we’ve said, is com­pli­cated, and most de­ci­sions are not nearly that sim­ple. In fact, what if we’re in a sit­u­a­tion where our choices are not

- (a) punch some­one in the face
- or
- (b) don’t

but rather:

- (a) punch some­one in the face
- or
- (b) punch some­one else in the stom­ach?

… What the hell do we do then?

    

## CHAP­TER TWO Should I Let This Run­away Trol­ley I’m Driv­ing Kill Five Peo­ple, or Should I Pull a Lever and De­lib­er­ately Kill One (Dif­fer­ent) Per­son?

Weird ques­tion, right? We were just goof­ing around, talk­ing about _Les Mis­érables_ and YouTube com­ments, and sud­denly we’re in some dystopian ve­hic­u­lar psy­chodrama. Ob­vi­ously, chances are you’ve never been in this ex­act sit­u­a­tion, and you prob­a­bly never will be. But trust me when I say that any un­der­stand­ing of mod­ern eth­i­cal de­ci­sion-mak­ing re­quires you to think very hard about what you would do if you _were_ faced with this choice, and more im­por­tantly, why you would do it.

So. You’re driv­ing a trol­ley, and the brakes fail. On the track ahead of you are five con­struc­tion work­ers who will be smooshed by the run­away trol­ley—but there’s a lever you can pull that will switch the trol­ley onto an­other track, on which is _one_ con­struc­tion worker. The ques­tions are ob­vi­ous: Should you do noth­ing, al­low­ing five peo­ple to be killed? Should you pull the lever, killing one per­son? Also, why are these peo­ple work­ing on ac­tive trol­ley tracks in the mid­dle of the day? Who ap­proved this? Jerry, from sched­ul­ing? That guy is so in­com­pe­tent. I heard he only got this job be­cause his cousin owns the trol­ley com­pany.

This thought ex­per­i­ment and its many vari­a­tions (which we’ll get to shortly) are col­lec­tively called “the Trol­ley Prob­lem.” The orig­i­nal ques­tion was posed in 1967 by a British woman named Philippa Foot.[^1] Now, I know what you’re think­ing: “Philippa Foot” sounds like the name of a fairy-tale mouse who lives in­side a pur­ple mush­room in an en­chanted for­est. But she wasn’t a fairy-tale mouse, she was an es­teemed philoso­pher, and the Trol­ley Prob­lem is ar­guably mod­ern phi­los­o­phy’s most fa­mous thought ex­per­i­ment. In fact, it’s _so_ fa­mous and oft-dis­cussed that many aca­demics kind of hate it now—they roll their eyes and look an­noyed when it comes up, be­cause it’s all any­one has talked about for fifty years. It’s like the phi­los­o­phy ver­sion of “Stair­way to Heaven” or _The God­fa­ther_ or some­thing—an ad­mit­ted clas­sic that has suf­fered from over­ex­po­sure. But suck it up, aca­demic philoso­phers; we’re gonna talk about it, be­cause work­ing through its com­plex­i­ties does a bang-up job of ex­plain­ing why “do­ing the right thing” is so dif­fi­cult.

Most peo­ple agree that in the orig­i­nal con­cep­tion laid out above, we should pull the lever. We give this an­swer re­flex­ively—it just… seems like the right move. We don’t know any­thing about the peo­ple—they’re just anony­mous con­struc­tion work­ers who in­ex­pli­ca­bly don’t find it im­por­tant to pay at­ten­tion to the seem­ingly vi­tal ques­tion of whether there might be a trol­ley bear­ing down on them—so we ought to save as many as pos­si­ble, right? We have the chance to do some­thing sim­ple that spares four hu­man lives. Pull that lever, baby, and we’ll be he­roes!

But hid­den in this prob­lem, lurk­ing un­der the sur­face, are a whole bunch of booby traps—the trou­bling places that our an­swer leads us to once the orig­i­nal sce­nario is even slightly mod­i­fied. For ex­am­ple, what if we’re not the _driver_, but just an in­no­cent ob­server, stand­ing next to the tracks where (in this ver­sion) the track-switch­ing lever is lo­cated? Now we don’t have the same de­ci­sion-mak­ing re­spon­si­bil­i­ties that we might have if we were em­ployed by the trol­ley com­pany. Would we still pull the lever then? Or what if the po­ten­tial smooshees aren’t anony­mous? What if we look out through the front wind­shield and rec­og­nize our friend Su­san stand­ing over there on the other track, and be­cause we don’t want to kill our friend Su­san, who’s so nice and thought­ful and once gave us her Be­y­oncé tick­ets when she couldn’t use them, we ac­tively de­cide _not_ to switch tracks. Is it morally per­mis­si­ble to let five peo­ple get killed in or­der to save our friend Su­san’s life? Or what if we see Su­san stand­ing there on the other track, but not only is she not our friend, we _hate_ her? She’s con­de­scend­ing and mean and she re­fused to give us her Be­y­oncé tick­ets that one time even though she couldn’t use them, and ac­tu­ally we were lit­er­ally just telling our sis­ter yes­ter­day that some­times we wish she’d be flat­tened by a run­away trol­ley. If we pull the lever now, did we do it be­cause we wanted to save five lives… or be­cause an­noy­ing Be­y­oncé-ticket-hoard­ing Su­san had it com­ing?

Here’s the one that al­ways gets peo­ple: What if we’re stand­ing on a bridge that spans the tracks, look­ing down at the run­away trol­ley, and next to us is a big thick-necked weight lifter[^2] named Don, who’s lean­ing waaaay out over the edge of the bridge. We—ex­perts in physics, ap­par­ently—cal­cu­late that Don is just mas­sive enough so that if the trol­ley hit him, it would slow down and come to a stop be­fore the five guys got smooshed. Which means all we have to do is shove Don the _teen­si­est_ bit so he falls onto the tracks and _he_ gets smooshed, sav­ing five other lives. Would we shove him? Most peo­ple draw a line in the sand here, and say no—they wouldn’t shove poor Don to his cer­tain death. At which point, who­ever is ad­min­is­ter­ing the thought ex­per­i­ment rightly points out that the ac­tion and the re­sult are es­sen­tially iden­ti­cal: in one sce­nario we pull a lever, in the other we tip Don off a bridge, but in each case we are know­ingly caus­ing the death of one in­no­cent per­son to save five oth­ers. But it _feels_ dif­fer­ent, right? There’s gotta be a dif­fer­ence be­tween pulling a lever from in­side a trol­ley and _phys­i­cally push­ing some­one off a bridge_. Also: Be more care­ful, Don. Stop lean­ing so far out over the rail­ings of bridges. (None of the peo­ple in the Trol­ley Prob­lem have any aware­ness of the dan­gers all around them. It’s in­fu­ri­at­ing.)

We’re not nearly done, by the way, with thorny Trol­ley Prob­lem–re­lated quan­daries. What if we’re doc­tors in a hos­pi­tal, and five peo­ple come into the ER need­ing five dif­fer­ent or­gan trans­plants or they’ll all die: one needs a heart, one a liver, one a lung, one a stom­ach, and one a… spleen, I guess? Do you need a spleen to live? It doesn’t mat­ter. The point is, they all need or­gans. We, the ex­hausted doc­tors on duty tonight, walk to the vend­ing ma­chine to get a soda and see a cus­to­dian hap­pily clean­ing the floors. Maybe he’s singing a lit­tle song to him­self about how healthy he is, and how it’s so cool that all of his or­gans are func­tion­ing per­fectly. This gives us a great idea: We’ll kill that cus­to­dian, har­vest his or­gans, and divvy ’em up. His heart goes to the heart-need­ing guy, his spleen to the spleen-need­ing lady, and so on. Ev­ery­body wins! (Ex­cept for the cus­to­dian.)

Again, this seems ab­hor­rent, but in essence it’s no dif­fer­ent from our ac­tion and its re­sults in the orig­i­nal ex­per­i­ment: be­cause of a choice we make, one in­no­cent dies and five in­no­cents live. Al­most none of us would agree to that ver­sion, how­ever. It’s one thing to pull a lever, we think—it’s an­other thing en­tirely to sneak up be­hind a singing cus­to­dian and gar­rote him with a pi­ano wire so we can rip out his spleen. This is why the Trol­ley Prob­lem is so com­pelling: our an­swers to the sim­ple ques­tion “Is it okay to do this?” vary widely with each dif­fer­ent ver­sion, even though the ba­sic act (choos­ing to kill one per­son) and its end re­sult (five oth­ers live) is al­ways the same.

So… what the hell?

### Util­i­tar­i­an­ism—A Re­sults-Ori­ented Busi­ness!

We have now ar­rived at the sec­ond of our three main West­ern philo­soph­i­cal schools: util­i­tar­i­an­ism, most fa­mously de­vel­oped by British philoso­phers Jeremy Ben­tham (1748–1832) and John Stu­art Mill (1806–1873), two deeply weird dudes.

Ben­tham had many ad­mirable qual­i­ties—he ar­gued for gay rights, mi­nor­ity rights, women’s rights, and an­i­mal rights, which were not things a lot of peo­ple ar­gued for in eigh­teenth-cen­tury Eng­land. He was also… let’s say, “ec­cen­tric”? and de­clared that when he died his body should be given to his friend Dr. Thomas South­wood Smith for use in med­i­cal re­search. Smith pre­served Ben­tham’s skele­ton, dressed it in one of Ben­tham’s suits (as he had ap­par­ently re­quested), and com­mis­sioned a wax replica head when the preser­va­tion of Ben­tham’s ac­tual head—and I quote—“did not pro­duce ac­cept­able re­sults.” Ap­par­ently, in fact, it “went dis­as­trously wrong, rob­bing the head of most of its fa­cial ex­pres­sion, and leav­ing it de­cid­edly unattrac­tive.” (I have de­cided not to in­clude any pho­tos of this. You’re wel­come.) The Ben­tham skele­ton-wax-head con­trap­tion is called his “auto-icon,” which I sup­pose is a bet­ter name than “night­mare death pup­pet,” and in 1850 Smith do­nated the auto-icon to Uni­ver­sity Col­lege Lon­don, of which Ben­tham was a sort of “spir­i­tual founder” (though not an ac­tual one) so they took it in. Hi­lar­i­ously, ac­cord­ing to the UCL blog, “The Col­lege did not im­me­di­ately dis­play the auto-icon, much to Smith’s dis­dain.” Seems like a real “can you blame them?” type of deal. For decades UCL kept their hu­man scare­crow in a wooden cab­i­net, but in Feb­ru­ary 2020 they put it in a freak­ing glass case in the freak­ing stu­dent cen­ter, which I imag­ine ev­ery­one at Uni­ver­sity Col­lege Lon­don re­ally en­joys and it doesn’t at all make them want to barf.[^3]

Ben­tham’s dis­ci­ple J. S. Mill was also an early women’s rights sup­porter, au­thor­ing a ground­break­ing work of fem­i­nist thought called _The Sub­jec­tion of Women_ in 1869.[^4] He learned Greek and Latin by the age of eight, and by the time he was a teenager he had an im­pres­sive com­mand of Eu­clidean math, pol­i­tics, phi­los­o­phy, and ba­si­cally ev­ery­thing else, thanks to an over­bear­ing dad who had some truly in­tense thoughts on child­hood ed­u­ca­tion. By the time he was twenty he was hor­ri­bly de­pressed—a pre­dictable out­come if you have the kind of fa­ther who made you learn Greek and Latin in kinder­garten. Mill pulled out of his funk partly by read­ing Ro­man­tic po­etry, which is a very nine­teenth-cen­tury-British-ge­nius way to pull out of a funk, and went on to be­come one of his gen­er­a­tion’s most in­flu­en­tial philoso­phers de­spite never teach­ing at a uni­ver­sity or even at­tend­ing one. To cap off his sin­gu­lar life, Mill died in 1873 of St. An­thony’s fire, a rare in­fec­tion where your skin es­sen­tially ex­plodes into bright red in­flam­ma­tions. But be­fore his skin ex­ploded, he fur­thered Ben­tham’s work on the sub­ject of util­i­tar­i­an­ism, and brought it to the fore­front of West­ern philo­soph­i­cal thought.

Util­i­tar­i­an­ism is one branch of a school of eth­i­cal phi­los­o­phy broadly called “con­se­quen­tial­ism,” which cares only about the _re­sults_ or _con­se­quences_ of our ac­tions. The best thing to do, says a con­se­quen­tial­ist, is sim­ply the thing that re­sults in the most good and the least bad. Specif­i­cally, Ben­tham’s ini­tial phras­ing of util­i­tar­i­an­ism was that the best ac­tion is what­ever makes the most peo­ple _happy_.[^5] He called this the “great­est hap­pi­ness prin­ci­ple,” and it’s both invit­ingly sim­ple and kind of silly.[^6] “Who gets to de­cide what ‘hap­pi­ness’ is?” would be one ques­tion we might ask, given that some peo­ple, like me, are nor­mal and well-ad­justed, and other peo­ple put pineap­ple on pizza and en­joy lis­ten­ing to the Red Hot Chili Pep­pers.

Still, con­se­quen­tial­ism has un­de­ni­able ap­peal. When I first read about it in col­lege, I thought: “Cool! I _get_ this one!” It’s an eth­i­cal the­ory that feels _at­tain­able_, be­cause all that mat­ters for any ac­tion is the out­come: more over­all hap­pi­ness = bet­ter, more over­all sad­ness = worse, so all we have to do is cre­ate more plea­sure/hap­pi­ness than we do pain/sad­ness and we win the ethics con­test! Con­se­quen­tial­ists give us the com­fort of _know­ing_ that what we did was good or bad, be­cause the an­swer lies in ver­i­fi­able re­sults; it’s an at­tempt to take moral­ity out of the ab­stract and make it more like math, or chem­istry. Think of the scene at the end of _Schindler’s List_, when Os­kar Schindler (Liam Nee­son) laments that he hadn’t done enough—that his gold pin could’ve been traded or sold, and the money then used to save the lives of two more peo­ple. Schindler had found a way to res­cue per­se­cuted peo­ple us­ing his for­tune and in­flu­ence, so ev­ery pfen­nig he spent equaled some per­cent­age of a hu­man life. His moral cal­cu­la­tion was crys­tal clear. And that’s why _Schindler’s List_ is fa­mously such a pleas­ant and re­lax­ing movie to watch.

Okay, so, only the re­sults mat­ter. But how do we ac­tu­ally judge the re­sults? If you’re Os­kar Schindler, and you trade a gold Nazi pin you don’t re­ally care about for two hu­man be­ings, it’s pretty easy to fig­ure out that you cre­ated more hap­pi­ness/plea­sure (two lives are saved) than pain/sad­ness (you don’t have your cool pin any­more). But most de­ci­sions aren’t nearly that cut-and-dried. If we’re go­ing to judge _all_ of our ac­tions on this ba­sis, we need some kind of cal­cu­la­tor that can help us de­ter­mine how many “hap­pi­ness points” or “sad­ness de­mer­its” each act cre­ates. So, Ben­tham in­vented one. He came up with seven scales we should use to mea­sure the plea­sure cre­ated by any­thing we do:

- In­ten­sity (how strong it is)
- Du­ra­tion (how long it lasts)
- Cer­tainty (how def­i­nite it is that it’ll work)
- Propin­quity (how soon it can hap­pen)
- Fe­cun­dity (how “last­ing” it is—how much other plea­sure it can lead to)
- Pu­rity (how lit­tle pain it causes in re­la­tion to the plea­sure it cre­ates)
- Ex­tent (how many peo­ple it ben­e­fits)

Two things are clear. First, it is _im­pos­si­ble_ to look at that list and not make jokes about util­i­tar­i­an­ism be­ing like sex. I mean, come on. “In­ten­sity,” “how long it lasts,” “how much other plea­sure it can lead to”—if you read that sec­tion and did not im­me­di­ately make a joke about Jeremy Ben­tham be­ing his­tory’s horni­est philoso­pher, you’re a bet­ter per­son than I am. But sec­ond: this cal­cu­la­tor stinks. How are we ac­tu­ally sup­posed to ap­ply these scales to the things we do? How can we cal­cu­late the “fe­cun­dity” of loan­ing a co­worker twenty bucks, or the “pu­rity” of eat­ing a fried tur­key leg at a state fair? Ben­tham even sug­gested new ter­mi­nol­ogy for our mea­sure­ments: “he­dons” for units of plea­sure, and “do­lors” for units of pain. This dude wanted us to walk around and say things like, “By my cal­cu­la­tion, buy­ing pro­duce from a lo­cal farm­ers mar­ket in­stead of a large na­tional chain cre­ates 3.7 he­dons and only 1.6 do­lors, and thus it is a good ac­tion.” Doesn’t seem plau­si­ble. But Ben­tham—who, it should again be noted, had his skele­ton sta­pled to a chair and per­ma­nently dis­played in a fa­mous uni­ver­sity—clearly be­lieves in his sys­tem, and writes about it with great con­vic­tion. He even made up a cute lit­tle rhyme to help guide us:

> In­tense, long, cer­tain, speedy, fruit­ful, pure—
> 
> Such marks in plea­sures and in pains en­dure.
> 
> Such plea­sures seek if pri­vate be thy end:
> 
> If it be pub­lic, wide let them ex­tend.
> 
> Such pains avoid, which­ever be thy view:
> 
> If pains must come, let them ex­tend to few.

And you know what? De­spite all of the prob­lems we’ve al­ready noted with the great­est hap­pi­ness prin­ci­ple, that ghoul­ish hu­man taxi­dermy ex­per­i­ment had a point. If you knew noth­ing about moral­ity and all you did was fol­low Ben­tham’s lit­tle rhyme, you’d be a pretty de­cent per­son. When we cre­ate plea­sure or pain, he says, those sen­sa­tions can be de­fined by how in­tense, long, cer­tain, speedy, fruit­ful, and pure they are. If you’re act­ing only for your­self, go ahead and seek plea­sures how­ever you want—but if you’re act­ing pub­licly, aim to spread as much plea­sure around as you can.[^7] Avoid caus­ing pain when­ever pos­si­ble, but if you can’t, do your best to limit the amount of pain peo­ple ex­pe­ri­ence. That ain’t half bad. The main thing Ben­tham and the other util­i­tar­i­ans have go­ing for them is their over­rid­ing con­cern for other peo­ple, and their be­lief that all peo­ple’s hap­pi­ness mat­ters equally. _My_ hap­pi­ness is no more spe­cial than _any­one else_’s, they said, which es­sen­tially elim­i­nates the con­cept of elitism. The util­i­tar­ian cruise ship has no first class sec­tion re­served for the wealth­i­est pas­sen­gers—ev­ery­one’s room is the same size, and ev­ery­one eats from the same buf­fet.

So… is util­i­tar­i­an­ism the an­swer?

### No. Util­i­tar­i­an­ism Is Not “the An­swer” (in Many Sit­u­a­tions).

Un­for­tu­nately, any stress test that we per­form on util­i­tar­i­an­ism can re­veal cru­cial weak­nesses in its cen­tral tenets. If all that mat­ters is max­i­miz­ing hap­pi­ness and min­i­miz­ing pain, we quickly ar­rive at some gnarly con­clu­sions—like, say, that a doc­tor could go ahead and stran­gle an in­no­cent cus­to­dian in or­der to hand out his or­gans to five needy pa­tients. Ben­tham’s great­est hap­pi­ness prin­ci­ple also sug­gests that if a pig has enough pig slop and mud to roll around in, the pig is “hap­pier” (and thus, more “suc­cess­ful” in its life) than, say, Socrates, who was maybe a bril­liant thinker but also an­noyed ev­ery­one in Athens so much that his gov­ern­ment threw him in jail and made him drink hem­lock and die. Any eth­i­cal the­ory that sug­gests a muddy pig had a hap­pier and bet­ter life than one of hu­man­ity’s great­est thinkers is in trou­ble right off the bat, prob­a­bly.[^8]

In­deed, ever since Ben­tham in­tro­duced util­i­tar­i­an­ism to the world, philoso­phers have de­lighted in de­sign­ing thought ex­per­i­ments to re­veal how flimsy it can be. Here’s one I like:[^9] Imag­ine there’s an elec­tri­cian (let’s call him Steve) work­ing on a trans­former at ESPN dur­ing a World Cup soc­cer match. Steve slips and falls be­hind the trans­former—just gets re­ally wedged in there—and the elec­tri­cal equip­ment starts re­peat­edly jolt­ing him. We could get Steve free, but do­ing so would re­quire that we shut the trans­former down for a few min­utes, in­ter­rupt­ing the broad­cast. The strict con­se­quen­tial­ist makes an easy call here: tens of mil­lions of peo­ple would be _so sad_ if the feed gets cut, so, sorry, Steve, you’ll just have to stay there and get con­tin­u­ously zapped un­til your bones are vis­i­ble through your skin like in car­toons. But that an­swer leaves us cold. It feels wrong to let poor in­no­cent Steve suf­fer so oth­ers can be happy. That’s what a lot of the prob­lems with con­se­quen­tial­ism boil down to, re­ally—some­times it sim­ply _feels_ like the con­clu­sion we come to, when we tally up the to­tal “plea­sure” and “pain” re­sult­ing from a de­ci­sion, just can’t be right.

Now, util­i­tar­i­ans had a clever re­sponse to this: If we con­clude that some ac­tion cre­ated more good than bad, but it seems like this ac­tion can’t pos­si­bly be morally per­mis­si­ble, well… that just means we did the cal­cu­la­tion wrong. When we’re to­tal­ing up the good and bad of the ac­tion, we have to con­sider the en­tire pic­ture; that is, how much pain would be caused not just to the one in­no­cent per­son who suf­fered, but to _all_ peo­ple, who now know that this has hap­pened _and_ that our so­ci­ety has deemed it per­mis­si­ble—which means the same thing could the­o­ret­i­cally hap­pen to them. Hear­ing that we let Steve get zapped like the rob­ber in _Home Alone 2_ when he touches Kevin’s booby-trapped, elec­tri­fied sink just so we could watch a soc­cer match would thus make _a lot of peo­ple_ at least _a lit­tle bit_ mis­er­able, so we have to add their psy­cho­log­i­cal and emo­tional pain to Steve’s ac­tual phys­i­cal pain, which makes the to­tal amount of “bad” far greater than we at first thought. This is both a bril­liant de­fense and a to­tal cop-out, be­cause any­time a util­i­tar­ian cal­cu­la­tion leads to an un­pleas­ant con­clu­sion, the util­i­tar­ian can just tell us we did the math wrong.

And even if we do fac­tor in the neb­u­lous amount of pain/sad­ness caused to the world at large by let­ting Steve be zapped, a con­se­quen­tial­ist might _still_ let it hap­pen. I mean, sure: The­o­ret­i­cally, ev­ery­one now knows that our so­ci­ety per­mits such things and is thus aware that it may hap­pen to them some­day… but hon­estly, what are the chances this _would_ hap­pen to any of us? We’re not elec­tri­cians, we don’t work at ESPN—we might (cor­rectly) write this off as a freak ac­ci­dent. Plus, Steve must have un­der­stood the risks when he took the job of “trans­former fixer”—_all_ jobs carry _some_ risk. So the strict con­se­quen­tial­ist might do a thor­ough cal­cu­la­tion of he­dons and do­lors and _still_ de­cide that it’s cool to just leave Steve there, vi­brat­ing like a tun­ing fork, so we can all watch the last eight min­utes of the Brazil-France semi­fi­nal. Sort­ing out these broader, sec­ondary plea­sure/pain im­pli­ca­tions can be a mad­den­ingly in­ex­act sci­ence.

An­other prob­lem: de­ter­min­ing the re­sults of our ac­tions re­quires that we un­der­stand the link be­tween those ac­tions and their re­sults—that we ac­tu­ally _did_ what we think we did—which is fre­quently not the case. If there’s one thing peo­ple are bad at, it’s draw­ing the cor­rect con­clu­sion from a given re­sult.[^10] Of­ten we do things whose con­se­quences we can’t de­ter­mine for a long time. Some­times we can’t tell the dif­fer­ence be­tween cau­sa­tion—we did _this thing_, which caused _that re­sult_—and cor­re­la­tion—we did _this thing_, and also that other thing _hap­pened_, but they’re not re­lated. (Sports fans, for ex­am­ple, of­ten wear a cer­tain jer­sey or sit in a spe­cific view­ing lo­ca­tion in their liv­ing room be­cause at some level they think it helps their team win—which of course it does not.[^11],[^12],[^13]) It’s aw­fully hard to de­ter­mine how much good or bad we’ve cre­ated if we don’t even truly un­der­stand what we’ve “done.”

Here’s an ex­am­ple. Let’s say we’re try­ing to achieve some kind of good—we’re teach­ers, and we want our stu­dents to get bet­ter test scores. To in­crease their mo­ti­va­tion, we tell them that if the av­er­age grade on the next math test is above an eighty, we’ll give them each a prize: one big puffy marsh­mal­low! Some of the kids like marsh­mal­lows, so they study harder. Some hate marsh­mal­lows, and they study less. Some are in­dif­fer­ent, so they study the same amount. And some are so in­cred­u­lous at how bone­headed an idea this is, they con­clude that their teach­ers are ir­re­deemable goobers and they need to trans­fer to an­other school—so they study harder than they ever have be­fore, and all ace the test. At the end of the day, the av­er­age grade is an eighty-two, and we high-five each other be­cause we think we’ve solved the prob­lem of stu­dent mo­ti­va­tion: of­fer ev­ery­one a marsh­mal­low! Our find­ings are pub­lished in _Awe­some Teacher Mag­a­zine_ with a pic­ture of us hold­ing a bag of marsh­mal­lows un­der the head­line: “What’s Their Sweet-cret?! These Teach­ers Know How to Get S’more out of Their Stu­dents!”

We just learned a bad les­son from a good out­come—we think of­fer­ing our stu­dents marsh­mal­lows helped to achieve a greater good, but in fact they largely achieved the in­tended re­sult _de­spite_ our ac­tion, and we’re now in­clined to con­tinue do­ing some­thing that ac­tu­ally makes us _worse_ teach­ers. The great ma­jor­ity of hu­man ac­tions in­volve in­com­plete in­for­ma­tion, ei­ther on the front end (be­fore we do it) or on the back end (when we ob­serve the re­sults), so de­ter­min­ing the moral value of an ac­tion based on the re­sults seems like a risky propo­si­tion. (And worse, a true con­se­quen­tial­ist might not even care that the re­sult was achieved in an un­in­tended way—we got the re­sult we wanted, so who cares how it hap­pened?) If we’re declar­ing an ac­tion “good” or “bad” based on its re­sults, and re­sults are of­ten im­pos­si­ble to fully un­der­stand… where does that leave us? And doesn’t “pulling the lever” on the trol­ley seem a bit riskier now?

### Two More Prob­lems for Util­i­tar­i­an­ism: He­do­nists and Mur­der­ous Sher­iffs

Let’s head back to the Trol­ley Prob­lem, to bet­ter un­der­stand why we _feel_ dif­fer­ently as we make our way through the vari­a­tions, even when the big-pic­ture util­i­tar­ian cal­cu­la­tion keeps spit­ting out the same in­struc­tions. Re­mem­ber that when we ap­proach the orig­i­nal ques­tion, we un­con­sciously re­spond as util­i­tar­i­ans: sav­ing more peo­ple = good. But should we shove Don the weight lifter off a bridge to stop the train? Well, no, say most peo­ple. “Why not?” ask the know­ing Phi­los­o­phy 101 pro­fes­sors, spring­ing their trap—“You’re still choos­ing to kill one per­son to save five.” “Be­cause it just _feels_ dif­fer­ent,” we re­ply weakly. What about killing one healthy per­son and har­vest­ing his or­gans to save five peo­ple who need or­gan trans­plants? “No way,” we say. Do­ing that would make us feel like we’re not even _our­selves_—like we’re the bad guy in a movie star­ring Don Chea­dle and Rachel McAdams as de­tec­tives in search of the in­fa­mous “Util­i­tar­ian Killer.”[^14] I sus­pect the rea­son for the in­con­sis­tency is some­what re­lated to those teach­ers and their marsh­mal­low ex­per­i­ment; the util­i­tar­ian an­swer­ing the “Trol­ley Prob­lem Clas­sic” might ar­rive at the right an­swer for the wrong rea­son. Maybe it _is_ morally cor­rect to pull the lever and save the five peo­ple… but not just be­cause “five is greater than one.”

As I men­tioned, when Mill and Ben­tham brought util­i­tar­i­an­ism into the world in the eigh­teenth and nine­teenth cen­turies, it drove philoso­phers batty—much of the aca­demic world an­grily re­jected the idea that ethics could be a re­sults-only en­ter­prise. Their cri­tiques are re­ally fun to read, be­cause they’re as close as philoso­phers get to trash-talk­ing.[^15] In 1945, Bertrand Rus­sell[^16]—who as it hap­pens was J. S. Mill’s god­son—pub­lished _A His­tory of West­ern Phi­los­o­phy_, an im­pres­sive sur­vey of ev­ery­thing from the pre-So­cratic Greeks to twen­ti­eth-cen­tury lo­gi­cians. Al­though Rus­sell was fond of his god­fa­ther and found both his in­tel­lec­tual prow­ess and his deeply moral life ad­mirable, the sec­tion Rus­sell wrote on the util­i­tar­i­ans oozes dis­dain. “There is noth­ing new in this doc­trine,” he sniffs, and later adds that “the in­flu­ence of the Ben­thamites on British leg­is­la­tion and pol­icy was as­ton­ish­ingly great, con­sid­er­ing their com­plete ab­sence of emo­tional ap­peal.” Among his other thoughts:

> There is an ob­vi­ous la­cuna in Ben­tham’s sys­tem.

and

> His op­ti­mism was there­fore per­haps ex­cus­able, but in our more dis­il­lu­sioned age it seems some­what naïve.

and

> John Stu­art Mill, in his _Util­i­tar­i­an­ism_, of­fers an ar­gu­ment which is so fal­la­cious that it is hard to un­der­stand how he can have thought it valid.

and

> Jeremy Ben­tham was an ig­no­rant fool and should I ever visit Uni­ver­sity Col­lege Lon­don I shall rip off his wax head and fling it into the Thames.

Fine—he didn’t write that last one, but you get the idea. He didn’t like util­i­tar­i­an­ism. He sum­ma­rizes his dis­plea­sure this way:

> Any­thing what­ever may be an ob­ject of de­sire; a masochist may de­sire his own pain.… A man may de­sire some­thing that does not af­fect him per­son­ally ex­cept be­cause of his de­sire—for in­stance, the vic­tory of one side in a war in which his coun­try is neu­tral. He may de­sire an in­crease of gen­eral hap­pi­ness, or a mit­i­ga­tion of gen­eral suf­fer­ing.… As his de­sires vary, so do his plea­sures.

Rus­sell, whom I imag­ine writ­ing this sec­tion of his book while clench­ing his foun­tain pen so hard it even­tu­ally snaps in half, touches on a de­cent point here. The util­i­tar­ian fo­cus on to­tal amounts of plea­sure or pain makes us think about the po­ten­tially mas­sive dif­fer­ences among the peo­ple who are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing the plea­sure and pain. Re­mem­ber ear­lier when I men­tioned that some peo­ple, like me, are nor­mal and well-ad­justed, and other peo­ple, who are not, en­joy Hawai­ian pizza (which, if you don’t know, is topped with pineap­ple and ham)? Well, what if I’m run­ning a pizza shop and en­counter you, a weirdo who loves Hawai­ian pizza—in fact, you love it _so deeply and thor­oughly_ that the amount of plea­sure you get from it is just off the charts? One slice of Hawai­ian pizza sends you into an or­gas­mic reverie—just buck­ets of he­dons drip­ping off your fore­head—so that the “to­tal plea­sure” of you eat­ing one slice of Hawai­ian is greater than the to­tal plea­sure of ev­ery­one else eat­ing nor­mal pizza. If I’m be­ing a good lit­tle util­i­tar­ian, shouldn’t I stop mak­ing nor­mal (good) pizza in or­der to de­vote my life to mak­ing Hawai­ian (crime against na­ture) pizza, solely to ben­e­fit you and cre­ate more plea­sure?[^17]

Util­i­tar­i­an­ism of­ten runs into prob­lems like this, be­cause hu­man be­ings, it turns out, are _weird_, so search­ing for ac­tions that cre­ate the most “to­tal hap­pi­ness” can cre­ate bizarre sit­u­a­tions. It doesn’t seem fair to pre­fer a ton of plea­sure for one Hawai­ian pizza–lov­ing so­ciopath over smaller plea­sures for a large num­ber of more de­cent and sta­ble peo­ple, who un­der­stand that the proper places for ham and pineap­ple are in sand­wiches and fruit sal­ads, re­spec­tively. Other times, util­i­tar­i­ans do the re­verse, mak­ing rules that seem to elim­i­nate the pe­cu­liar­i­ties of each in­di­vid­ual and con­geal all hu­man hap­pi­ness or sad­ness into gi­ant clumps. That’s hard to swal­low too, given that the dif­fer­ences in what makes peo­ple happy are beau­ti­ful and in­ter­est­ing—they’re the very things that make us _us_. To some of its crit­ics, util­i­tar­i­an­ism isn’t re­ally even ethics—it’s math. And if some­one com­plains about the re­sult, a util­i­tar­ian points to the fact that more peo­ple are happy than sad and yells, “Score­board!” like a drunk foot­ball fan whose team is win­ning.

One of my fa­vorite anti-util­i­tar­ian thought ex­per­i­ments—the one that re­ally helps ex­plain the Trol­ley Prob­lem weird­ness—comes from Bernard Williams (1929–2003), an­other British[^18] philoso­pher, who de­signed the fol­low­ing (para­phrased) sce­nario. It’s a close cousin of both “Steve the Zappee at ESPN” and the Trol­ley Prob­lem, but his anal­y­sis puts an even finer point on Rus­sell’s cri­tique:

Jim is va­ca­tion­ing in a small town in some dis­tant part of the coun­try, and he hap­pens upon the lo­cal sher­iff, Pete, who is point­ing a gun at ten res­i­dents.[^19] Pete tells Jim that here in this town they do a su­per-fun thing to main­tain law and or­der: ev­ery so of­ten they kill ten peo­ple at ran­dom, just to re­mind ev­ery­one who’s boss. But now that Jim is here, it’s a spe­cial oc­ca­sion, so if Jim agrees, he—Jim—can shoot just _one_ of the lo­cals, and that will serve as the weekly “les­son.” (Be­fore you ask, it’s also clear that Jim can’t like grab the gun and pull some cool Ja­son Bourne moves on Pete and let ev­ery­one go free.) For the util­i­tar­ian, the so­lu­tion is ob­vi­ous: Jim should kill the one lo­cal and save nine lives. But the prob­lem, for Williams, is that this util­i­tar­ian an­swer ig­nores _Jim_. What be­comes of a man who was out for a nice walk and then stum­bled into a sit­u­a­tion where he was forced to mur­der an in­no­cent per­son in cold blood, sim­ply to achieve some kind of max­i­mal he­don/do­lor ra­tio? How does Jim just go back to his nor­mal life?

Williams uses the word _in­tegrity_ to at­tack the util­i­tar­i­ans—less in the sense of “hon­esty and moral up­right­ness” than “whole­ness,” or “un­di­vid­ed­ness.” He says that their world­view causes a crack in the ba­sic foun­da­tion of an in­di­vid­ual’s be­ing—the sense that “each of us is spe­cially re­spon­si­ble for what he does, rather than for what other peo­ple do.” Ten peo­ple might die be­cause Sher­iff Pete thinks mass mur­der is a good way to main­tain law and or­der—but that’s on Pete. If Jim kills a guy, _that’s on Jim_, even if he does it for the sake of some kind of “greater good.” Jim’s in­tegrity has to mat­ter, at some level—his sense of be­ing a holis­tic en­tity who’s not re­quired to com­pro­mise him­self by act­ing in a way that di­vides him into parts, some of which he won’t rec­og­nize as his own. Jim has to think it’s per­mis­si­ble _for him_—not just for “some­one”—to shoot an in­no­cent per­son if it saves nine oth­ers, or to shove a weight lifter off a bridge if it stops a run­away trol­ley. It might be that the morally right thing to do is in fact to kill the one lo­cal. But in the util­i­tar­ian’s mind, it’s sim­ply a num­bers game, and for Williams, num­bers can’t be the only fac­tor.

We’ll come back to the Trol­ley Prob­lem in the next chap­ter (and get more ex­pla­na­tions for our in­con­sis­tent re­sponses), but for now, let’s just be con­tent with this no­tion: when we’re con­fronting moral dilem­mas, es­pe­cially ones where se­ri­ous pain and suf­fer­ing re­sult from our ac­tions, re­ly­ing solely on util­i­tar­ian ac­count­ing is bound to cause sig­nif­i­cant prob­lems—there are other fac­tors here, not least among them our _in­tegrity_, and ig­nor­ing those fac­tors may re­sult in our do­ing things we re­ally don’t feel are the right things to do. And even if our per­sonal for­mu­la­tion of the right ac­tion hap­pens to line up with a util­i­tar­ian world­view, that doesn’t nec­es­sar­ily mean the util­i­tar­ian world­view is the _rea­son_ it’s the right ac­tion.

### Enough Pick­ing on Util­i­tar­i­ans—Let’s Fo­cus on the Pos­i­tives!

Most of the thought ex­per­i­ments in­vented to at­tack con­se­quen­tial­ism in­volve hav­ing to do some­thing aw­ful to pre­vent some­thing _more_ aw­ful from hap­pen­ing; the best way to ex­ploit the flaws in a “num­bers game” the­ory is to de­sign sce­nar­ios where peo­ple suf­fer no mat­ter what you de­cide to do. But to let the util­i­tar­i­ans off the hook a lit­tle, we should note that their the­ory of­ten holds up far bet­ter when we’re sim­ply try­ing to max­i­mize good. Put run­away trol­leys and mur­der­ous sher­iffs aside for a sec­ond and con­sider a more com­mon real-life sit­u­a­tion: a hur­ri­cane dam­ages a city, and a food bank con­tain­ing one thou­sand meals needs to de­cide how to di­vide them up. The util­i­tar­ian would sim­ply aim to spread the food around to as many peo­ple as pos­si­ble, start­ing with those who had been hurt the most by the storm or were in the great­est need—be­cause we’d cre­ate more plea­sure by giv­ing those peo­ple food than if we gave it to peo­ple who were only lightly in­con­ve­nienced. That’s a pretty good sys­tem! The com­pli­ca­tions arise when you run into those weird plea­sure-mon­ster re­quests; like, maybe there’s one guy named Lars who claims he should get one hun­dred of the meals for him­self, be­cause he’s com­pos­ing an emo-rock opera based on the movie _Avatar_ that will take months to com­plete, so he needs a lot of food to keep his cre­ative juices flow­ing. Well, this is just great—now the util­i­tar­ian has to cal­cu­late how much plea­sure Lars will get from com­plet­ing his emo-rock opera, and how much plea­sure other peo­ple will get from hear­ing it.[^20] Sud­denly, what seemed like a straight­for­ward dis­tri­bu­tion model gets all gunked up. It’s un­likely (ab­sent other fac­tors)[^21] that giv­ing one-tenth of the avail­able food to some James Cameron–wor­ship­ping Fall Out Boy su­per­fan is eth­i­cally prefer­able, but if we’re be­ing good lit­tle util­i­tar­i­ans, we have to go through the process of think­ing it all through and re­cal­cu­lat­ing, which is dif­fi­cult and an­noy­ing.

Con­se­quen­tial­ism has re­cently seen a resur­gence in the world of moral phi­los­o­phy. This may be due to some­thing en­demic to the modern world, like in­come dis­par­ity hit­ting all-time highs, which has re­fo­cused aca­demic at­ten­tion on the mis­ap­pro­pri­a­tion of cap­i­tal. Or maybe the world’s prob­lems have just be­come so mas­sive, the pop­u­la­tion so enor­mous, and the ques­tions of how we treat each other so ur­gent, a phi­los­o­phy that sim­ply aims to help as many needy peo­ple as much as we can makes more sense in moral terms than it did in sim­pler, less pop­u­lous times. Quite lit­er­ally _as I write this_, gov­ern­ments ev­ery­where are de­cid­ing how to ad­min­is­ter the var­i­ous Covid-19 vac­cines, which (at least at first) are in lim­ited sup­ply. Those cal­cu­la­tions are in­dis­putably util­i­tar­ian—they pri­or­i­tize those most likely to get very ill or die, as well as peo­ple whose jobs put them at higher risk. The “good” of each dose is there­fore max­i­mized, be­cause each one al­le­vi­ates the most po­ten­tial pain and un­hap­pi­ness—we’d be hard-pressed to find a school of phi­los­o­phy that could de­scribe a bet­ter way to vac­ci­nate the pub­lic against this dis­ease. While a purely re­sults-based phi­los­o­phy can cre­ate a lot of prob­lems, there are clearly sit­u­a­tions that greatly ben­e­fit from car­ing only about how much plea­sure we can cre­ate[^22] and how lit­tle pain.

But we also saw that de­ter­min­ing the moral value of our ac­tions based solely on their re­sults can be im­pos­si­ble, or mis­lead­ing, or hard to cal­cu­late, or all three. So… what if we ig­nore the re­sults? What if we can de­ter­mine the moral worth of what we do _be­fore_ we do it? What if, faced with a choice be­tween killing one per­son or five, there were some kind of rule we could fol­low that would guar­an­tee we acted cor­rectly _re­gard­less of the re­sult_? And what if we could go back to that Uni­verse Good­ness Ac­coun­tant from the in­tro­duc­tion, who tsk-tsked us for all the bad re­sults we got, and say, “Hey, lady—we don’t care if our day of good deeds got all screwed up, be­cause we _meant_ to do good things and only our _in­ten­tions_ de­ter­mine our moral worth”? Wouldn’t that feel good, to rub it in her face a lit­tle?

Buckle up, peo­ple. It’s Kant time.

    

## CHAP­TER THREE Should I Lie and Tell My Friend I Like Her Ugly Shirt?

Which of these false ex­cuses have you used to avoid an an­noy­ing so­cial obli­ga­tion?

- “Sorry, I didn’t get your text. My phone’s been weird lately.”
- “I can’t make din­ner tonight—our babysit­ter dropped out at the last sec­ond.”
- “I would _love_ to at­tend your daugh­ter’s mid­dle school or­ches­tra con­cert, but my lizard is de­pressed. She isn’t sit­ting on her fa­vorite rock, and she won’t eat let­tuce, and I just need to be there for her.”[^1]

“Should I tell the truth?” is one of the most com­mon eth­i­cal dilem­mas we face. Most of us don’t _en­joy_ mis­lead­ing peo­ple, but the gears of so­ci­ety do mesh more smoothly if we grease them with white lies. It cer­tainly seems eas­ier (and maybe even more po­lite) to tell some­one we have to look af­ter our sick lizard, rather than say­ing, “I do not want to go to your kid’s con­cert, be­cause it will prob­a­bly suck and be bor­ing,” or worse yet _ac­tu­ally go­ing to the con­cert_. How­ever, we also sense that there must be some eth­i­cal cost when we lie. We know we’re not sup­posed to do it, and ev­ery time we do, we feel a twinge of wrong­ness; it feels _bad_, or at least _iffy_… but the feel­ing usu­ally fades quickly, we just go about our lives, and in most cases, no one seems the worse for wear. So… is it ac­tu­ally bad?

When we’re first con­fronted with one of these sit­u­a­tions—a friend bought an ugly shirt to wear to a job in­ter­view, say, and asks us for our opin­ion—we might do a cou­ple of con­se­quen­tial­ist cal­cu­la­tions:

Good Things About Ly­ing and Say­ing We Like the Shirt

1. We don’t hurt our friend’s feel­ings.
2. In fact, we make her _happy._
3. We don’t seem like a jerk.
4. Our friend­ship con­tin­ues apace.

Bad Things About Telling the Truth and Say­ing the Shirt Is Hideous

1. We make our friend sad.
2. We may have to have a dif­fi­cult con­ver­sa­tion and ar­gue that true friend­ship means al­ways be­ing hon­est, which can be a tough sell when some­one is up­set at you for be­ing hon­est.
3. We seem like a jerk.
4. Our friend may re­act badly, dou­ble down on her own opin­ion in or­der to prove us wrong, wear the ugly shirt to the in­ter­view, fail to get the job be­cause the in­ter­viewer ques­tions the de­ci­sion-mak­ing abil­ity of some­one who would buy such an ugly shirt, fall into a deep de­pres­sion, sever ties with her friends and fam­ily, turn to a life of vi­o­lent crime, and spend twenty-five years in a max­i­mum-se­cu­rity prison.[^2]

If we are be­ing good lit­tle con­se­quen­tial­ists, we might also try to an­tic­i­pate the larger, broader set of con­se­quences—what will be the ef­fect of liv­ing in a world where our clos­est friends don’t al­ways tell us the truth? We may then con­clude, cor­rectly, that such a world _al­ready ex­ists_, and it’s not so bad, re­ally, so maybe we should just avoid any con­flict and pro­claim that the lace col­lar re­ally pops and the over­size neon green but­tons are a cool con­ver­sa­tion starter.

But as we’ve seen, con­se­quen­tial­ist ac­count­ing is fuzzy and im­pre­cise. Not to men­tion that this ex­per­i­ment seems a bit tainted, be­cause the ben­e­fits we iden­ti­fied are largely to _our­selves_—_we_ will ei­ther avoid some pain (the tough con­ver­sa­tion with our friend, hurt­ing her feel­ings) if we lie, or feel that pain if we tell the truth, and since peo­ple gen­er­ally try to avoid pain when­ever pos­si­ble, our judg­ment may be skewed here. Gen­er­ally speak­ing, the best eth­i­cal de­ci­sion is prob­a­bly not “take the easy route out of self-in­ter­est.” It would be awe­some it if were! But it’s prob­a­bly not.

We should also ac­knowl­edge that when we made these con­se­quen­tial­ist cal­cu­la­tions, we only went half­way: we thought about the good/plea­sure that comes from ly­ing and the bad/pain from telling the truth, but did not try to cal­cu­late the good/plea­sure that comes from telling the truth or the bad/pain from ly­ing. We don’t think about those sides of the equa­tion as much be­cause they’re more neb­u­lous—how do we cal­cu­late the so­ci­etal _ben­e­fit_ of truth, or the so­ci­etal _ill_ of a white lie? It only seems pos­si­ble if some­thing tan­gi­ble re­sults from those ac­tions—say, if we falsely pro­claim that we like the ugly shirt, and our friend, brim­ming with con­fi­dence from our com­pli­ment, wears it to the in­ter­view, doesn’t get the job be­cause of how ugly the shirt is, falls into a deep de­pres­sion, turns to a life of vi­o­lent crime, and spends twenty-five years in a max­i­mum-se­cu­rity prison.[^3]

There’s a whole bunch of “what-ifs” in­volved with eth­i­cal cal­culations, which is partly what makes util­i­tar­ian ac­count­ing feel shaky. So maybe there is some other eth­i­cal sys­tem we can use—one that prom­ises hard and fast rules we can fol­low to _guar­an­tee_ moral suc­cess. Per­haps what we need is a real stick­ler. A stern hardass who crosses his arms dis­ap­prov­ingly when we equiv­o­cate. A no-non­sense Ger­manic dad who will look at our moral re­port card, see five A’s and one A-mi­nus, and ask: “What hap­pened with the A-mi­nus?”

We need Im­manuel Kant, and the philo­soph­i­cal the­ory known as de­on­tol­ogy.

### The Cat­e­gor­i­cal Im­per­a­tive: The Most Ger­man Idea Ever

De­on­tol­ogy is the study of du­ties or obli­ga­tions. If you’ve heard the term be­fore, you ei­ther (a) stud­ied phi­los­o­phy or (b) had a very an­noy­ing con­ver­sa­tion at a cock­tail party with a grad stu­dent, prob­a­bly named Jonas, who drank Ja­pa­nese whiskey and talked way too much about David Fos­ter Wal­lace.[^4] Im­manuel Kant (1724–1804), pri­mar­ily re­spon­si­ble for bring­ing de­on­tol­ogy to promi­nence, be­lieved that we should dis­cern rules for moral be­hav­ior us­ing only our abil­ity for pure rea­son­ing, and then act out of an un­flinch­ing duty to fol­low those rules. Some sit­u­a­tion presents it­self, we tease out the spe­cific “maxim” we have to fol­low, we fol­low it, and we’re done. Since the only thing that mat­ters is our ad­her­ence to the duty to fol­low what­ever rule we came up with, the _re­sults_ of our ac­tions are ir­rel­e­vant. Fol­low­ing the right rules = act­ing morally. Not fol­low­ing them = fail­ing to act morally. End of story. No lee­way, no loop­holes, no ex­cuses.

It’s a pretty rigid sys­tem, and as you might ex­pect, Kant was a pretty rigid dude. As leg­end has it, his rou­tines were so pre­dictable and ex­act that lo­cal shop­keep­ers in East Prus­sia would set their watches based on when he walked past their stores. That’s most likely apoc­ryphal, but it speaks to the myth that built up around him based on his hard-core view of moral­ity and his schol­ar­ship in gen­eral; I mean, any­one who built an en­tire eth­i­cal the­ory on the back of “pure rea­son” is bound to be an in­tensely schol­arly fel­low. Be­fore he delved into moral phi­los­o­phy, he was a lover of his­tory and sci­ence, as Bertrand Rus­sell tells us:

> Af­ter the earth­quake of Lis­bon he wrote on the the­ory of earth­quakes; he wrote a trea­tise on wind, and a short es­say on the ques­tion whether the west wind in Eu­rope is moist be­cause it has crossed the At­lantic Ocean.

There isn’t a ton of hu­mor to be found in the writ­ings of eigh­teenth-cen­tury philoso­phers, but hon­estly, noth­ing is fun­nier to me than imag­in­ing Im­manuel Kant’s “trea­tise on wind.” I mean, pic­ture the most bor­ing text you can imag­ine. The 1976 Cald­well, Idaho, busi­ness reg­istry, or a nine-hun­dred-page his­tory of the gar­den hose. I guar­an­tee you they are not one-tenth as bor­ing as Im­manuel Kant’s trea­tise on wind. But once he moved past his fas­ci­na­tion with… air that moves around, he fo­cused his con­sid­er­able in­tel­lect on moral­ity, and even to­day is held in ex­tremely high re­gard among West­ern philoso­phers. Prob­a­bly be­cause none of them ever had to read his trea­tise on wind.

Kant’s ex­pli­ca­tion of de­on­tol­ogy is fa­mously dif­fi­cult to read—much harder, I think, than util­i­tar­i­an­ism or Aris­totelian virtue ethics.[^5] Jeremy Ben­tham may have suf­fered from a creepy post­mortem scare­crow fan­tasy, but at least he in­cluded fun lit­tle po­ems in his eth­i­cal writ­ings. Kant never com­posed any fun lit­tle po­ems. Kant’s writ­ing is the _op­po­site_ of fun lit­tle po­ems. Kant’s writ­ing looks like this:

> A com­pletely iso­lated meta­physics of morals… is not only an in­dis­pens­able sub­strate of all the­o­ret­i­cally sound and def­i­nite knowl­edge of du­ties; it is also a desider­a­tum of the high­est im­por­tance to the ac­tual ful­fill­ment of its pre­cepts.

I picked that chunk at ran­dom, but they’re all like that. Not a great beach read. How­ever, the most im­por­tant idea in Kan­tian ethics _is_ fairly sim­ple to un­der­stand. It’s called the cat­e­gor­i­cal im­per­a­tive, which he in­tro­duced in his not-at-all-in­tim­i­dat­ingly ti­tled _Foun­da­tions of the Meta­physics of Morals_:

> Act only ac­cord­ing to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should be­come a uni­ver­sal law.

We need to re­ally take that in, be­cause it’s ar­guably the most fa­mous sen­tence in West­ern philo­soph­i­cal thought. The only oth­ers that re­ally come close would be René Descartes’s _Cog­ito, ergo sum_ (“I think, there­fore I am”), Thomas Hobbes’s “The life of man [is] soli­tary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short,” and of course the In­sane Clown Posse’s “Wa­ter, fire, air, and dirt / Fuck­ing mag­nets, how do _they_ work?”

The cat­e­gor­i­cal im­per­a­tive states that we can’t just find rules that tell us how _we_ ought to be­have—we have to find rules _that we could imag­ine_ _ev­ery­one else fol­low­ing too_. Be­fore we do some­thing, we have to de­ter­mine what would hap­pen if _ev­ery­one_ did it; and if a world in which ev­ery­one did it would be all screwed up, that means _we’re_ not al­lowed to do it. So, should we lie to our friend? No. Be­cause first we have to imag­ine a world where _ev­ery­one_ lies—and in such a world, we’d re­al­ize, no one would ever trust each other, hu­man com­mu­ni­ca­tion would cease to func­tion, all in­ter­ac­tions would be­come sus­pect, and even ly­ing (the thing we’re think­ing about do­ing) would lose its point. So: we can’t lie to any­one, ever, for any rea­son. (See? The dude is hard-core.)

And when we tell the truth, we have to do so not “be­cause we care about our friend” or “we’re afraid we’ll be caught in a lie” or some­thing—we tell the truth only out of a duty to fol­low the uni­ver­sal maxim we have rea­soned out. Giv­ing money to char­ity be­cause, say, “we feel sad about the state of the world” might be a nice thing to do, but the ac­tion has no moral worth. It _only_ has moral worth if we’re ad­her­ing to a maxim—per­haps “When we are able, we ought to help those less for­tu­nate”—that we can imag­ine _ev­ery­one in the world_ fol­low­ing. In or­der to be good lit­tle Kan­tians, our mo­ti­va­tion in any ac­tion can­not stray one inch from “Act out of a duty to fol­low a uni­ver­sal maxim.” No ex­cep­tions!

Ba­si­cally, Kant wanted to dif­fer­en­ti­ate be­tween hu­mans us­ing their pure rea­son (thus con­firm­ing our spe­cial­ness, as the only crea­tures who can do that) and the rest of the beasts in the lower, an­i­mal world, where emo­tions and feel­ings reign supreme and events un­fold due to these baser pas­sions. That’s why things like hap­pi­ness and fear have to be taken out of the equa­tion when we’re look­ing at mo­ti­va­tions—I mean, cows and por­cu­pines can feel hap­pi­ness or fear, and we’ve gotta be bet­ter than some dumb por­cu­pine munch­ing on a twig. This ex­plains why Kant thinks giv­ing to char­ity out of sym­pa­thy or sad­ness might be _praise­wor­thy_, but not _moral_. His es­teem for the hu­man abil­ity to use our brains makes him a bit of a snob—and that snob­bery puts him in good philo­soph­i­cal com­pany. Most schools of thought both an­cient and mod­ern spend a de­cent amount of time ex­tolling the most bril­liant and ed­u­cated among us, and af­firm­ing that hu­mans are bet­ter than other crea­tures be­cause we can think and rea­son and phi­los­o­phize. Those ar­gu­ments make sense un­til you see a bunch of kids on a speed­boat dur­ing spring break chug­ging vodka from an ice luge shaped like a shot­gun, and then you start to think maybe ot­ters and but­ter­flies have it more fig­ured out than we do.

But Kant’s strict sys­tem also pro­vides a form of com­fort. Since moral “suc­cess” comes only from act­ing out of duty to fol­low a uni­ver­sal maxim, if some­thing “bad” hap­pens as a re­sult of what­ever we do, it ain’t on us—we acted cor­rectly! In that sense, Kan­tian de­on­tol­ogy is the ex­act op­po­site of util­i­tar­i­an­ism;[^6] to that point, while all of util­i­tar­ian ethics was based on max­i­miz­ing hap­pi­ness, Kant thought “hap­pi­ness” was ir­rel­e­vant.

> There can be no im­per­a­tive which would, in the strict sense, com­mand us to do what makes for hap­pi­ness, be­cause hap­pi­ness is an ideal not of rea­son but of imag­i­na­tion, de­pend­ing only on em­pir­i­cal grounds which one would ex­pect in vain to de­ter­mine an ac­tion through which the to­tal­ity of con­se­quences—which in fact is in­fi­nite—could be achieved.

That’s how Kant ex­plains my “Hawai­ian pizza and Red Hot Chili Pep­pers” prob­lem. There’s no fol­low­able maxim in­volv­ing the cre­ation of “hap­pi­ness,” be­cause “hap­pi­ness” is some­thing sub­jec­tive that we can only de­fine for our­selves. Noth­ing in the world, no mat­ter how sim­ple, will make ev­ery­one happy—my own daugh­ter, Ivy, doesn’t like _cake_, and my son, William, doesn’t like _ice cream_—so we can­not pos­si­bly de­sign a rule in­volv­ing “mak­ing peo­ple happy” that we would want ev­ery­one to fol­low. What makes me happy will make some­one else deeply sad or in­dif­fer­ent or maybe happy but in a dif­fer­ent way or to a dif­fer­ent de­gree. So, if Kant _had_ writ­ten a fun lit­tle poem to ex­plain his phi­los­o­phy, like Ben­tham did, it would look like this:

> Act only out of duty to fol­low a uni­ver­sal maxim
> 
> De­rive these max­ims us­ing your pure rea­son
> 
> Hap­pi­ness is ir­rel­e­vant
> 
> End of poem

Not quite as catchy.

### Cat­e­gor­i­cal Im­per­a­tive 2: The Rare Se­quel That’s Bet­ter Than the Orig­i­nal

So, Kant doesn’t care what you think of the world ver­sus what I think of the world—he wants to take feel­ing and sen­ti­ment out of the equa­tion. This is Kant’s call­ing card: the in­sis­tence that moral­ity is some­thing we ar­rive at free of our sub­jec­tive feel­ings or judg­ments. None of that Aris­totelian trial and er­ror, or con­se­quen­tial­ist hap­pi­ness/sad­ness guess­work—we have to use our ra­tio­nal brains, and _only_ our ra­tio­nal brains, to cre­ate ra­tio­nal rules that lead to ra­tio­nal con­clu­sions about ra­tio­nal ac­tions. Whether you agree or not, Kant’s hard-core brain-based the­ory was a seis­mic event in West­ern phi­los­o­phy; his mon­u­men­tal in­flu­ence can be un­der­stood only when you see how many con­tem­po­rary philoso­phers worked from his source ma­te­rial. He’s sort of like Hitch­cock in film, or maybe Run-DMC in hip-hop: he had a _mas­sive_ in­flu­ence on those who came af­ter him.

But de­on­tol­ogy also cre­ates new prob­lems for us. Chief among them: when we re­place feel­ing and in­di­vid­ual judg­ment with strict uni­ver­sal laws that we have to dis­cern and then fol­low, it can take a very long time to fig­ure out what the hell to do. Some­times, be­hav­ing eth­i­cally can be a “trust your gut” type of ex­er­cise, and Kant is here to tell us our guts are stupid and we shouldn’t lis­ten to them. This is a fre­quent crit­i­cism of Kan­tian the­ory: try­ing to obey it is a purely in­tel­lec­tual ex­er­cise, and it’s _re­ally god­damn hard_. The char­ac­ter Chidi Anagonye in _The Good Place_ is a strict Kan­tian, and he’s so con­cerned with for­mu­lat­ing pre­cise Kan­tian max­ims that he es­sen­tially par­a­lyzes him­self with in­de­ci­sion, strug­gling to act in even the sim­plest of cir­cum­stances. At one point, Chidi is so des­per­ate to avoid ly­ing, in or­der not to vi­o­late the cat­e­gor­i­cal im­per­a­tive, that he strug­gles to lie to ac­tual _demons_ who want to de­stroy him and his friends. (Af­ter suf­fer­ing Chidi’s tor­tured in­ter­nal de­bates for the mil­lionth time, Michael, Ted Dan­son’s char­ac­ter, asks him, “Has any­one ever told you what a drag you are?” His re­ply: “_Ev­ery_one. _Con_stantly.”) There are many other crit­i­cisms, how­ever. One I per­son­ally like comes from nine­teenth-cen­tury Ger­man grump Friedrich Ni­et­zsche, who found Kant overly moral­is­tic and school­marmish:

> Some moral­ists want to vent their power and cre­ative whims on hu­man­ity; some oth­ers, per­haps in­clud­ing Kant, sug­gest with their moral­ity: “What de­serves re­spect in me is that I can obey—and you _ought_ not to be dif­fer­ent from me.”

Or, to para­phrase, “Ugh. Get over your­self, Kant.”[^7]

But there’s a sec­ond for­mu­la­tion of the cat­e­gor­i­cal im­per­a­tive, sometimes called in trans­la­tion the _prac­ti­cal im­per­a­tive_. It adds a rule to Kant’s phi­los­o­phy that isn’t nearly as dif­fi­cult to fol­low:

> Act so that you treat hu­man­ity, whether in your own per­son or in that of an­other, al­ways as an end and never as a means only.

In other words: don’t use peo­ple to get what you want. Ly­ing to our friend does just that—we’re do­ing it _in or­der to_ avoid a dif­fi­cult con­ver­sa­tion, or _in or­der to_ avoid seem­ing like a jerk. She’s not an end in her­self, she’s a means to an end. This for­mu­la­tion of the cat­e­gor­i­cal im­per­a­tive also retroac­tively gives a new ex­pla­na­tion as to why we felt so queasy about poor Steve, the ESPN en­gi­neer. If we let him get zapped so we could watch the World Cup, we’d be (lit­er­ally) us­ing him as an ob­ject that ab­sorbs pain so that we can ex­pe­ri­ence plea­sure. As tech­ni­cal and brainy as Kan­tian the­ory is, I find there to be some­thing sweetly hu­man­is­tic about the sec­ond for­mu­la­tion. Kant holds hu­mans in the high­est pos­si­ble re­gard and re­jects any ac­tion that de­means them or turns them into tools used to achieve some other goal. I’m not say­ing you’d want him to be your dad and com­fort you af­ter you strike out in Lit­tle League, but I think this it­er­a­tion of the cat­e­gor­i­cal im­per­a­tive means there’s a beat­ing heart un­der all that pure rea­son.

### Find­ing the Right Maxim: It’s Nearly Im­pos­si­ble!

Let’s now look at the Trol­ley Prob­lem through Kant’s eyes. He ob­vi­ously re­jects the coarse util­i­tar­ian re­sults-based cal­cu­la­tion: _kill 1, be­cause 1 < 5_. Since the re­sults of an ac­tion are ir­rel­e­vant, the “We saved four peo­ple!” re­frain bounces harm­lessly off the im­pos­ing Ger­manic fortress of de­on­to­log­i­cal the­ory. Kant only asks: When con­sid­er­ing our op­tions, what maxim could we will to be uni­ver­sal, and what ac­tion will obey our duty to fol­low it? Maybe we could rea­son out a maxim that says “We should al­ways try to spare the lives of our fel­low hu­mans,” which could cer­tainly be uni­ver­sal­ized—the world in which ev­ery­one fol­lows that rule seems like a pretty good world. So, then, should we pull the lever? I mean, we’d save lives… but we would also be _caus­ing_ that one other worker to die, which seems to be­tray the maxim… so ac­tu­ally, hang on a sec­ond—maybe we could de­sign a dif­fer­ent maxim that says “We should never _in­ten­tion­ally_ cause an in­no­cent per­son to die”[^8] (again, eas­ily uni­ver­sal­ized), and since pulling the lever does in fact _cause_ a per­son to die, maybe we _don’t_ pull it? I mean, if we do noth­ing, _we_ wouldn’t be caus­ing five peo­ple to die—the failed trol­ley brakes would cause that, right? Or, but hang on, be­cause maybe the sec­ond the brakes fail the “thing that’s caus­ing some­thing to hap­pen” trans­fers from the trol­ley brakes to us, since we are the only ones with the abil­ity to af­fect the trol­ley, which means “do­ing noth­ing” _is_ ac­tu­ally us _caus­ing_ five peo­ple to die. But hang on again, be­cause by pulling the lever we would _def­i­nitely_ be caus­ing the one other guy to die, and he never would’ve died with­out us pulling the lever, so how is that okay?!

See how hard this is? Even though Kant prom­ises clear an­swers to moral prob­lems, when you ap­ply his rea­son­ing to the Trol­ley Prob­lem, it seems like we’re in trou­ble. (We’re _al­ways_ in trou­ble with Kant. He’s al­ways stand­ing right be­hind us, cluck­ing his tongue, point­ing out how badly we’re blow­ing it.)

Now, again, most sit­u­a­tions are not as death-soaked as the Trol­ley Prob­lem. Most sit­u­a­tions are far more mun­dane—like, should we lie to our friend and say we like her ugly shirt?—so we can more eas­ily tease out the right Kan­tian move. But the Trol­ley Prob­lem does re­veal a lot of what is frus­trat­ing about de­on­to­log­i­cal the­ory: the max­ims take time to for­mu­late, and act­ing out of a duty to fol­low them some­times still seems wrong, and then we have to start over and come up with a new maxim. For bet­ter or worse, the strict util­i­tar­ian can just light­ning-quick say “Five is more than one!” and yank the lever. The Kan­tians have to use their pure rea­son to draw up a uni­ver­sal rule and act only out of a duty to fol­low that rule, and in this in­stance, they have to do that while bar­rel­ing down the tracks on a run­away trol­ley with scream­ing pas­sen­gers and scared old ladies and the lives of six some­how-still-un­aware-of-their-im­pend­ing-doom con­struc­tion work­ers at stake. How the hell are they gonna pull that off, in real time?! I mean, we’ve been mulling this over for ten pages and we _still_ don’t have a clear an­swer for what we’re sup­posed to do.

But let’s put prac­ti­cal­ity aside for a sec­ond. There must be some way to cre­ate a maxim we can fol­low that (a) we could will to be uni­ver­sal, and (b) leads to sav­ing the five lives (which our guts kinda told us would be the bet­ter out­come). Re­mem­ber, our in­ten­tion is all that mat­ters here. We just need a maxim that means we’re _in­tend­ing only to save five peo­ple_ who would be smooshed if we did noth­ing, which would mean that the smoosh­ing of the one other guy wouldn’t be morally weigh­ing on our shoul­ders, be­cause we didn’t _in­tend_ to smoosh _him_. So, let’s re­turn to the maxim “We ought to spare the lives of in­no­cent peo­ple when­ever pos­si­ble,” but mod­ify it slightly to say: “We ought to spare the lives of _as many in­no­cent peo­ple as we can_, when­ever pos­si­ble.” (Now, this is ob­vi­ously send­ing us back to­ward util­i­tar­ian math. Put a pin in that, we’ll re­turn to it in a sec­ond.) Since five in­no­cent peo­ple are about to die, we con­clude that the ac­tion that obeys our duty to that maxim is: “Pull this lever.” We can rea­son­ably ar­gue that we would have pulled that lever if _no one_ were on the other track, so if the re­sult of fol­low­ing our maxim is “one guy gets smooshed,” well, that sucks, but it was not our _in­ten­tion_.

Philippa Foot was ac­tu­ally ad­dress­ing this ex­act point in her orig­i­nal pa­per—it has to do with the doc­trine of dou­ble ef­fect, a philo­soph­i­cal idea that goes all the way back to Saint Thomas Aquinas in the thir­teenth cen­tury. Ba­si­cally, it means that an out­come can be more or less morally per­mis­si­ble de­pend­ing on whether you ac­tu­ally _in­tended_ it to hap­pen when you acted—like, when we kill some­one in self-de­fense, we _in­tended_ only to save our own in­no­cent life, and the _re­sult_ was that some­one else died. If we pull the lever _in­tend­ing_ to de­lib­er­ately smoosh a guy… not so great. But if the guy _got smooshed_ be­cause we were _in­tend­ing_ to save the lives of five guys, we’re off the hook. This may all seem like se­man­tics—or worse, a loop­hole—but since in­ten­tions are all that mat­ter to Kant, if we pull this off we can maybe eat our cake (sav­ing more lives) and have it too (not dis­ap­point­ing Im­manuel Kant).

One as­pect of Kan­tian rea­son­ing ac­tu­ally makes the Trol­ley Prob­lem clearer and not murkier; it helps ex­plain—even bet­ter than Bernard Williams’s “in­tegrity” ar­gu­ment—why our gut re­ac­tions to its dif­fer­ent ver­sions var­ied from ex­am­ple to ex­am­ple. Re­mem­ber how most peo­ple feel like pulling the lever is okay, but shov­ing the weight lifter off the bridge is not? Un­til now, we could only ex­plain this by say­ing “It feels wrong,” or maybe “Our in­tegrity has to mat­ter.” Those are _de­cent_ ex­pla­na­tions, but Kan­tian de­on­tol­ogy gives us a much sharper knife, and we can now slice this baloney re­ally thin. A sec­ond ago I men­tioned that we were drift­ing back to­ward util­i­tar­ian ac­count­ing by adding “_as many in­no­cent lives as we can_” into the maxim, which feels like we’re stir­ring some util­i­tar­i­an­ism into the de­on­to­log­i­cal stew. We might won­der, if util­i­tar­i­an­ism and Kan­tian­ism kind of merge here, why we need the an­noy­ing, dif­fi­cult-to-fol­low Kan­tian rule­book at all. Can’t we just use the eas­ier-to-un­der­stand great­est hap­pi­ness prin­ci­ple?! This all goes back to the idea that some­times, if we use util­i­tar­ian meth­ods, we ar­rive at the right moral an­swer but for the wrong rea­sons.

View­ing the orig­i­nal Trol­ley Prob­lem from a de­on­to­log­i­cal stand­point, we de­cided to fol­low the maxim “We ought to spare the lives of as many in­no­cent peo­ple as we can, when­ever pos­si­ble,” and the ac­tion we took out of a duty to obey that maxim was: pulling a lever. Pulling a lever is a pretty neu­tral ac­tion—it isn’t in­her­ently “wrong” or “bad.” In the “shove a weight lifter off the bridge” ver­sion, our ac­tion is cer­tainly _not_ neu­tral—we’re straight-up mur­der­ing a guy. So while a duty to fol­low the maxim “We ought to spare the lives of as many in­no­cent peo­ple as we can, when­ever pos­si­ble” might seem like just a fancy way of a util­i­tar­ian say­ing “Five is more than one!” that sim­i­lar­ity dis­solves when we add in the sec­ond for­mu­la­tion of the im­per­a­tive: that we should not use peo­ple as a means to an end, but rather as ends in them­selves. Shov­ing Don off the bridge cer­tainly counts as us­ing him as a means to an end—he would cease to be a per­son, and _lit­er­ally_ be­come a tool (in this case, a “hu­man trol­ley stop­per”) that al­lows us to achieve some other goal. In the Trol­ley Prob­lem Clas­sic, util­i­tar­ian ac­count­ing and de­on­to­log­i­cal duty over­lap—which­ever one we use, we’re likely to ar­rive at the same re­sult (pull the lever, save the five peo­ple). But util­i­tar­ian ac­count­ing isn’t as finely honed as Kan­tian rea­son­ing. As the de­tails of the prob­lem shift and change, strict util­i­tar­i­an­ism keeps telling us to “kill one and save five,”[^9] even when we start to feel queasy about the way in which we’re car­ry­ing out the “kill one” part. De­on­tol­ogy, how­ever, draws im­por­tant lines of dis­tinc­tion be­tween ac­cept­able and un­ac­cept­able “kill one” ac­tions. Again, we should note that util­i­tar­i­ans might claim we’re cal­cu­lat­ing wrong here—that liv­ing in a world where any­one could be shoved off a bridge in or­der to stop a ca­reen­ing trol­ley would cause so much wide­spread psy­chic agony, the “pain” of do­ing it would out­weigh the “plea­sure” of sav­ing more lives. But it’s hard not to see that Kant’s more metic­u­lous play­book gives us a bet­ter, stur­dier rea­son not to shove Don off the bridge.

### We Can’t Even Lie… to Mur­der­ers?

Part of Kant’s en­dur­ing ap­peal, it seems to me, is that he prom­ises a fool­proof how-to guide for liv­ing a moral life. He’s telling us that we can—if we stick with his pro­gram—get an A on this test. But just like with the thought ex­per­i­ments de­signed to show the lim­its of util­i­tar­i­an­ism, we can find some hy­po­thet­i­cals that seem to poke holes in de­on­tol­ogy. Here’s a fun one:[^10] Let’s say a mur­derer wants to kill your brother, Jeff, who is hid­ing up­stairs in your house. The mur­derer knocks on the door (he’s a po­lite mur­derer; he doesn’t just barge in) and says, “Hello, I am a mur­derer. I am try­ing to kill your brother, Jeff. Is he home, per­chance?” Our nat­u­ral in­cli­na­tion would be to say, “Sorry, Po­lite Mur­derer, he’s not here.” But re­mem­ber: Kant tells us that _we are not al­lowed to lie_, be­cause ly­ing can’t be uni­ver­sal­ized, be­cause if ev­ery­body could lie it would ren­der all hu­man com­mu­ni­ca­tion mean­ing­less, etc., etc. And so, ab­surdly, Kant tells us _we’re not al­lowed to lie to a mur­derer_, even when he has flatly stated that _he is there to mur­der our brother_. If Kant is our guide, Jeff is doomed. Sorry, Jeff. I hope you un­der­stand—we just can’t vi­o­late a uni­ver­sal maxim. Thanks for tak­ing such good care of us all those years af­ter Mom and Dad got di­vorced. Sorry you’re gonna be mur­dered.

But maybe we can fi­na­gle a dif­fer­ent maxim out of this sit­u­a­tion (as we did with the Trol­ley Prob­lem) and find a lit­tle es­cape hatch, which may in turn help us with the prob­lem of our friend and her ugly shirt. What if we re­spond not with a lie, but with a _true_ state­ment that doesn’t help him find Jeff? What if we say, “You know, Po­lite Mur­derer, I saw my brother ear­lier to­day at the gro­cery store… and I know on Tues­days he likes to go to the park and feed the ducks.” If those state­ments are true, and we are good enough ac­tors to hide our ner­vous­ness, and the mur­derer doesn’t ask any fol­low-up ques­tions, and Jeff doesn’t step on a creaky spot of the up­stairs floor at the ex­act wrong time like in a hor­ror movie, the mur­derer may go and check the duck pond in­stead of, you know, go­ing up­stairs and mur­der­ing our brother. This lit­tle hedge al­lows us to avoid dis­obey­ing a cat­e­gor­i­cal im­per­a­tive, and also saves Jeff’s life. Some­times with Kant it feels like a game where we have to find ei­ther the right way to phrase the maxim we will fol­low, or a way to avoid _not_ fol­low­ing it, in or­der to achieve the re­sult we want with­out run­ning afoul of his rules.

Stuff like this is where Kant loses me, hon­estly. If a mur­derer is at our door try­ing to kill our brother, we don’t re­ally have a lot of time for ad­her­ence to uni­ver­sal max­ims other than “Don’t let any­one mur­der our brother.” Of course, this is Kant’s whole point: they’re not uni­ver­sal max­ims if you can pick and choose when to fol­low them. (That’s why they’re not called “mostly-uni­ver­sal-but-if-you’re-in-a-tough-scrape-they-don’t-have-to-be-_to­tally_-uni­ver­sal” max­ims.) Still, I bris­tle at Kant for not al­low­ing us to use our judg­ment here. It just doesn’t feel very… hu­man. Aris­to­tle, in con­trast, al­lows us to seek virtue in a more ex­pe­ri­en­tial way—by trial and er­ror, es­sen­tially—which strikes me as more com­pas­sion­ate. It feels like he _trusts_ us, and has more tol­er­ance for the mis­takes we’re bound to make. Uni­ver­sally man­dated du­ties are good in the­ory, but I won­der how Kant would feel if _he_ were hid­ing in our at­tic and the po­lite mur­derer came look­ing for _him_. Maybe he’d hope we had ig­nored his writ­ings and read more Aris­to­tle. (Though he was so hard-core, he’d prob­a­bly be per­versely psyched to die be­cause we fol­lowed the cat­e­gor­i­cal im­per­a­tive.)

In the case of our friend and the ugly shirt, then, we might find a way to be good lit­tle Kan­tians and still not cause our friend pain or sad­ness by straight-up say­ing “That shirt is butt-ugly.” Ide­ally, of course, we have the kind of friend­ship where we can say “Hon­estly, that’s not your best look,” and our friend will re­ceive that com­ment with equa­nim­ity. But if our friend is more sen­si­tive, or more ner­vous about her in­ter­view, per­haps we could say “You know, I re­ally like that blue shirt you have—you should wear that one.” Or per­haps we say that this in­ter­view is so im­por­tant, we should go shop­ping and pick out a shirt she looks even bet­ter in. Or maybe, if we see that she re­ally loves the shirt, and wear­ing it seems to be giv­ing her con­fi­dence head­ing into this job in­ter­view, and we get the sense that her wear­ing the shirt isn’t go­ing to ruin her life or cause her any ex­quis­ite pain or suf­fer­ing, we could sim­ply say that we gen­er­ally think she al­ways looks good, and that if the in­ter­viewer has half a brain she’ll give our friend the job no mat­ter what shirt she wears.

With these first chap­ters, we’ve learned about the three main globs of sec­u­lar eth­i­cal thought in the West­ern world over the last 2,400 years: Aris­totelian virtue ethics, con­se­quen­tial­ism, and de­on­tol­ogy. But some­times, in our ev­ery­day lives, we en­counter a mun­dane lit­tle ques­tion about what we ought to do in some ba­sic earth­bound sce­nario, and we don’t want to have to em­ploy a huge all-en­com­pass­ing moral the­ory to make sense of what’s right. We just want some­one to tell us—quickly—what we should do. We want _rules_, like the ones Kant of­fers us, but, you know, _sim­pler_ rules. Re­ally we just want some­one to ex­plain, for ex­am­ple, whether we should re­turn our shop­ping cart to the rack by the grocery store en­trance, or whether it’s okay to leave it in the park­ing lot. Can some­one just tell us whether we should do that, with­out a com­pli­cated uni­ver­sal maxim de­rived from pure rea­son or a mul­ti­tiered he­don/do­lor util­i­tar­ian cal­cu­la­tion?

Is that too much to ask?

[^5] For me, Kant isn’t as hard to read as some, like Georg Hegel (gave up af­ter two min­utes) or that fas­cist Hei­deg­ger, but it’s still hard, and I’d rec­om­mend read­ing an an­no­tated edi­tion if you de­cide to dive in. This is a good chance for me to plug the on­line _Stan­ford En­cy­clo­pe­dia of Phi­los­o­phy_, which has well-writ­ten and pretty clear ex­pla­na­tions of just about ev­ery­thing that’s ever hap­pened in the field. And it’s free! The _Good Place_ writ­ers used it all the time, when­ever we got lost or needed a re­fresher course on some­thing (which was: fre­quently). For the record, the hard­est thing I’ve even at­tempted to read is Lud­wig Wittgen­stein’s _Trac­ta­tus Logico-Philo­soph­i­cus_, which, like, don’t even _try_. Wittgen­stein is largely thought of as a ge­nius even by pro­fes­sional philoso­pher stan­dards, and that sev­enty-five-page-long mi­graine is the only book he ever pub­lished in his life­time. Imag­ine be­ing so bril­liant that you only write one sev­enty-five-page book and the smartest peo­ple who ever lived are all like, “Man, that guy is a _ge­nius._”
6. [^6] Seems im­por­tant to note that Kant and Ben­tham were roughly con­tem­po­rary, and Kant en­tirely pre-dates Mill, so it’s slightly more ac­cu­rate to say that util­i­tar­i­an­ism was a re­sponse to de­on­tol­ogy and not the other way around, even though we dis­cussed util­i­tar­i­an­ism first in this book.
7. [^7] The irony, of course, is that Ni­et­zsche and Kant cer­tainly have things in com­mon, not least of which is that Ni­et­zsche was an _in­vet­er­ate_ snob. His en­tire world­view is based on the idea that most peo­ple are weak and dumb, and a very small num­ber are in­cred­i­ble and bril­liant, and _those_ peo­ple should be al­lowed to do what­ever they want. This is an­other case—like the Greeks cel­e­brat­ing “wise men” while they cleared their throats and pointed to them­selves—of a philoso­pher es­sen­tially ar­gu­ing that we ought to re­vere peo­ple who are sus­pi­ciously like the philoso­pher him­self. Also, if you’re scor­ing the phi­los­o­phy fight be­tween Kant and Ni­et­zsche, at least Kant’s snob­bery didn’t ac­ci­den­tally help cre­ate the Nazis.
8. [^8] In clas­sic “phi­los­o­phy is im­pos­si­ble” fash­ion, I have to make this an “in­no­cent” per­son to avoid coun­ter­ar­gu­ments about self-de­fense, and also Todd points me to some­thing called “just war the­ory,” which is a col­lec­tion of ar­gu­ments about the spe­cific set of cri­te­ria nec­es­sary to jus­tify war—be­cause in some ex­tremely con­strained cir­cum­stances, it turns out, killing an in­no­cent per­son may in fact be per­mis­si­ble. Again, we’re in one of those _but al­though how­ever_ spi­rals where you can’t even say “Let’s agree that there are things” be­fore some philoso­pher raises her hand and points out twenty-six rea­sons why we can’t ac­tu­ally de­clare that there are things. Sev­eral times over the course of _The Good Place_ we had some­one say, to Chidi, “This is why ev­ery­one hates moral philoso­phers.” I never truly un­der­stood why that’s funny un­til I be­gan writ­ing this book.
9. [^9] A philoso­pher named John Tau­rek wrote a pa­per on this is­sue, es­sen­tially tear­ing util­i­tar­i­an­ism a new one, called “Should the Num­bers Count?” Tau­rek is flab­ber­gasted at the no­tion that you would ever make a life-or-death de­ci­sion based on how many peo­ple are on one side of the equa­tion and how many are on the other, be­cause do­ing so ig­nores the fact that each per­son’s life is max­i­mally valu­able _to that per­son_, and just math­e­mat­i­cally adding the val­ues of five lives to­gether doesn’t give you some kind of “greater to­tal value” than the value of one life. He es­sen­tially ar­gues that if you have a choice be­tween sav­ing a mil­lion lives (with, say, a mil­lion doses of life­sav­ing medicine) or one life (giv­ing all mil­lion doses to one per­son who needs that much medicine to be cured), you should… flip a coin. It’s pretty in­tense. His ded­i­ca­tion to this idea is ad­mirable, but I feel like it would be aw­fully hard to give a mil­lion doses of medicine to one per­son while a mil­lion other peo­ple died. I also feel like, were I that one guy, I’d maybe think: “Yeah… go ahead and save a mil­lion peo­ple.”
10. [^10] The irony of this thought ex­per­i­ment, which seems to find a cru­cial flaw in de­on­to­log­i­cal rea­son­ing, is that it comes from Kant him­self. It’s what the kids would call a “self-own.”

    

## CHAP­TER FOUR Do I Have to Re­turn My Shop­ping Cart to the Shop­ping Cart Rack Thingy? I Mean… It’s All the Way Over _There_.

What’s the small­est nice thing you do for other peo­ple on a reg­u­lar ba­sis? Not “other peo­ple” like your best friend or sis­ter, but peo­ple you don’t know—the in­di­vid­ual face­less dots com­pris­ing the mass of hu­man­ity you’re aware of but never re­ally think about, un­less one of them talks too loud in a movie the­ater or throws a fit in a Jamba Juice be­cause there’s not enough mango in her smoothie. Maybe when you park on the street you try to leave a full car-length of space be­tween your car and the car in front of you, so that some­one else will also have a spot to park in (in­stead of an awk­ward half-spot’s length, which, when you come upon it, boils your blood). Or maybe if you’re walk­ing on the street at night and there’s a woman walk­ing alone a few yards ahead, you cross to the other side of the street so she doesn’t have the un­set­tling sound of foot­steps be­hind her. You do these things, maybe, be­cause your grand­fa­ther taught you to be con­sid­er­ate, or be­cause some­one once did a sim­i­larly nice thing for you and it made you feel good. And when you do these things, these lit­tle ba­sic “other peo­ple” things, you get a twinge of hap­pi­ness. “I’m a good per­son,” you think. “I did my ‘good thing’ for the day.” But what you didn’t know, is that all of those things are _very bad_.

I’m just kid­ding. Of course they’re good! Why would they be bad? They’re warm­hearted and thought­ful and nice. Just thought it would be funny to make you sweat a lit­tle.

I love those lit­tle kind­nesses—the al­most im­per­cep­ti­ble im­provements on the world we live in, done solely for the ben­e­fit of other peo­ple. When I’m the re­cip­i­ent of these cour­te­sies—when some­one stops and waves me out in a mo­ment when I have to take a dif­fi­cult left turn across two lanes of traf­fic, say—I get dis­pro­por­tion­ately happy. It means that the peo­ple around me are con­sid­er­ing the lives and feel­ings of oth­ers, and I be­lieve that con­sid­er­a­tion to be the glue that holds so­ci­ety to­gether. And when the op­po­site oc­curs—when some­one in rush hour de­cides to ig­nore the NO LEFT TURN 4–7 P.M. sign and just sit there in the left lane, wait­ing to turn down a side street, ut­terly dis­re­gard­ing the hun­dreds of cars grind­ing to a stop be­hind him—be­cause ap­par­ently _his_ de­sire to make a left at this ex­act street is _far more im­por­tant_ than _ev­ery­one else’s_ de­sire to get wher­ever they’re go­ing _com­bined_—I dream of shoot­ing fire from my eye sock­ets and melt­ing his car into a pud­dle of smol­der­ing metal.

The thing about these nice lit­tle ges­tures is: they’re es­sen­tially free. We have to park _some­where_, so why not park in such a way so as to al­low for other peo­ple to park too? You have to walk _some­where_, so why not re­lieve a fel­low pedes­trian’s po­ten­tial anx­i­ety by pop­ping over to the other side of the street and sig­nal­ing that you’re not a threat to her safety? These tiny de­ci­sions don’t cost us any­thing ex­cept the ounce of thought needed to ex­e­cute them, and they’re help­ful for other peo­ple. But what about when it _isn’t_ free—when it re­quires a lit­tle ex­tra ef­fort? What about, say, af­ter we un­load our gro­ceries into our car, and our empty cart is sit­ting there in the park­ing lot, and the cart rack is _over there_, forty yards away, and we just want to get home…

I mean… do we _have to_?

### Come On. Be Rea­son­able.

When I be­gan work­ing on _The Good Place_, lit­er­ally at square one of try­ing to fig­ure out what made some­one “good” or “bad,” I fig­ured that learn­ing the an­swers would be way eas­ier if I had some ac­tual phi­losophy ex­perts to help me. (Aris­to­tle was right, it turns out—ev­ery­body needs a teacher.) I emailed a UCLA pro­fes­sor named Pamela Hi­eronymi and asked her to meet me for cof­fee one af­ter­noon, where I was hop­ing she could ex­plain all of moral phi­los­o­phy in a tight ninety min­utes so I could beat the traf­fic.[^1] When I ex­plained the show’s premise and asked her for some guid­ance, her first rec­om­men­da­tion was that I read a book called _What We Owe to Each Other_ by T. M. Scan­lon. So I did. Well, more ac­cu­rately, I read the first ninety pages, got lost, put it down, picked it back up a month later, got lost again, tried one more time, gave up, and haven’t looked at it since. But I feel like I got the gist. And Pamela ex­plained it very thor­oughly. What­ever. Don’t judge me.[^2]

Scan­lon calls his the­ory “con­trac­tu­al­ism.” It’s nowhere near as cen­tral to the his­tory of phi­los­o­phy as our Big Three, but its core tenet re­ally ap­peals to me. It pro­vides a re­as­sur­ing eth­i­cal base­line—a kind of stan­dard­ized, uni­ver­sal rule­book that we can all thumb through for guid­ance as we wan­der around in the world bump­ing into peo­ple on the street and get­ting caught in awk­ward in­ter­ac­tions at Jamba Juice. Scan­lon’s work comes out of Kan­tian “rules-based” ethics, but it isn’t as de­mand­ing. You know how when you buy some­thing elec­tronic, like a dish­washer or Blue­tooth speaker or some­thing, there’s a three-hun­dred-page man­ual printed in fifty dif­fer­ent lan­guages… and then there’s a two-page “Quick-Start Guide” that tells you the ba­sics of how to turn it on and plug it in and stuff? In rules-based ethics, Kant wrote the three-hun­dred-page man­ual. Con­trac­tu­al­ism is the Quick-Start Guide. Now, while it’s true that we can get a de­cent han­dle on Kant through his rel­a­tively pithy im­per­a­tives, he still re­quires us to use our pure rea­son to ab­stractly for­mu­late those thorny uni­ver­sal max­ims, which as we’ve seen can be tricky and time-con­sum­ing. For me, Scan­lon’s process for de­ter­min­ing eth­i­cal rules is much eas­ier to grasp and de­ploy.

Hi­eronymi, who’d been a stu­dent of Scan­lon’s at Har­vard, de­scribed con­trac­tu­al­ism to me this way: Imag­ine our crew has been at war with an­other crew for years, just slug­ging it out in a dense for­est, fir­ing on each other from trenches a hun­dred feet apart. It’s an ab­so­lute stale­mate. Nei­ther side has any ad­van­tage over the other, and no hope of ever gain­ing one. Ex­hausted and weary, we call a tem­po­rary truce and de­cide we some­how need to de­sign and de­scribe a mu­tu­ally liv­able so­ci­ety; we need a set of rules that can be ac­cepted by both sides, no mat­ter how wildly dif­fer­ent our views are (and we ob­vi­ously hold _very_ dif­fer­ent views, hence the end­less trench war­fare). Scan­lon’s sug­ges­tion: We give ev­ery­one on both sides the power to veto ev­ery rule, and then we start pitch­ing rules. As­sum­ing ev­ery­one is mo­ti­vated to ac­tu­ally find some rules in the first place—that ev­ery­one is _rea­son­able_—the rules that pass are the ones no one can re­ject. This means we’ll all de­sign our rules in such a way that they can be jus­ti­fied to other peo­ple, be­cause if we don’t, they won’t be­come rules. It’s a sim­ple, el­e­gant way of find­ing the ba­sic bucket of so­ci­etal goo that holds us to­gether.

Now, it makes a big as­sump­tion—that ev­ery­one is go­ing to be “rea­son­able.” This is def­i­nitely one of those mo­ments in phi­los­o­phy where we have to back up and de­fine some­thing in or­der to feel like we know what the hell we’re talk­ing about. Scan­lon doesn’t give a quick, pithy def­i­ni­tion of “rea­son­able,” in part be­cause… there isn’t one. But in essence he says this: I’m rea­son­able if, when you and I dis­agree, I’m will­ing to con­strain or mod­ify my pur­suit of my own in­ter­ests to the same de­gree that you’re will­ing to con­strain or mod­ify _your_ pur­suit of _your_ in­ter­ests. When we come to­gether to sug­gest our rules, then, we aren’t just “look­ing out for num­ber one.” Rather, we _both_ want to de­sign a world where we ac­com­mo­date each other’s needs, so that when we don’t see eye to eye on some­thing, find­ing a way to co­ex­ist in some kind of har­mony be­comes our top pri­or­ity. Scan­lon is af­ter “a shared will­ing­ness to mod­ify our pri­vate de­mands in or­der to find a ba­sis of jus­ti­fi­ca­tion that oth­ers also have rea­son to ac­cept.” It’s a con­tract he wants all of us to sign, giv­ing us all the same ex­act mo­ti­va­tions.

Im­por­tantly, this doesn’t mean we al­ways have to de­fer to other peo­ple in ev­ery con­flict—be­cause in Scan­lon’s world, _they’re_ ap­proach­ing the con­flict with the same in­ten­tion to mod­ify _their_ in­ter­ests in or­der to jus­tify them to _us_. It cre­ates a kind of dy­namic ten­sion, where we all re­gard ev­ery­one else’s in­ter­ests as equal to our own—not _more_ im­por­tant, but _equally_ im­por­tant. We can now bet­ter un­der­stand why Hi­eronymi ex­plained this to me by set­ting the scene of end­less, mis­er­able, stale­mated war—both sides’ weari­ness and de­sire for a path for­ward help us be­lieve that ev­ery­one _will_ be rea­son­able, be­cause we’re all mo­ti­vated to find a way out of this quag­mire, and we all rec­og­nize that ev­ery­one else is mo­ti­vated in the same way.[^3]

When we ap­ply Scan­lon’s the­ory to the world we live in—the world com­pris­ing thou­sands of small mo­ments and de­ci­sions and in­ter­ac­tions—con­trac­tu­al­ism makes a pretty good di­vin­ing rod for bad or un­just be­hav­ior. For ex­am­ple: If some­one pro­posed a rule that said, “No driver should use the break­down lanes on any high­way un­less there is an emer­gency,” no one could rea­son­ably re­ject that rule. This rule, prop­erly ap­plied, would treat ev­ery­one the same[^4] and serve pub­lic safety. But if Wayne the Lam­borgh­ini Driver said, “Hey, I got a rule: no one can use the break­down lanes _ex­cept_ for Lam­borgh­ini driv­ers, who can drive wher­ever they want, be­cause Lam­bos rule,” some­one _could_ (and likely would) rea­son­ably re­ject that rule. Scan­lon’s the­ory al­lows us to quickly iden­tify be­hav­iors that feel un­just or self­ish, like when you’re stuck in heavy traf­fic and a rich dope in the ob­vi­ous throes of a midlife cri­sis pulls his yel­low Lam­borgh­ini into the break­down lane and whizzes past you.

And when we ap­ply con­trac­tu­al­ism to any of those lit­tle “free” de­ci­sions from ear­lier in this chap­ter, we’ll get the an­swers we’d ex­pect: Would any­one veto a rule that says, “We should park our car, when­ever we can, in a way that al­lows other peo­ple enough room to park”? No. Why would any rea­son­able per­son veto that? How about: “We can park wher­ever we want, and ev­ery­one else can go to hell”? Well, now, that’s def­i­nitely get­ting ve­toed. Scan­lon isn’t try­ing to turn us into flour­ish­ing, vir­tu­ous su­per-peo­ple. He just wants us all—no mat­ter our per­son­al­i­ties or re­li­gious be­liefs or po­lit­i­cal bents or pizza-top­ping pref­er­ences—to be able to look each other in the eye and jus­tify our ba­sic rules for how to live.

That’s partly why con­trac­tu­al­ism ap­peals to me more than Kan­tian de­on­tol­ogy. Kant wants us to en­counter a prob­lem, press pause, en­ter some kind of soli­tary med­i­ta­tion zone, use our pure rea­son to dis­cern and de­scribe a uni­ver­sal law that ap­plies to the prob­lem, and then act out of a duty to fol­low that law. Scan­lon wants us to fig­ure this stuff out _with each other_—to sit across from one an­other and sim­ply ask: “Do you agree that this is okay?” He puts his faith not in ab­stract rea­son­ing, but in our nec­es­sary re­la­tion­ships with other peo­ple. Now, this can seem dicey too—I’m guess­ing that for many of us, leav­ing our fate in other peo­ple’s hands doesn’t seem like the safest pos­si­ble bet. It’s hard enough to fig­ure out rules for how we ought to live, and now this guy tells us our choices could be ve­toed by Cindy, our next-door neigh­bor who talks to squir­rels like they’re peo­ple, or by our cousin Der­rek, who jumped off a div­ing board into a swim­ming pool that was frozen solid and broke his tail­bone? Per­haps more rel­e­vantly, here in 2022, we’d be de­pend­ing on the “rea­son­able­ness” of peo­ple with whom we ve­he­mently dis­agree, like con­spir­acy-the­ory-spout­ing Face­book trolls or racist great-un­cles. You’re telling me _those_ peo­ple can re­ject our rules for per­mis­si­ble be­hav­ior? Well… yes, _as long as their ob­jec­tions are rea­son­able_, and they con­strain their own de­sires to the same de­gree we con­strain ours. (And re­mem­ber, many of their more ex­treme views would be re­jected _by us_ as un­rea­son­able.) As odd and an­noy­ing and un­pre­dictable as the peo­ple around us can be, given that _they’re the peo­ple we have to live with_, I think it’s of­ten a bet­ter idea to de­sign the moral bound­aries of our world with their co­op­er­a­tion than it is to do it ab­stractly, in their ab­sence. And I fur­ther think it’s a bet­ter idea for _them_ to do so with _our_ co­op­er­a­tion.

### Okay, I Get It, Just Tell Me If I Have to Re­turn the Damn Cart to the Rack, Please, I’m in a Hurry

Again, the pre­vi­ous ex­am­ples (like where to po­si­tion our car when we park on the street) are the sort of “free” de­ci­sions where we have to do _some­thing_, so it’s no skin off our backs to do the best ver­sion of what­ever the thing is. But what about when the de­ci­sion _does_ cost us some­thing—some amount of time, or ef­fort, or en­ergy, or sac­ri­fice? Like, say, the ques­tion that started this chap­ter: Should we re­turn our shop­ping cart to the shop­ping cart rack?

A bunch of new com­pli­ca­tions make this… more com­pli­cated. First, the rules of shop­ping cart re­place­ment have never been clear to me. Are we _sup­posed_ to bring them back, or is the store cool with us leav­ing them in the park­ing lot? Some gro­cery stores have em­ploy­ees who col­lect them, which seems to im­ply that it’s okay to leave them near our cars… or maybe they _have_ to hire those em­ploy­ees be­cause peo­ple are self­ish jerks and leave carts in the park­ing lot even though the store would pre­fer we didn’t. Also, maybe it’s _bet­ter_ to leave them in the park­ing lot, be­cause then peo­ple just pop out of their cars and _bam_, there’s a cart right there wait­ing for them! But then again, some­times peo­ple pop out of their cars and _bam_, their car door hits a stray shop­ping cart, which stinks. Plus: We go to the gro­cery store, ap­proach the door, get a cart from the rack, go shop­ping, bring it to our car… and then just leave it there? There’s some­thing slightly off about that. It seems like we ought to re­turn it… but re­turn­ing it re­quires one last lit­tle bit of ef­fort on our part to close that loop—one forty-yard jaunt back across the park­ing lot, the wob­bly wheels of the cart grind­ing un­pleas­antly on the as­phalt while our gro­ceries wilt a lit­tle in the hot car,[^5] then a tricky fi­nal push as the cart jan­gles awk­wardly back into its sta­tion­ary nest­ing-doll col­umn, and fi­nally the re­verse jaunt: forty yards _back_ to our car, dodg­ing traf­fic, fum­bling with our keys, un­lock­ing the door again, and set­tling into the seat where we could’ve been three min­utes ago, in a bet­ter mood, if we’d just de­cided to tell ethics to screw off.

So what would Scan­lon say about all this? The rule we’re propos­ing seems some­thing like: “Af­ter us­ing a gro­cery cart, re­turn it to its rack so the next per­son can use it.” No rea­son­able per­son re­jects that rule, in all like­li­hood. But what if it’s “Af­ter us­ing a gro­cery cart we should re­turn it to the rack, un­less the store has a ded­i­cated em­ployee whose job it is to col­lect carts from the park­ing lot, in which case it’s fine to leave it in the park­ing lot”? That also seems un­re­jectable. So, I guess… if there’s a dude in a re­flec­tive vest wan­der­ing around the park­ing lot gath­er­ing carts, we can leave ours at the top of our park­ing space and head on home. That ac­tion would be al­low­able.

So… is that it? Are we done?

Con­trac­tu­al­ism has a ceil­ing—it sets in place only the rules we’d all live by if we were each mo­ti­vated to find a min­i­mum stan­dard for co­ex­is­tence. Scan­lon is look­ing around at a world full of very dif­fer­ent kinds of peo­ple and try­ing to es­tab­lish cer­tain base­lines of be­hav­ior we will all fol­low. His the­ory is de­signed to stop peo­ple from do­ing some­thing ob­vi­ously crappy and dis­agree­able—like _steal­ing_ the shop­ping carts, or dam­ag­ing them so no one else can use them, or get­ting _in_ one that we find on the street when we’re drunk af­ter a wed­ding and hav­ing our friend Nick push us down the side­walk re­ally fast un­til we wipe out (be­cause Nick is also drunk and loses con­trol) and go tum­bling onto the street.[^6] All of _those_ rules, if they were sug­gested as al­low­able uses for shop­ping carts, would rea­son­ably be re­jected.

So, al­though Scan­lon’s rules cre­ate this min­i­mum ba­sis for a liv­able so­ci­ety, that might not be the only tool we want to use when we make eth­i­cal de­ci­sions. We don’t only want to meet some kind of “min­i­mum re­quire­ment”—we don’t just want a pass­ing grade on this test! We want to clear the bar de­scribed by “rules we all agree to” with room to spare, and be­come the eth­i­cal rock stars we know we can be. This means that while we _have to_ fol­low what­ever con­trac­tu­al­ist rules we all agree to, maybe we _should_ do more. Maybe we _start_ with con­trac­tu­al­ism, and then keep go­ing…

So let’s play this out. Let’s say we’re at a gro­cery store that does, in­deed, hire peo­ple to sweep the park­ing lot for stray carts and re­turn them to the rack by the front door. Af­ter un­load­ing our gro­ceries, we de­cide—as we’re wont to do—to for­mu­late our next ac­tion us­ing T. M. Scan­lon’s the­ory of con­trac­tu­al­ism. Given that we don’t be­lieve any­one would rea­son­ably re­ject the rule “We can leave our shop­ping cart in the park­ing lot if the store has an em­ployee whose job it is to col­lect it,” we de­cide to do just that. But then we think about a few other things. We think: “It’s not _that_ far back to the rack.” And we think: “I _did_ just use this cart, and my dad al­ways told me to put things back where they be­long af­ter I use them.” And then we think: “Some­one else will need to use this cart, and if _all_ shop­pers just leave our carts in the park­ing lot, the em­ploy­ees who col­lect them might fall be­hind and then fu­ture cus­tomers might ap­proach the rack and find no carts there, which is an­noy­ing when it hap­pens to us.”[^7] And then we think: “Let­ting the carts drift free in the park­ing lot can be ir­ri­tat­ing, be­cause they some­times wob­ble into peo­ple’s cars, or par­tially block park­ing spa­ces, or I bang my door on them when I’m get­ting out of the car.” And then we think: “Yes, there are em­ploy­ees tasked with col­lect­ing the carts from the lot, but that work is bor­ing and phys­i­cally tir­ing and repet­i­tive, and the peo­ple who do it are out­side in the heat or cold and they aren’t paid very much, prob­a­bly, so yes it’s their job, but also I have the chance to make their job a lit­tle eas­ier.” The over­all amount of “good” we can do by just run­ning the cart forty yards over there and putting it back where we got it is small, but it’s real, and it may slightly im­prove the lives of a lot of peo­ple: the em­ployee (who doesn’t have to clean up our mess), fu­ture shop­pers (who find carts wait­ing for them in the rack by the front door, where they are most con­ve­nient), and fu­ture car park­ers (who don’t get their cars dinged by drift­ing carts or slam their doors into them or have park­ing spa­ces blocked). That’s so many peo­ple! For so lit­tle ef­fort!

So. Do we _have to_ re­turn the cart to the rack? No. Prob­a­bly not.

But should we? Yeah, I think we prob­a­bly should. If we’re able, we should move be­yond the “min­i­mum re­quire­ments” of con­trac­tu­al­ism and do that small amount of ex­tra work.[^8] (And I say this as a guy who fre­quently does not do that ex­tra work, be­cause: who wants to do ex­tra work?) It re­quires a fairly neg­li­gi­ble amount of ef­fort and con­sid­er­a­tion from us, and has the po­ten­tial to cre­ate a de­cent amount of hap­pi­ness and con­ve­nience and stress-re­duc­tion for some num­ber of other peo­ple. It can _help_ other peo­ple. That ought to be a goal we all share.

“Help­ing other peo­ple” is a big, neb­u­lous idea, but there’s no such thing as “ethics” with­out it, so we’d bet­ter fig­ure out what we mean, ex­actly, when we de­cide to move be­yond con­trac­tu­al­ist min­i­mums and de­clare “help­ing other peo­ple” as our new goal. We can eas­ily imag­ine _lit­eral_ ways of help­ing other peo­ple—car­ry­ing boxes up a flight of stairs when our friend moves, or do­nat­ing fifty dol­lars to a soup kitchen. But what about, just, the ethe­real ideas of “treat­ing other peo­ple well” or “be­ing con­sid­er­ate” or “be­hav­ing un­selfishly”? It’s hard to pin down, at least in a prac­ti­cal way that will help us fig­ure out _what the hell we’re sup­posed to do_ as we mill around the earth and bump into peo­ple. But just be­cause it’s hard to de­scribe doesn’t mean we should give up try­ing to de­scribe it. In fact, one of the best ex­pla­na­tions of why “other peo­ple” mat­ter isn’t re­ally an “ex­pla­na­tion” at all, but rather a world­view: it’s the south­ern African con­cept of _ubuntu_.

### “I Am, Be­cause We Are”

Ex­plain­ing ubuntu will take a sec­ond, be­cause there’s not re­ally (as far as I’ve found) a per­fect en­cap­su­la­tion, and since I don’t speak Zulu or Xhosa or any other African lan­guage, all I have to go on are some­what murky Eng­lish trans­la­tions. A lot of the ex­pla­na­tion of ubuntu is done through apho­risms, anec­dotes, and proverbs, though the South African po­lit­i­cal philoso­pher Jo­hann Broodryk de­fines it this way:

> A com­pre­hen­sive an­cient African world view based on the val­ues of in­tense hu­man­ness, car­ing, shar­ing, re­spect, com­pas­sion, and as­so­ci­ated val­ues, en­sur­ing a happy and qual­i­ta­tive hu­man com­mu­nity life in the spirit of fam­ily.

Broodryk an­tic­i­pates our next ques­tion: “It may be asked whether this no­tion is unique,” he writes, “since all cul­tures as­cribe ba­si­cally to these pos­i­tive val­ues.” He’s right, of course—if we think of ubuntu as, say, “hu­man in­ter­con­nect­ed­ness,” there are par­al­lels in Bud­dhism, or the Hindu con­cept of dharma. The dif­fer­ence, he says, is that in Africa “these val­ues are prac­ticed on a much deeper level. It is about a real pas­sion­ate liv­ing of hu­man­ity, as if hu­man­ity is the pri­mary rea­son for liv­ing above all other con­cerns.” An­other writer, Mluleki Mnyaka, fur­ther in­ter­prets ubuntu as an ac­tual eth­i­cal sys­tem, which plays “a de­ter­min­ing fac­tor in… [the] for­mu­la­tion of per­cep­tions… of African so­ci­ety about what is good or bad be­hav­ior.” Okay, we might be think­ing, it’s the root of an African phi­los­o­phy, a world­view re­lated to the ways hu­mans are con­nected to each other, a hu­man­is­tic ethos that de­scribes val­ues and good be­hav­iors… but what does the word “ubuntu” ac­tu­ally _mean_?

The an­swer seems like a bit of a cop-out: “ubuntu” means a lot of dif­fer­ent things, no one of them di­rectly or eas­ily ex­pli­ca­ble in trans­la­tion. In fact, be­cause it en­cap­su­lates a com­mu­nity-spe­cific set of eth­i­cal guide­lines, it may even have dif­fer­ent mean­ings de­pend­ing on who you are and which African lan­guage you’re speak­ing; Broodryk notes that the word it­self varies—in Zulu it’s _ubuntu_, in Swahili it’s _utu_, in Shona it’s _unhu_, and so on. But the cen­tral idea re­mains the same—it’s al­ways re­lated to _hu­man­ness_, or “the ideal of be­ing hu­man.” I first heard of it in a de­cid­edly nonaca­demic con­text—af­ter the Bos­ton Celtics (my fa­vorite bas­ket­ball team) won the 2008 NBA cham­pi­onship, their coach Doc Rivers said that he used ubuntu as a way for a group of in­di­vid­ual star play­ers to fo­cus on a col­lec­tive goal (a team cham­pi­onship) in­stead of per­sonal glory. Rather than get­ting hung up on what the word ac­tu­ally “means,” it’s bet­ter to fo­cus on the essence of the con­cept. Here’s a proverb that I think comes close to en­cap­su­lat­ing the whole idea:

> A per­son is a per­son through other peo­ple.

Ubuntu is Scan­lon’s con­trac­tu­al­ism, but su­per­charged. It’s not just that we _owe_ things to other peo­ple—ubuntu says we _ex­ist through them_. Their health is our health, their hap­pi­ness is our hap­pi­ness, their in­ter­ests are our in­ter­ests, when they are hurt or di­min­ished _we_ are hurt or di­min­ished. The virtues that po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Michael Onye­buchi Eze cites as be­ing char­ac­ter­is­tic of ubuntu ring an Aris­totelian bell—“mag­na­nim­ity, shar­ing, kind­ness”—but the em­pha­sis is now on the _com­mu­nal_ in­stead of the in­di­vid­ual. In 2006, Nel­son Man­dela was asked to de­fine ubuntu and said this:

> In the old days, when we were young, a trav­eler to our coun­try would stop in our vil­lage, and he didn’t have to ask for food or for wa­ter. Once he stops, the peo­ple give him food, and at­tend to him. That is one as­pect of ubuntu, but it [has] var­i­ous as­pects.… Ubuntu does not mean that peo­ple should not en­rich them­selves. The ques­tion, there­fore, is: Are you go­ing to do so in or­der to en­able the com­mu­nity around you to be able to im­prove?[^9]

So. Why should we re­turn the shop­ping cart to the shop­ping cart rack? Be­cause it helps other peo­ple, and _we_ are only peo­ple _through other peo­ple_. Liv­ing in our world, go­ing about our days with our own prob­lems and an­noy­ances and is­sues to deal with, it’s easy (and tempt­ing) to re­main trapped in our lit­tle brains and to only do stuff that im­proves our lives or eases our own pains. But… come on, that stinks. We’re not alone here on earth. We’re one tiny part of a much larger whole, as the Kenyan philoso­pher and the­olo­gian John S. Mbiti wrote:

> The in­di­vid­ual does not and can­not ex­ist alone.… He owes his ex­is­tence to other peo­ple in­clud­ing those of past gen­er­a­tions and his con­tem­po­raries. He is sim­ply part of the whole.… What­ever hap­pens to the in­di­vid­ual hap­pens to the whole group, and what­ever hap­pens to the whole group hap­pens to the in­di­vid­ual. The in­di­vid­ual can only say, “I am, be­cause we are; and since we are there­fore I am.”

We don’t just owe _things_ to peo­ple—we owe _our whole freak­ing ex­is­tence_ to them. And when we think of “other peo­ple” _that_ way, well, we’re not go­ing to stop at the min­i­mal amount that we “owe to each other”—we’re gonna damn well re­turn the shop­ping cart to the rack if we think it eases the bur­den of those around us. All we’re re­ally do­ing here is mak­ing sure the check­list we run down any­time we’re de­cid­ing what to do puts “com­mu­nity health and hap­pi­ness” as its pri­mary con­cern, not just as a pleas­ant po­ten­tial by-prod­uct.

This has been a core tenet of South­ern African phi­los­o­phy for cen­turies, but in West­ern phi­los­o­phy the con­trac­tu­al­ist idea that our moral lives are de­pen­dent on our mu­tual re­la­tion­ships with other peo­ple is more of an out­lier. We’re not re­ally go­ing to dis­cuss René Descartes, but con­sider for a sec­ond his fa­mous En­light­en­ment for­mu­la­tion _Cog­ito, ergo sum—_the afore­men­tioned “I think, there­fore I am”—which, again, is one of the very foun­da­tions of West­ern thought. When we place it next to this ubuntu for­mu­la­tion—“I am, be­cause we are”—well, man oh man, that’s a pretty big dif­fer­ence. Descartes saw his own sin­gu­lar con­scious­ness as proof of ex­is­tence. Prac­ti­tion­ers of ubuntu see our ex­is­tence as con­di­tional on _oth­ers’_ ex­is­tence. Some­one could write a very in­ter­est­ing book on the sorts of civ­i­liza­tions and laws and cit­i­zens that emerge from each of these two ut­ter­ances. Not me, though—it sounds re­ally hard. But _some­one_.

The point is, I’ve been de­scrib­ing con­trac­tu­al­ist the­ory in a pretty dry, in­tel­lec­tual way, as like a board meet­ing where we’re soberly pitch­ing rules and vot­ing on them. But as Hi­eronymi pointed out to me, there’s a warmer, fuzzier way to look at it. Scan­lon asks us to ap­proach the peo­ple we share the earth with and de­clare the fol­low­ing: “I know you treat me as some­one who mat­ters, who has a veto in our sys­tem, and you know I treat you in that way, and we each know that the other knows this.” He wants us to cre­ate an eth­i­cal sys­tem in which “mu­tual re­spect can be mu­tu­ally rec­og­nized.” That re­ori­en­ta­tion of moral­ity doesn’t go quite as far as ubuntu, but it does place a check on our in­her­ent ego­ism, and puts our re­la­tion­ships with those around us—both the peo­ple we know and those we don’t—at the cen­ter of our per­sonal good­nes­some­ters. Once we as­sume that po­si­tion, it gets re­ally hard to be, for lack of a bet­ter word, a jerk.

### Do­ing the Bare Min­i­mum: Still (Ap­par­ently) Too Much for Some Peo­ple

For the first year-plus of the Covid-19 out­break, there was one per­sis­tent and harm­ful is­sue: No one wanted to wear masks. Or, more ac­cu­rately: no one _wanted_ to, but mil­lions of dopes ac­tu­ally _wouldn’t_. Scan­lon pub­lished his book in 1998, but if he were writ­ing it now, I bet he’d have a lot to say about those dopes. Wear­ing a mask is roughly as an­noy­ing as re­turn­ing a shop­ping cart to the rack af­ter we’ve un­loaded our car—it takes more ef­fort than just do­ing noth­ing, but _barely_ more ef­fort, re­ally, and when we run through the pros and cons of mask-wear­ing it be­comes lu­di­crous not to do it. Here’s what was asked of us: buy a two-dol­lar face cov­er­ing and use it when you go out­side. Here’s who would ben­e­fit: ev­ery­one, ev­ery­where on earth. Here’s how they’d ben­e­fit: _so­ci­ety re­turns to nor­mal much faster, and ev­ery­body doesn’t get sick and die_. A global pan­demic is, oddly, an ideal sce­nario to il­lus­trate con­trac­tu­al­ism—what we owe to each other in this case is both easy to iden­tify and in­finites­i­mally small, and the ben­e­fits are _as­tro­nom­i­cally huge_. I said be­fore that con­trac­tu­al­ism can quickly and ef­fec­tively iden­tify be­hav­ior that feels un­rea­son­able or self­ish—well, ev­ery time I see a video where some­one screams that wear­ing a mask in this Taco Bell is a form of op­pres­sion, my first thought is: “You’re be­ing un­rea­son­able, and I re­ject your rule.” (For some­one prac­tic­ing ubuntu, of course, sug­gest­ing that we don’t all have to wear a mask would be lu­di­crous; the main func­tion of these masks is not to keep our­selves safe, but rather to keep _other peo­ple_ safe if _we_ hap­pen to be sick. Masks are phys­i­cal in­car­na­tions of ubuntu.)

Scan­lon’s book may be a slog, but his the­ory is not—it’s el­e­gant and sim­ple. In fact, the the­ory is so sim­ple that Scan­lon told me, when I met him,[^10] that his men­tor Derek Parfit didn’t find it very con­vinc­ing. Parfit, per­haps the most im­por­tant philoso­pher of the last fifty years, had been bad­ger­ing Scan­lon to write a book. When Scan­lon fi­nally showed him his ini­tial writ­ings on con­trac­tu­al­ism, Parfit re­sponded, “Tim, this is not a moral the­ory. It’s just a de­scrip­tion of your per­son­al­ity.” (Philoso­phers can be jerks[^11] some­times.) But I dis­agree—I find con­trac­tu­al­ism to be a re­li­able eth­i­cal guide when I’m weigh­ing my de­ci­sions and my re­sponses to other peo­ple’s. Re­mem­ber, though, that it gives us only a min­i­mum base­line for cre­at­ing a liv­able so­ci­ety. Once we de­ter­mine that base­line, it’s up to us to ex­ert a lit­tle more ef­fort, to try a lit­tle harder, if we re­ally want to im­prove both our­selves and our world.

We now have a lot of ar­rows in our quiver—virtue ethics, de­on­tol­ogy, util­i­tar­i­an­ism, con­trac­tu­al­ism, ubuntu… this quiver is jam-packed, baby! But so far we’ve been ask­ing pretty sim­ple ques­tions: Should we be vi­o­lent for no rea­son? Should we lie? Should we put things back where they came from? The next batch of ques­tions will be trick­ier and more nu­anced. We’re go­ing to need all of the big the­o­ries we’ve al­ready learned, and a bunch of new ideas we’ll pick up along the way, and it’s _still_ go­ing to get harder and harder to come up with an­swers.

But, I mean, we gotta _try_, right?    

# PART TWO

In Which We Take Ev­ery­thing We’ve Learned, and We Start Ask­ing Some Tougher Ques­tions, and We Use the Stuff We’ve Learned to Try to An­swer Them, and We Also Learn a Bunch More Cool Stuff

    

## CHAP­TER FIVE Should I Run into a Burn­ing Build­ing and Try to Save Ev­ery­one Trapped In­side?

Jack Lu­cas was thir­teen when the United States en­tered World War II. Two years later he lied about his age, forged his mom’s sig­na­ture, and en­listed in the Ma­rine Corps, join­ing a unit that landed on Iwo Jima in 1945. Less than a week af­ter he turned sev­en­teen, he was in a trench when two grenades landed nearby. Since he was the only one who saw them, he shoved his fel­low sol­diers out of the way, jumped on one grenade, and _pulled the other one un­der­neath him_. The ex­plo­sions sent him fly­ing through the air; he landed on his back and was left for dead. Ex­cept some­how he wasn’t dead, de­spite hav­ing 250 pieces of grenade shrap­nel lodged in his body. He even­tu­ally re­cov­ered and re­ceived the Medal of Honor for his brav­ery.[^1]

As amaz­ing and heroic as that story is, tales of mil­i­tary hero­ism have a way of af­fect­ing us… only so much. Sol­diers ex­hibit­ing ex­tra­or­di­nary com­bat brav­ery don’t _seem_ like reg­u­lar peo­ple—even though they fre­quently _are_ reg­u­lar peo­ple who’ve been placed in im­pos­si­ble sce­nar­ios we can’t imag­ine ever fac­ing our­selves. But we’ve prob­a­bly seen other sto­ries about some­one who _is_ like us, and who acted hero­ically within a gen­eral space we _do_ in­habit—jump­ing onto sub­way tracks to res­cue some­one who’d fallen, maybe, or run­ning into traf­fic to save a way­ward tur­tle that was try­ing to cross the free­way. We may chew on these sto­ries a bit longer, and they may af­fect us more deeply, be­cause they’re closer to our own ex­pe­ri­ence. We may won­der whether we could or would do the same thing in the same sit­u­a­tion. We may se­cretly think, “Man, I’m glad _that_ lady did that, be­cause no way I’m risk­ing my life for some dumb tur­tle with no sense of di­rec­tion,” and then we might feel a lit­tle bad about our­selves, be­cause we’ve re­al­ized we wouldn’t be as brave. And then, even­tu­ally, we may for­get about the whole thing and watch a YouTube video of a cool Rube Gold­berg con­trap­tion that some teenager con­structed in her house dur­ing the Covid-19 quar­an­tine.[^2]

Part of the won­der of be­ing hu­man is that we get to learn about the ex­tra­or­di­nary lev­els of virtue of which other hu­mans are ca­pa­ble. We hear sto­ries of coura­geous Lon­don shop own­ers dur­ing the bomb­ings of 1940, keep­ing a stiff up­per lip and march­ing through rub­ble to open their stores. We watch video of an anony­mous man in Tianan­men Square stand­ing alone in front of a tank, and read about women who ex­pose hor­ri­fy­ing abuses while risk­ing their ca­reers and men­tal health in or­der to pre­vent the same aw­ful things from hap­pen­ing to oth­ers. So we know these things are pos­si­ble—this level of courage, brav­ery, for­ti­tude, gen­eros­ity, and em­pa­thy is _achiev­able_, in the same way that a four-minute mile is achiev­able, or free-solo-ing a cliff face is achiev­able. Most of us, thank­fully, will never be in one of these sit­u­a­tions. Most of us will never even have to de­cide whether to save a tur­tle from a free­way. But if we want to be good peo­ple, we still need some the­o­ret­i­cal un­der­stand­ing of how we _ought_ to re­act in ex­treme sit­u­a­tions, should they arise—and more to the point, we need to know whether be­ing good peo­ple _re­quires_ us to act the way those he­roes did. Un­der­stand­ing the lim­its of re­quired virtue can give us a North Star by which we can nav­i­gate: Ex­actly how good do we have to be, prac­ti­cally speak­ing, be­fore we’ve achieved our goal of be­com­ing good peo­ple? Which hu­man ac­tions de­fine _nec­es­sary_ good­ness, and which ones are like “That’s amaz­ing that you did that, but if I _don’t_ do it I’m not nec­es­sar­ily a bad per­son”? I mean, it can’t be true that if we don’t rush into a burn­ing build­ing to res­cue ev­ery­one in­side, we’re _bad_, right? The jokey ti­tle of this book aside, in or­der to be _good_ we don’t have to be _per­fect_, right?

… Right?!

### Moral Per­fec­tion: A Cau­tion­ary Tale

We sort of know the an­swer al­ready, if we’re as­pir­ing Kan­tians: our ac­tions do, in a way, have to be “per­fect.” Kan­tian de­on­tol­ogy is the most all-or-noth­ing of these schools of thought, be­cause he’s an ab­so­lutist; we don’t even need to pose a the­o­ret­i­cal ex­treme out­lier like the burn­ing-build­ing sce­nario in or­der to know whether we’d fail Kant’s test, be­cause no mat­ter how mun­dane or crazy the sit­u­a­tion, if we don’t dis­cern a uni­ver­sal maxim and then act out of a duty to fol­low that maxim, we’ve failed, and Kant will shake his per­pet­u­ally dis­ap­prov­ing head at us. But let’s con­sider the burn­ing build­ing any­way. Again, de­pend­ing on how we phrase the maxim, we may feel as though Kant re­quires dif­fer­ent lev­els of valor; for ex­am­ple, if the maxim is “We should al­ways sac­ri­fice our own safety if we have the chance to save other peo­ple”—well, put a hand­ker­chief over your face and storm in­side. But if the maxim is “We should act swiftly and de­ci­sively in or­der to save hu­man lives,” we might only be re­quired to call 911 and alert pro­fes­sional res­cuer-type peo­ple of the emer­gency. But what if we know that the near­est fire­house is an hour away? Does the maxim have to in­clude the ei­ther/or fork­ing path re­gard­ing prox­im­ity of a pro­fes­sional res­cue squad? Or any other vari­able?

Pre­dictably, we find our­selves con­fronting the same crit­i­cism of Kan­tian thought we dis­cussed ear­lier: the for­mu­la­tion of these stupid max­ims he wants us to de­vise through pure rea­son can be damn near im­pos­si­ble. To me, a key part of any eth­i­cal sys­tem has to be that it _can ac­tu­ally work in real life_. And while there are plenty of sce­nar­ios where we have the time and pa­tience to en­gage in Kan­tian rea­son­ing, there are also plenty where we don’t. If a build­ing is on fire and we have to tease out the proper uni­ver­sal maxim that ap­plies, I mean… those poor peo­ple. I can imag­ine them now, yelling from the win­dows:

“Help us! We’re trapped!”

“Okay, hang on,” we yell back. “It’s un­clear to us whether we are morally re­quired to at­tempt to res­cue you!”

“We to­tally get it! Just make sure you act out of your duty to fol­low a de­on­to­log­i­cal maxim!”

“Thank you for un­der­stand­ing! Should have an an­swer in the next thirty to forty min­utes!”

Since ex­treme sit­u­a­tions, for Kan­tians, don’t re­quire any dif­fer­ent moral rea­son­ing than bor­ing ev­ery­day sit­u­a­tions, and both can be re­ally hard, let’s ap­proach this from a util­i­tar­ian’s per­spec­tive and see what hap­pens. As we’ve seen, util­i­tar­ian ac­tions can be easy to de­ter­mine in sim­ple sit­u­a­tions but harder in com­pli­cated ones, and this one’s on the com­pli­cated end of the spec­trum. It’s about sav­ing lives, like the Trol­ley Prob­lem, but now with an added wrin­kle: we don’t _know_ whether we can suc­ceed in res­cu­ing these peo­ple. In the Trol­ley Prob­lem the re­sults were def­i­nite and baked into our cal­cu­la­tion—one dies or five die—but now… who knows? Maybe we save ev­ery­one. Maybe they all die. Maybe we save some, but _we_ die. Maybe we save _no one_ and we die. That would suck. And yet, from a strict util­i­tar­ian po­si­tion, if we have the chance to save mul­ti­ple lives we should do it… right? More hap­pi­ness would be bet­ter? Even if we might die? Even though this burn­ing-build­ing sit­u­a­tion is re­ally scary, and we don’t know any­thing about how to as­sess dan­ger from struc­ture fires, and also maybe we haven’t been work­ing out a lot re­cently and aren’t in great shape and got winded yes­ter­day try­ing to open a jar of may­on­naise so it seems pretty god­damn un­likely that we’ll be able to pull off a heroic life­sav­ing res­cue? Well, too bad, says the strict util­i­tar­ian rule­book—we ought to risk one life (our own) to try to save how­ever many lives are threat­ened by this tow­er­ing in­ferno. And if that’s true, then shouldn’t we—if we want to be good lit­tle util­i­tar­i­ans—buy a po­lice scan­ner and lis­ten for other burn­ing-build­ing sce­nar­ios and then rush over to try to help save _those_ peo­ple? I mean, how can what­ever we’re do­ing right now cre­ate more hap­pi­ness than sav­ing lives?

Here we find a new crit­i­cism of util­i­tar­i­an­ism: when we fol­low con­se­quen­tial­ist the­ory out to the far end of the bell curve—reach­ing the in­escapable ter­mi­nus of a life where we act _only_ in or­der to max­i­mize hap­pi­ness—we fall into a big ol’ booby trap: the “hap­pi­ness pump.”

Let’s say we adopt a purely con­se­quen­tial­ist world­view. One day we find a five-dol­lar bill on the street, and since we don’t re­ally _need_ five ex­tra bucks, we de­cide to make the world a lit­tle bet­ter. We go on­line and find a highly ef­fi­cient char­ity that for five bucks can pur­chase a mos­quito net and get it to sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa, where it can pre­vent a kid from con­tract­ing malaria and maybe dy­ing. Five bucks to save a hu­man life?! Easy call. Flush with suc­cess, we look at our bank ac­count and see a bal­ance of $3,000. We’ve al­ready paid our rent this month, and we have a steady job and no im­me­di­ate health crises, so that money isn’t _vi­tal_, right now. Three thou­sand dol­lars would buy six hun­dred more mos­quito nets—that’s six hun­dred more hu­man lives! So we give it all away. Then we look around our house and see a bunch of old clothes and books and fur­ni­ture we don’t need, so we sell them and do­nate all the money to buy more mos­quito nets. Then we fig­ure we don’t tech­ni­cally _need_ a car, be­cause we _could_ walk to work and take Lyfts ev­ery­where else we need to go, and why should we drive around in a car we don’t _re­ally_ need when kids are dy­ing of malaria? How is that fair? It isn’t. So we sell our car and give the money to the mos­quito net char­ity. Then we sell our house, do­nate the money, and move in with our friend. And then we re­al­ize: “Hey, I have _two_ kid­neys, and I only _need_ one…”

You get the point.

Clas­sic util­i­tar­i­an­ism gives us a sim­ple rule for how to be good—cre­ate more hap­pi­ness and plea­sure than pain and suf­fer­ing—but it doesn’t re­ally sug­gest at what point we are al­lowed to put re­straints on our good­ness-cre­at­ing ac­tions in or­der to just main­tain our ba­sic lives. In _The Good Place_ we in­vented a char­ac­ter named Doug Forcett, who had taken the idea of max­i­miz­ing hap­pi­ness to the ex­treme—he ate only lentils he grew him­self, be­cause they re­quired very lit­tle wa­ter. He al­lowed him­self to be pushed around by a teenage bully who’d re­al­ized that Doug would do what­ever dumb thing the bully wanted him to do, and since do­ing those things made the bully happy, Doug obliged. If we adopt a util­i­tar­ian world­view whole­sale and fol­low it to the end of the line, we risk be­com­ing this kind of “hap­pi­ness pump”—a bat­tery, es­sen­tially, pow­er­ing the hap­pi­ness of other peo­ple at the ex­pense of our own. Any lim­its we put on util­i­tar­ian ac­tions are ar­bi­trary and self-de­fined, which to me dents its use­ful­ness as a guid­ing prin­ci­ple. If the peo­ple who in­vented util­i­tar­i­an­ism never told us when we could stop… when should we stop?

The con­tem­po­rary philoso­pher Su­san Wolf wrote about this in a pa­per called “Moral Saints,” in which she ques­tions the very idea of what it would mean to be “morally per­fect.” She writes:

> For the moral saint, the pro­mo­tion of the wel­fare of oth­ers might play the role that is played for most of us by the en­joy­ment of ma­te­rial com­forts, the op­por­tu­nity to en­gage in the in­tel­lec­tual and phys­i­cal ac­tiv­i­ties of our choice, and the love, re­spect, and com­pan­ion­ship of peo­ple whom we love, re­spect, and en­joy. The hap­pi­ness of the moral saint, then, would truly lie in the hap­pi­ness of oth­ers, and so he would de­vote him­self to oth­ers gladly, and with a whole and open heart.

This is that “hap­pi­ness pump” idea, re­phrased: Wolf de­scribes it as a per­son whose de­fault set­ting is not “self-preser­va­tion,” but rather “other-preser­va­tion.” It’s the ego turned in­side out. When we think of it that way, it doesn’t sound _so_ ter­ri­ble—it even echoes ubuntu—but in or­der to achieve this moral saint­hood we’d have to do this _all the time_, in ev­ery sce­nario, which es­sen­tially ren­ders the idea im­pos­si­ble. If we were hav­ing lunch with our best friend, Carl, and across the street a woman got frus­trated by a mal­func­tion­ing park­ing me­ter, we would have to leap up and rush to help her… un­less do­ing so made Carl up­set, be­cause he was right in the mid­dle of an emo­tional story about his on­go­ing trou­bles with his sis­ter, and thus the act of help­ing the park­ing me­ter lady would cause _him_ more _un­hap­pi­ness_ than the hap­pi­ness we would cre­ate by help­ing the woman with her park­ing me­ter trou­bles… but then as we’re mak­ing that cal­cu­la­tion we hap­pen to over­hear some­one talk­ing about a flood in Mis­souri that dis­placed thou­sands of peo­ple, all of whom are more in need than Carl _or_ Park­ing Me­ter Lady, so we rush to the air­port… This con­stant and end­less util­i­tar­ian cal­cu­la­tion makes it im­pos­si­ble for us to live any­thing ap­proach­ing a nor­mal life.

And what be­comes of such a per­son? How would we be, for lack of a bet­ter term, _peo­ple_, if our only goal were moral saint­hood? Wolf wor­ries about that too.

> If the moral saint is de­vot­ing all his time to feed­ing the hun­gry or heal­ing the sick or rais­ing money for Ox­fam, then nec­es­sar­ily he is not read­ing Vic­to­rian nov­els, play­ing the oboe, or im­prov­ing his back­hand.… A life in which _none_ of these pos­si­ble as­pects of char­ac­ter are de­vel­oped may seem to be a life strangely bar­ren.… An in­ter­est in some­thing like gourmet cook­ing will be… dif­fi­cult for a moral saint to rest easy with. For it seems to me that no plau­si­ble ar­gu­ment can jus­tify the use of hu­man re­sources in­volved in pro­duc­ing a _pâté de ca­nard en croute_ against pos­si­ble al­ter­na­tive benef­i­cent ends to which these re­sources might be put.

The moral saint can’t go see movies, or play ten­nis, or learn Ara­bic, or cook what­ever the hell a _pâté de ca­nard en croute_ is, be­cause do­ing so robs her of valu­able moral saint ac­tiv­ity time. And with­out any of these life-en­rich­ing ac­tiv­i­ties, the moral saint be­comes _su­per bor­ing_. “A moral saint will have to be very, very nice,” Wolf writes, drily. “It is im­por­tant that he not be of­fen­sive. The worry is that, as a re­sult, he will have to be dull-wit­ted or hu­mor­less or bland.” Right! A per­son who self-ab­ne­gates to the point where he can­not risk laugh­ing at some­thing that oth­ers might not find funny, or who can’t risk mak­ing an ob­ser­va­tion about the world out of the fear that some­one else might not share a sim­i­lar view, is a _snooze_.

Not to men­tion that no one wants to hang out with a per­son who has only one in­ter­est—whether that in­ter­est is be­ing morally per­fect, or swim­ming, or play­ing the bag­pipes. The idea of in­di­vid­u­al­ity, of be­ing a liv­ing en­tity with di­men­sion and speci­ficity, frees us to pur­sue things we love and want to ex­pe­ri­ence, and with­out car­ing to fer­til­ize those seeds unique to our lit­tle hu­man gar­dens we’re not re­ally _peo­ple_. In other words: Not _ev­ery­thing_ can or should be about moral­ity. (“There seems to be a limit,” says Wolf, “to how much moral­ity we can stand.”) Hu­man ac­com­plish­ment is cool, and valu­able, and ad­mirable, and when we re­al­ize that those valu­able ac­com­plish­ments are in­com­pat­i­ble with moral saint­hood, we can let go of moral saint­hood as a rea­son­able guide for how to live our lives. If we don’t, we be­come dull, di­men­sion­less bat­ter­ies, do­ing noth­ing but pow­er­ing the rest of the world.[^3]

The ques­tion we’re try­ing to an­swer—“What’s the up­per limit of re­quired good­ness?”—seems like a job for virtue ethics; be­cause again, while Kant and Mill ask _What should I do?_, Aris­to­tle is ask­ing _What kind of per­son should I be?_ The first ques­tion aims to be more prac­ti­cal, I sup­pose—those guys are try­ing to give us ac­tual in­struc­tion man­u­als that we can break open when­ever we are faced with a tough choice. But in cer­tain sit­u­a­tions those rule-based the­o­ries break down, or sug­gest that we do out­ra­geous or ab­surd things. Aris­to­tle sug­gests that if we can fo­cus on be­com­ing vir­tu­ous peo­ple, we will then make good choices. His “prac­tice makes per­fect” ap­proach (or, more ac­cu­rately: “con­tin­ual prac­tice brings us asymp­tot­i­cally closer to per­fec­tion”—but that’s not as catchy) con­tains a key to an­swer­ing the ques­tion: “Just how good do I have to be in or­der to be good?”

By def­i­ni­tion, the golden mean pro­vides for ev­ery virtue both an up­per and a lower limit—those vices at ei­ther end of the see­saw. The sol­dier with _too much_ courage will be­come rash and stupid, charg­ing over a hill and try­ing to take on an en­tire army by her­self, while the one with _no_ courage will wet his pants at the first sign of trou­ble and aban­don his fel­low sol­diers. The ideal amount of ev­ery virtue, again, is that the­o­ret­i­cal per­fect bal­ance be­tween ex­cess and de­fi­ciency. So now, in­stead of a see­saw, let’s think of this as a tug-of-war. You know how there’s a flag at the cen­ter of the rope, and the flag drifts a lit­tle this way and then back the other way as one side or the other gains the up­per hand? The teams are vices—like cow­ardice and rash­ness—and the flag is the golden mean of courage. If ev­ery­thing is in bal­ance, the flag re­mains at the very cen­ter of those two vices, thanks to the equal ten­sion from each side. But if one or the other vice starts to pull harder, the flag drifts a lit­tle bit to­ward that vice and needs to be pulled back the other way _by the op­pos­ing vice_. So the golden mean ac­tu­ally _de­mands_ that we ex­hibit some amount of mildly “vice-like” be­hav­ior in or­der to main­tain our vir­tu­ous bal­ance. The per­son seek­ing the golden mean of courage, for ex­am­ple, _has_ to oc­ca­sion­ally stir in a lit­tle cow­ardice, be­cause if she doesn’t, she may be­come too rash.

Edith Hall, a pro­fes­sor of clas­sics at King’s Col­lege Lon­don, ex­cel­lently ex­plains this an­gle on Aris­totelian means:

> I be­lieve my own worst faults are: im­pa­tience, reck­less­ness, ex­ces­sive blunt­ness, emo­tional ex­tremes and vin­dic­tive­ness. But Aris­to­tle’s idea of… “the golden mean” ex­plains that all these are fine _in mod­er­a­tion_—peo­ple who are never im­pa­tient don’t get things done; peo­ple who never take risks live lim­ited lives; peo­ple who evade the truth and do not ex­press pain or joy at all are psy­cho­log­i­cally and emo­tion­ally stunted or de­prived; and peo­ple who have no de­sire what­so­ever to get even with those who have dam­aged them are ei­ther de­lud­ing them­selves or have too low an es­ti­mate of their own worth.

In other words, Aris­to­tle doesn’t de­mand that we be per­fect lit­tle moral saints, smil­ing all the time, never los­ing our tem­pers, and pol­ish­ing ap­ples for our teach­ers. In fact, such a per­son is _fail­ing_ at find­ing the Goldilocks bulls­eye for which­ever virtue he’s at­tempt­ing to ex­hibit. And he’s also su­per an­noy­ing. And bor­ing. Who wants to hang out with _that_ guy? Just sit­ting there, be­ing all per­fect all the time, lord­ing it over us—or worse, _not_ lord­ing it over us, be­cause he’s so per­fect he would _never_ lord any­thing over us. How _dare_ he not lord it over us?! That guy is the _worst_!

Sorry. The point is, we _need_ “im­per­fect” qual­i­ties, as long as they are ex­hib­ited only in the cor­rect amount to be use­ful—by keep­ing us from tilt­ing too far into ex­cess or de­fi­ciency—and not harm­ful. For Aris­to­tle, all of this _do­ing_ and _search­ing_ and _ori­ent­ing_ has one pur­pose: to ap­proach a state of “flour­ish­ing.” But to me, there’s a sort of ad­ja­cent, and more prag­matic, ben­e­fit: the al­lowance for, or even _need for_, some amount of vice-like be­hav­ior as we search for virtue takes the pres­sure off us. To use yet an­other leisure time–ac­tiv­ity metaphor, virtue ethics func­tions like those bumpers that bowl­ing al­leys put up for kids, to pre­vent the balls from rolling into the gut­ters—if we drift too far in one di­rec­tion, the search for the golden mean nudges us back onto a bet­ter tra­jec­tory. Know­ing we don’t have to be _com­pletely_ coura­geous or _ut­terly_ kind or _per­fectly_ gen­er­ous makes the ar­du­ous project of be­com­ing bet­ter peo­ple seem less im­pos­si­ble.

### Don’t Sac­ri­fice Your En­tire Life for a Ran­dom Vi­o­lin­ist

One thought ex­per­i­ment we might ex­plore here is Ju­dith Jarvis Thom­son’s “Vi­o­lin­ist.” Thom­son (1929–2020), whom you may re­mem­ber from her con­tri­bu­tions to the Trol­ley Prob­lem, imag­ines a sce­nario in which a woman we’ll call Meg wakes up back-to-back with a fa­mous vi­o­lin­ist named Ar­mando, whose kid­neys are fail­ing. Meg ap­par­ently has the only com­pat­i­ble set of kid­neys around, and the So­ci­ety of Mu­sic Lovers has kid­napped her and med­i­cally con­nected her to Ar­mando in or­der to save his life. The So­ci­ety of Mu­sic Lovers tells Meg she must re­main con­nected to Ar­mando for some in­de­ter­mi­nate amount of time, be­cause he’s a world-class vi­o­lin­ist and his mu­sic makes a lot of peo­ple happy, so… sorry, Meg—your only job now is to serve as a seden­tary blood-cleaner for this dis­eased vi­o­lin mae­stro.[^4] Is this a rea­son­able re­quest? Most peo­ple would say no. Most peo­ple would also start keep­ing an eye out for mem­bers of the So­ci­ety of Mu­sic Lovers, who ap­par­ently are a lot more dan­ger­ous than their name would sug­gest.

But a strict con­se­quen­tial­ist might say that Meg should sub­mit to this new life as a hu­man blood-cleaner. Ar­mando has mil­lions of fans! His mu­sic brings so much joy to so many. And what have you ever done, Meg? Oh, you’re an HR rep for GE­ICO. Big deal. Have you ever played Dvořák’s Vi­o­lin Con­certo in A Mi­nor with the Lon­don Phil­har­monic? Be­cause Ar­mando has, and it was _in­cred­i­ble._ Suck it up and clean Ar­mando’s blood. (Though again, yes, the strict con­se­quen­tial­ist has to add in the pain caused by peo­ple know­ing this could hap­pen to them, etc., etc.)

A Kan­tian would of course turn up her nose at this—you want to talk about treat­ing some­one as a means to an end in­stead of as an end in her­self? Ar­mando is lit­er­ally us­ing the en­tirety of Meg’s ex­is­tence to stay alive. Meg is a hu­man crutch for Ar­mando. Bad bad bad. The Kan­tian would also have some words for the So­ci­ety of Mu­sic Lovers, and the doc­tor who per­formed the surgery, and the or­der­lies who clean the room, and the guy who filled the vend­ing ma­chines in the hos­pi­tal. Kan­tians have a few words for ev­ery­one.

Aris­to­tle would agree with Kant that Meg is not re­quired to un­will­ingly do­nate her kid­neys to Ar­mando in per­pe­tu­ity, but for a dif­fer­ent rea­son. He might say that there is a limit to self-sac­ri­fice, be­cause some­one who tilts too far to­ward help­ing oth­ers to flour­ish—a hap­pi­ness pump, es­sen­tially—may be un­able to flour­ish her­self. There is some amount of “self­ish­ness” that’s ap­pro­pri­ate and even _good_ for us to have, be­cause with­out it we aren’t prop­erly valu­ing our own lives. If _flour­ish­ing_ is the ul­ti­mate hu­man pur­pose, it re­quires us to pro­tect our­selves a lit­tle from suf­fer­ing. “I don’t have to loan my re­nal sys­tem to a ran­dom vi­o­lin­ist at the com­plete un­end­ing ex­pense of my own life and hap­pi­ness” cer­tainly falls within the bounds of the rea­son­able amount of “self­ish­ness” a per­son should ex­hibit.[^5]

It may seem like I am nudg­ing us to­ward choos­ing Aris­to­tle as our of­fi­cial guide in the quest to be­come bet­ter peo­ple. I’m re­ally not—I be­lieve that each of these schools of thought has some­thing use­ful to of­fer us. (Also, Aris­to­tle had his prob­lems—for in­stance, he was _very_ into slav­ery. He 100 per­cent thought slav­ery was cool. I know it was 2,400 years ago, but still—don’t be so into slav­ery, Aris­to­tle!) No mat­ter which school of thought we’re talk­ing about, while it’s ob­vi­ously coura­geous to run into a burn­ing build­ing and try to save ev­ery­one, it’s not eth­i­cally _re­quired_, es­pe­cially if the chances for sur­vival (for you and the peo­ple in­side) are im­pos­si­ble to cal­cu­late.[^6] We wouldn’t uni­ver­sal­ize a maxim that said, “We must _al­ways_ risk our lives to save other peo­ple,” be­cause do­ing so would cause peo­ple to con­stantly in­ter­vene in sit­u­a­tions where they’re un­likely to sur­vive. It’s also hard to claim that we are “max­i­miz­ing good” by mak­ing a very risky bet that we—who are not in any way qual­i­fied to as­sess the dan­gers of a fire and then nav­i­gate the sit­u­a­tion in or­der to save oth­ers—can suc­ceed. And just like Aris­to­tle’s overly coura­geous sol­dier tak­ing on an en­tire army him­self, reck­lessly charg­ing into a burn­ing build­ing may cer­tainly be la­beled an _ex­ces­sively_ coura­geous act, tilt­ing over into rash­ness. Like any­thing else, it’s a cal­cu­la­tion: brave is good, fool­ish is not.

So, ul­ti­mately, there _are_ lim­its on what’s re­quired of us—moral per­fec­tion is im­pos­si­ble, and it’s un­wise to think of it as any kind of rea­son­able goal. But what if we _did_ storm into the burn­ing build­ing, and res­cued the peo­ple in­side? We ei­ther for­mu­lated a uni­ver­sal maxim in record time and fol­lowed it, or we hold the con­cept of max­i­miz­ing hap­pi­ness in such high re­gard that we de­cided to risk our own safety, or we felt as though res­cu­ing those peo­ple was not ex­hibit­ing an ex­cess of courage… and we freakin’ did it! Ev­ery­one pats us on the back, in awe of our brav­ery (and pos­si­bly the speed with which we formed a uni­ver­sal maxim and then fol­lowed it). Some­one snaps a photo of us emerg­ing from the flames, and we look su­per badass—mod­ern-day su­per­heroes, risk­ing life and limb to save oth­ers. As we con­sider the pic­ture, flush with the en­dor­phin rush that comes from an act of hero­ism, our In­sta­gram ac­count starts call­ing out to us…

“Post it… You’ll look so cool… Post ii­i­itttt…”

1. [^1] A bunch of other wild stuff hap­pened to him too. In 1961 he was on a para­trooper train­ing mis­sion when both of his para­chutes mal­func­tioned, and in 1977 his wife hired a hit man to drug his beer so she could show up with Lu­cas’s gun, kill him, and make it look like a sui­cide—but the po­lice were tipped off and Lu­cas switched the drugged beer, foil­ing the plot. Some­how he sur­vived it all and died in 2008 at the age of eighty.
2. [^2] And then we may feel bad about our­selves again, be­cause _we_ could never de­sign that thing! How does any­one de­sign those things?!
3. [^3] Wolf is a great writer, and this part of her ar­gu­ment is re­ally el­e­gant: She de­scribes two sorts of moral saints, the Ra­tio­nal Saint (a Kan­tian ap­proach) and the Lov­ing Saint (a util­i­tar­ian ap­proach). She then very neatly dis­misses both as self-de­feat­ing, by say­ing that the Ra­tio­nal Saint could not uni­ver­sal­ize the maxim “make ev­ery­one else as happy as pos­si­ble,” be­cause if ev­ery­one tried to do that, we would all just stand in a big cir­cle, wait­ing for ev­ery­one else to have a prob­lem we could fix, and thus no one would do any­thing. (Also, re­mem­ber that Kant him­self dis­missed the idea of uni­ver­sal max­ims re­gard­ing hap­pi­ness, be­cause of my “Hawai­ian pizza and Red Hot Chili Pep­pers” prob­lem—that dif­fer­ent peo­ple are made happy by dif­fer­ent things.) And if we all be­came util­i­tar­ian Lov­ing Saints, deny­ing our own hap­pi­ness for the sake of oth­ers, we’d all be­come deeply _un­happy_, and thus could po­ten­tially _re­duce_ the to­tal hap­pi­ness in the world, which is the op­po­site of what we’d be aim­ing for.
4. [^4] Thom­son does not make it clear how Ar­mando’s go­ing to con­tinue to play the vi­o­lin while he’s in this hos­pi­tal bed get­ting his blood cleaned by some­one else’s kid­neys, but we’ll let that slide.
5. [^5] At the risk of drift­ing into the thorny world of pol­i­tics, Thom­son de­signed this thought ex­per­i­ment to dis­cuss the is­sue of abor­tion, in the case of un­wanted preg­nancy. It’s not hard to guess what her con­clu­sion was. Foot was also dis­cussing abor­tion in the 1967 pa­per that started it all—the ti­tle was “The Prob­lem of Abor­tion and the Doc­trine of Dou­ble Ef­fect.”
6. [^6] Like ev­ery­thing else in ethics, the cal­cu­la­tion changes with the cir­cum­stances. Are we paid fire­fight­ers who are on duty? Well, yeah, now we should charge in there, be­cause it’s the job we signed up for. Just like with the Trol­ley Prob­lem vari­a­tions where we’re ei­ther a pro­fes­sional trol­ley driver or a by­stander, the specifics of our role in the sit­u­a­tion mat­ter a great deal.

    

## CHAP­TER SIX I Just Did Some­thing Un­selfish. But What’s in It for Me?!

A few years ago, I caught my­self do­ing some­thing em­bar­rass­ing. There’s a Star­bucks near my house, and I got the same thing ev­ery time I went in: a medium cof­fee. The price was $1.73, I paid in cash, and when I got my change I would toss it into the tip jar by the reg­is­ter. Ex­cept… I _didn’t_ just toss it in. Af­ter hand­ing me my change, the barista would turn around to get the cof­fee, and I would wait un­til he had turned _back_ around be­fore I graced him with my gen­er­ous tip of twenty-seven U.S. cents.

When I sud­denly re­al­ized that I was do­ing this—af­ter maybe the hun­dredth time I did it—so many ques­tions popped into my head at once: Why did I need that per­son to see me per­form such a mi­nus­cule act of kind­ness? Did I crave some kind of _eth­i­cal credit_ for tip­ping this guy twenty-seven cents? Or was it per­haps the fear that if he _didn’t_ see me do it, he’d think I was the kind of per­son who _didn’t_ tip? What did this mean for the (dif­fer­ent but re­lated) act of char­i­ta­ble giv­ing—is there a greater moral value in do­nat­ing anony­mously? If so, isn’t that an­noy­ing? I mean, if you don’t let them in­clude your name on the donor roll, then no one will know what a good per­son you are!

What­ever the rea­son, one thing be­came clear: I was be­ing su­per lame. Tip­ping twenty-seven cents was pretty lame, and do­ing so only when I knew I would be seen do­ing it was _dou­bly_ lame. (The only real good that came out of the whole episode was that pon­der­ing it led directly to cre­at­ing _The Good Place_.) It made me won­der (again) what the hell I was do­ing, and why the hell I was do­ing it. I poked around to re­search why ex­actly I was be­ing so lame, and came upon the con­cept of moral desert.[^1]

### Hu­man­ity’s Un­quench­able Thirst for Gold Stars

In phi­los­o­phy, “desert” deals with fig­ur­ing out what peo­ple are owed, or in some cases what they’re _en­ti­tled_ to, based on dif­fer­ent ac­tions in dif­fer­ent sce­nar­ios. _Moral_ desert is the idea that if we do good deeds, we should be re­warded for them—some­times in like a cool spir­i­tual way, where our souls be­come en­riched by the cos­mic pos­i­tiv­ity we’ve cre­ated, but some­times in a lit­eral, “big shiny tro­phy!” way. There’s a lot of writ­ing about the moral­ity of peo­ple get­ting what they de­serve, and our duty to give peo­ple what they de­serve (or at least nudge them fur­ther to­ward what they de­serve), and it can get re­ally hairy and dif­fi­cult to un­der­stand; a lot of it be­comes math­e­mat­i­cal, with charts and graphs and logic ma­tri­ces, and we’ll just skip right over that stuff and talk about the most ba­sic ques­tion: Do we “de­serve” some kind of bonus if we act with virtue? In my case, when I tipped the barista, some part of me felt like I was owed the grat­i­tude he would dis­play when he saw my gen­eros­ity—I was in­vert­ing the very idea of a tip, be­cause the pur­pose of the ac­tion be­came a re­ward for _me_ in­stead of the guy who’d earned it. And when you put it like that… I mean, that can’t be right. Right?

I was heart­ened to dis­cover how wide­spread this feel­ing is. The de­sire for oth­ers to rec­og­nize our good­ness has been dis­cussed for cen­turies, and when I did an in­for­mal sur­vey of my friends and col­leagues, many of them copped to the same foible: When we do some­thing good, we want credit, dammit. We want a lit­tle gold star. We want to be seen as good peo­ple—and I mean _lit­er­ally_ seen—which I think is both com­pletely un­der­stand­able and deeply em­bar­rass­ing. (Side note: _So much_ of phi­los­o­phy in­volves in­ves­ti­gat­ing em­bar­rass­ing hu­man ac­tiv­i­ties and in­cli­na­tions. We re­ally are weird lit­tle crea­tures.) Why do we so in­tensely crave recog­ni­tion for our good deeds, even if those deeds are mi­nus­cule?

There’s a cou­ple of ways to look at this, and they cover ground that stretches be­yond what we might tra­di­tion­ally think of as “ethics,” at least in the West­ern philo­soph­i­cal sense. When I caught my­self do­ing this silly, bor­der­line-pa­thetic thing—crav­ing twenty-seven cents’ worth of moral desert—I asked my­self the ques­tion we talked about in the in­tro­duc­tion: “What am I _do­ing_?” Up to that point in my life, I hadn’t of­ten in­ter­ro­gated my­self that way, es­pe­cially in mun­dane sit­u­a­tions like buy­ing cof­fee. But I’ve since come to be­lieve that mak­ing bet­ter de­ci­sions re­quires that we do so rou­tinely. That be­lief led me to the writ­ings of Thich Nhat Hanh.

Thich Nhat Hanh (1926–) is a Bud­dhist monk from Viet­nam who was nom­i­nated for the No­bel Peace Prize in 1967 by Mar­tin Luther King Jr. Take a sec­ond and reread that sen­tence. Have you ever heard any­thing more im­pres­sive than “he was nom­i­nated for a No­bel Peace Prize by Mar­tin Luther King Jr.”? But here’s the im­por­tant part: in­stead of do­ing what ev­ery­one else would’ve done—put on a T-shirt that says I WAS NOM­I­NATED FOR A NO­BEL PEACE PRIZE BY MAR­TIN LUTHER KING JR. and stand on the cor­ner wav­ing a flag that says I WAS NOM­I­NATED FOR A NO­BEL PEACE PRIZE BY MAR­TIN LUTHER KING JR.—Thich Nhat Hanh just kept ad­vo­cat­ing for peace in Viet­nam and try­ing to help peo­ple. That’s how good a per­son he is. In per­haps his most fa­mous book, _The Heart of the Bud­dha’s Teach­ing_, he shares this story:

> Em­peror Wu asked Bod­hid­harma, the founder of Zen Bud­dhism in China, how much merit he had earned by build­ing tem­ples all over the coun­try. Bod­hid­harma said, “None what­so­ever.” But if you wash one dish in mind­ful­ness, if you build one tem­ple while dwelling deeply in the present mo­ment—not want­ing to be any­where else, not car­ing about fame or recog­ni­tion—the merit from that act will be bound­less, and you will feel very happy.

Mind­ful­ness is the core of Bud­dhist phi­los­o­phy; Hanh de­fines it as “the en­ergy that brings us back to the present mo­ment.” This may seem like more of a re­li­gious idea than an eth­i­cal one, but when you ap­ply it to my lame quest for moral desert, it takes on an eth­i­cal di­men­sion. Some part of my ac­tion—wait­ing un­til my “good” deed could be rec­og­nized be­fore I did it—came from the de­sire to have the deed func­tion as some­thing other than what it was. I cared about the _re­ac­tion to_ the deed, and how _I_ might ben­e­fit from it. Tip­ping ceased to be sim­ply the ac­tion of tip­ping—it be­came a means to an end, and the end was self­ish. Bud­dhist phi­los­o­phy sug­gests that true hap­pi­ness comes from re­main­ing fo­cused on the things we do, and do­ing them with no pur­pose other than _to do them_.

Gi­ant chunks of West­ern phi­los­o­phy are cap­tured and el­e­gantly re­for­mu­lated in this one beau­ti­ful idea.[^2] For ex­am­ple: by suc­cumb­ing to this de­sire to be thought of as peo­ple who do good, which leads us to do things with the in­ten­tion of re­ceiv­ing praise or some other moral desert, we’re also run­ning afoul of our stoic[^3] Prus­sian watch­dog Im­manuel Kant. He’d chas­tise us for not act­ing out of duty to fol­low a uni­ver­sal maxim _and_ tell us we are us­ing the re­cip­i­ent of the small ges­ture as a means to an end—mak­ing our­selves feel good and re­ceiv­ing praise or recog­ni­tion. (A Kan­tian dou­ble whammy! He’d prob­a­bly be so psyched about how bad we’re be­ing, that freak.)

A util­i­tar­ian, on the other hand, might say that it’s bet­ter to make two peo­ple feel good than one, so it’s ac­tu­ally _prefer­able_ to make sure the barista saw the tip—that way he feels good, and I feel good too be­cause I get recog­ni­tion for my (twenty-seven cents’ worth of) gen­eros­ity. Now, the util­i­tar­ian might note that the tip will _even­tu­ally_ be noted and counted, so the hap­pi­ness of the _barista_ will wind up be­ing the same no mat­ter what,[^4] and thus _I_ can feel roughly the same amount of hap­pi­ness that I’d feel in the mo­ment of in­stan­ta­neous ac­knowl­edg­ment. But there is still the ex­tra hap­pi­ness I get from _see­ing the barista see me_—so in to­tal, tip­ping in view of the tippee slightly in­creases the to­tal hap­pi­ness.

And Aris­to­tle? I’m hon­estly not sure what he’d say. This ac­tion doesn’t fall neatly into a “virtue” cat­e­gory. It’s a slight ex­cess of pride, maybe? Or pos­si­bly a de­fi­ciency of hu­mil­ity? (The one thing I know for sure is that an Aris­totelian would def­i­nitely say twenty-seven cents is a crummy tip. Chip in a buck and let’s get closer to that golden mean of gen­eros­ity, bud.[^5]) Aris­to­tle might also ding me for ex­hibit­ing my old pec­ca­dillo: ex­ces­sive du­ti­ful­ness. I even­tu­ally con­cluded that while I was in­deed seek­ing some kind of praise or “hat tip” from the barista, I was _more_ mo­ti­vated by the fear that he would think I _hadn’t_ tipped him, since tip­ping is a “rule” (or gen­er­ally agreed-upon prac­tice) in Amer­i­can restau­rants. I came to that con­clu­sion af­ter my wife, J.J., re­minded me that when we were in Paris on our hon­ey­moon, de­spite hav­ing read about the Eu­ro­pean sys­tem wherein ser­vice gra­tu­ity is not re­quired in restau­rants (but is in­stead wrapped into the price of the meal), I still left tips for our wait­ers ev­ery­where we went. In that case I was wor­ried about two things: (1) be­ing seen as a boor­ish, self­ish Amer­i­can, and (2) break­ing a rule, even though I had am­ple ev­i­dence that the “rule” in ques­tion was not be­ing bro­ken. (I did this so con­sis­tently that as we got off the plane at the end of the trip, J.J. looked at me and said, “Did you tip the pi­lot?” Which was an ex­cel­lent burn.) Same deal with the Star­bucks tip—I needed the barista to tick a lit­tle box next to my name on an imag­i­nary “good cus­tomer check­list.” Re­mem­ber how I said my ex­cess of du­ti­ful­ness can be kind of an­noy­ing? There you go.

But let’s re­turn to this (pretty com­pelling) util­i­tar­ian coun­ter­ar­gu­ment, which I noted above: the “added good” caused by the barista see­ing me tip him, and thus feel­ing pleased be­cause he’s be­ing rec­og­nized for do­ing a good job. Again, granted, he’d also feel this at the end of the day when he counts up his to­tal tips, but the small, mu­tu­ally ac­knowl­edged in-per­son hu­man in­ter­ac­tion is a lit­tle bright spot in his day, and mine, and there is value there. This ar­gu­ment was made to me by a friend I was hash­ing this out with, and it started me think­ing about the con­cept of one-way mon­e­tary trans­ac­tions in much larger realms—like char­i­ta­ble giv­ing. That’s ob­vi­ously a dif­fer­ent sort of trans­ac­tion than a gra­tu­ity, but the eth­i­cal ques­tions around moral desert per­tain to both—in each case, we are giv­ing money to some­one (or some­thing), and in each case we want to be re­warded for what we’ve done. We feel that we’re _owed_ a moral pat on the back, and even though it’s shame­ful to ad­mit it, that feel­ing is pow­er­ful. We want the credit!

In his twelfth-cen­tury mag­num opus, the Mish­neh Torah, the Jew­ish scholar Mai­monides lays out eight lev­els of char­i­ta­ble giv­ing. One of the high­est is to give money anony­mously to peo­ple you don’t know (as­sum­ing they need the money and are wor­thy of the gift). A lit­tle far­ther down on the list are things like giv­ing anony­mously to peo­ple you _do_ know, and giv­ing to peo­ple be­fore you’re asked. At the very bot­tom, es­sen­tially, is rolling your eyes, grunt­ing, “Ugh, FINE,” and toss­ing a quar­ter at a starv­ing kid. When I tipped my twenty-seven cents, I was just one level above that: “When one gives in­ad­e­quately, but gives gladly and with a smile.” (Again, the Star­bucks tip wasn’t “char­ity,” but the specifics of the ac­tion here are less im­por­tant than the de­sire for credit.)

If one of the high­est lev­els of char­ity is “anony­mous giv­ing to anony­mous peo­ple,” that means that if we give a large amount of money to, say, a group fight­ing poverty in ru­ral Ar­kan­sas, we ought to do it anony­mously. How­ever, the anonymity (morally good for us, maybe) also af­fects other peo­ple, who see only “Anony­mous” in the donor list. Maybe that’s a good thing. Maybe the anonymity sends a mes­sage that this do­na­tion was, in Thich Nhat Hanh’s words, _mind­ful_, and peo­ple will be in­spired by the act of giv­ing purely for the sake of giv­ing, and not for recog­ni­tion or pride. But many oth­ers—I’ll speak for my­self here—look at “Anony­mous” and can’t help but think: _Who is that?!_ There’s a mu­seum in Los An­ge­les we used to take our kids to when they were driv­ing us nuts and we were to­tally out of ideas for how to en­ter­tain them, and a list on the wall shows gifts of _tens of mil­lions of dol­lars_, some of which are anony­mous. I can’t help it—I want to know who the donors were! I don’t know why, re­ally—partly sus­pi­cion, maybe, that the gifts came from peo­ple L.A. mu­se­um­go­ers would find ob­jec­tion­able… partly low-level gos­sip-seek­ing about who ponied up that kind of dough… and partly a moral cu­rios­ity. _Who did this good thing?_

That’s the crux of this coun­ter­ar­gu­ment to do­nat­ing anony­mously: How much _ex­tra_ good has come from fa­mous peo­ple—George Clooney, or Oprah, or Le­Bron James—pub­licly an­nounc­ing their char­i­ta­ble giv­ing? How much more at­ten­tion has been brought to those causes be­cause of the pub­lic na­ture of their gifts? Cer­tainly: a _lot_. And it doesn’t have to be fa­mous peo­ple—if we give $1,000 to fight poverty in ru­ral Ar­kan­sas and our friends and co­work­ers and fam­ily see what we’ve done, per­haps they’ll be in­spired and de­cide to give them­selves. There’s gotta be some golden mean here be­tween “to­tal anonymity” and “post a selfie while cut­ting a huge check, with hash­tags #ImAwe­some, #Bet­terThanYou, and #Gen­er­ousAF.”

### Score One for the Util­i­tar­i­ans!

We can’t deny there is some­thing good, pure, and _mind­ful_ about giv­ing anony­mously, which strips away ev­ery­thing sur­round­ing the act other than the act it­self. Hon­estly, I am more drawn to that hu­man­is­tic Bud­dhist ex­pla­na­tion of why anonymity is good than Kant’s “rules and reg­u­la­tions” ap­proach. But af­ter mulling this all over for a good long time, my in­ner util­i­tar­ian takes over and wins the day. (See? Told you I wasn’t in the bag for Aris­to­tle!) The goal of char­i­ta­ble giv­ing is to max­i­mize the trans­fer of money from peo­ple who have it to peo­ple who need it. Of­ten, the cir­cum­stances are dire—the money will be used for emer­gency dis­as­ter re­lief, to pro­vide food, shel­ter, or medicine. Re­quir­ing a pu­rity of mo­ti­va­tion seems like a lim­it­ing de­mand in a realm where we shouldn’t im­pose any lim­its. In other words: I don’t re­ally care why you’re giv­ing money, as long as you’re giv­ing it. (Within rea­son, of course—more on this in a sec­ond.) The util­i­tar­ian drive to max­i­mize good takes the pole po­si­tion, for me, in this race.

As an ex­am­ple: I once at­tended a fancy char­ity event that hon­ored one Hol­ly­wood mogul type per year. The point of hon­or­ing these moguls was not to re­ward them for their ex­cel­lent ser­vice to the cause—many of them had noth­ing to do with the char­ity in ques­tion be­fore they were cho­sen as the hon­oree—but rather to get them to use their power and in­flu­ence to force other peo­ple in Hol­ly­wood to give money. If Scott Power­bro­ker calls peo­ple on the phone and says, “I’m be­ing hon­ored at a char­ity din­ner, would you like to buy a ta­ble?” ev­ery­one says yes, be­cause they are flat­tered that Scott Power­bro­ker is call­ing them, and also they want to brag to their peers that they and Scott are _old, old_ friends. (“We’ve known him for­ever,” they want to say. “Ac­tu­ally, we’re go­ing to see him this week­end at a char­ity thing.”) The year I went, a pow­er­ful tal­ent agent was be­ing hon­ored—let’s call him Josh. I asked a friend who worked closely with the char­ity why Josh was the hon­oree, and he ex­plained that the year be­fore, they had hon­ored Josh’s long­time ri­val, Greg, who had raised an all-time-record amount of money. They fig­ured if they hon­ored Josh, his lizard-brain com­pet­i­tive in­stinct would kick in, and he would try to outdo his ri­val. “Did it work?” I asked. My friend laughed and said that when they called Josh, be­fore they could even get all the way through the re­quest, he barked, “How much did Greg raise last year?!” He promptly ac­cepted the honor and set out to raise more. Which he did.

Now, in terms of mo­ti­va­tions to raise money for char­ity, “Van­quish my ri­vals and es­tab­lish al­pha male su­pe­ri­or­ity in Hol­ly­wood” is… not ideal. That’s prob­a­bly pretty low on Mai­monides’s list, it cer­tainly fails Kant’s test, and it’s ver­rrrrrrry far away from a Bud­dhist state of mind­ful­ness. But also, I think: Who cares? Josh raised mil­lions of dol­lars for a good cause, and if his ego was in­flated as a by-prod­uct, so be it. Char­i­ta­ble giv­ing in the mod­ern world is a num­bers game—there are bil­lions in need, and money is con­cen­trated in the hands of very few. And when we’re talk­ing num­bers games, util­i­tar­i­an­ism has a mas­sive leg up on ev­ery other eth­i­cal the­ory. If ig­nor­ing ev­ery­thing (within rea­son) ex­cept the re­sults—the to­tal money raised—gets the world to be­come a more eq­ui­table place, that’s fine with me.

Now, a lot of ethi­cists will scoff at this. “Scoff!” they’ll say. The whole point of ethics is to draw lines of dis­tinc­tion be­tween bet­ter and worse kinds of ac­tions, and if you ig­nore the rea­sons peo­ple do things, you’re not re­ally even “do­ing ethics.” So let’s draw a dis­tinc­tion here: when it comes to char­i­ta­ble giv­ing, I’m just less con­cerned with peo­ple’s mo­ti­va­tions for giv­ing than I am with _how we judge those peo­ple_. And to those scoff­ing ethi­cists, I of­fer as philo­soph­i­cal backup to my view: the writ­ings of William James.

### A Philo­soph­i­cal Jam­bal­aya

James (1842–1910) was a sort of nine­teenth-cen­tury Aris­to­tle—he wrote about psy­chol­ogy, phi­los­o­phy, ed­u­ca­tion, re­li­gion, and a bunch of other stuff. He’s some­times called the “Fa­ther of Mod­ern Psy­chol­ogy,” which is a very cool thing to be called, and there’s a huge build­ing named af­ter him at Har­vard that he didn’t even have to pay for. Do you know how im­pres­sive and aca­dem­i­cally in­flu­en­tial you have to be to get a Har­vard build­ing named af­ter you with­out do­nat­ing a ton of money?[^6] James’s main philo­soph­i­cal con­tri­bu­tion is in the the­ory known as prag­ma­tism. In a se­ries of lec­tures from 1906, he de­scribes it as “a method of set­tling meta­phys­i­cal dis­putes that oth­er­wise might be in­ter­minable,” and man oh man, does _that_ seem like it could be use­ful to us.

The anec­dote he uses to be­gin his lec­tures in­volves an ar­gu­ment his friends were hav­ing about a squir­rel on a tree. A per­son on the other side of the tree keeps run­ning around it, try­ing to see the squir­rel, but the squir­rel is too fast and keeps scram­bling around in the same di­rec­tion, so the tree is al­ways be­tween the squir­rel and the would-be squir­rel-seer. The ques­tion is, did the per­son “go around” the squir­rel?[^7] James’s response: It de­pends on what you mean by “go around.” If you mean “the per­son was at var­i­ous points lo­cated to the north, east, south, and west of the squir­rel,” then yes, of course he “went around the squir­rel.” But if you mean “was the per­son in front of the squir­rel, then to one side, then be­hind it, then to the other side,” then no, the per­son didn’t “go around the squir­rel,” be­cause the squir­rel al­ways kept his belly pointed to­ward the per­son (with the tree be­tween them). The larger point James makes here is: _What dif­fer­ence does it make?_ We can ac­cu­rately de­scribe the event, the re­sults of ei­ther ex­pla­na­tion are the same in terms of what oc­curred, so the rest is just se­man­tics. That’s what prag­ma­tism asks:

> What dif­fer­ence would it prac­ti­cally make to any one [_sic_] if this no­tion rather than that no­tion were true? If no prac­ti­cal dif­fer­ence what­ever can be traced, then the al­ter­na­tives mean prac­ti­cally the same thing, and all dis­pute is idle. When­ever a dis­pute is se­ri­ous, we ought to be able to show some prac­ti­cal dif­fer­ence that must fol­low from one side or the other’s be­ing right.

James’s prag­ma­tism “look[s] away from first things, prin­ci­ples, ‘cat­e­gories,’ sup­posed ne­ces­si­ties” and to­ward “last things, fruits, con­se­quences, facts.” It’s sim­ply con­cerned with truth and uses ev­ery method at its dis­posal to find it. The metaphor James uses for prag­ma­tism is a “cor­ri­dor in a ho­tel,” with a lot of doors branch­ing off it. Be­hind one door is a re­li­gious man; be­hind the next is an athe­is­tic woman; then a chemist, a math­e­ma­ti­cian, an ethi­cist, and so on—each one of­fer­ing a pos­si­ble way to ar­rive at some kind of fact that we can rely on. The prag­ma­tist can, at any mo­ment, open any of those doors and use what she finds to ar­rive at truth. It’s the jam­bal­aya of phi­los­o­phy.

So we can see the point here, right? In the case of the poorly in­ten­tioned char­ity hon­oree, we can wan­der down the cor­ri­dor and hear a lot of yelling from be­hind the doors: _The method he used to raise money was not based on a uni­ver­sal maxim! It doesn’t rep­re­sent a golden mean of gen­eros­ity! It doesn’t at­tain Mai­monides’s ideals! It’s not mind­ful!_[^8] We lis­ten to all of these protes­ta­tions, take them in, con­sider them… and then we hear a util­i­tar­ian say: _But… his lit­tle ego trip did max­i­mize the amount that was do­nated, with­out caus­ing any tan­gi­ble harm._ And, to the prag­ma­tist, this in­dis­putable fact would prob­a­bly out­weigh all those other opin­ions. So, while prag­ma­tism isn’t it­self “util­i­tar­ian,” in this case it may em­ploy util­i­tar­ian think­ing to get to an an­swer that seems best—just as it might align with Kant or Aris­to­tle in some other in­stance.

Now, there’s a trap here that we need to rec­og­nize and side­step. Re­mem­ber ear­lier when I said that I was fine ig­nor­ing ev­ery­thing “within rea­son” ex­cept the good re­sult (that the do­na­tions were max­i­mized)? That par­en­thet­i­cal “within rea­son” is do­ing a _lot_ of work. It’s easy to think of a sit­u­a­tion where the mo­ti­va­tion for char­i­ta­ble giv­ing would _not_ be ig­nor­able, and a prag­ma­tist would con­clude that there _is_ a prac­ti­cal dif­fer­ence be­tween two dif­fer­ent sorts of do­na­tions. Maybe some­one do­nates to char­ity be­cause he’s a crim­i­nal, and uses the foun­da­tion to laun­der money, or to achieve so­cial sta­tus that cloaks his crim­i­nal ac­tiv­i­ties. Think of no­to­ri­ous sex traf­ficker, pe­dophile, and all-around night­mare per­son Jef­frey Ep­stein—he do­nated tons of money to dozens of causes as a way to main­tain ac­cess to in­flu­en­tial peo­ple and power-wash his rep­u­ta­tion. So if we’re talk­ing about Jef­frey Ep­stein, well, yeah—now there’s a def­i­nite “prac­ti­cal dif­fer­ence” be­tween his do­na­tion and that of some­one who’s less, you know, hor­ri­fy­ing. But the case of the ego­tis­ti­cal Hol­ly­wood mogul con­tains no crim­i­nal ac­tiv­ity (that we know of), no harm to an­other per­son… _no real prac­ti­cal dif­fer­ence_ in how the money got to those in need. The guy and the squir­rel both ran around the tree—who cares how we de­scribe it?

James called prag­ma­tism “a me­di­a­tor and rec­on­ciler” that—and I love this phrase—“ ‘un­stiff­ens’ our the­o­ries.” Prag­ma­tism, has, in fact, “no prej­u­dices what­ever, no ob­struc­tive dog­mas, no rigid canons of what shall count as proof. She is com­pletely ge­nial. She will en­ter­tain any hy­poth­e­sis, she will con­sider any ev­i­dence”—as long as its rea­son­ing is teth­ered to the right facts. In this case, the fact is: more money was raised for peo­ple in need than might have been oth­er­wise be­cause of an ego­tis­ti­cal guy’s ego, and no rec­og­niz­able harm came to any­one else be­cause of that fact. So be it.

It should be noted that Thich Nhat Hanh would prob­a­bly dis­agree with James (and me) here, be­cause he cares more about the per­son do­ing the thing than what hap­pened when he did it. The Bud­dhist view of hap­pi­ness re­quires that it be the _right_ hap­pi­ness—the mind­ful hap­pi­ness that comes from de­vo­tion to the Bud­dha’s teach­ings. As Hanh says,

> Ev­ery­one wants to be happy, and there is a strong en­ergy in us push­ing to­ward what we think will make us happy. But we may suf­fer a lot be­cause of this. We need the in­sight that po­si­tion, re­venge, wealth, fame, or pos­ses­sions are, more of­ten than not, ob­sta­cles to our hap­pi­ness.

We have fo­cused mostly on the re­sults of char­i­ta­ble giv­ing (or tip­ping), and we ended up in a prag­matic/util­i­tar­ian con­clu­sion that if good is max­i­mized, mo­ti­va­tion of the giver is sec­ondary. But much like Kant, Hanh wants us to think about the act it­self. If we give money to char­ity for _our own_ hap­pi­ness—if the goal is to be show­ered with praise and ad­mi­ra­tion—we are vi­o­lat­ing both Kant’s uni­ver­sal maxim and Hanh’s (or Bud­dha’s) view of what brings us _ac­tual_ hap­pi­ness in­stead of a false equiv­a­lent. The mind­ful ac­tion—the do­ing of a thing with no in­ten­tion but to do it—pro­vides greater calm and joy. Hanh would not have felt sat­is­fied watch­ing that Hol­ly­wood fundraiser un­fold, be­cause de­spite all of the money that was flow­ing to those who needed it, he would have thought the hon­oree to be a deeply un­happy per­son. Also the meal was flank steak and Hanh is a veg­e­tar­ian, so that would’ve bummed him out too.

Per­haps a prag­ma­tist wouldn’t care one way or the other whether we pat our­selves on the back af­ter do­ing some­thing good—self-ag­gran­dize­ment is less an eth­i­cal is­sue than a “good taste, bad taste” one—but Im­manuel Kant would, and Thich Nhat Hanh would (for a dif­fer­ent rea­son), and it’s not hard to imag­ine a bad mo­ti­va­tion for a good act caus­ing us ac­tual moral trou­ble at some point. We may start to see the ex­ter­nal “re­wards” for good deeds as more de­sir­able than the acts them­selves, which might then lead to us do­ing things just for clicks and likes and faves and flat­ter­ing in­ter­views. That’s what plagues the char­ac­ter Tahani Al-Jamil in _The Good Place_—her de­sire for fame and at­ten­tion over­whelms her, tak­ing her to some dark places as a re­sult. (She was so jeal­ous of her more fa­mous, more suc­cess­ful sis­ter Kami­lah, she lit­er­ally died af­ter top­pling a statue of Kami­lah, which crushed her.) Al­though I’m ar­gu­ing for some prag­ma­tism here, we prob­a­bly don’t want to stray too far away from a mind­ful life of good and pure in­ten­tions. At the far end of the spec­trum, way past “do­nat­ing so we can brag about it on Twit­ter,” we find some truly harm­ful acts of fake al­tru­ism done for bad rea­sons—wealthy peo­ple giv­ing money to a uni­ver­sity in or­der to buy a spot for an un­de­serv­ing child, or the Sack­ler fam­ily do­nat­ing to mu­se­ums in an at­tempt to white­wash their shame­ful his­tory of ad­dic­tive-pre­scrip­tion-drug ped­dling. Those aren’t moral acts by any­one’s def­i­ni­tion.

Prag­ma­tism asks us to be moral ref­er­ees, watch­ing the ac­tion un­fold and de­ter­min­ing whether there is any dif­fer­ence be­tween one out­come and an­other—and thus whether the dis­pute is idle or mean­ing­ful. Of course, if we’re play­ing ref­eree, a new ques­tion arises: When do we blow the whis­tle? If some­one does some­thing bad, some­thing that we be­lieve has a tan­gi­bly neg­a­tive ef­fect on the world, should we say so? When, if ever, should we not only de­ter­mine that some­one is act­ing im­morally, but ac­tu­ally call them on it?

Well, let me tell you about the time my wife bumped into a guy’s car at 1 mph and our whole life was turned up­side down.

1. [^1] Con­fus­ingly, the “desert” here isn’t the dry, sandy place where camels roam around; nor is it dessert, like ice cream, though that’s how it’s pro­nounced. It’s et­y­mo­log­i­cally linked to the con­cept of _de­serv­ing_ some­thing. I do X, so I _de­serve_ Y. The “ice cream” ver­sion also kind of works, in the sense of: “If you fin­ish your green beans you get dessert,” but that’s not ac­tu­ally where the philo­soph­i­cal term comes from. One no­table book on the sub­ject is Shelly Ka­gan’s _The Ge­om­e­try of Desert_, which sounds like a book writ­ten by a cool math teacher who uses stacks of Oreos to teach you about cylin­ders.
2. [^2] Thich Nhat Hanh also wrote the pas­sage that in­spired the metaphor for death that Chidi gives Eleanor in the se­ries fi­nale of _The Good Place_. He de­scribes a per­son’s life as anal­o­gous to a wave form­ing—with spe­cific di­men­sions and prop­er­ties and qual­i­ties—and then re­turn­ing to the ocean whence it came. The wa­ter is the con­stant—the wave is just a dif­fer­ent way for the wa­ter to be, for some amount of time, so when it ceases to be a wave and re­turns to the ocean, we should be happy, not sad. It’s beau­ti­ful and peace­ful and makes me cry a lit­tle ev­ery time I think about it.
3. [^3] The Sto­ics were a group of an­cient Greek, Ro­man, and Syr­ian philoso­phers who wor­shipped Socrates and at­tempted to free peo­ple from what Rus­sell calls “mun­dane de­sires” (like the de­sire for ma­te­rial pos­ses­sions) in or­der to achieve greater free­dom. I men­tion this only be­cause I am us­ing the word “stoic” here in the dic­tio­nary sense, mean­ing “in­dif­fer­ent to plea­sure or pain,” but any­one read­ing this who knows a lot about phi­los­o­phy might see the word “stoic” ap­plied to Kant and im­me­di­ately be­gin a lengthy refu­ta­tion of the en­tire book based on my flawed un­der­stand­ing of the cap­i­tal-_S_ Sto­ics. Al­though now that I’m reread­ing Rus­sell’s sec­tion on the Sto­ics I see that he says Kant “re­sem­bles them,” so I take this all back; I meant it as a sly lit­tle phi­los­o­phy ref­er­ence be­cause I’m su­per smart and well-versed in this topic.
4. [^4] Though again, “propin­quity” mat­tered to Ben­tham, so the faster the barista sees the tip, the bet­ter. More on this in a sec­ond…
5. [^5] Im­por­tant to note the role that con­text plays in sit­u­a­tions like this. I’m a well-paid TV com­edy writer, mar­ried to an­other well-paid TV com­edy writer, so for me, twenty-seven cents is a bum­mer of a tip. Some­one in a dif­fer­ent so­cioe­co­nomic po­si­tion might be quite gen­er­ous in tip­ping that amount. We’ll deal with this fur­ther in chap­ter 12.
6. [^6] Ex­tremely.
7. [^7] Brief aside that may be of in­ter­est only to me: What James de­scribes here is nearly pre­cisely the way in which Earth and its moon re­late to each other. The moon slowly ro­tates as it re­volves around Earth, and thus the same side of the moon is al­ways fac­ing us. Hence “dark side of the moon”—that’s the side we never see. I’m a bit sur­prised that James uses the squir­rel and the tree in­stead of the moon and Earth, be­cause James’s whole phi­los­o­phy is in­ex­orably and sort of beau­ti­fully tied to sci­ence and seis­mic changes in sci­en­tific the­ory. There’s a cool his­tor­i­cal thing go­ing on here, where James is speak­ing in the im­me­di­ate af­ter­math of a mas­sive shift in the way peo­ple un­der­stood the uni­verse. The year pre­ced­ing these lec­tures, 1905, is some­times called Al­bert Ein­stein’s _an­nus mirabilis_—“year of mir­a­cles”—be­cause the pa­pers he pub­lished on spe­cial rel­a­tiv­ity and the par­ti­cle the­ory of light blew the world of physics to smithereens, and all sci­en­tists ev­ery­where had to ba­si­cally start from scratch. Imag­ine how hard it would be, in­tel­lec­tu­ally and emo­tion­ally, to have based your en­tire world­view on a set of seem­ingly prov­able the­o­ries, and then one day find out that they were _all wrong_. Imag­ine be­ing a sixty-eight-year-old physi­cist in 1906, hav­ing to sud­denly junk all the lec­tures you’ve been giv­ing for four decades. Oof. So here comes William James, philoso­pher and (not in­con­se­quen­tially, I think) psy­chol­o­gist, who ex­plic­itly de­signs a the­ory that can help move peo­ple away from old, in­fe­rior ways of think­ing and to­ward new and bet­ter ones. He writes about the process of form­ing new opin­ions, how “a new ex­pe­ri­ence puts them to a strain,” caus­ing an “in­ward trou­ble… from which he seeks to es­cape by mod­i­fy­ing his pre­vi­ous mass of opin­ions.” Against a back­drop of re­cent sci­en­tific break­throughs, he’s ad­dress­ing the flex­i­bil­ity we need to ab­sorb new truths, and not to re­ject them on the ba­sis of a pre­vi­ous truth we be­lieved in but that is no longer rel­e­vant or even ac­cu­rate. (We’ll deal with this a lot more in a later chap­ter.) The point of all of this is, I wish he used the moon ro­tat­ing and re­volv­ing around the Earth in­stead of the squir­rel thing, be­cause I think em­ploy­ing a sci­en­tific anal­ogy would be a bet­ter the­matic link to the point he is try­ing to make. Coun­ter­point: it’s kind of cute, imag­in­ing that lit­tle squir­rel scam­per­ing around the tree. So. Ei­ther way works, I guess.
8. [^8] I’m en­joy­ing imag­in­ing the ex­tremely peace­ful Thich Nhat Hanh be­hind one of these doors, just ab­so­lutely scream­ing this at the top of his lungs.

    

## CHAP­TER SEVEN Yes, I Bumped into Your Car. But Do You Even _Care_ About Hur­ri­cane Ka­t­rina?!

In 2005, J.J. (then my fi­ancée) bumped into a guy in very slow-mov­ing traf­fic. A nearby po­lice of­fi­cer looked ev­ery­thing over and said he didn’t see any dam­age. None­the­less, they ex­changed in­for­ma­tion and went on their way. A few days later, we re­ceived a claim for $836. The en­tire fender, said the man, needed to be re­placed.

It’s im­por­tant to note that this took place dur­ing Hur­ri­cane Ka­t­rina. New Or­leans was lit­er­ally un­der­wa­ter, and I—like ev­ery­one else in Amer­ica—watched in hor­ror as thou­sands of peo­ple’s lives were de­stroyed and a great city nearly dis­ap­peared for­ever. A friend of mine who’d grown up there had just lost his fa­ther; very soon af­ter the fu­neral, which was dif­fi­cult enough, their fam­ily home was badly dam­aged.[^1] Just aw­ful, in ev­ery di­rec­tion. In the midst of that tur­moil, I went and ex­am­ined this man’s car, and if I strained _very_ hard, I could _barely_ dis­cern a six-inch pen­cil-line crease along his rear bumper. In a fit of pique, I told him that al­though we didn’t dis­pute the events that led to this tragic dis­fig­ure­ment of the rear bumper of his Saab sedan, I found it ab­surd that this blem­ish was worth $836. I told him that things like this were why car in­sur­ance in Los An­ge­les is so ex­pen­sive. And I made him an of­fer: I would do­nate $836 to the Red Cross’s Ka­t­rina re­lief ef­forts in his name, and he would go on liv­ing with dam­age to his rear bumper so min­i­mal you needed a high-pow­ered mi­cro­scope to no­tice it. He said he’d think it over.

Con­vinced that I com­manded the moral high ground, I an­grily shared this story with my friends and co­work­ers, and the snow­ball started rolling down the hill very quickly. Many of them joined my cause—they started pledg­ing more and more money to the Red Cross if this guy would agree not to fix his bumper. (The guy, it should be noted, was un­aware any of this was hap­pen­ing.) Soon I had prom­ises of $2,000… $5,000… In less than forty-eight hours, thanks to the early days of in­ter­net vi­ral­ity, hun­dreds of peo­ple had pledged up­ward of $20,000 if this un­sus­pect­ing Saab driver would agree not to fix his car. I started a blog to keep track of all of it and posted reg­u­lar up­dates. I got me­dia in­quiries from sev­eral ma­jor news out­lets. I had dreams of res­cu­ing New Or­leans all by my­self, armed with noth­ing but a key­board and a bril­liant mas­ter­stroke of moral rea­son­ing.

And then I started to feel sick.

So did J.J.—and at ex­actly the same mo­ment. We were ex­cit­edly dis­cussing the most re­cent events, and pledges, and me­dia re­quests, and we looked at each other and in­stantly read on each other’s faces the same queasy feel­ing: there was some­thing very _wrong_ about what we were do­ing… though we couldn’t pin­point what it was. The lit­tle voices in our heads were chirp­ing at us, and we fi­nally started lis­ten­ing to them. If I’m car­bon-dat­ing my own per­sonal jour­ney through moral phi­los­o­phy, I’d mark that con­ver­sa­tion, late at night on the front stoop of our first jointly rented house in Los An­ge­les, as the point of ori­gin.

Hav­ing no bet­ter idea of what to do, I started read­ing ar­ti­cles and sec­tions of books on ethics. I cold-called phi­los­o­phy pro­fes­sors, many of whom were kind enough to talk it through with me. (Philoso­phers, it turns out, _re­ally_ en­joy talk­ing about phi­los­o­phy.) I might have wanted a de­fin­i­tive take on whether what I was do­ing was eth­i­cal, but as these things usu­ally go in phi­los­o­phy, the peo­ple I con­sulted gave me a wide range of an­swers. Pub­licly de­cry­ing this man’s be­hav­ior might be _good_, be­cause it could call at­ten­tion to more im­por­tant mat­ters and ef­fect change. No: pub­licly de­cry­ing his be­hav­ior was _bad_, be­cause it was un­fair to force him to choose be­tween some­thing right­fully owed to him and a so­ci­etal good that has noth­ing to do with the ac­ci­dent. One pro­fes­sor scoffed at the idea that this was even a moral ques­tion—he just said I was be­ing kind of a jerk to the guy, and you don’t need moral phi­los­o­phy to tell you not to be a jerk. Fair enough.

Though these con­ver­sa­tions led to con­tra­dic­tory con­clu­sions, they also helped me see that there was an ac­tual philo­soph­i­cal ex­pla­na­tion for why we felt queasy: I was _sham­ing_ this guy. Nam­ing what was prob­lem­atic about my ac­tions both pro­vided some re­lief and caused some new pain. It was like sens­ing that some­thing is wrong in your ab­domen, and then hav­ing a doc­tor tell you your ap­pen­dix has burst—a real good news (you were right!) bad news (go to the hos­pi­tal!) sit­u­a­tion. The moral reper­cus­sions were com­pli­cated and hard to parse. But gen­er­ally speak­ing: J.J. _did_ bump into him, and al­though $836 is a crazy amount of money to re­place a fender, he didn’t set that price, so he hadn’t re­ally done any­thing wrong. What­ever nu­ances and shad­ings and com­plex­i­ties needed to be teased out, I clung to that as a base­line to guide my­self: sham­ing some­one when he did noth­ing wrong (or, at least, sham­ing him to a de­gree far out of pro­por­tion with his ac­tion) felt like a bad thing to do.

So ul­ti­mately, I bit the bul­let and called the guy. I told him ev­ery­thing that had hap­pened, copped to my mis­takes, and apol­o­gized. I also let him know I had al­ready cut him a check, which was en route. He was pleas­ant and for­giv­ing, and said he might give some of the money to the Red Cross. Then I wrote a note to all of the peo­ple who had pledged money and asked them to do­nate any­way, be­cause giv­ing money to hur­ri­cane vic­tims is a good thing to do. Peo­ple gen­er­ally (but not unan­i­mously) felt like this was a happy out­come, and at the end of the saga, more than $27,000 went to Ka­t­rina vic­tims.

But don’t cel­e­brate this util­i­tar­ian vic­tory just yet. Much like those goof­ball teach­ers and their dumb marsh­mal­low ex­per­i­ment, this has the dis­tinct feel­ing of a good re­sult from a bad ac­tion.

### Fine, I Screwed Up. But What About All the Times _You_ Screwed Up?!

Some­thing I’d never pon­dered be­fore my wife creased that guy’s bumper was the dif­fer­ence be­tween shame and guilt. In its most ba­sic form, guilt is the in­ter­nal feel­ing that we have done some­thing wrong—it’s our own icky, pri­vate sense of per­sonal fail­ure. Shame is hu­mil­i­a­tion for _who we are_, re­flected back at us through other peo­ple judg­ing us from the out­side. (In a mem­o­rable scene from _Game of Thrones_, the di­a­bol­i­cal char­ac­ter Cer­sei, af­ter a life­time of un­pleas­ant me­dieval roy­alty–type ac­tions, is forced to walk naked through the streets while peo­ple yell, “Shame! Shame!” at her. Thanks to her many pri­vate mono­logues, view­ers know that she feels ex­actly zero _guilt_ about her many trans­gres­sive ac­tions, and af­ter her lit­eral walk of shame ends, she sets about de­stroy­ing ev­ery­one who has wronged her.) I was sham­ing the Saab driver for what I saw as his mis­aligned value sys­tem—how can you pos­si­bly care about this crease on your bumper when New Or­leans is drown­ing?! Then I in­vited ev­ery­one to shine a spot­light on him and judge him for his choice. What made J.J. and me feel icky was guilt stem­ming from our be­hav­ior (re­ally, mostly _my_ be­hav­ior)—the nag­ging in­ter­nal feel­ing that we were do­ing some­thing wrong, even if we couldn’t put a name to what it was.

We can cer­tainly imag­ine sit­u­a­tions that call for shame to be de­ployed. A daily pe­rusal of Amer­i­can news­pa­pers re­veals dozens of shame-wor­thy ac­tiv­i­ties: cor­rup­tion, ram­pant hypocrisy, us­ing power for per­sonal en­rich­ment, dere­lic­tion of duty, racism, dis­hon­esty—and that’s just Ted Cruz![2](ch07.xhtml#footnote-075) We in­stinc­tively feel that sham­ing peo­ple for their mis­deeds serves an im­por­tant pur­pose: to make those bad peo­ple feel bad for the bad things they did, or at least to make _good_ peo­ple re­al­ize that the peo­ple who did the bad things are bad. But in or­der for shame to work as a moral de­ter­rent, there has to be a causal link be­tween the thing they did and the shame we in­tend them to feel. In the case of the Saab bumper, there… wasn’t. The creas­ing of his bumper had jack squat to do with Hur­ri­cane Ka­t­rina, ex­cept that the two events oc­curred at the same time. Is the de­struc­tion of a city more im­por­tant than a crease on a bumper? Of course. No one in the world would dis­agree.[^3],[^4] But the prob­lem with what I did—well, _one_ of the prob­lems; there were sev­eral—is that it’s sim­ply not fair to launch that sort of ran­dom moral at­tack. There will al­most _al­ways_ be some­thing more im­por­tant go­ing on in the world than what­ever it is two peo­ple are beef­ing about. Let’s say we bor­row fifty dol­lars from our sis­ter and agree to pay it back in a week. If she comes back a week later and asks for her money, we could sim­ply glance at the news, find an un­fold­ing calamity, and say, “How dare you ask me for the money when chil­dren are starv­ing in South Su­dan!” Sham­ing some­one for car­ing about Thing X when un­re­lated Thing Y is far more dire just doesn’t hold wa­ter. The com­mon mod­ern-day term for this is “whataboutism.”

Whataboutism is most com­monly de­ployed as a de­fen­sive strat­egy. Some­one is caught do­ing some­thing bad—any­thing from an ac­tual crime to say­ing some­thing mildly of­fen­sive on the in­ter­net—and then in­stead of own­ing up to it, he says, “Well, what about [Way Worse Thing X]?!” or “What about that bad thing _you_ did?!”[^5] or “What about the fact that I also did [Good Thing Y]?” It’s a way to throw sand in the eyes of the peo­ple mak­ing the charge, blind­ing them mo­men­tar­ily and giv­ing the ac­cused a chance to wrig­gle free. Nearly all whataboutisms are in­de­fen­si­ble, be­cause by def­i­ni­tion they fail to ad­dress the moral short­com­ing the bad ac­tor has ex­hib­ited. Let’s say Tim makes a misog­y­nis­tic joke. His friend Joe calls him on it and says Tim should be ashamed of what he said. Then Tim re­sponds, “Oh, like you’re so per­fect? You once stole an al­paca from a pet­ting zoo!” Even if this is true, it has noth­ing to do with Tim’s be­hav­ior. Tim is us­ing a moral wrong com­mit­ted by his ac­cuser to in­sin­u­ate that his ac­cuser’s charge has no merit or is com­pro­mised. Which is stupid. Two things can be true: Joe shouldn’t have stolen that al­paca, and also Tim’s com­ment was misog­y­nis­tic. And most im­por­tantly, the fact that Joe once stole an al­paca does not mean he for­feits the abil­ity to point out that Tim said some­thing of­fen­sive.

Here’s an­other va­ri­etal: In the af­ter­math of 9/11, a con­tro­versy arose over the pro­posal to build a mosque near the Ground Zero site in New York. A com­mon re­frain among those op­posed was _We’ll build a mosque at Ground Zero when they build a syn­a­gogue in Saudi Ara­bia!_ Which leads one to ask: Why would the Amer­i­can peo­ple base _any_ de­ci­sion on what Saudi Ara­bia does, given their… let’s call it “iffy” record on hu­man rights? When it comes to re­li­gious lib­erty, shouldn’t the U.S. be aim­ing _con­sid­er­ably higher_ than Saudi Ara­bia? It was a flatly disin­gen­u­ous ar­gu­ment, link­ing one coun­try’s ac­tions to an­other’s for no good rea­son. Any par­ent will surely rec­og­nize this strat­egy—we tell our kids to stop watch­ing TV, and they fire back that Madi­son’s par­ents let her watch TV fif­teen hours a day! Well, we re­spond, Madi­son is a dis­as­ter, and her par­ents got so drunk at the school fundraiser that at the end of the night they had to be fire­man-car­ried to an Uber. (We don’t say this, re­ally, though we want to—we just say, “You’re not Madi­son, and we’re not her par­ents.”) “Some­body else did some­thing bad, so _we_ should be able to do some­thing bad” is a flimsy moral ar­gu­ment.

When we screw up, de­flect­ing at­ten­tion onto a com­pletely un­re­lated ac­tion ut­terly misses the point, which is: _that we screwed up_. De­spite their fun­da­men­tal dif­fer­ences, the philo­soph­i­cal the­o­ries we’ve dis­cussed all agree—on like a “this is so ob­vi­ous we shouldn’t have to say it” level—that each of us is re­spon­si­ble for our own ac­tions. They might dif­fer on the moral ac­count­ing we do once we’ve de­cided to act, but none of them sug­gests that our ac­tions should be judged based on _other peo­ple’s ac­tions_ that have noth­ing to do with ours. It’s plainly ob­vi­ous, and yet here we are, in the year 2022, sur­rounded by peo­ple who try to get away with stuff be­cause of other stuff that has noth­ing to do with their stuff. Which leads us all the way back to my own whataboutism—us­ing a hur­ri­cane to shame a guy who just wanted his damn car fixed.

### Any­one Want to De­fend Me Here?

The con­cept of pub­lic shame has been around at least since bib­li­cal times—peo­ple would be fas­tened in pil­lo­ries or stocks and rit­u­ally abused, screamed at, tick­led,[^6] what­ever—to pun­ish them for their sins and per­haps to vent some pu­ri­tan­i­cal re­venge en­ergy. The stocks fell out of fa­vor in the nine­teenth cen­tury, but have come roar­ing back in a new form: the so­cial me­dia “drag­ging” (as the kids say) that comes roar­ing through our de­vices ev­ery day, when some­one with even a mod­icum of fame does some­thing of­fen­sive. Now, it should be noted that the peo­ple be­ing dragged fre­quently de­serve what’s hap­pen­ing—the per­son in ques­tion has said or done some­thing bad, has been exposed, and is now pay­ing the price. There is pub­lic good here, with­out ques­tion—some aw­ful peo­ple have been called to the mat for their aw­ful be­hav­ior in a way they never could have been be­fore. In my opin­ion, the mod­ern sys­tem of rad­i­cal ex­po­sure has done more good than harm. But there’s a larger ques­tion here, which is whether shame is a pro­duc­tive way to achieve an eth­i­cal out­come. For one thing, when peo­ple are shamed, they may not want to change their be­hav­ior—of­ten, their de­fenses go up and they dig in their heels, which can have the op­po­site ef­fect that we want it to have.[^7] What we want, os­ten­si­bly, is for them to not only suf­fer con­se­quences for what they’ve done, but also _change_ their be­hav­ior go­ing for­ward. That’s hard for peo­ple to de­cide to do when they’re reel­ing back­ward and get­ting pub­licly pum­meled like a speed bag.

I had, in the early stages of my cru­sade, made a few good de­ci­sions—I didn’t pub­licly name the Saab owner, or pub­lish a photo of his li­cense plate. I re­mem­ber think­ing clearly that we shouldn’t do those things—maybe the lit­tle voice in my head man­aged to eke out those small vic­to­ries. (It’s im­pos­si­ble to know what the guy would have felt if we _had_ done that, but I imag­ine it would’ve been a cock­tail of anger and shame, and I sure don’t think that would’ve helped.) But I made sev­eral ter­ri­ble de­ci­sions too. So let’s con­duct a lit­tle de­brief on the Fender Fi­asco (or Saab Story?) through the lens of our three eth­i­cal schools of thought.

If I’m look­ing for a philo­soph­i­cal de­fense, my best bet is through con­se­quen­tial­ism. Af­ter all, I turned a mi­nor fender ben­der into a mas­sive re­dis­tri­bu­tion of wealth to peo­ple in tremen­dous need—what­ever sad­ness I caused the guy by sham­ing him, the in­crease in hap­pi­ness I cre­ated through pledged do­na­tions more than made up for it. How­ever, the con­se­quen­tial­ist would also have to in­clude in her tally the so­ci­etal dam­age of my ac­tions: ev­ery­one now has to live in a world where ev­ery mi­nor trans­ac­tion could re­sult in a pub­lic ref­er­en­dum on the im­por­tance of that trans­ac­tion. That doesn’t seem like a gen­er­ally happy so­ci­ety. Re­mem­ber Steve, the ESPN trans­former fixer? When we were try­ing to re­cal­cu­late and add the ex­tra pain caused by ev­ery­one now liv­ing in a world where they knew the same thing could hap­pen to them, we fig­ured it wouldn’t be _that much_ pain, re­ally, be­cause most peo­ple would know they’d never be in Steve’s po­si­tion, so they wouldn’t re­ally fear such a world. That’s not the case here. Most peo­ple would re­al­ize that they _will_ at some point find them­selves in a sit­u­a­tion where a mi­nor dis­pute could be­come gar­bled and de­railed due to some other, larger is­sue—_ev­ery­one_ has mi­nor dis­putes with other peo­ple, and there are _al­ways_ big­ger prob­lems un­fold­ing some­where else. This util­i­tar­ian “re­cal­cu­la­tion” isn’t nearly as hard to ex­e­cute—we have to add a ton of do­lors to the to­tal.

And how would a Kan­tian be dis­ap­pointed in me? Let us count the ways. I’m pretty sure that “we should force peo­ple in­volved in mi­nor traf­fic in­ci­dents to weigh the rel­a­tive im­por­tance of their car re­pair against the needs cre­ated by na­tional catas­tro­phes be­fore re­ceiv­ing resti­tu­tion” vi­o­lates the cat­e­gor­i­cal im­per­a­tive. Could we will that rule into ex­is­tence, to be used by ev­ery­one all the time? No. That way mad­ness lies. But the Kan­tian doesn’t stop there. She also cer­tainly says I vi­o­lated the sec­ond for­mu­la­tion of the im­per­a­tive, be­cause I used the guy as a means to any num­ber of ends: help­ing peo­ple who had noth­ing to do with the ac­ci­dent… mol­li­fy­ing my own anger at the treat­ment of New Or­leans hur­ri­cane vic­tims… mak­ing a state­ment about the ab­sur­di­ties of Los An­ge­les auto in­sur­ance. I mean, if you’re a Kan­tian and you want to find a way to crit­i­cize my be­hav­ior, the world’s your oys­ter. (I don’t even want to think about how a con­trac­tu­al­ist would re­act to what I did. T. M. Scan­lon would be so dis­ap­pointed in me if he ever heard this story. No one tell him.)

Aris­to­tle might ap­plaud me—in like a quiet, golf-clap sort of way—for the _af­ter­math_ of my ini­tial de­ci­sion, the part where I felt guilt over what I’d done. A per­son who’s _de­fi­cient_ in guilt may never change his be­hav­ior, be­com­ing cal­lous to the ef­fects of his ac­tions. A per­son who feels _ex­ces­sive_ guilt might de­velop low self-es­teem or be­come a recluse out of a fear of harm­ing oth­ers. Some­where in the mid­dle would be the mean—let’s call it “self-aware­ness.” So… good work, Mike, on the af­ter­math, in which a healthy dose of guilt pulled me away from my de­fi­ciency and back to­ward that mean. But what about the shame that I made the other guy feel for _his_ ac­tions? Will Aris­to­tle ap­plaud me for that too? Hope­fully?

No. No he will not.

Again, there may be some amount of shame we should make other peo­ple feel when they do some­thing bad. Shame has a func­tion in a healthy world, be­cause it gives us a weapon in the war against bad be­hav­ior. If peo­ple were in­ca­pable of feel­ing shame, they would do what­ever they wanted to with im­punity, never wor­ry­ing that their rep­u­ta­tions might suf­fer in the pub­lic square. The act of lightly sham­ing our fel­low cit­i­zens for un­vir­tu­ous ac­tions or be­liefs may there­fore be okay; this isn’t guess­work on my part—Aris­to­tle ac­tu­ally says that while shame is not a virtue, per se:

> The per­son ex­ces­sively prone to shame, who is ashamed about ev­ery­thing—is called ex­ces­sive; the per­son who is de­fi­cient in shame or never feels shame at all is said to have no sense of dis­grace.

But re­mem­ber how we de­scribed Aris­to­tle’s ap­proach to mild­ness—the golden mean rep­re­sents an _ap­pro­pri­ate_ amount of anger, di­rected only at _peo­ple who de­serve it._ That’s the key to my own blun­der re­gard­ing the Saab guy. He didn’t _de­serve_ the tor­nado of shame I whipped up and sent at him. I might take is­sue with how much he cared about his car, but by bring­ing Hur­ri­cane Ka­t­rina into the equa­tion—an en­tirely asym­met­ri­cal and un­re­lated dis­as­ter with mas­sive hu­man pain and suf­fer­ing at­tached to it—I oblit­er­ated the cal­cu­la­tion he and I were try­ing to make over how to han­dle the mi­nor ac­ci­dent. It was a mas­sively un­fair act, which ex­plains my sud­den feel­ing of guilt when it ex­ploded into the pub­lic sphere. Were he around to wit­ness all of this, I think Aris­to­tle would’ve said: “Dude. You _su­per_ blew this.”[^8]

If there’s some amount of guilt that might help us or shame that could be help­ful to other peo­ple, I’d wa­ger that the amount of guilt that can be help­ful is far higher than the shame. Guilt comes from reck­on­ing with our­selves, and we’re prob­a­bly more likely to pay at­ten­tion (and re­act well) to our own lit­tle voices, rather than other peo­ple’s. Some­times I won­der what would’ve hap­pened if in­stead of con­clud­ing on our own that we were screw­ing this up, J.J. and I had been yelled at by some­one else for what we were do­ing—if _we’d_ been shamed for the act of sham­ing some­one. (A meta-sham­ing!) Would we have re­sponded calmly and re­ex­am­ined our be­hav­ior? Or would we have dug in our heels and fought back, high­light­ing the money go­ing to char­ity and the ab­sur­dity of an $836 bumper crease? If we’d been called out and our de­fense mech­a­nisms had kicked in, I might be writ­ing a very dif­fer­ent book right now, called some­thing like _How to Be the Ul­ti­mate Judge of Ev­ery­one Else’s Ac­tions with #NoRe­grets_.

The prob­lem, of course, is that we can’t al­ways count on our lit­tle voices to cre­ate the feel­ing of guilt that made J.J. and me course-cor­rect so dra­mat­i­cally—es­pe­cially when the thing that’s hap­pen­ing is nu­anced and com­pli­cated and messy. Look­ing back, I think that what helped us the most wasn’t any­thing philo­soph­i­cal or the­o­ret­i­cal. J.J. and I re­al­ized we were screw­ing up be­cause we were _talk­ing about it_. The sim­ple act of speak­ing out loud about what we were do­ing led us to con­clude that what we were do­ing was prob­lem­atic.[^9] At the time, of course, we had no real un­der­stand­ing of moral ac­count­ing—at the risk of sound­ing like a bad rom-com movie trailer: we only had each other.[^10] When we’re try­ing to be­come bet­ter peo­ple, we should re­mem­ber how pow­er­ful the sim­ple act of con­ver­sa­tion can be, to help us nav­i­gate these choppy wa­ters.

Re­vis­it­ing the in­ci­dent, I also bet­ter un­der­stand the true power of Ju­lia An­nas’s quote: “The re­sult [of prac­tic­ing some­thing] is a speed and di­rect­ness of re­sponse com­pa­ra­ble to that of mere habit, but un­like it in that the lessons learned have in­formed it and ren­dered it flex­i­ble and in­no­va­tive.” Now we get it, right? I blun­dered into a sit­u­a­tion I did not un­der­stand, thanks to a com­bi­na­tion of not hav­ing ever stud­ied phi­los­o­phy be­fore and how straight-up weird the sit­u­a­tion was. In a flash, we were wrestling with is­sues of le­gal ethics, car in­sur­ance rates, duty, re­spon­si­bil­ity, hur­ri­canes, shame, guilt, and the eco­nom­ics of fender re­pair in late-model Saab sedans. Who could pos­si­bly know ex­actly what to do in that mo­ment? Well… maybe some­one who is so prac­ticed at var­i­ous virtues that she can ap­proach new and thorny sit­u­a­tions calmly and knowl­edge­ably. J.J. and I might have saved our­selves a lot of guilt—and spared oth­ers a lot of shame—if we’d al­ready put in the time to­ward cul­ti­vat­ing virtue, to the point where we were flex­i­ble and in­no­va­tive. (Or maybe we still would’ve blown it. But we would’ve had a bet­ter shot at get­ting it right.)

At the end of the day, that fender ben­der did a lot of good. For one thing, it kicked off my per­sonal in­ter­est in moral phi­los­o­phy. It raised a bunch of money for char­ity, which the util­i­tar­i­ans among us will ap­plaud. It forced me to reckon with my own ac­tions and apol­o­gize, a thing I think we should all do a lot more of­ten. (More on this in chap­ter 13.) I re­mem­ber think­ing that my life had in some big, messy way… _im­proved_. I was a bet­ter per­son on the other side of the whole thing.

That’s a good feel­ing—that we’re a lit­tle bet­ter to­day than we were yes­ter­day. It buoys us, sends us about our day with a smile and a lit­tle wind in our sails. So what if, feel­ing those lovely feel­ings, we de­cide to go knock off some er­rands we’ve been ig­nor­ing, head to the gro­cery store, and af­ter re­turn­ing a few stray carts in the park­ing lot to the rack on our way in (that’s right, that’s how good we are now—we’re re­turn­ing _other peo­ple’s carts_), we see a plate of free cheese sam­ples with a sign that says LIMIT ONE PER CUS­TOMER. And man oh man, if it isn’t smoked gouda—our fa­vorite cheese. So even though it clearly says LIMIT ONE PER CUS­TOMER, a thought oc­curs to us:

“I’m a good per­son. There’s a higher bal­ance in my moral bank ac­count than there was just a week ago. I’ve _earned_ the right to break this lit­tle rule. I’m gonna take _three_ pieces of smoked gouda from this tray, in­stead of one.”

That’s okay, right?

7.

When they met she was mar­ried with two chil­dren, but they de­vel­oped a close friend­ship, and twenty years later Har­riet’s hus­band passed away. She and Mill were mar­ried soon af­ter, and Mill cred­ited her with in­flu­enc­ing and im­prov­ing his writ­ing (she was a writer as well). I guess what I’m say­ing is, J.J. and I are like the Har­riet Tay­lor and J. S. Mill of our time. Ex­cept, ob­vi­ously, our con­tri­bu­tions to phi­los­o­phy will be far more im­por­tant.

    

## CHAP­TER EIGHT We’ve Done Some Good Deeds, and Given a Bunch of Money to Char­ity, and We’re Gen­er­ally Re­ally Nice and Morally Up­stand­ing Peo­ple, So Can We Take Three of These Free Cheese Sam­ples from the Free Cheese Sam­ple Plate at the Su­per­mar­ket Even Though It Clearly Says “One Per Cus­tomer”?

My dad used to have a the­ory. Af­ter my par­ents di­vorced, he got re­ally into live mu­sic (as forty-year-old bach­e­lors are wont to do) and started amass­ing an enor­mous CD col­lec­tion. He would buy two to four CDs, two to four times per week. He wasn’t ex­actly rich, and when I would com­ment on how much money he was spend­ing on mu­sic he would say some­thing like: “Think about it this way: I don’t like the band U2. They have like ten al­bums. I’m not go­ing to buy _any_ of their al­bums—which means I’ve _saved_ a hun­dred and fifty bucks, so the next hun­dred and fifty I spend on other CDs is es­sen­tially free!”

Now, he was kid­ding, ob­vi­ously, but it al­ways stuck with me as a fun fi­nan­cial loop­hole: imag­in­ing that we have some kind of “re­serve” of money built up, re­sult­ing from things we _didn’t_ buy, which we can then spend with­out con­se­quences.[^1] Some peo­ple hold a re­lated view of moral re­sponsibil­ity. They be­lieve that do­ing a bunch of good stuff gives them a kind of bank ac­count bal­ance of moral cur­rency, which they can then with­draw and “spend” if they want to do some­thing… not so great. Es­sen­tially: “I know I shouldn’t eat ham­burg­ers be­cause the beef in­dus­try is de­stroy­ing the en­vi­ron­ment. But, what­ever, I drive an elec­tric car. Fire up the grill!”

Our lives are filled with thou­sands of rules—in school, at work, in traf­fic, in so­ci­ety, at home—and at times, for one rea­son or an­other, we feel we’re al­lowed to break one. Maybe we think the rule is dumb or out­dated, or maybe we think of our­selves as good peo­ple whose other good deeds have earned us a free pass. No one—not even ex­ces­sively rule-fol­low­ing dorks like me—fol­lows _ev­ery_ rule. It’s im­pos­si­ble. But if we’re try­ing to be good peo­ple, we should know how to deal with the mo­ments when we ac­tively choose not to be.

### Moral Ex­haus­tion: The Most Im­por­tant Term You’ll Learn from This Book

Think­ing that our past good deeds give us an ex­cuse to oc­ca­sion­ally break rules (or make choices that con­tra­dict our gen­eral moral world­views) is an un­der­stand­able po­si­tion. I of­ten _hold_ that po­si­tion, and again, I’m a hard-core rules nerd. Re­cently, I re­al­ized I didn’t re­ally know any­thing about the bank I use for my check­ing ac­count. Out of cu­rios­ity, I poked around and read about the founders, the cur­rent CEO, and var­i­ous board mem­bers. My shock­ing con­clu­sion: they’re mon­sters. (At least, to me they are.) Their so­ciopo­lit­i­cal po­si­tions are cal­lous and bor­der­line cruel. They’ve do­nated mil­lions of dol­lars to politi­cians and causes I find repug­nant. In some cases, they ac­tively funded the peo­ple re­spon­si­ble for the sedi­tious in­sur­rec­tion at the Capi­tol on Jan­u­ary 6, 2021. They have pub­licly said things that if my chil­dren ever say will lead to ex­tremely un­pleas­ant Thanks­giv­ing din­ners. Well, okay, I thought, time to shift my check­ing ac­count to some other bank.

Then the re­al­ity of what that would mean be­gan to sink in.

First of all: _Ev­ery_ multi­na­tional bank is full of (in my eyes) mon­sters. A quick round of re­search about the equiv­a­lent peo­ple at other banks re­vealed that these dudes (and they’re ba­si­cally all dudes) are es­sen­tially in­ter­change­able. Was I re­ally go­ing to find an Amer­i­can bank CEO who sides with me on the need for cam­paign fi­nance re­form? Also, there is no rea­son­able al­ter­na­tive to keep­ing one’s money in a bank. We’re not re­ally liv­ing in a “hole in a mat­tress” world any­more. Plus: Mov­ing my check­ing ac­count would be _an­noy­ing_. I have checks, and auto-with­drawals for monthly bills, and an ATM card, and the whole deal. Pick­ing it all up and re­lo­cat­ing it and trans­fer­ring ev­ery­thing _sounds so hard and ir­ri­tat­ing_, and it makes me sleepy.

So… maybe I just leave my check­ing ac­count where it is? I mean, I’m gen­er­ally a good dude. Can I just… let this one go?

Here we’re con­fronting a con­di­tion I think of as Moral Ex­haus­tion.[^2],[^3] Try­ing to do the right thing all the time is—and I’m go­ing to use a fairly wonky, tech­ni­cal phi­los­o­phy term here, so bear with me—_a huge pain in the ass_. Ev­ery day we are con­fronted with dozens of moral and eth­i­cal de­ci­sions—which prod­ucts to buy or use, which po­lit­i­cal can­di­dates to sup­port, how to sim­ply ex­ist in and move about the earth—and some op­tions are cer­tainly bet­ter than oth­ers. There’s an en­vi­ron­men­tally “best” tooth­paste we should buy, an “ideal” length of time we should leave the wa­ter run­ning when we shower, a “most eth­i­cal” car to drive, and a “bet­ter” op­tion than driv­ing at all. There’s a “most re­spon­si­ble” way to shop for gro­ceries, a “worst” so­cial me­dia com­pany we def­i­nitely shouldn’t use, a “most rep­re­hen­si­ble” pro sports fran­chise owner we shouldn’t sup­port, and a “most la­bor-friendly” cloth­ing com­pany we should. There are ex­pen­sive so­lar pan­els we _should_ put on our roofs, low-flow toi­lets we _should_ in­stall, and me­dia out­lets we _shouldn’t_ pa­tron­ize be­cause they stiff their jour­nal­ists.

What makes it dou­bly ex­haust­ing is that we also—and again, sorry for the overly aca­demic ter­mi­nol­ogy—have our own crap to deal with. Fam­ily lo­gis­tics, ro­man­tic en­tan­gle­ments, school meet­ings, se­crets we should or shouldn’t keep from our friends, cars that need to be fixed, toast­ers that need to be fixed, door hinges that need to be fixed—why does ev­ery­thing break all the time?!—and so on, to in­fin­ity. And that’s if things are go­ing _well_! We’ll also at some point face far more se­ri­ous prob­lems: ill­nesses, job losses, fam­ily crises, toast­ers we didn’t fix that mal­func­tion and start fires—_there is so much go­ing on, all the time_. Those daily an­noy­ances, and larger, more se­ri­ous prob­lems, make the work of be­ing alive in­cred­i­bly dif­fi­cult even for the luck­i­est among us, to say noth­ing of those in poverty or other dis­tress. So if we want to be good, by the time we deal with all the crap we _have_ to deal with and fi­nally de­cide to try to achieve that goal, our in­ter­nal bat­tery is at about 5 per­cent. (Oh, that’s an­other thing we have to deal with—the bat­ter­ies in lit­er­ally ev­ery de­vice we use are al­ways about to run out.[^4]) Now add to this cock­tail of stress the fact that very of­ten, do­ing the “right” thing is harder and re­quires more in­testi­nal for­ti­tude (and money!) than do­ing the lazier/worse thing. And the cap­per—the rot­ten cherry on top of this turd sun­dae—is that, as we saw in the in­tro­duc­tion, even if we scale the triple-peaked moun­tain of Daily Stress, Se­ri­ous Prob­lems, and Cir­cum­stance, and (run­ning on 5 per­cent bat­tery power) try our very best to do the harder/bet­ter thing, _we of­ten fail mis­er­ably_ de­spite our best in­ten­tions.

It. Is. Ex­haust­ing.

So… _not_ do­ing the “right” thing once in a while feels like a lit­tle present we can give our­selves, sav­ing us the time and ef­fort we know it would re­quire to re­search and act and change and im­prove. It might also feel like a lux­ury we’ve _earned_ through other good ac­tions. Should we con­tinue to use Face­book, even though we know about the hor­ri­fy­ing spread of mis­in­for­ma­tion it fa­cil­i­tates? No, we prob­a­bly shouldn’t. But dammit, it’s a nice way to keep up with our fam­ily—and we just gave a hun­dred bucks to a friend’s 5K Ir­ri­ta­ble Bowel Syn­drome Run for the Cure, so give us a break, man. We’re good peo­ple!

And then there are other sit­u­a­tions where we’re tempted to break the rules be­cause _the rules stink_. Two years ago, my fam­ily adopted a very sweet, very sickly stray dog we named Henry. Henry is an adorable twenty-pound mutt, who’s lov­ing and af­fec­tion­ate de­spite his rough first year of life. Af­ter we adopted him and nursed him back to health, we be­gan tak­ing him on walks around our neigh­bor­hood and dis­cov­ered that be­ing on a leash turns him into a _mon­ster_. He barks, he snarls, he growls, he wrenches out of his har­ness—it’s ba­nanas. Off a leash? De­light­ful dream pup. On a leash? The preda­tor, from _Preda­tor_.[^5]

So, when­ever one of us takes Henry on a walk, we have to make a choice: leash or no leash—which, in our neigh­bor­hood, would be against the rules. I, be­ing the Rules Dork, al­ways press for “leash.” But I also have to ad­mit: fol­low­ing the rule makes us mis­er­able. It makes ev­ery­one else mis­er­able. It makes Henry mis­er­able. It scares chil­dren. And given all that… shouldn’t we break the rule?

Two cases of po­ten­tial rule-break­ing. In the first, we have a sort of fun-house mir­ror re­flec­tion of moral desert—in­stead of do­ing some­thing good and feel­ing like we ought to be re­warded, we feel like we _can_ do some­thing _bad_, be­cause of other good things _we’ve al­ready done_. There’s no real log­i­cal or eth­i­cal ba­sis for think­ing this way, but it’s tempt­ing—be­cause again, life is hard, and maybe we de­serve a hia­tus from moral cal­cu­la­tions once in a while. In the sec­ond case, we’re star­ing at a rule we know to be silly, or wrong, or harm­ful, so we rea­son­ably feel like we should ig­nore it. Yet even as we’re tempted to dis­miss a rule for ei­ther of these rea­sons, we can feel the cold, un­for­giv­ing stare of Im­manuel Kant bor­ing a hole through the backs of our skulls. Rules are rules, he says, in his char­ac­ter­is­ti­cally flat, emo­tion­less Ger­man.[^6] If some­thing is wrong, it’s wrong. If ev­ery­one could pick and choose her own rules to fol­low, the world would be law­less! _Keine Ausre­den!_[^7]

### Moral Jay­walk­ing

I’ll risk the back of my head and dis­agree with Kant here, be­cause of what I think of as the Hot Day Jay­walk­ing rule. Let’s say we need to cross the street to get to a store on the other side. The cross­walk is a block south of us. It’s 103 de­grees, and we just drove here in a car whose in­te­rior was 200 de­grees, and there’s no traf­fic… so we jay­walk. It’s tech­ni­cally a crime, but it’s _barely_ a crime, and ut­terly un­der­stand­able, and it saves us some mis­ery. Would Kant let us do it? No. Cat­e­gor­i­cal im­per­a­tive, uni­ver­sal maxim, blah blah blah. But you know what? Shut up, Kant. _It’s so hot out here_ and we just need to pop into CVS to pick up a pre­scrip­tion, it’ll take two sec­onds, and we’re sweat­ing buck­ets, and _shut up_. We’re not per­fect. Sue us. In mo­ments of ex­haus­tion, when the act we’d be com­mit­ting is so in­finites­i­mally “bad” it barely even reg­is­ters as “bad” (or it’s only “bad” in a fuzzy, com­plex way), I think it’s okay to break those small rules.

Maybe this sounds self-serv­ing. Maybe I want to make an ar­gu­ment for moral jay­walk­ing (un­der the right cir­cum­stances) just to cre­ate a rea­son­able de­fense for my de­ci­sion to walk my Jekyll-and-Hyde dog with­out a leash, or to not switch banks (which, again, _how an­noy­ing does that sound_?). But I don’t think it is self-serv­ing. For one thing, as we learned from Su­san Wolf’s “Moral Saints,” and from the case of that an­noy­ing guy who al­lowed his du­ti­ful­ness to run amok (me), fol­low­ing _ev­ery_ rule _all the time_ in _all sce­nar­ios_ isn’t nec­es­sar­ily good. In fact, the po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist James C. Scott ac­tu­ally thinks break­ing a rule ev­ery once in a while is morally nec­es­sary:

> One day you will be called upon to break a big law in the name of jus­tice and ra­tio­nal­ity. Ev­ery­thing will de­pend on it.… How are you go­ing to pre­pare for that day when it re­ally mat­ters? You have to stay “in shape” so that when the big day comes you will be ready. What you need is “an­ar­chist cal­is­then­ics.” Ev­ery day or so break some triv­ial law that makes no sense, even if it’s only jay­walk­ing. Use your own head to judge whether a law is just or rea­son­able. That way, you’ll keep trim; and when the big day comes, you’ll be ready.

For Scott, these small trans­gres­sions build up our eth­i­cal mus­cles and pre­pare us for more im­por­tant moral ex­er­cise. But I also think that some rules are coarse and in­ef­fec­tive ways of achiev­ing a re­sult, like “All dogs must be on leashes” or “Pedes­tri­ans can never jay­walk.” And I fur­ther think that if we’re try­ing to be good peo­ple, given how ex­haust­ing life on earth can be, tak­ing a lit­tle respite from our Moral Ex­haus­tion is okay (and maybe even nec­es­sary) just so we don’t lose our minds. I say we al­low our­selves these mo­ments of rule-break­ing, on two con­di­tions:

First: that the rules we vi­o­late are not ob­vi­ously harm­ful to other peo­ple. Let’s say you love an­i­mals. You give money to the AS­PCA, and you once pulled your car over to help a tur­tle that had wan­dered out into the road. (That’s right. That was you, in that ex­am­ple from ear­lier. That’s how much you love an­i­mals.) You’re also a huge pro­po­nent of adopt­ing pets from shel­ters in­stead of buy­ing them from breed­ers. Then one day a friend tells you she bought a lit­tle yel­low Lab puppy named Wal­nut from a breeder, but is now mov­ing and can’t keep it. Yes, adopt­ing Wal­nut would tech­ni­cally vi­o­late your own rule to sup­port adop­tions from shel­ters, but there’s a com­pelling coun­ter­ar­gu­ment, which is _look at Wal­nut’s ears they’re so floppy!_ Let your­self off the hook. Take Wal­nut home. Jay­walk­ing doesn’t negate your en­tire project of be­ing a good per­son on earth, and tak­ing Wal­nut home doesn’t undo the years of work you’ve put into the cause of pro­mot­ing shel­ters. How­ever, if the rule you want to vi­o­late is, say, “Don’t flee the scene of an ac­ci­dent,” or “Don’t start a war in the Mid­dle East un­der false pre­tenses,” there is no “good deed” bank ac­count with a high enough bal­ance to ex­cuse your be­hav­ior.

Sec­ond: we need to ac­knowl­edge that what we’re do­ing is not ideal. The min­i­mal harm we gen­er­ate from this small bad ac­tion could be com­pounded if we pre­tend we’re not do­ing it, be­cause that might al­ter the way we think of our­selves, and even­tu­ally even change what kind of peo­ple we are.

There’s a con­cept in pub­lic pol­icy called the Over­ton win­dow, named af­ter its in­ven­tor, Joseph Over­ton-Win­dow.[^8] An Over­ton win­dow de­scribes the range of “ac­cept­abil­ity” a po­lit­i­cal idea has at any given time. Some ideas—say, same-sex mar­riage—be­gin as ex­tremely un­likely, or even un­think­able. Over time, var­i­ous fac­tors emerge in the cul­ture—more ac­cep­tance of LGBTQ+ peo­ple gen­er­ally, more gay char­ac­ters on pop­u­lar TV shows—and the win­dow shifts a lit­tle, mak­ing same-sex mar­riage more po­lit­i­cally pos­si­ble. As cul­tural norms con­tinue to evolve (younger politi­cians take of­fice, pro­po­nents en­gage in ef­fec­tive ac­tivism, peo­ple re­al­ize that we all have at least one LGBTQ+ per­son in our so­cial cir­cle), the Over­ton win­dow shifts with them, un­til fi­nally the range of pos­si­bil­ity de­scribed by the win­dow in­cludes same-sex mar­riage ac­tu­ally be­ing rec­og­nized as the law of the land. Some­thing once un­think­able be­comes pos­si­ble, and then even­tu­ally it be­comes re­al­ity.

Re­gard­ing our lit­tle trans­gres­sions, we see the po­ten­tial prob­lem, right? Over­ton win­dows can rep­re­sent any kind of range, in­clud­ing what we con­sider ac­cept­able be­hav­ior for our­selves. So, we know jay­walk­ing is wrong, but we do it any­way… and then we’ve be­come “peo­ple who oc­ca­sion­ally jay­walk.” No big deal. But once that’s true, it’s a short jour­ney to be­com­ing “peo­ple who _al­ways_ jay­walk.” Then one day we can’t find a garbage can, and we think, “I mean, toss­ing a gum wrap­per on the ground isn’t _that much_ worse than jay­walk­ing,” so we do that… and soon we’re lit­ter­ing all the time, and since lit­ter­ing is now ac­cept­able we start park­ing il­le­gally, which shifts our win­dow to al­low for stiff­ing con­trac­tors out of pay­ment, and once we do that it’s a hop, skip, and a jump to cheat­ing on our taxes, and then em­bez­zling money, and cheat­ing on our spouses, and smug­gling en­dan­gered rhi­nos out of In­dia, and sell­ing black mar­ket weapons to in­ter­na­tional ter­ror­ists.

Now. Is this _likely_? Of course not. That’s a de­lib­er­ately ab­surd “what if,” like one of those cops in a 1980s PSA warn­ing kids that if they smoke a sin­gle cig­a­rette they’re on a fast track to heroin ad­dic­tion. But there’s a se­ri­ous point here: the shift­ing of an Over­ton win­dow of­ten hap­pens grad­u­ally, and we read­just to its new range very quickly,[^9] so there is risk in al­low­ing our­selves to do _any­thing_ we know is bad just be­cause we want to. In fact, even with good in­ten­tions and level heads, if we give in to our lesser in­stincts too of­ten there’s a far more likely out­come than “we be­come black mar­ket weapons deal­ers.” It’s sim­ply that we be­come _self­ish_. We start to be­lieve that our own “right” to do what­ever we want, when­ever we want to do it, is more im­por­tant than any­thing else, and thus our sense of moral­ity con­cerns only our _own_ hap­pi­ness or pain. We be­come… Ayn Rand.

### Bad Writer, Worse Philoso­pher

Rand (1905–1982) was a nov­el­ist and philoso­pher who of­fered her read­ers the deal of a life­time. De­vel­op­ing a nine­teenth-cen­tury idea called “ra­tio­nal ego­ism” or “ra­tio­nal self­ish­ness,” she sug­gested that the true path to moral and so­ci­etal progress in­volves peo­ple car­ing only about their own hap­pi­ness. She called her the­ory “ob­jec­tivism,” and it’s ba­si­cally the ex­act op­po­site of util­i­tar­i­an­ism—in­stead of try­ing to max­i­mize plea­sure and min­i­mize pain for _ev­ery­one_, we do it _only for our­selves._ Or as she wrote in the af­ter­word to _At­las Shrugged_:

> My phi­los­o­phy, in essence, is the con­cept of man as a heroic be­ing, with his own hap­pi­ness as the moral pur­pose of his life, with pro­duc­tive achieve­ment as his no­blest ac­tiv­ity, and rea­son as his only ab­so­lute.

This is an amaz­ing phi­los­o­phy. And not in a good way. If our own hap­pi­ness is the moral pur­pose of our lives, that means we’re ob­li­gated to max­i­mize it at the ex­pense of ev­ery­thing else, in­clud­ing, and es­pe­cially, _other peo­ple’s_ hap­pi­ness. In Ayn Rand’s world, there could be a thou­sand Steves trapped be­hind that ESPN gen­er­a­tor, and I could be _the only one_ watch­ing the World Cup on TV, and I’d _still_ de­cide to let them all fry be­cause _I_ am happy and _they_ are merely po­ten­tial hin­drances to my hap­pi­ness. It’s ba­nanas. Here’s my fa­vorite quote of hers, wherein she takes a brave stance against “be­ing nice”:

> Do not con­fuse al­tru­ism with kind­ness, good will or re­spect for the rights of oth­ers.… The ir­re­duc­ible pri­mary of al­tru­ism, the ba­sic ab­so­lute, is _self-sac­ri­fice_—which means self-im­mo­la­tion, self-ab­ne­ga­tion, self-de­nial, self-de­struc­tion—which means the _self_ as a stan­dard of evil, the _self­less_ as a stan­dard of the good. Do not hide be­hind such su­per­fi­cial­i­ties as whether you should or should not give a dime to a beg­gar. That is not the is­sue. The is­sue is whether you _do_ or do _not_ have the right to ex­ist _with­out_ giv­ing him that dime. The is­sue is whether you must keep buy­ing your life, dime by dime, from any beg­gar who might choose to ap­proach you.… Any man of self-es­teem will an­swer: _No._ Al­tru­ism says: _Yes._

Or, to put it an­other way: “Fuck all y’all.”

It’s frankly dispir­it­ing that a woman who ad­vo­cated rad­i­cal self­ish­ness and ut­ter dis­dain for ev­ery­one but one­self wasn’t booed off the world stage, but even to­day Rand has plenty of ad­her­ents, es­pe­cially among those who call them­selves lib­er­tar­i­ans. (There are more than a few Ran­dites in the U.S. Con­gress—for­mer Speaker of the House Paul Ryan says he asked all of his staffers to read her books, a re­quest which, based on their length and un­read­abil­ity, may have vi­o­lated the Geneva Con­ven­tions.) I sup­pose at some level, this shouldn’t be sur­pris­ing. She is ba­si­cally telling her read­ers that the only thing they need to do to be morally pure is greed­ily pro­tect their own in­ter­ests. A diet book that claimed you could lose weight by eat­ing pecan pie and drink­ing Moun­tain Dew Code Red would def­i­nitely sell a few copies. The ap­peal of her the­o­ries to those in­ter­ested in achiev­ing and main­tain­ing power is cer­tainly more likely to ex­plain her en­dur­ing place than is her ac­tual tal­ent—Rand’s nov­els are end­less mon­strosi­ties, writ­ten in turgid prose that dou­bles as an ef­fec­tive pre-op anes­thetic. As one noted aca­demic put it, “There are only two prob­lems with Ayn Rand: she can’t think and she can’t write.”[^10]

The most cur­sory glance at any of our pre­vi­ously dis­cussed moral the­o­ries sends ob­jec­tivism ca­reen­ing to­ward the flam­ing garbage can of his­tory. It’s the flat op­po­site of util­i­tar­i­an­ism, so… it fails there. I can’t imag­ine Im­manuel Kant strug­gling through 1,172 pages of _At­las Shrugged_[^11] and declar­ing in­fi­nite self­ish­ness a solid uni­ver­sal maxim. T. M. Scan­lon seems like a pretty calm and thought­ful per­son, but it’s not hard to imag­ine him read­ing Ayn Rand and putting his fist through a wall. And an Aris­totelian in search of a golden mean would bris­tle at a the­ory that tells the very con­cept of a golden mean to go jump in a lake. None­the­less, we live in a world where “Be as self­ish as you can!” is some­how a main­stream moral the­ory. It’s out there, float­ing around, telling us we can do what­ever we want, ig­nore the value of oth­ers’ lives, treat ev­ery­one else as a means to our own end, de­cide _we owe noth­ing to any­one_.[^12] Our lit­tle moral trans­gres­sions, harm­less though they might be, shift our Over­ton win­dows ever so slightly to­ward a world where Ayn Rand’s goofy “ra­tio­nal self­ish­ness” be­comes slightly more plau­si­ble. The so­lu­tion, how­ever, is sim­ple: we com­mit to those reg­u­lar “check-ins”—to sim­ply note, when we morally jay­walk, _that we’re do­ing it_. Make the “good deed” bank ac­count with­drawal, but pin the re­ceipt up on our cu­bi­cle wall as a re­minder.

### The Free-Rid­ing Ninja: A Case Study

Think­ing about the long-term ef­fects of moral cal­cu­la­tions we make in small, rel­a­tively unim­por­tant mo­ments calls to mind an­other of phi­los­o­phy’s most fa­mous thought ex­per­i­ments: the Free Rider Prob­lem. Imag­ine a trol­ley car[^13] ab­so­lutely jam-packed with peo­ple. Par­ents and strollers, cy­clists with their bi­cy­cles, old cou­ples with a mil­lion gro­cery bags—just a sweaty, soupy reser­voir of BO and rush-hour mis­ery. Each one of these com­muters has paid the re­quired fee to ride the trol­ley, and mirac­u­lously, to­day, the num­ber of pay­ing pas­sen­gers is the ex­act limit of the trol­ley’s ca­pac­ity. (It’s amaz­ing how things like that seem to hap­pen, in philo­soph­i­cal thought ex­per­i­ments.) As the trol­ley starts to move, a woman named Deb comes run­ning up and jumps onto the out­side of the trol­ley, hang­ing on to a pole and snag­ging a free ride. She didn’t pay her fare, but she’s also not tak­ing up any space that could be used by some­one who did. Is she do­ing any­thing wrong?

In­stinc­tively, we think: Of course she is. The Kan­tian whip-crack­ers im­me­di­ately point and jump up and down and an­grily shout at us in Ger­man,[^14] since Deb is clearly vi­o­lat­ing the cat­e­gor­i­cal im­per­a­tive—she could cer­tainly not will that her ac­tion be­come a uni­ver­sal law. If ev­ery­one did what she did (wait un­til the trol­leys are packed and then grab a free ride with­out pay­ing) the en­tire com­muter sys­tem would break down, be­cause no one would pay, be­cause they’d all be aim­ing to snag a free ride. Pretty clearly “wrong,” when you ap­proach it from Kant’s per­spec­tive. But then again, most things are wrong when you ap­proach them from Kant’s per­spec­tive. Peo­ple be­ing wrong was Kant’s kink.

But… no one on the trol­ley was re­ally in­con­ve­nienced—they all got to their des­ti­na­tions in the same amount of time they would’ve if Deb had _not_ hitched her free ride. Which means that from a util­i­tar­ian point of view, this kind of worked out—Deb’s sneaky ma­neu­ver in­creased the amount of to­tal hap­pi­ness in the world (more peo­ple got to their des­ti­na­tions), with­out any ad­di­tional pain. Of course, the smol­der­ing looks of fury di­rected at Deb from the pay­ing pas­sen­gers force us to re­cal­cu­late here—their com­bined anger might over­whelm the plea­sure of Deb snag­ging a free trip. So: Let’s now imag­ine that Deb is ac­tu­ally _hid­den from their view_. Maybe she scram­bled up the side of the trol­ley car light­ning-fast and is ly­ing flat on the roof, un­seen by any­one. (Deb is a ninja, it turns out. Just go with it.)

The ques­tion now be­comes: If no one sees Deb the Ninja com­mit this small act of rule-break­ing, so they were nei­ther in­con­ve­nienced by it nor made to feel any anger about hav­ing to live in a world where nin­jas get free rides while ev­ery­one else has to pay, _now_ what do we think of this ac­tion? Good? Bad? We could keep mod­i­fy­ing the orig­i­nal act and chew­ing on the im­pli­ca­tions for­ever; like the Trol­ley Prob­lem, the Free Rider Prob­lem has mil­lions of ver­sions, and maybe even more real-life ap­pli­ca­tions—once you know it, you see it ev­ery­where. The ethics of not tak­ing a vac­cine and thus re­ly­ing on those who _did_ for per­sonal safety… cheat­ing on your taxes but still us­ing pub­lic re­sources… us­ing too much wa­ter on your lawn in a drought-rid­den city… not vot­ing but still com­plain­ing about gov­ern­ment—these are all Free Rider va­ri­etals. But in the name of pre­vent­ing Over­ton win­dow shifts and de­scents into Ayn Rand fever dreams of our worst and most self­ish in­stincts, let’s ap­proach this in­side out in­stead of out­side in: let’s ask what _Deb_ thinks about what she did. No one else even knows she did it, thanks to her park­our abil­i­ties and ninja stealth, so the only one do­ing any ru­mi­nat­ing on Deb’s free ride is Deb her­self. Is _she_ fine with it? Think­ing about Deb’s own guilt, or lack thereof, might help us bet­ter pin­point how we feel about mak­ing with­drawals from our moral bank ac­counts.

Deb’s feel­ings about her own ac­tion prob­a­bly de­pend on a lot of Deb-spe­cific things. Maybe there’s con­text we don’t know about. Maybe Deb the Free-Rid­ing Ninja just fought off a group of thugs who were rob­bing an old man, and then she had to get down­town to meet her sick dad and bring him soup, and her ninja out­fit has no pock­ets for trol­ley fare, and she thought to her­self, “I just did a su­per-good thing, and I’m not hurt­ing any­one here, so I’m just gonna grab a free ride.” In that case, she’s prob­a­bly ac­knowl­edg­ing that this isn’t an _ideal_ way to be­have, but then let­ting her­self off the hook. Un­der sim­i­lar cir­cum­stances in the fu­ture, she’ll pay for her ride like ev­ery­one else. The Over­ton win­dow de­scrib­ing her own moral range prob­a­bly won’t move very much, if at all.

Or maybe Deb is a bad ninja, not a good one. She walks around all day us­ing her ninja re­flexes to steal lol­lipops from chil­dren, and when she saw an op­por­tu­nity to score a free ride she (lit­er­ally) leaped at it. In that case, Deb might be on a more slip­pery slope. Her Over­ton win­dow might have just shifted; be­fore, her worst ac­tions were petty candy-re­lated crimes, but now she’s a per­son who doesn’t pay for sub­way rides and feels no re­morse. Deb’s ab­sence of guilt may put her on a metaphor­i­cal ride to Self­ish­town.

Again, part of the project of this book is to help us ac­cept fail­ure—be­cause, again, fail­ure is the in­evitable re­sult of car­ing about moral­ity and try­ing to be good peo­ple. I re­ally don’t mean to ar­gue for per­fect liv­ing, or moral saint­hood, or any­thing close to that, be­cause (a) it’s im­pos­si­ble, and (b) I don’t even think it’s a good goal. In­stead, I’m ar­gu­ing that when we do fail, in mat­ters great or small, we just take a sec­ond to ac­knowl­edge our fail­ure to our­selves, and try to re­mem­ber that feel­ing the next time we have a de­ci­sion to make. That’s why it’s in­struc­tive to fo­cus on some­thing as small as jay­walk­ing or hitch­ing a free ride on a trol­ley. Deb’s ac­tions may have been more jus­ti­fi­able than we thought, or less. They may be no­ticed by other peo­ple or go com­pletely un­seen. But what­ever the case, we can only hope that the lit­tle voice in Deb’s head chirps loudly enough to keep her from mak­ing this a habit, or at least to warn her that she’s been do­ing stuff like this a lot re­cently and ought to knock it off.

### Small Sac­ri­fice, Huge Re­ward

It’s not al­ways easy to know the dif­fer­ence be­tween harm­lessly break­ing rules and send­ing our­selves down a slip­pery Over­ton win­dow–shift­ing path. Plenty of great TV shows and movies in­volve peo­ple mak­ing tiny bad de­ci­sions and then spend­ing the rest of their lives mak­ing more and more of them to try to make up for the first one, even­tu­ally be­com­ing ir­re­deemable mon­sters. It’s un­likely any of us will, say, de­cide to start cook­ing crys­tal meth like Wal­ter White in _Break­ing Bad_ and one day find our­selves run­ning a New Mex­i­can drug em­pire. But if guilt is how we po­lice our­selves, we need to al­low our­selves to feel that guilt, and we need to lis­ten to our guilty con­sciences when they give us pause. That’s one of the big­gest hin­drances to mak­ing use of our in­di­vid­ual guid­ance sys­tems—too many of us just don’t pin those slightly damn­ing re­ceipts up on our cu­bi­cle walls so they can re­mind us of these lit­tle bad things we’ve done. Again, I can’t help but think about the Covid-19 “mask prob­lem.” The peo­ple who’ve re­fused to join the team here—the ones who de­cided that they sim­ply didn’t have to (or want to) fol­low this new rule—of­ten get _ex­tremely in­dig­nant_ when store own­ers or work­ers ask them not to be “free rid­ers” and go mask­less while ev­ery­one else cov­ers up. “How dare you,” they say. “This is Amer­ica! I can do what I want, be­cause of lib­erty! The Con­sti­tu­tion guar­an­tees us Free­dom of Face, and also Don’t Tread on Me and George Wash­ing­ton and Bald Ea­gles!”[^15] Thanks in part to this at­ti­tude (and in larger part to the craven me­dia types and politi­cians who fos­tered it), we all watched help­lessly as the virus ripped through the coun­try in wave af­ter wave. Even worse were the states where _au­thor­i­ties_ de­cided not to re­quire mask-wear­ing—ei­ther for sim­i­lar ide­o­log­i­cal rea­sons, or be­cause they feared the wrath of those who held that ide­ol­ogy, or both, or both plus ig­no­rance and stu­pid­ity.

The wide­spread lack of guilt among mask re­sisters feels like a gut punch, to me. Be­cause again, it’s such a mi­nus­cule ask—wear­ing a mask falls roughly at the “don’t jay­walk” level of in­di­vid­ual sac­ri­fice. Imag­ine we were in that Hot Day Jay­walk­ing sce­nario from ear­lier—it’s 103 de­grees and the cross­walk is a block away, so we in­tend to just hus­tle across the street. Now imag­ine that some­one said: “Hey, I know it’s an­noy­ing, but if we all agree to head on down and use the cross­walk in­stead of jay­walk­ing, we can save a hun­dred thou­sand peo­ple from dy­ing in auto ac­ci­dents.” Imag­ine how eas­ily we’d make that call! Okay, it’s a lit­tle hot and a bit in­con­ve­nient… but 100,000 peo­ple? It’d be one of the sim­plest cal­cu­la­tions we’d ever made. And yet here I sit, writ­ing this book, watch­ing the case count for the na­tion sky­rocket be­cause too many peo­ple think their own Ayn Ran­dian right to un­fet­tered self­ish­ness out­weighs the sum to­tal of lit­er­ally ev­ery­one else’s hap­pi­ness and safety.

It’s one of the rea­sons Scan­lon’s _What We Owe to Each Other_ struck such a chord with me—the ti­tle it­self ori­ents us, points us in a cer­tain di­rec­tion. He no­tably did not call his book _Do We Owe Things to Each Other?_ He be­gins his jour­ney with the point of view that we do, cer­tainly, owe things to each other, and the goal is to find out what those things are. In a frac­tured na­tional mo­ment of stress and pain, of in­equal­ity and in­jus­tice, of eth­i­cal strain and Moral Ex­haus­tion, we should go easy on our­selves at mo­ments when we fail in our quest to be­come bet­ter peo­ple. But we can­not for­get this sim­ple truth: _we owe things to each other_. They may be small things, or sim­ple things, but they’re _there_, they’re im­por­tant, and we can’t ig­nore them.

One fi­nal P.S.: Af­ter I com­pleted the first draft of this book and sent it to my ed­i­tor to look over, some­thing started nag­ging at me. How hard would it be, _re­ally_, to find a bank that made me feel bet­ter about where I keep my money? I had writ­ten that all bank CEOs were mon­sters… but I had fo­cused on maybe the five big­gest banks, and re­al­ized I’d kind of phoned in the ac­tual re­search. So I poked around, and found a few banks that (in my opin­ion) were bet­ter in­sti­tu­tions than the one I’d been us­ing. They don’t in­vest in fos­sil fu­els, they ac­tively sup­port char­i­ta­ble causes, they have codes of eth­i­cal con­duct for their em­ploy­ees, and so on. “Well, crap,” I thought. “Now I gotta switch.”

So I did. And af­ter all my com­plain­ing and grip­ing about how hard it would be, and how an­noy­ing it would be, you know what? _It was ex­actly as an­noy­ing as I thought._ Maybe more. Pa­per­work, and con­fus­ing phone calls, and in­cor­rect rout­ing num­bers, and new ATM cards, and the whole deal. It took months to get things up and run­ning. I’m cer­tainly glad I did it, but it’s im­por­tant not to sug­ar­coat how ir­ri­tated I was at mul­ti­ple points in the process. It served as a good re­minder of two dif­fer­ent things. One: the work of mak­ing bet­ter choices is fre­quently an­noy­ing. We just have to ac­cept that. And two: _it can be done_—if we want to do it, and can sum­mon the time and en­ergy to make it hap­pen.

We’ve talked about fail­ure, and learn­ing to ac­cept it in our eth­i­cal lives, but we can now be a bit more pre­cise when we de­fine which kinds of fail­ure are good and which are bad. The good kind comes from _try­ing_ to do some­thing good, and ei­ther mis­cal­cu­lat­ing or just flatly mak­ing the wrong de­ci­sion. That’s the kind of fail­ure that’s 100 per­cent guar­an­teed, and 100 per­cent for­giv­able—plus, the at­tempt at virtue that led to it lets us learn from what we did, and gives us a bet­ter chance at suc­cess in the fu­ture. The kind I was ges­tur­ing at when I didn’t want to change banks came partly from ap­a­thy, or maybe “moral lazi­ness.” I didn’t do some­thing I knew would be a lit­tle bet­ter than the thing I was do­ing, be­cause, well, it was hard and an­noy­ing. We’ve just spent an en­tire chap­ter declar­ing that per­fec­tion is im­pos­si­ble, and we’re en­tirely within our rights to let our­selves off the moral hook once in a while when we jay­walk (lit­er­ally or fig­u­ra­tively). That self-for­give­ness is nec­es­sary, I think, just to get through the day. But if I’m be­ing hon­est with my­self, I gave up a lit­tle early with the check­ing ac­count thing. (I am lucky enough to even have a check­ing ac­count, and the time and en­ergy to think about the pros and cons of where that check­ing ac­count is lo­cated, and the re­sources to make a change—as we’ll see a lit­tle later, peo­ple in my po­si­tion have an obli­ga­tion to fight a lit­tle harder to get things right.) I don’t think I’d be a “bad” per­son if I hadn’t changed my bank. But I do feel like a slightly bet­ter one be­cause I switched, and the ini­tial thing that al­most stopped me was more lazi­ness than any­thing else.

We’ve com­pleted two-thirds of our jour­ney, ev­ery­one! That’s the good news. The bad news is, we’re about to get real thorny. We’re gonna wade into some deeply con­fus­ing and painful ap­pli­ca­tions of moral phi­los­o­phy, stretch­ing and strain­ing and chew­ing on re­ally tough ques­tions that plague us in our daily lives, that cause us anx­i­ety and an­guish and of­ten lead to loud ar­gu­ments with our clos­est friends and fam­ily.

But in a _fun_ way!

In Which Things Get Re­ally Tough, but We Power Through and Com­plete Our Jour­neys, Be­com­ing Per­fectly Vir­tu­ous and Flour­ish­ing and De­on­to­log­i­cally Pure Hap­pi­ness-Gen­er­at­ing Su­per-Peo­ple, and Also There’s a Chap­ter with Some Curs­ing in It, but It’s for a Good Rea­son

    

## CHAP­TER NINE Oh, You Bought a New iPhone? That’s Cool. Did You Know That Mil­lions of Peo­ple Are Starv­ing in South Asia?!

In Oc­to­ber 2018, my beloved Bos­ton Red Sox won the World Se­ries, beat­ing the L.A. Dodgers in five games. I was at the ti­tle-clinch­ing game in Los An­ge­les with my close friends Nate and Dave and my son, William. I didn’t think sports had much more to of­fer me in the cat­e­gory of emo­tional grat­i­fi­ca­tion, but that mo­ment—the in­stant they se­cured the cham­pi­onship—was so pure and won­der­ful and mag­i­cal that I felt like I was float­ing. Dave spon­ta­neously lifted William up in the air. We hugged and cried and laughed and cel­e­brated. Here’s a pic­ture of William right af­ter we ran down to the field level:

![[f0167-01.jpg]]

Look at that face. That’s a big ol’ face full of joy, right there.

In De­cem­ber, I de­cided to get William a Christ­mas present to com­mem­o­rate the oc­ca­sion and found for sale a bat au­to­graphed by four of the Red Sox’s best play­ers. It was pretty ex­pen­sive for a ten-year-old’s Christ­mas present: $800. Oof. That’s al­most as much as a new bumper for a 2005 Saab.[^1] But then I scrolled back through my pic­tures and _look at that face full of joy_. I de­cided: What the hell. This was a mo­ment we will re­mem­ber for­ever. So I bought it. And then for a mo­ment, I felt _ter­ri­ble_. And it’s all phi­los­o­phy’s fault.

Well, one philoso­pher’s in par­tic­u­lar.

The thou­sands of de­ci­sions we make ev­ery day come not just with Moral Ex­haus­tion—the hot new philo­soph­i­cal term ev­ery­one’s talk­ing about—but with a forced ac­count­ing of our moral op­por­tu­nity cost. “Op­por­tu­nity cost” is an eco­nom­ics term de­scrib­ing what we give up when we spend our re­sources—the op­por­tu­nity cost of a com­pany putting more money into re­search and de­vel­op­ment is that it can’t hire as many work­ers; the op­por­tu­nity cost of spend­ing more on ad­ver­tis­ing is that it has less money to buy sup­plies. Moral op­por­tu­nity cost, then, would be the good we miss out on do­ing when we choose to do some­thing else. Which brings us to icon­o­clas­tic Aus­tralian util­i­tar­ian, and source of that 2018 buz­zkill, Pe­ter Singer.

In De­cem­ber 2006, Singer (born 1946) wrote an ar­ti­cle for the _New York Times Mag­a­zine_ called “What Should a Bil­lion­aire Give—and What Should You?” At the time, Bill Gates had pledged nearly $30 bil­lion to his char­i­ta­ble foun­da­tion, mak­ing him (by the num­bers) one of the great­est phi­lan­thropists of all time. Singer ap­plauds Gates for his work to erad­i­cate dis­eases like malaria that rav­age poor en­claves of sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa. But then he says this:

> Gates may have given away nearly $30 bil­lion, but that still leaves him sit­ting at the top of the Forbes list of the rich­est Amer­i­cans, with $53 bil­lion. His 66,000-square-foot high-tech lake­side es­tate near Seat­tle is re­port­edly worth more than $100 mil­lion.… Among his pos­ses­sions is the Leices­ter Codex, the only hand­writ­ten book by Leonardo da Vinci still in pri­vate hands, for which he paid $30.8 mil­lion in 1994. Has Bill Gates done enough? More point­edly, you might ask: if he re­ally be­lieves that all lives have equal value, what is he do­ing liv­ing in such an ex­pen­sive house and own­ing a Leonardo Codex? Are there no more lives that could be saved by liv­ing more mod­estly and adding the money thus saved to the amount he has al­ready given?

Singer wants us to think about Gates dif­fer­ently: not as a man who gave $30 bil­lion to char­ity, but rather as a man who _still has $53 bil­lion_, _none of which_ he’s giv­ing to char­ity. What would we think of a man who has $53 bil­lion[^2] and gives none of it away? We’d start with “What an ass,” and prob­a­bly not move much be­yond that. But is that fair to Gates? Given, you know, the $30 bil­lion he _did_ give to char­ity?[^3]

In chap­ter 5 we dis­cussed the up­per lim­its of virtue, and dis­cov­ered the need for some kind of ceil­ing on what any eth­i­cal sys­tem can ex­pect of us. But even as we (rea­son­ably) shrink away from the idea of be­com­ing a “hap­pi­ness pump,” Singer doesn’t want to let us off the hook. He wants us to think, _all the time_, about whether there might be more we can do (than what­ever it is we’re do­ing) to help other peo­ple. So now we need to ask a new ques­tion: When, if ever, are we al­lowed to ig­nore the moral op­por­tu­nity cost of some mun­dane, ev­ery­day de­ci­sion?

### Ev­ery Pair of Loafers Is a Hu­man Life: The Pe­ter Singer Story

The peo­ple at the top of the hu­man food chain are ba­si­cally aliens—they live lives we can’t pos­si­bly imag­ine. (And I say that as an ex­tremely well-paid TV com­edy writer.) Tele­com bil­lion­aire John Mal­one owns more than 2.2 mil­lion acres of land in the United States. That means he owns prop­erty greater than the size of Del­a­ware plus all of New York City plus Hous­ton. Larry El­li­son, who founded Or­a­cle Cor­po­ra­tion, got bored a few years ago and bought an en­tire Hawai­ian Is­land. The peo­ple at the far end of the “crazy rich” bell curve don’t in­habit the same planet as you and I, so on the rare oc­ca­sion when they emerge from what­ever James Bond su­pervil­lain vol­cano they live in and in­ter­act with the real world, their ac­tions draw in­tense scru­tiny. When wild­fires ripped through Aus­tralia in 2019, Ama­zon CEO Jeff Be­zos, the world’s rich­est man, an­nounced that his com­pany would pledge $1 mil­lion AUD ($690,000 USD) in aid. For this he was roundly, and ap­pro­pri­ately, dunked on—peo­ple pointed out that Be­zos had made that much money ev­ery five min­utes _for the en­tire year_. Then, pre­dictably, peo­ple be­gan to re­view what else Be­zos had re­cently spent his money on. For ex­am­ple, he’d plunked down $42 mil­lion to build a clock in a hol­lowed-out moun­tain in Texas that was de­signed to last for ten thou­sand years. So, $42 mil­lion for weirdo fu­tur­is­tic alien su­per clock… $690,000 to save a con­ti­nent? Barely a month later, Be­zos an­nounced he would do­nate _$10 bil­lion_ over the next decade to fight cli­mate change, and it’s hard not to see a con­nec­tion be­tween his pub­lic pil­lo­ry­ing and his sud­den in­ter­est in large-scale al­tru­ism. (See? Shame can be good!)

It’s nat­u­ral and cor­rect for us to de­mand that the peo­ple who can do the most ac­tu­ally _do_ the most. But what’s “the most”? How much are they on the hook for in any given sit­u­a­tion, and when should we feel like they’ve met their obli­ga­tions? Singer’s cri­tique of Bill Gates’s char­i­ta­ble giv­ing shook me up, so I went look­ing for other stuff he’d writ­ten, and man oh man—if you’re ever in­ter­ested in feel­ing morally in­ad­e­quate, read a bunch of Pe­ter Singer books. His 100 per­cent pure, un­cut util­i­tar­i­an­ism can lead to very weird places—like shrug­ging off $30 bil­lion in char­i­ta­ble gifts—but he car­ries one sim­ple idea through­out ev­ery­thing he writes: there is no dif­fer­ence in the in­her­ent value of a life _over here_—wher­ever “here” is, for us—than there is in a life _over there_. To prove his point, he of­fers a com­pelling thought ex­per­i­ment, which I’ll sim­plify and para­phrase.

Imag­ine we’re walk­ing by a shal­low pond, and we see a drown­ing child. Most peo­ple agree that we have a moral re­spon­si­bil­ity to act—we should rush into the knee-high wa­ter and, you know, grab the kid so he doesn’t, you know, drown. But what if we saw the drown­ing child, and we thought to our­selves, “You know, I _should_ save that child, but I just bought these new Ital­ian loafers, and I re­ally don’t want to ruin them. So… good luck, kid!” And then we just walked on by, per­haps whistling a happy lit­tle ditty about how soft and leath­ery our loafers are. We would, of course, be con­sid­ered hor­ri­ble, aw­ful peo­ple—worse even than a guy with $53 bil­lion who gives none of it to char­ity, prob­a­bly, be­cause what was re­quired of us was so ba­sic and our rea­son for not do­ing it was so cal­lous. Choos­ing to save our loafers in­stead of a hu­man be­ing means we’re ei­ther sadists, or so­ciopaths, or Ayn Rand acolytes, or all three. Peo­ple would tweet about us and drag us for our aw­ful­ness, and they’d be right to do it.

But again, most peo­ple aren’t mon­sters. Most of us would in­stantly cal­cu­late that a hu­man life is worth more than a pair of Ital­ian loafers, and we would wade into the pond and try to save the kid. But here’s Singer’s point: We know for a fact that there are chil­dren drown­ing in ponds, lit­eral and metaphor­i­cal, all over the world, _right now_. We see ad­ver­tise­ments ask­ing for thirty cents a day to help a starv­ing child in Yemen, or get mail from an or­ga­ni­za­tion telling us that a dol­lar a week can save a hu­man life in Syria, and more of­ten than not we ig­nore them. In fact, we’re _an­noyed_ by them. Yet a dol­lar a week is a lot less than we would’ve spent on those Ital­ian loafers. Why do we value a life _over there_ less than we value a life _over here_? Why does the pond have to be lit­er­ally in front of our faces in or­der for us to act?

When Singer con­ducts this thought ex­per­i­ment in his classes, stu­dents of­ten cite rea­son­able con­cerns with the trans­ac­tion—we’d be giv­ing money to an or­ga­ni­za­tion we _think_ is sav­ing lives, but some of it prob­a­bly gets si­phoned off into bu­reau­cracy, and the ac­tual im­pact of the money is sort of vague. Singer then points out that the cost to us is so small—pen­nies, re­ally—so even if the money is only, say, 25 per­cent as im­pact­ful as promised, isn’t that a deal worth mak­ing? Yeah, I know—hard to quib­ble with, right? And fi­nally, Singer asks us to take the log­i­cal next step: col­lect all the money we were _go­ing_ to spend on Ital­ian loafers, or new jeans, or a new iPhone we don’t re­ally need, and send it to some­one else, some­where in the world, to help that per­son live a bet­ter life (or pos­si­bly: live at all). He asks us to make a full and com­plete util­i­tar­ian sac­ri­fice—give up the small amount of plea­sure we get from a new lamp or what­ever, and dra­mat­i­cally de­crease the amount of pain be­ing felt by some­one fac­ing chal­lenges we can hardly imag­ine.

Singer knows he’s onto some­thing here. A lot of us buy tons of things we don’t need, and the sim­ple act of point­ing out how much more we could do with our money spot­lights our own ex­ces­sive con­sumerism. In fact, when we start look­ing at all of the dumb crap we’ve ac­cu­mu­lated in our houses—all the un­nec­es­sary throw pil­lows and ex­tra sweaters we never wear and $800 au­to­graphed base­ball bats—we re­al­ize that Singer is of­fer­ing us the deal of a life­time: We can be he­roes! Ev­ery sin­gle one of us can be Os­kar Schindler. Granted, Schindler saved lives by risk­ing his own while un­der the op­pres­sive eye of a fas­cist regime, and we’re just sit­ting around watch­ing _Juras­sic Park_ on TNT and eat­ing honey-roasted peanuts… but _we can lit­er­ally save peo­ple’s lives_, just like he did. All we have to do is _not_ buy that lamp, and in­stead send the thirty bucks to a mos­quito net char­ity in Africa, and then wait for Steven Spiel­berg to make an Os­car-win­ning movie about our sac­ri­fice and brav­ery.

But then we re­mem­ber the cau­tion­ary tale of the hap­pi­ness pump, and won­der where this ends for us—sit­ting in an empty house, down to our last can of honey-roasted peanuts? Sud­denly we’re back in that gray area, won­der­ing at what point we’re al­lowed to just buy dumb stuff we want and not feel a util­i­tar­ian guilt be­cause we aren’t us­ing the money for some­thing more im­por­tant. It’s im­pos­si­ble to know!

Ex­cept no, it isn’t, says Singer, chan­nel­ing his in­ner Ben­tham: you can cal­cu­late it.

Singer be­lieves that there is a cer­tain amount of money we need for a ba­sic life—food, shel­ter, a mod­icum of en­ter­tain­ment or leisure, and so on. That amount varies de­pend­ing on our cir­cum­stances—how many kids we have, where we live, etc.—but it’s cal­cu­la­ble. We can fig­ure out how much we ac­tu­ally need, build in a lit­tle pad for sav­ings and med­i­cal emer­gen­cies and the like, and _any amount of money we make be­yond that_ we should give to some­one less for­tu­nate. “The for­mula is sim­ple,” he wrote in an­other _New York Times Mag­a­zine_ ar­ti­cle from 1999, “what­ever money you’re spend­ing on lux­u­ries, not ne­ces­si­ties, should be given away.” Singer is the con­se­quen­tial­ist an­swer to Im­manuel Kant. The dude is _hard-core_. His view of moral ne­ces­sity is so in­tense, I sort of pic­ture him look­ing like Tom Hardy in _Mad Max: Fury Road_. A post­punk, griz­zled, lone-wolf util­i­tar­ian war­rior, wan­der­ing through the desert, guided by an un­com­pro­mis­ing sense of jus­tice. In re­al­ity, he looks like this—

![[f0173-01.jpg]]

—which is a lot less in­tim­i­dat­ing.

Now we bet­ter un­der­stand his com­plaint about Gates. Do­nat­ing $30 bil­lion is won­der­ful, but if he still has $53 bil­lion, he ought to give al­most all of that away too. What does Bill Gates not have that he needs? Noth­ing. What do famine-stricken chil­dren liv­ing in Africa not have that they need? Beds, houses, food, clean wa­ter, malaria medicine, vi­ta­mins, ed­u­ca­tion, soap, and vac­cines. And what does Bill Gates _have_ that he _doesn’t_ need? Around $52.999 bil­lion dol­lars. For Singer this is a no-brainer. The amount we have above this cal­cu­la­ble “ne­ces­si­ties” to­tal might be $1, or it might be $53 bil­lion, but the ac­tion is the same: we don’t need it, so we should send it to some­one who does.

Again, we should point out the very rea­son­able ob­jec­tions to his com­mand. First: For most peo­ple, pay­ing for ne­ces­si­ties, adding a bit for en­ter­tain­ment, and sav­ing a lit­tle ex­tra for a rainy day doesn’t _feel_ very safe. Ev­ery one of us will at some point con­front a cat­a­strophic “black swan”–type event—a car crash, an ill­ness, a busi­ness deal gone wrong, a friend or rel­a­tive in ex­treme need. We also (if we can) want to save for even­tual re­tire­ment, or to help our fu­ture kids and maybe grand­kids with their lives. If we give all our money away and then sud­denly need some for a dire per­sonal sit­u­a­tion, we prob­a­bly won’t be com­forted by the knowl­edge that our money was used to de­worm a river in Malawi, im­prov­ing the health of thou­sands of chil­dren.

Though _some_ of us would, ap­par­ently. There are anec­dotes in Singer’s books _The Life You Can Save_ and _The Most Good You Can Do_ that in­volve peo­ple giv­ing one of their kid­neys away—not to a spe­cific per­son, mind you, just to “who­ever needs it”—as part of a move­ment called “ef­fec­tive al­tru­ism.” (Singer’s acolytes are as hard-core as he is.) Part of the cal­cu­la­tion these folks do, when do­nat­ing their kid­neys, in­volves the fact that the chances of dy­ing from only hav­ing one kid­ney are roughly 1 in 4,000—ba­si­cally the same odds as be­ing killed by a car while rid­ing a bi­cy­cle. That means, to them, that by _not_ giv­ing their ex­tra kid­ney away, they are valu­ing their own lives as 4,000 times more im­por­tant than the lives of anony­mous strangers. De­spite that math­e­mat­i­cal logic, most of us can’t help but hes­i­tate at the thought of just… giv­ing away a kid­ney. Most of us have fam­ily or close friends for whom we’re a the­o­ret­i­cal donor—what if our child needed a kid­ney in a few years, but we couldn’t help her be­cause we’d yanked one out to sat­isfy the dic­tates of an Aus­tralian ethi­cist we’ve never met? Or what if our one re­main­ing kid­ney failed and we were put in the po­si­tion of ask­ing one of our fam­ily mem­bers to give _us_ a kid­ney? That’s no fun ei­ther. The fact that the odds of these things hap­pen­ing are small is ir­rel­e­vant. The very thought of them gives us chills.[^4]

An­other com­plaint about Singer’s world­view is that he’s _su­per_ not into sup­port­ing what we might call “cul­tural” char­i­ties. When kids are lit­er­ally dy­ing, he says, it’s hard to jus­tify ig­nor­ing their pain and send­ing your an­nual char­i­ta­ble gift to a lo­cal art mu­seum or sym­phony or­ches­tra. Again, hard to ar­gue with the logic of that state­ment, but also: Or­ches­tras are nice! For some peo­ple, they are in­cred­i­bly mean­ing­ful and vi­tal to their hu­man ex­pe­ri­ence. It seems al­most cruel to chas­tise those peo­ple for giv­ing money to the or­ches­tra, us­ing the pre­ventable death of chil­dren as a club to bash them with. Singer’s point is im­por­tant and well-taken—some char­i­ties are ob­jec­tively bet­ter than oth­ers, and the ef­fec­tive al­tru­ism move­ment de­serves a ton of credit for re­search­ing and high­light­ing those wor­thy of our money.[^5] But this line of at­tack can feel like a cousin of my Saab bumper move: you shouldn’t care about _this_, be­cause _that_ is so much worse. _Oh, you want to give the art mu­seum a hun­dred bucks? That’s cool. You could lit­er­ally save twenty hu­man lives with that money, but no, go ahead, star­ing at a Bran­cusi sculp­ture is also im­por­tant I guess._

Singer’s ar­gu­ments can be frus­trat­ing in their in­flex­i­bil­ity. Again, their ba­sic logic is in­escapable, and we find our­selves re­peat­edly butting up against that logic even as we _feel_ that it’s un­fair. That’s why, when I bought that ex­pen­sive but ut­terly “un­nec­es­sary” au­to­graphed bat af­ter the Red Sox won the World Se­ries, I mo­men­tar­ily got bummed out. I felt the specter of Pe­ter Singer glar­ing at me. _Eight hun­dred bucks for a bat, huh? Noth­ing bet­ter you could do with that money?_ “Leave me alone, Pe­ter Singer!” I replied, hope­fully not out loud, though I can’t say defini­tively whether or not it was out loud. “This mat­ters to me! Let me do this!” The specter of Pe­ter Singer was un­moved. _Okay, man. It’s your money. But real quick, why don’t you head over to Ox­fam’s web­site and take a peek at a few sto­ries about peo­ple liv­ing in ab­ject poverty?_

Re­mem­ber Bernard Williams and his crit­i­cism of util­i­tar­i­an­ism? He said that it de­nies us our in­tegrity—our sense of be­ing a whole and un­di­vided per­son—and sac­ri­fices our in­di­vid­ual core projects in the name of a non­spe­cific mass hu­man “hap­pi­ness.” Util­i­tar­i­an­ism can some­times deny us the things that make us “us.” Williams would find ab­surd the idea that I did some­thing morally wrong by buy­ing my son a present cel­e­brat­ing a mo­ment that we lov­ingly shared, and which rep­re­sents an in­te­gral bond­ing ex­pe­ri­ence. Ul­ti­mately, that’s where I per­son­ally land too—aligned with Williams and Su­san Wolf, who warned us against seek­ing moral saint­hood. Our lives are our own, and we shouldn’t feel bad about fill­ing them with ex­pe­ri­ences and even ob­jects that give those lives shape and di­men­sion. Fol­low­ing Singer’s logic, I shouldn’t have gone to that game at all, re­ally, be­cause World Se­ries tick­ets are ex­pen­sive. We maybe shouldn’t have bought na­chos and a hot dog for my son, we shouldn’t have paid for park­ing… in fact, I prob­a­bly shouldn’t pay for the spe­cial MLB ca­ble pack­age that lets me watch Red Sox games. It can get very silly, very quickly.

But Singer, dammit, has a point.

We do a lot of dumb stuff that we don’t need to do, and when we do that dumb stuff, we very rarely think about the moral op­por­tu­nity cost—the other, bet­ter things we _could_ be do­ing in­stead. Singer’s un­re­lent­ing fo­cus on moral op­por­tu­nity cost is why I love him, buz­zkills and all—his un­com­pro­mis­ing util­i­tar­i­an­ism serves an im­por­tant func­tion. In 2019 he rere­leased his book _The Life You Can Save_ and asked me to write an in­tro­duc­tion.[^6] Af­ter dis­cussing all of the an­noy­ing things a reader can feel when div­ing into Singer’s work, I[^7] wrote:

> More im­por­tant than what you feel when you read this book is what you will _not_ feel: com­pla­cency. You will not feel like other peo­ple don’t mat­ter. You will not blithely scroll past re­ports of dis­as­ters, whether abroad or close to home, with­out con­sid­er­ing—even if just for a mo­ment—the im­pacted lives of those af­fected. In­stead, you will have, bounc­ing around in your head, the thought that there may be some­thing sim­ple you can do to help, some­thing that does not dis­rupt your life or put you or your fam­ily’s well-be­ing in peril.

That, to me, is the gift Singer gives us: It’s _in­cred­i­bly_ easy for peo­ple liv­ing in even mod­est com­fort to be­come com­pla­cent—to for­get that the great ma­jor­ity of peo­ple on earth live in some de­gree of poverty or dis­tress, and have daily prob­lems and dan­gers that far sur­pass our own. Air-con­di­tion­ing, heat, food, clean wa­ter, a wash­ing ma­chine, a re­frig­er­a­tor, am­ple elec­tric­ity, medicine, safety from war or crime—these are things many of us take for granted, and most peo­ple can’t count on. Singer is like a com­pla­cency alert sys­tem.[^8] He’s here to tap us on the shoul­der—_tap tap tap!_—to re­mind us how for­tu­nate we are, and to ask if we might con­sider do­ing a bit more to help a few more peo­ple.

Singer has plenty of de­trac­tors in the aca­demic world. His shoul­der-tap­ping doesn’t make us feel good—and frankly, it’s not sup­posed to. No one wants to feel like we’re con­stantly screw­ing up, so when an in­tim­i­dat­ing Aus­tralian road war­rior with a sawed-off shot­gun (still the way I think of him, can’t help it) points out that we can nearly _al­ways_ do more good if we make dif­fer­ent choices—who ques­tions our de­ci­sion-mak­ing _ev­ery sin­gle time_ we go to a movie or buy jeans—well, it kind of sucks. It’s even more painful and an­noy­ing to be told that the lit­eral cost of those jeans is _ten hu­man lives_. How­ever, we also want to be peo­ple who _care_ and _try_, and Singer’s shoul­der-tap­ping can help with that. The crux of what we’re talk­ing about here is, again, en­gage­ment—the sim­ple act of ask­ing our­selves: _What am I do­ing? Is there some­thing bet­ter I could be do­ing?_ Con­fronting our be­hav­ior may be painful and an­noy­ing, but it’s also a rem­edy for ap­a­thy, which is the en­emy of im­prove­ment. We can hardly hope to hit an Aris­totelian mean of civil en­gage­ment if we feel no con­se­quences when we un­der­per­form.

The Covid-19 cri­sis led to in­spir­ing sto­ries, like land­lords for­giv­ing rent pay­ments and cit­i­zens band­ing to­gether to de­liver food to the el­derly and in­firm. It also led to _aw­ful_ sto­ries, about other land­lords evict­ing peo­ple with­out mercy, and com­pa­nies forc­ing their em­ploy­ees to work with in­ad­e­quate pro­tec­tion.[^9] There were fundrais­ers for front­line health­care work­ers, and mis­er­able pro­jec­tions of how this would af­fect the poor and dis­ad­van­taged, and through it all many peo­ple won­dered the same thing: What are _my_ re­spon­si­bil­i­ties? How much should _I_ do to help? I be­lieve the an­swer (in this sit­u­a­tion, and oth­ers like it) starts with Scan­lon and then drifts over to Singer. When a pub­lic health cri­sis af­fects ev­ery­one on earth at the same mo­ment, the min­i­mum re­quire­ments for all of us—the rules no rea­son­able per­son would re­ject, the ba­sic things we owe to each other—are easy to de­ter­mine and non-ne­go­tiable: we need to limit our travel to the best of our abil­ity, main­tain so­cial dis­tanc­ing, wear masks, and so on. Af­ter that—and this is where Singer comes back into the pic­ture—our re­spon­si­bil­i­ties scale up de­pend­ing on our so­cioe­co­nomic sit­u­a­tions. As one ex­am­ple, if we have peo­ple who work for us in some ca­pac­ity—dog walk­ers, babysit­ters, and so on—and we can af­ford to pay them (whether a whole or par­tial salary) even if they aren’t _ac­tively_ work­ing for us dur­ing a shut­down, we should. In a cri­sis, peo­ple lucky enough to have money to spare ought to give it to peo­ple who need it.

At the top of the food chain we find peo­ple like Jeff Be­zos and bil­lion­aire me­dia im­pre­sario David Gef­fen, who given their wealth (I’d ar­gue) have the _great­est_ re­spon­si­bil­ity to help other peo­ple. Which, when Covid-19 hit, they of­ten did not. Early in the cri­sis, Ama­zon started a Go­FundMe cam­paign to raise money for its work­ers,[^10] which went over about as well as it had when Be­zos tossed $690,000 at Aus­tralia to help fight wild­fires. A ba­sic cal­cu­la­tion shows that Be­zos could per­son­ally pay all of his 250,000 min­i­mum-wage em­ploy­ees their full yearly salaries and still have about _$175 bil­lion_ left over. When you are the world’s rich­est man, and you em­ploy hun­dreds of thou­sands of peo­ple who are in harm’s way, your re­spon­si­bil­i­ties ex­tend far be­yond “pay your dog walker.” Gef­fen, not to be out­done, at one point posted an In­sta­gram photo of his $590 mil­lion yacht sail­ing peace­fully in the Grenadines, along with an unironic cap­tion about the im­por­tance of so­cial dis­tanc­ing. If you’re won­der­ing how that went over, he quickly set his ac­count to pri­vate and as of this writ­ing hasn’t re­ally been heard from since.

I’m not quite as harsh re­gard­ing Gef­fen as Pe­ter Singer would be. I wouldn’t say he’s morally re­quired to sell his yacht and do­nate the money. But I would say that as a man worth bil­lions, he has a re­spon­si­bil­ity to do far more than the av­er­age per­son dur­ing a pan­demic that has dis­rupted the lives of ev­ery­one on earth. I’d also rec­om­mend he spend some of that money on a so­cial me­dia con­sul­tant, so that when he tries to post a pic­ture of his $590 mil­lion yacht the same week a record num­ber of Amer­i­cans lose their jobs, there’d be some­one to grab his phone and toss it into the ocean.

### Mod­ern Life’s Most Ex­as­per­at­ing Mis­take: The Well-In­ten­tioned Screw-Up

Singer’s moral shoul­der-tap­ping—_tap tap tap!_—does a very good job of re­mind­ing us, when we spend our time and money, that there may be ways we can spend it bet­ter. But some­times, we hit an­other snag. The prob­lem isn’t al­ways that we spent money with­out think­ing about whether we could use it to do more good in the world. Some­times we _ac­tu­ally tried_ to do some good—we lis­tened to Singer, dammit!—and just like with our well-in­ten­tioned good­ness seeker from the in­tro­duc­tion, the world smacked us in the face any­way.

In 2004 I moved to Los An­ge­les and had to get a car for the first time in my life. I set­tled on a mid­size sedan that was kind of ex­pen­sive, but it looked cool and got good safety rat­ings. Af­ter about three months I hated it—not be­cause it wasn’t fun to drive, which it was, and not be­cause driv­ing around L.A. is mis­er­able no mat­ter what car you’re driv­ing, which it is. I just hated how much gas it used. As a per­son who talked a lot about the neg­a­tive en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact of in­ter­nal com­bus­tion en­gines, I felt (ap­pro­pri­ately) like a hyp­ocrite for driv­ing a car that got like sev­en­teen miles to a gal­lon.

So as soon as the lease was up, I got a Toy­ota Prius, which at the time was among the most fuel-ef­fi­cient cars avail­able, av­er­ag­ing be­tween thirty-eight and fifty miles per gal­lon. Much bet­ter! I felt like less of a hyp­ocrite. Un­til a friend of mine told me that the way the Prius’s hy­brid bat­ter­ies were man­u­fac­tured was ac­tu­ally, in toto, _more_ harm­ful to the en­vi­ron­ment than a reg­u­lar gas-pow­ered car, for rea­sons that now es­cape me. (Some­thing some­thing chem­i­cals in the bat­ter­ies some­thing some­thing ground­wa­ter leak­age some­thing some­thing.) While re­search­ing whether that was true, I read an ar­ti­cle about how fully-elec­tric cars were now emerg­ing onto the mar­ket and vowed to make one of them my next pur­chase… un­til I then read a _very_ stri­dent ar­ti­cle about how that would ac­tu­ally be _worse_, be­cause the elec­tric­ity on the Cal­i­for­nia grid still mostly came from coal-burn­ing power plants,[^11] so un­less you had a so­lar grid pow­er­ing your car, you were ac­tu­ally do­ing _more_ harm by driv­ing a fully elec­tric ve­hi­cle, you dummy, and then I had a panic at­tack and lay on the floor and put a cold com­press on my head.

So, we’re back to Moral Ex­haus­tion.[^12] But this is a new, more vir­u­lent strain of Moral Ex­haus­tion[^13]—one where we’re some­how pun­ished even when we do some­thing that’s bet­ter than what­ever we were do­ing be­fore. And worse yet, we’re of­ten con­fronted by peo­ple who crit­i­cize us for screw­ing up. _How could you sup­port this per­son for Con­gress—don’t you know that he voted for the Iraq War? How could you buy these pa­per tow­els—the par­ent com­pany pol­lutes rivers! How could you see that movie, eat this food, travel to that coun­try, play this brand of bag­pipes?_[^14] It seems like ev­ery time we think we’ve made a good de­ci­sion, even if we’ve re­searched the is­sue and feel we’ve gone with the best op­tion, some­one writes an ar­ti­cle ex­plain­ing why we’re ac­tu­ally Part of the Prob­lem. Plus, an­noy­ingly, some of our friends and fam­ily mem­bers and help­ful on­line ac­quain­tances ab­so­lutely _de­light_ in point­ing out where we’ve gone wrong. _Oh, you like peanut but­ter and jelly sand­wiches? That’s nice. Guess you don’t care about the ELEVEN MIL­LION CHIL­DREN who SUF­FER from PEANUT AL­LER­GIES and could LIT­ER­ALLY DIE be­cause of your SELF­ISH LUNCH CHOICES. #how­dareyou #peanutjus­tice4all #Choosy­Mom­sChooseLIFE._

This eth­i­cal dilemma feels unique to our age: When in­for­ma­tion is so read­ily avail­able, how do we es­cape the guilt (or shame) that comes from learn­ing about our un­in­ten­tion­ally bad de­ci­sions? No one in 340 BCE un­der­stood the detri­men­tal ef­fects of per­sonal choices on wildlife ecosys­tems. But now we know _ev­ery­thing_, and if we don’t, there are plenty of peo­ple who do (or at least pre­tend to) and thor­oughly en­joy ex­plain­ing to us how we’re blow­ing it. It’s a sec­ond-level eth­i­cal dilemma: How do we re­spond to the un­in­tended eth­i­cal dilem­mas that some­times re­sult from our at­tempts to solve eth­i­cal dilem­mas? This is a real twisty pret­zel of a sit­u­a­tion, and seems like a job for Aris­to­tle and his “What kind of per­son should I be?” ap­proach. So, Aris­to­tle, how much should we care about the pos­si­bil­ity that we’ll act with as much virtue as we can muster and still get punched in the gut?

A virtue ethi­cist might say, well, if we worry _too much_ about the un­fore­seen ills of some­thing we did, it might drive us into a sort of paral­y­sis, where all we do is con­sider and re­con­sider the po­ten­tial ef­fects of our ac­tions, so con­cerned with the­o­ret­i­cally bad out­comes from even the sim­plest de­ci­sions that we just ner­vously pace and twitch when try­ing to de­ter­mine which brand of canned peaches to buy. But a _de­fi­ciency_ of car­ing about un­in­tended con­se­quences might send us ca­reen­ing back to­ward ap­a­thy—not car­ing _at all_ about the fact that things can go un­ex­pect­edly wrong when we do stuff threat­ens to turn us into peo­ple who don’t give a crap about any­thing we do. There is some golden mean we should find, wherein we think things through as much as we can but for­give our­selves when our well-in­ten­tioned ac­tions have some dele­te­ri­ous ef­fect.

I wanted to avoid the hypocrisy of driv­ing a car that got bad gas mileage while call­ing for other peo­ple to curb their fos­sil fuel use. That in­con­gruity made me feel crummy and em­bar­rassed, be­cause hypocrisy stinks. It’s one of the most in­fu­ri­at­ing traits we can dis­play. (Our old friend Ju­dith Shk­lar wrote a whole chap­ter on hypocrisy, which she, you might imag­ine, doesn’t care for.) But there’s also a dif­fer­ence be­tween my orig­i­nal hypocrisy (driv­ing a car I knew was bad for the en­vi­ron­ment) and my _ac­ci­den­tal_ hypocrisy (driv­ing a car that was bet­ter for the en­vi­ron­ment than the gas-guz­zler, but _ac­ci­den­tally_ harm­ful in a dif­fer­ent way). If Aris­to­tle helped get us through the ini­tial wave of con­fu­sion and guilt, some kind of Kan­tian-like ap­proach—fac­tor­ing in my good in­ten­tions—may take us the rest of the way.

Just as in the pre­vi­ous chap­ter, when we hoped that Deb the Free-Rid­ing Ninja would ac­knowl­edge her own short­com­ings so as not to nudge her Over­ton win­dow to­ward worse be­hav­ior, we need to be our own judges. Let’s say we give fifty bucks to the Save the Amer­i­can Pel­i­cans Fund, which pro­tects threat­ened wet­lands where pel­i­cans live, and then our friend Nancy finds out and yells at us: “You fool!” she screams. “Save the Amer­i­can Pel­i­cans Fund is a ter­ri­ble char­ity! You should’ve given to the Amer­i­can Fund to Save the Pel­i­cans—ev­ery­one knows _that’s_ the only good pel­i­can char­ity!” First of all, Nancy, chill out, you’re spit­ting on us. And sec­ond, it was an hon­est mis­take—we _in­tended_ to help the pel­i­cans, and we acted in good faith. Our in­stinct might be to just throw up our hands—how could we have known this was such a ter­ri­ble blun­der? We don’t have a month of free time to de­vote to re­search­ing a mil­lion sim­i­lar-sound­ing pel­i­can char­i­ties, Nancy![15](footnote.xhtml#footnote-037) But if we let the an­noy­ance of mak­ing a mis­take (or be­ing shamed by it) af­fect us too much, we might de­cide it’s point­less to ever try to help any­body, ever, be­cause who needs the headache? Bet­ter to fo­cus on the fact that the _idea_ was good—give money to a char­ity—even if the _re­sult_ was less than ideal. The Kan­tian world­view seems _re­ally_ at­trac­tive now; by buy­ing a Prius, or do­nat­ing to char­ity, we’re ac­tively try­ing to fol­low a Kan­tian maxim: help other peo­ple when we can, make the world bet­ter, do our part to solve a sys­temic prob­lem. If we later get sideswiped by a rot­ten out­come, even Kant—that sniff­ing, un­pleasable moral snob—would ac­knowl­edge that we didn’t do any­thing “wrong.” We tried, we failed, we’ll try to be bet­ter next time. And also maybe we’ll cut back on the time we spend with Nancy, who’s a lit­tle much.

Try again. Fail again. Fail bet­ter.[^16] It’s the best we can do, and of­ten, even if we’ve bought into that phi­los­o­phy, it doesn’t feel that great to live this way. The more care­fully we ex­am­ine our de­ci­sions, the more tempt­ing it seems to ig­nore all the moral dilem­mas we’ll in­evitably dis­cover. They’re so com­pli­cated and an­noy­ing that we might con­clude it’s eas­ier—and no worse in eth­i­cal terms—to sim­ply keep do­ing what we were al­ready do­ing.

… I mean, is that an op­tion? Maybe?

    

## CHAP­TER TEN This Sand­wich Is Morally Prob­lem­atic. But It’s Also De­li­cious. Can I Still Eat It?

In the sum­mer of 2012, Dan T. Cathy, the CEO of fast food chain Chick-fil-A, joined _The Ken Cole­man Show_ (a syn­di­cated ra­dio pro­gram) and spoke out against gay mar­riage. Be­cause what that de­bate needed, ap­par­ently, was the “chicken sand­wich fran­chise owner” point of view. Here’s what he said:

> I think we are invit­ing God’s judg­ment on our na­tion when we shake our fist at Him and say, “We know bet­ter than you as to what con­sti­tutes a mar­riage.” I pray God’s mercy on our gen­er­a­tion that has such a pride­ful, ar­ro­gant at­ti­tude to think that we have the au­dac­ity to de­fine what mar­riage is about.

If you don’t re­mem­ber what hap­pened af­ter that, you can prob­a­bly guess. LGBTQ+ groups called for boy­cotts. Anti gay–mar­riage politi­cians and ad­vo­cates posted pic­tures of them­selves proudly eat­ing Chick-fil-A sand­wiches. Ev­ery­body started yelling.

At the time, I was work­ing on the show _Parks and Recre­ation_, and the writ­ers’ room was up in arms.[^1] I had never eaten at Chick-fil-A and casually posited that I never would now, be­cause I didn’t want to sup­port an or­ga­ni­za­tion that didn’t be­lieve in the ba­sic hu­man (and Con­sti­tu­tional) free­dom to marry who­ever one wants to marry. You can imag­ine how shocked I was when a few of the writ­ers said they would con­tinue to go to Chick-fil-A with­out hes­i­ta­tion. When I asked them why, they gave sev­eral rea­sons:

- Not go­ing wouldn’t make a dif­fer­ence, re­ally, be­cause one per­son’s chicken or­der is a drop in the cor­po­rate profit bucket.
- Their chicken sand­wiches are _so good_.
- Not pa­tron­iz­ing the store would only hurt the em­ploy­ees who worked there, some of whom might be laid off if busi­ness sank, so re­ally we’d only be hurt­ing _them_.
- Se­ri­ously, though, their chicken sand­wiches are amaz­ing.
- Ev­ery other fast food restau­rant CEO is prob­a­bly just as bad on po­lit­i­cal and so­cial is­sues, so where do you draw the line?
- The pick­les they put on their sand­wiches? In­cred­i­ble.

This stunned me. Here were sev­eral good friends of mine, whom I knew to hold LGBTQ+ rights as some­thing of a core value, punt­ing on a pretty sim­ple act of re­sis­tance… for the sake of a chicken sand­wich?

We de­bated this for hours, and got nowhere. I found it end­lessly frus­trat­ing that those on the op­po­site side of the de­bate con­ceded the points I made and _still_ shrugged and said they wouldn’t change their fast food habits. They also whatabouted me like crazy—bring­ing up artists or stores I pa­tron­ized in or­der to point out that I wasn’t so per­fect ei­ther, points _I_ then had to con­cede and which made me think: “Well, maybe they’re right. Maybe it isn’t that big a deal to buy a sand­wich from Chick-fil-A, even now. Maybe I’m over­re­act­ing?”

This de­bate ex­em­pli­fied one of the thorni­est moral is­sues of our time: Can we sep­a­rate the things we like from the peo­ple who make them? And should we?

### A Fun Lit­tle Moral Sur­prise: Ev­ery­thing We Love Is Ter­ri­ble!

We all have at least a dozen prob­lem­atic per­sonal affini­ties. We root for the Kan­sas City Chiefs, At­lanta Braves, Flor­ida State Semi­noles, or some other sports team that cal­lously dresses its mas­cot in an of­fen­sive Na­tive Amer­i­can cos­tume. We cheer for ath­letes who have com­mit­ted do­mes­tic abuse, hold re­pug­nant po­lit­i­cal views, take banned per­for­mance-en­hanc­ing sub­stances, or cheat in some other way. We watch and love en­ter­tain­ment made by Woody Allen, Ro­man Polan­ski, or Brett Rat­ner, pro­duced by Les Moonves, Scott Rudin, or Har­vey We­in­stein, star­ring Sean Penn, James Woods, Mel Gib­son, or Char­lie Sheen. We lis­ten to mu­sic by Michael Jack­son, Eric Clap­ton, R. Kelly, or Placido Domingo. If we don’t know of at least one per­son or thing whose ac­tions make it prob­lem­atic for us to be their ac­tive fan, it’s only be­cause we’re her­mits who haven’t looked at the in­ter­net in twenty years.[^2] Here’s our old friend Moral Ex­haus­tion,[^3] with an­other new fun twist. It’s hard enough to fig­ure out what we’re sup­posed to _do_ all the time—now we have to be re­spon­si­ble for what we _like_?

We’ve been sad­dled with this prob­lem for a long time, but only re­cently did we re­ally start to care about it. An in­crease in cul­tural con­ver­sa­tion around top­ics of so­cial jus­tice, more so­cial me­dia sham­ing, and an emerg­ing aware­ness that maybe it’s not okay to as­sault women or use other cul­tures as Hal­loween cos­tumes have meant that peo­ple’s bad ac­tions are much more likely to be ex­posed, and thus _we_ are much more likely to be called to ac­count for watch­ing, lis­ten­ing to, and root­ing for them. But here’s the prob­lem: It’s not just that so many of the peo­ple we love, who have made great art or sung great mu­sic or hit key home runs in the World Se­ries, are morally prob­lem­atic. It’s that they’re _the peo­ple we love_. They’re the peo­ple whose art and ac­com­plish­ments helped us form our iden­ti­ties, bond with our par­ents and friends, de­fine our child­hoods. We _love_ them. Some of us can’t even swear off a chicken sand­wich af­ter a pro­vin­cial goober burps up some ho­mo­pho­bia on a ra­dio show—so what hap­pens when we hear that our all-time fa­vorite singer or ac­tor or sports hero has done some­thing aw­ful? We are emo­tion­ally in­ter­wo­ven with the parts of the cul­ture that shaped our iden­tity, so just de­tach­ing our­selves from them is _painful_. It’s not like re­mov­ing a splin­ter—it’s more like am­pu­tat­ing a limb. Or, to ex­tend the pre­vi­ous metaphor: it’s not just that the chicken sand­wiches taste re­ally good—it’s that the chef is our best friend.

There are two sub­cat­e­gories to this dilemma. The first we might think of as “Bad Things We Love That Can Change.” And we’ll use as our ex­am­ple the mis­er­able, aw­ful story of the foot­ball team for­merly known as the Wash­ing­ton R*dskins. (Note: I will be quot­ing ar­ti­cles that used the ac­tual slur and will leave it in­tact for clar­ity, so pro­ceed with cau­tion.)

### Sce­nario 1: The Leop­ard Can, but Won’t, Change His Spots

Daniel Sny­der bought the fran­chise in 1999, and as of this writ­ing they’ve since com­piled a record of 149-202-1. They have mostly stunk, due in large part to the fact that Sny­der is—and I don’t use this term lightly—a doo­fus. He has done so many doofy things since buy­ing the team that in 2010 a jour­nal­ist named Dave McKenna wrote a piece for the _Wash­ing­ton City Pa­per_ called “The Cranky Red­skins Fan’s Guide to Dan Sny­der” in which he listed some­thing bone­headed, of­fen­sive, or thought­less Sny­der had done for ev­ery let­ter of the al­pha­bet. The list was damn­ing and thor­ough, but in­stead of ex­am­in­ing his be­hav­ior and vow­ing to im­prove, Sny­der sued the _City Pa­per_ for defama­tion and de­manded $2 mil­lion in dam­ages. Which is a clas­sic doo­fus move.[^4]

The con­tro­versy over the team’s plainly racist nick­name[^5]—a point of con­tention since long be­fore Sny­der took over—was thus over­seen by a very big doo­fus for more than two decades, and it went about as well as you might imag­ine. In 2013, af­ter yet an­other ex­tremely rea­son­able call from Na­tive groups to rec­og­nize the nick­name as of­fen­sive, Sny­der said this:

> We will never change the name of the team. As a life­long Red­skins fan, and [_sic_] I think that the Red­skins fans un­der­stand the great tra­di­tion and what it’s all about and what it means, so we feel pretty for­tu­nate to be just work­ing on next sea­son. We’ll never change the name. It’s that sim­ple. NEVER—you can use caps.[^6]

Sev­eral as­pects of this state­ment are of­fen­sive to me. Some of them in­volve his ter­ri­ble gram­mar and syn­tax, but the more im­por­tant ones re­late to his apolo­gia, which amounts to: It’s tra­di­tion! It’s the way it’s al­ways been done, so we can’t change it. “This is the way it’s al­ways been done” is the last de­fense of the true ig­no­ra­mus. The amount of time some­thing has been done is not, by it­self, a good rea­son to keep do­ing it. By re­ly­ing solely on prece­dent and fail­ing to crit­i­cally ex­am­ine the prob­lems that prece­dent might cre­ate for us, we’re ba­si­cally just flip­ping the mid­dle fin­ger to the idea of progress, or find­ing ways to be bet­ter peo­ple.[^7] We’re ac­tively _not_ try­ing to be bet­ter, and worse, we’re see­ing the not-try­ing as a _virtue_. This ben­e­fits no one.

Sny­der _could_ change his views, of course; he just didn’t wanna. Now, if he weren’t pow­er­ful and in­flu­en­tial, that wouldn’t re­ally mat­ter, be­cause he’d just be a crotch­ety dork in his liv­ing room bark­ing at his TV. But since he _is_ pow­er­ful and in­flu­en­tial, he be­came a bot­tle­neck for those who found the nick­name prob­lem­atic; his stance cre­ated an­guish for any Wash­ing­ton fans in fa­vor of a name change, who then had to fig­ure out what _they_ were sup­posed to do about the ten­sion be­tween their fan­dom and their be­lief sys­tem. They _love_ this par­tic­u­lar chicken sand­wich, and yet it also clashes with their un­der­stand­ing of a just and vir­tu­ous world, and Sny­der is the only guy who can make things bet­ter. When he de­fi­antly an­nounced he would never change—be­cause This Is the Way It’s Al­ways Been Done—his prob­lem be­came _their_ prob­lem.

I found a great ex­pla­na­tion for why peo­ple take this stance from the writer Jor­dan K. Ngubane, au­thor of _An African Ex­plains Apartheid_ (1963). Ngubane wrote the book in South Africa at a time when crit­i­cisms of the Apartheid regime weren’t ex­actly re­ceived well by those in power; in the pref­ace, he thanks his friends and col­leagues who helped him with the book, but does not name them for fear they would be pun­ished. (The date is listed as Au­gust 18, 1961, less than a year be­fore Nel­son Man­dela was cap­tured and spent nearly three decades in prison.) Here’s what Ngubane writes about the rea­sons an Afrikaner na­tion­al­ist might per­pet­u­ate Apartheid, even in the face of its in­her­ent moral rot:

> He sees it as a way of life, a world out­look by which to cre­ate for him­self the so­cial or­der af­ter his de­sign.… His­tory to him is a con­tin­u­ally un­fold­ing ex­pe­ri­ence whose real va­lid­ity lies not so much in its be­ing a guide to the fu­ture as in be­ing a jus­ti­fi­ca­tion.… When pressed to mod­ify it, he is be­wil­dered. In his view, all this is tan­ta­mount to say­ing he should re­nounce the world he has cre­ated for him­self.

Say­ing “this world is prob­lem­atic” amounts to say­ing “I, who have helped build this world, am prob­lem­atic.” For peo­ple deeply in­vested in _the way things are_, any change would mean con­fronting de­ci­sions they’ve made that cre­ated or sus­tained the trou­bling re­al­ity. And it doesn’t have to be some­thing as huge and so­ci­ety-wide as Apartheid. Re­cently, many peo­ple in the LGBTQ+ com­mu­nity have made re­quests re­gard­ing which pro­nouns peo­ple use when ad­dress­ing them. This might be be­cause some peo­ple are born with a phys­i­o­log­i­cal gen­der that doesn’t match the gen­der with which they iden­tify, or it might just be an aver­sion to gen­dered pro­nouns them­selves. The re­sults were pre­dictable: Some peo­ple adapted quickly, grant­ing this min­i­mally in­tru­sive re­quest. Other peo­ple… didn’t do that. They dug in their heels and re­fused to budge. They have been do­ing things a cer­tain way for a long time, they “un­der­stand” that ver­sion of their world, and any al­ter­ation of that world causes stub­born­ness or out­right panic.

But what does such a stance mean for the rest of us? When peo­ple raise an eth­i­cal is­sue and a per­son in a po­si­tion of power proudly de­clares, in all caps, that upon zero re­flec­tion he’s de­cided not to look into the mat­ter be­cause he’s def­i­nitely right, the an­guished are left with few op­tions. We don’t have to be Wash­ing­ton foot­ball fans to un­der­stand the prob­lem here, be­cause again, chances are we all love some­thing that would be eas­ier to love if it would just… change, a lit­tle. Get with the times. Adapt. It might be an older ac­tor whose in­ter­views in­volve a cringey, ret­ro­gres­sive at­ti­tude to­ward his fe­male costars, or a uni­ver­sity that still has a statue of a slave-own­ing Con­fed­er­ate gen­eral in its court­yard, or your aunt Con­nie, who’s re­ally sweet and sends you a birth­day card ev­ery year but also has some trou­bling thoughts about Mex­i­cans that she loudly shares with you ev­ery Thanks­giv­ing. When we re­al­ize the leop­ards that cause our moral an­guish won’t change their spots, we then have to make our own de­ci­sion: Do we keep sup­port­ing them, or do we cut our emo­tional and fi­nan­cial ties? To an­swer that, we can ap­ply our schools of eth­i­cal thought to Sny­der’s ac­tions—to see if he has a leg to stand on—and also to our _own_ ac­tions, to see if our sup­port of his team is morally de­fen­si­ble. (For sim­plic­ity’s sake, we’ll use Wash­ing­ton’s foot­ball team to stand in for all of these “prob­lem­atic things we love, that have the abil­ity to change.”)

We be­gin by us­ing our Quick-Start Guide: the con­trac­tu­al­ist ar­gu­ment. Could we rea­son­ably re­ject a prin­ci­ple that al­lows racist char­ac­ter­i­za­tions of per­se­cuted peo­ple to be used as team mas­cots? Of course. We’d pretty eas­ily re­ject that. In fact, if Sny­der sug­gested that rule dur­ing one of our con­trac­tu­al­ist rule-pitch­ing ses­sions, he’d be roundly laughed at—es­pe­cially since his de­fense amounts to: “I’ve been a fan of this team since I was young, and now I own them, so I can do what I want.” The ques­tion _what do we owe to each other?_ does not in­clude an ex­emp­tion clause for ei­ther “length of time you have cared about some­thing” or “be­ing rich and pow­er­ful.” Sny­der is ac­tu­ally do­ing some­thing akin to our old friend from chap­ter 4, Wayne the Lam­borgh­ini Driver—he’s sug­gest­ing a rule that, ow­ing to his wealth and sta­tus, _es­sen­tially ap­plies only to him_ (and peo­ple like him). And by the way, we’ve also ar­gued that the richer and more pow­er­ful you are, the _more_ you owe other peo­ple, be­cause when we’re sit­ting around com­ing up with rules that de­fine what we owe to each other, the pow­er­ful can more eas­ily bear the weight of sac­ri­fice. A con­trac­tu­al­ist re­jects Sny­der’s rule, which prob­a­bly sug­gests we ought to stop sup­port­ing the team.

De­on­tol­ogy won’t be any more le­nient with him. Sny­der’s ar­gu­ing that he could will into ex­is­tence a world where once any­one gets enough money or achieves enough in­flu­ence, he can stop con­sid­er­ing the feel­ings or needs of those less for­tu­nate. That’s the world the pigs cre­ate in _An­i­mal Farm_, and I don’t think George Or­well wrote _An­i­mal Farm_ as like a “how to” guide for run­ning a so­ci­ety. Plus, co-opt­ing Na­tive Amer­i­can im­agery and us­ing it as your mas­cot is a pretty straight­for­ward case of “us­ing other peo­ple as a means to an end.” Kant would re­ject Sny­der’s ac­tions, and since we’re sup­port­ing a fran­chise that’s bla­tantly vi­o­lat­ing both[^8] for­mu­la­tions of the cat­e­gor­i­cal im­per­a­tive left and right, Kant prob­a­bly wants us to find an­other way to spend our Sun­days.

Ap­ply­ing virtue ethics: we’re es­sen­tially ask­ing how com­pas­sion­ate we should be when it comes to is­sues that cause peo­ple an­guish or pain. Be­ing _ex­ces­sively_ com­pas­sion­ate might lead to lack of in­tegrity, or back­bone, or some­thing—nearly ev­ery­thing in the cul­ture is _some_ kind of iffy, so we’d con­stantly be drop­ping what­ever we were do­ing and search­ing for some­thing else that comes with no moral en­tan­gle­ments at all (an im­pos­si­ble pipe dream, here in 2022). On the other hand, a _de­fi­ciency_ of com­pas­sion leads to… what Daniel Sny­der is: shut down, de­fi­ant, im­pen­e­tra­ble, re­sis­tant to new ideas, cal­ci­fied, and ut­terly un­in­ter­ested in the emo­tional health of other peo­ple. Some­where be­tween those ex­tremes is a golden mean of com­pas­sion. Given that the name of his team cre­ates such ex­treme and un­nec­es­sary an­guish, and could be changed so eas­ily, I be­lieve Sny­der is de­fi­cient in con­sid­er­a­tion for oth­ers. His see­saw is out of whack here. And given how eas­ily he alone could change the name, it’s prob­a­bly wrong to sup­port the team.

Util­i­tar­i­an­ism is a lit­tle trick­ier. When Sny­der de­clines to en­ter­tain a name change, he _might_ have a con­se­quen­tial­ist leg to stand on. It is, I sup­pose, _pos­si­ble_ that if he changed the name, the to­tal pain felt by Wash­ing­ton fans who _don’t_ want it to change would be greater than that felt by In­dige­nous peo­ple if he chose to re­tain it. But are these two pains com­pa­ra­ble? Re­mem­ber, it’s not strictly _the num­ber of peo­ple who feel pain_ in each of the two dif­fer­ent out­comes—it’s the _to­tal amount of pain felt_, and the _in­ten­sity_ of that pain, and its _du­ra­tion_, and like four other things from that jaunty lit­tle poem. For the util­i­tar­ian, it’s bet­ter to have a hun­dred peo­ple get pa­per cuts than one per­son take a base­ball bat to the knee. So even if the _num­ber_ of peo­ple who feel pain (Na­tive Amer­i­cans and their al­lies, in this case) were smaller than the _num­ber_ of peo­ple who feel plea­sure, there might be sig­nif­i­cantly more _to­tal_ pain if Sny­der keeps the name the same. Not to men­tion that when we use Ben­tham’s good ol’ he­don/do­lor cal­cu­la­tor to fig­ure out how deep, last­ing, or in­tense the pain felt by pro-sta­tus-quo R*dskins fans would be if Sny­der did change it, we ought to re­mem­ber that what they’d be go­ing through is com­mon and ba­nal. Sports teams change their nick­names, uni­forms, and lo­gos all the time, and fans quickly adapt. The R*dskins them­selves used to be called the (still of­fen­sive, but less so) Bos­ton Braves. The St. John’s R*dmen (a pretty di­rect ana­log, here) changed their name to the Red Storm in 1994—when’s the last time you heard some­one grum­bling about that? Some­times, when teams _don’t_ change their nick­names or lo­gos—surely cit­ing “This is what we’ve al­ways been called and we’re not gonna change” as the rea­son—the re­sults are ab­surd. The Min­ne­ap­o­lis Lak­ers moved from a place with a lot of lakes to a place with ba­si­cally none, and now the name “Los An­ge­les Lak­ers” just makes no sense. The New Or­leans Jazz was an ap­pro­pri­ate nick­name—the Utah Jazz is most cer­tainly not. (Utah is a lovely state with many things to of­fer. Jazz is not one of those things.[^9]) Given how com­mon­place name changes are, even a con­se­quen­tial­ist ar­gu­ment for Sny­der’s de­ci­sion falls apart pretty quickly.

But what about the util­i­tar­ian ar­gu­ment re­gard­ing _us_, and our fan­dom? How much “bad” does us con­tin­u­ing to root for the team re­ally cre­ate? Some of that de­pends on what “sup­port­ing the team” re­ally means. Do we spend money on tick­ets and mer­chan­dise? Do we pub­licly tweet or post videos, spread­ing the racist logo on­line? Do we wear a hat or jer­sey out in pub­lic where oth­ers will see it? It’s likely that if our fan­dom is rel­a­tively pri­vate, we’re not cre­at­ing that much con­se­quen­tial­ist “harm.”[^10] But it also leads us back to one of those “in­tegrity” ques­tions re­gard­ing util­i­tar­ian acts. We may cre­ate only a tiny amount of “bad” by sit­ting at home and watch­ing our fa­vorite team play. But we’re the ones who have to live with our choices. We are, as Bernard Williams put it, “spe­cially re­spon­si­ble for what [we do], rather than for what other peo­ple do.” Re­ly­ing solely on a util­i­tar­ian cal­cu­la­tion that jus­ti­fies qui­etly root­ing for the team might not be rea­son enough to jus­tify the choice. We should also just do a gut check here, and ask our­selves if _we_ are okay with it.

And look: we might be.

We might mull over all of our op­tions—prac­ti­cal im­per­a­tives and doc­trines of means and util­i­tar­ian ac­count­ing and per­sonal gut checks—and when we con­sider the to­tal­ity of what mat­ters to us, we may just get to a point where we can­not imag­ine life with­out Wash­ing­ton foot­ball fan­dom. It’s an in­gre­di­ent that was stirred into our per­sonal chow­der at an early age, and it’s im­pos­si­ble to sep­a­rate that fla­vor from the rest of the dish. The “in­tegrity” is­sue cuts both ways—our own senses of who we are as com­plete peo­ple, of what mat­ters to us and which spe­cific build­ing blocks we’re com­prised of, might mean that when some­thing threat­ens the struc­tural in­tegrity of one of those build­ing blocks, all of the moral rea­son­ing in the world can’t get us to pry it free. What the hell do we do then?

Press pause, for a mo­ment, while we look at the sec­ond of the two sub­cat­e­gories men­tioned ear­lier: “Things We Root For That _Can’t_ Change.”

### Sce­nario 2: The Leop­ard _Can’t_ Change His Spots, or Maybe He Just Never Got Around to Chang­ing His Spots and Now He’s Dead

What if the thing we love or root for isn’t the Wash­ing­ton Foot­ball Team, who lit­er­ally at any mo­ment could change their mas­cot to some­thing less racist? What if we’re talk­ing about Michael Jack­son’s mu­sic, Ro­man Polan­ski’s movies, or Thomas Jef­fer­son’s writ­ing—where the thing caus­ing us moral an­guish is an un­change­able fact of his­tory? Hell, what if we’re writ­ing a book that re­lies a whole lot on the wis­dom of Aris­to­tle, a true ge­nius who also be­lieved the only peo­ple ca­pa­ble of virtue were “free males” and put a lot of time and ef­fort into ex­plain­ing why slav­ery was to­tally fine?

When I was about ten years old I had to stay home sick from school, and my mom rented me the movie _Sleeper_ by Woody Allen. All I re­mem­ber is laugh­ing and cough­ing and laugh­ing and cough­ing. I watched it twice in a row. My dad then told me that Allen had three books of com­edy pieces and short sto­ries, and in maybe four days I read all of _Side Ef­fects_, _Get­ting Even_, and _With­out Feath­ers._ I can defini­tively say that my ca­reer as a com­edy writer was launched by those books. Woody Allen’s sense of hu­mor isn’t just a thing I like—it’s part of my core iden­tity. So you can imag­ine what hap­pened in my brain when Allen (a) mar­ried his ex­tremely young quasi-step­daugh­ter, and later (b) was cred­i­bly ac­cused of sex­u­ally abus­ing a child.

Frankly, I prob­a­bly should’ve seen some­thing like event (a) com­ing. A shock­ing num­ber of Allen’s movies and other writ­ings in­clude a trou­bling theme: old men at­tracted to very young women—or more ac­cu­rately and, as Todd points out, “less cred­i­bly,” very young women in­ex­pli­ca­bly at­tracted to much older men. In _Man­hat­tan_ (1979), Allen plays a forty-two-year-old man, Isaac, who has an af­fair with a sev­en­teen-year-old girl named Tracy, played by Mariel Hem­ing­way. In real life, Allen was forty-four and Hem­ing­way was six­teen. In the movie, Tracy is in high school… and in real life, so was Hem­ing­way. Be­cause, again, she was six­teen hu­man years old. At one point Tracy and Isaac kiss in Cen­tral Park. It was the first time Hem­ing­way had ever kissed an­other per­son. Then two years af­ter film­ing, ac­cord­ing to Hem­ing­way’s mem­oirs, Allen flew to Idaho to con­vince her to run off to Paris with him, but left when it was clear she wasn’t at­tracted to him, and didn’t want to share a room.

There’s a word for this be­hav­ior, and it’s: “gross.”

Allen cer­tainly didn’t in­vent men be­ing gross about younger women. He may have per­fected it, though, both in films and in real life. In _An­nie Hall_, Tony Roberts’s char­ac­ter, Rob, bails Allen’s char­ac­ter, Alvy Singer (whom Rob calls “Max”), out of jail. Here’s how that di­a­logue goes:

- ROB: Imag­ine my sur­prise when I got your call, Max.
- ALVY: Yeah. I had the feel­ing that I got you at a bad mo­ment. You know, I heard high-pitched squeal­ing.
- ROB: Twins, Max. Six­teen-year-olds. Can you imag­ine the math­e­mat­i­cal pos­si­bil­i­ties?

So… statu­tory rape, in which two six­teen-year-old girls are also pos­si­bly com­mit­ting in­cest. Hi­lar­i­ous. I bring all this up less to draw fur­ther at­ten­tion to Allen’s ick­i­ness than to spot­light my own ques­tion­able be­hav­ior—I knew all of this about him for years. Decades. I have sev­eral of his movies es­sen­tially mem­o­rized—I just typed that back-and-forth from _An­nie Hall_ by heart, be­cause I’ve seen it a hun­dred times. And yet I never re­ally asked my­self whether it was… _okay_ that he wrote men and women like this. Then in 1997, a sixty-two-year-old Allen mar­ried twenty-seven-year-old Soon-Yi Previn, who’d been adopted as a child by his for­mer part­ner Mia Far­row. They be­gan dat­ing when Allen was fifty-six and Previn was twenty. Al­though they hadn’t had a lot of in­ter­ac­tion be­fore start­ing the ro­mance—Far­row and Allen were not tra­di­tion­ally “to­gether” for most of Soon-Yi’s child­hood—a key mo­ment in their re­la­tion­ship ap­par­ently oc­curred when Allen helped her with an in­jury she suf­fered in soc­cer prac­tice when she was in eleventh grade.

There’s a word for this be­hav­ior and it’s: (_pained, gut­tural groan while clutch­ing stom­ach_).

But when news of the re­la­tion­ship broke, I didn’t emit a pained, gut­tural groan. I did what a lot of peo­ple do when con­fronted with in­for­ma­tion that chal­lenges their core iden­ti­ties:[^11] I ex­plained it away. Soon-Yi wasn’t re­ally _his_ adopted daugh­ter, she was _Mia Far­row_’s adopted daugh­ter. And those movies are just fic­tion. And it’s not like he in­vented the idea of young women and older men! And on and on. Allen’s writ­ing was melted cheese on my per­sonal iden­tity pizza—if I scraped it off, my un­der­stand­ing of com­edy wouldn’t be the same, and thus nei­ther would I. It only got worse when, years later, Allen was ac­cused of sex­ual abuse by his daugh­ter Dy­lan. The de­tails are sor­did and some are dis­puted, but at the very least, a judge over­see­ing a cus­tody hear­ing pro­claimed in his de­ci­sion that Allen’s gen­eral be­hav­ior to­ward Dy­lan was “grossly in­ap­pro­pri­ate and that mea­sures must be taken to pro­tect her.” Un­like with the Wash­ing­ton R*dskins or Chick-fil-A, there’s no fix­ing this. Sny­der can change the name. Chick-fil-A can change their anti-LGBTQ+ stance. Cities can take down stat­ues of racist po­lice chiefs or Con­fed­er­ate gen­er­als. But I cre­atively wor­ship a guy whose ac­tions are (a) dicey at best and ab­hor­rent at worst, and (b) a mat­ter of his­tory. When the per­son or thing we love or ad­mire con­tains un­al­ter­able flaws, and they ei­ther don’t own up to them or are dead and can­not—like with Thomas Jef­fer­son’s slave-own­ing, or JFK’s phi­lan­der­ing and sex­ual as­saults—the only pos­si­ble change is ours, and the change is painful.

Again, our schools of thought will likely tell us we should, in­deed, swear these things off. Con­se­quen­tial­ism, for ex­am­ple, falls apart in ex­actly the same way it did in the “Things That _Can_ Change” ver­sion: It first seems to al­low for the pos­si­bil­ity that it’s okay to watch Woody Allen movies when we con­sider how few peo­ple are ac­tively “hurt” by our pop­ping in a DVD we al­ready own. No one would even know we had watched it, and _we_ would be happy. But that’s ex­actly the way the con­se­quen­tial­ist ar­gu­ment _feels_ wrong some­times—this is one of those mo­ments where it de­nies us our in­di­vid­ual in­tegrity. The things that make us “us” are the things at risk, here—both the love of the thing and the an­guish that lov­ing the thing causes—and util­i­tar­ian ac­count­ing ig­nores those ques­tions of in­ter­nal con­flict. We may _feel_ icky about watch­ing the movie, which is com­pletely sep­a­rate from the “good or bad” caused to other peo­ple. (The cal­cu­la­tion would ob­vi­ously change a great deal if we were, say, in a po­si­tion to fi­nance one of Allen’s films.)

The pu­rity of Kant seems tempt­ing: a cat­e­gor­i­cal im­per­a­tive to turn away from any “fruit of a poi­sonous tree” (art by an artist who has com­mit­ted an un­for­giv­able sin) ap­pears to take care of the whole sit­u­a­tion. But it’s also a slip­pery slope, as Kan­tian pu­rity of­ten is. What counts as “un­for­giv­able”? What about an ac­tor who didn’t com­mit a crime but merely sup­ports a pres­i­den­tial can­di­date we ab­hor? Is that enough to force us to fol­low the im­per­a­tive? And then there are the re­ally con­fus­ing cases. For ex­am­ple, Mel Gib­son’s anti-Semitism and misog­y­nis­tic com­ments to a Mal­ibu po­lice of­fi­cer in 2006 aren’t as bad as sex­ual as­sault, but they sure ain’t great… _but_, he also later quit drink­ing and apol­o­gized for what he said… _bu­u­u­u­uut_ in 2010 the ac­tress Winona Ry­der re­lated a charm­ing anec­dote wherein Gib­son found out her friend was gay and asked “Am I gonna get AIDS?” from talk­ing to him, and then when he found out Ry­der was Jew­ish, he called her an “oven dodger.” What do we make of his case? Should we give Gib­son the same cold shoul­der we’d give Allen, if we’re be­ing hard-core Kan­tians?

Again, this feels like a “What kind of per­son should I be?” ques­tion, more than a “What should I do?” ques­tion. There are just too many ver­sions of “bad be­hav­ior” to lump all these pos­si­ble sce­nar­ios to­gether and find one um­brella rule we can fol­low. So let’s try virtue ethics. If we don’t care _enough_ about the moral short­com­ings of the peo­ple who make our movies and TV shows and mu­sic, we’re cal­lous and in­sen­si­tive. We teach them a bad les­son—that they can say or do what­ever they want, and we will con­tinue to give them our money and at­ten­tion. But if we care _too much_, and refuse to spend our money on any­thing made by any­one with a skele­ton in their closet… well, given the hu­man pen­chant for skele­ton-hav­ing, we might never fol­low sports, lis­ten to mu­sic, or watch any­thing on a screen ever again. Is there some amount of car­ing that is good and lets us feel like we are be­ing thought­ful, con­sid­er­ate cit­i­zens and con­sumers who fac­tor in moral­ity when we make en­ter­tain­ment de­ci­sions, but also gives us a lit­tle bit of a break so we can love the things we love? Hope­fully?

### The “Ex­tra Chicken Nugget” De­fense

Here’s an anal­ogy that may help us find an an­swer. I be­came a veg­e­tar­ian about ten years ago.[^12] Be­ing a veg­e­tar­ian is fre­quently and ac­tively dif­fi­cult for me, be­cause meat tastes good! Star­ing at the words “but­ter­milk fried chicken” or “pork ribs” on a menu and then or­der­ing a goat cheese salad is a _tremen­dous_ bum­mer. I made the de­ci­sion for two rea­sons: my health (it’s an easy way to lower choles­terol, and mine has al­ways been bad), and moral­ity (an­i­mals aren’t treated well, by and large, and also they’re nice and cute and eat­ing them seems wrong, and also the meat in­dus­try is do­ing un­for­giv­ably aw­ful things to the en­vi­ron­ment). With re­spect to the “moral­ity” half of the ar­gu­ment, a large part of the point of be­com­ing a veg­e­tar­ian is to re­duce the amount of meat pur­chased by stores and restau­rants, which re­duces de­mand, which leads to re­duced meat pro­duc­tion. But what if some­one else—say, your ten-year-old daugh­ter, Ivy, who loves chicken nuggets—has al­ready or­dered chicken nuggets, and then didn’t fin­ish them? My eat­ing the rest of those nuggets does not send a pos­i­tive feed­back mes­sage to the restau­rant—no ex­tra chicken has been or­dered, which means no ad­di­tional chicken would ever be tal­lied up as be­ing nec­es­sary in the fu­ture. And the nuggets look re­ally good, by the way, in this the­o­ret­i­cal ex­am­ple. They look awe­some, and they’re just sit­ting there on her plate, and oooh look there’s ranch dress­ing, and we’re just gonna throw them away?! That’s nuts. _Some­one_ ought to en­joy them. I mean, what’s the harm?[^13]

I think it’s clear that eat­ing Ivy’s left­over chicken nuggets is not _as bad_ as or­der­ing my own. It’s not _great_, be­cause I’m still eat­ing meat, but it’s _bet­ter_ than or­der­ing new meat. There are lev­els here, is what I’m say­ing. Is it pos­si­ble that there are lev­els in terms of our en­ter­tain­ment con­sump­tion too? For ex­am­ple, the “watch­ing an old movie on DVD” sit­u­a­tion I men­tioned ear­lier. No new money is go­ing to Woody Allen if I watch _An­nie Hall_ on a DVD I have owned for twenty years. I’m not buy­ing a ticket to a new film and thus putting new money into his pocket. I still have to reckon in­ter­nally with my de­ci­sion to watch art made by a man whose ac­tions I find rep­re­hen­si­ble, but if that movie meant so much to me as a kid, and con­trib­uted di­rectly to my life and ca­reer as a writer, maybe that’s okay, some­how?

The most im­por­tant part of be­com­ing bet­ter peo­ple, I’ll say yet again, is that we _care_ about whether what we do is good or bad, and there­fore _try_ to do the right thing. If we love a prob­lem­atic per­son or thing too much to part with it al­to­gether, I think that means we have to keep two ideas in our head at the same time:

1. I love this thing.
2. The per­son who made it is trou­bling.

For­get­ting about (1) means we lose a piece of our­selves. For­get­ting about (2) means we are deny­ing that this thing causes us (and oth­ers) an­guish, and thus we’re fail­ing to show con­cern for the vic­tims of aw­ful be­hav­ior. We can think both of these things at the same time. And if we do—if we re­ally con­front the wrongs of the artists as we con­sume their work, in­stead of mak­ing ex­cuses or liv­ing in de­nial—we can to some de­gree for­give our­selves for keep­ing them in our lives. In cer­tain cases, we will find it im­pos­si­ble to con­tinue to en­joy the thing we love—the artist will do some­thing we sim­ply can­not abide, and it will prove so ugly and damn­ing that we just can­not spend our time or money to sup­port them, even in pri­vate. But in other cases, when some­thing is so in­ex­orably wo­ven into our core iden­ti­ties that life with­out it feels un­think­able, main­tain­ing those two ideas si­mul­ta­ne­ously can help us avoid the pain of sev­er­ing all ties while still striv­ing for self-im­prove­ment.

But what does this mean _prac­ti­cally speak­ing_, for us? How do we ac­tu­ally con­front this prob­lem day to day, per­son by per­son? Is it _al­ways_ enough sim­ply to keep two con­flict­ing ideas in our heads at the same time? How do we know when some­one has crossed over from “trou­bling” to “in­de­fen­si­ble”?

This part of the ques­tion doesn’t have an an­swer, I think. Some­times in phi­los­o­phy, peo­ple throw around the word “heuris­tic.” A heuris­tic is a tool that al­lows us to in­put a prob­lem and get a so­lu­tion—a rule of thumb that gives us a guide­line for our be­hav­ior. (Scan­lon’s “rules no one would rea­son­ably re­ject” is a heuris­tic—though a slightly ab­stract one—be­cause in the­ory we can take any sit­u­a­tion, run it through that ma­chine, and de­ter­mine the proper way for­ward.) There is no heuris­tic to an­swer the ques­tions “Can we sep­a­rate the art from the artist?” or “How do we deal with loved ones whose be­liefs cause us pain?” or “Can I cheer for a team whose owner gets sex­ual plea­sure from stran­gling baby gi­raffes?”[^14] We can and should ap­ply any of our moral the­o­ries to all of these sit­u­a­tions, but at some point we’ll just have to act. To _choose_. We will de­cide we have to ban­ish _this_ thing or per­son from our lives, but maybe not _that_ one, based on noth­ing more than our rea­son­ing and our guts. Peo­ple who want to avoid this thorny is­sue like to say, “Where do you draw the line?!” as if merely point­ing out its blur­ri­ness ab­solves us from try­ing to bring it into fo­cus. But as the co­me­dian John Oliver likes to say: _some­where_. We draw it _some­where_. You and I may draw it in dif­fer­ent places, but we need to draw it, each of us, for our­selves.

Now, the in­stant we draw these lines, we _guar­an­tee_ that we’ll even­tu­ally find our­selves in a con­tra­dic­tion. We will con­tinue to love and sup­port one per­son and not an­other, even when the two of them seem roughly equiv­a­lent in their be­hav­iors. Our friends will jump up and down and point and glee­fully ask how we can pos­si­bly watch _this_ movie but not _that_ one, or how we can cheer for _this_ base­ball player but con­demn _that_ one, and so on. Those con­tra­dic­tions are not ex­cuses to throw our hands up and aban­don the en­tire project of out­lin­ing our in­tegrity, our sense of be­ing a “whole and un­di­vided per­son.” They’re rea­sons to dig back in, mull ev­ery­thing over, and if nec­es­sary erase the line we drew and re­draw it some­where else. Con­tra­dic­tions within our own sys­tem of in­tegrity are sim­ply op­por­tu­ni­ties to _try_, again, to make de­ci­sions true to our own be­liefs, our un­der­stand­ing of ethics, and our sense of who we are. These mo­ments—when we are caught in a sit­u­a­tion that has no clear an­swer, no heuris­tic to em­ploy that will spit out a the­o­ret­i­cal but prac­ti­cally im­pos­si­ble “cor­rect” de­ci­sion—are when we see the true value in fail­ure. We’re de­cid­ing to do some­thing that _will_, some­day, back­fire. The more we chew on it and work it through, the more mean­ing we can de­rive from that back­fire when it hap­pens.

And the cap­per, of course, is the even thornier ques­tion: When do we not only curb our be­hav­ior, but ac­tu­ally _speak out_ against those peo­ple and things and be­hav­iors we’ve deemed in­com­pat­i­ble with our sense of in­tegrity? These is­sues aren’t like the fender ben­der that I hap­haz­ardly turned into an un­fair pub­lic sham­ing. If Aris­to­tle is right—if there is some amount of anger that should be di­rected at the right peo­ple for the right rea­sons, or some amount of shame that peo­ple should feel for their bad ac­tions—these are the sit­u­a­tions he’s talk­ing about. Re­mem­ber your pleas­ant and birth­day-re­mem­ber­ing Aunt Con­nie, who’s gen­er­ally lovely but also has some trou­bling thoughts about Mex­i­cans? Stand­ing up to Aunt Con­nie sounds _hard_. Just the thought of an ac­tual con­fronta­tion with a fam­ily mem­ber makes our stom­achs ache and our voices trem­ble. So we fre­quently take the easy way out, and… do noth­ing.

I’ve been guilty of this, a mil­lion times. Plenty of peo­ple in my life have said or done things I find ab­hor­rent, and I’ve re­mained silent be­cause I didn’t want to cause a scene, start a dif­fi­cult con­ver­sa­tion, or risk an ar­gu­ment. (I’m pretty con­flict-averse, a fact I’m of­ten not proud of.) As Over­ton win­dows shift along the con­tin­uum stretch­ing from tra­di­tion to rev­o­lu­tion, we find our­selves in a con­stant state of con­flict with those older than us, who cling to ideas that have long since been re­vealed as of­fen­sive or out­dated, and those younger than us, whose crit­i­cisms of the sta­tus quo can some­times seem overly stri­dent. Con­fronting ei­ther at­ti­tude can seem both dif­fi­cult and—given how rarely peo­ple seem to change their minds about stuff—point­less. But if I can’t quite find “an an­swer” to these prob­lems, I can at least tell you what _isn’t_ the an­swer: do­ing noth­ing.

It doesn’t help any­one to dig in our heels and ig­nore pleas from peo­ple who ac­cuse us of a lack of car­ing or sen­si­tiv­ity. It also doesn’t help any­one to re­main silent when our friends or loved ones or ca­sual ac­quain­tances say some­thing racist, sex­ist, or of­fen­sive. Ac­tion is called for here, in the name of open­ness and im­prove­ment, both for us and for other peo­ple. Now, when Aunt Con­nie ca­su­ally drops a racist talk­ing point about Mex­i­cans in the mid­dle of Thanks­giv­ing din­ner, it seems hor­ri­bly Pollyan­naish to sug­gest: “Talk about it! Have a di­a­logue!” What does that even look like? What good would it do? How would she re­act? Will you ruin Thanks­giv­ing? Will Aunt Con­nie ever speak to you again? We’ve al­ready seen how sham­ing peo­ple can back­fire, mak­ing them dig in their heels and dou­ble down on their be­liefs—why would we think this would be any dif­fer­ent?

But we’ve also heard, from Aris­to­tle, that “the per­son who is de­fi­cient in shame or never feels shame at all is said to have no sense of dis­grace.” If we love Aunt Con­nie, and care about her, wouldn’t we want _her_ to feel a lit­tle shame if she’s say­ing some­thing shame­ful? Wouldn’t we want to help _her_ flour­ish? And don’t we want to work at find­ing the golden mean of mild­ness—ex­press­ing the _right amount of anger_ in the _right sit­u­a­tions_? Virtue ethi­cists know means are hard to find, and they know ex­actly what they’re ask­ing of us—to do the gru­el­ing work of seek­ing them. If it were easy, we’d all be flour­ish­ing al­ready. So maybe we don’t stand up in the mid­dle of Thanks­giv­ing din­ner and de­clare our aunt to be an irredeemable racist. But maybe we _do_ pull her aside later, and try to ex­plain why her views are wrong or hurt­ful. Maybe we try to get to the bot­tom of her views, find their root cause, and work to change her mind. Maybe we ex­plain that while she may think she’s just ex­press­ing an opin­ion or mak­ing a joke, her words risk dam­ag­ing our re­la­tion­ship with her, and that re­main­ing silent as she says these things threat­ens our own sense of in­tegrity. No mat­ter what we do, we keep two con­flict­ing thoughts in our minds at the same time:

I love this per­son.

This per­son is caus­ing me an­guish.

We treat those thoughts with equal weight. And we hope the per­son in ques­tion will do the same.

### Un­sur­pris­ingly, Sny­der Loses Again

There’s a post­script to this dis­cus­sion: the R*dskins fi­nally changed their name.

In the sum­mer of 2020, as the en­tire coun­try wres­tled with po­lice bru­tal­ity and the Black Lives Mat­ter move­ment put racial in­jus­tice front and cen­ter, Sny­der fi­nally de­cided to join the rest of us here in the twenty-first cen­tury and agreed the nick­name was no longer ap­pro­pri­ate. Of all the ways we can be­come bet­ter peo­ple, “dragged kick­ing and scream­ing” isn’t ideal, but it’s bet­ter than noth­ing. (Feels worth men­tion­ing that not long af­ter the de­ci­sion to change the name, a _Wash­ing­ton Post_ piece ex­posed a dis­turb­ing pat­tern of sex­ual ha­rass­ment com­mit­ted by ex­ec­u­tives in the team’s front of­fice that turned into a full-blown PR night­mare. I’m sure that’s just a co­in­ci­dence, though.) I pre­fer to fo­cus not on the wind­ing path of doo­fus­ness that brought us here, but on the re­lief and hap­pi­ness of the In­dige­nous peo­ple and their al­lies who earned the win in this hard-fought bat­tle. It ham­mers home what we’ve been say­ing about _try­ing_. Sny­der shouted, only a few years ago, that he would NEVER change the name of his team. But a bunch of peo­ple kept try­ing. They kept lob­by­ing, and lightly sham­ing him, and mak­ing their case. And lit­tle by lit­tle, the Over­ton win­dow shifted. Other teams changed their names. So­cial jus­tice crept for­ward. And fi­nally, the win­dow’s range in­cluded some­thing that was once un­think­able.

This was a hard one. These are all hard ones. It can wear us out, think­ing about these prob­lems, es­pe­cially when we come armed with 2,400 years of philo­soph­i­cal the­ory and _still_ can’t find a de­fin­i­tive so­lu­tion. In mo­ments like this, a tempt­ing voice calls out to us—_Stop car­ing! Life is so much eas­ier when you don’t try so hard to be good, es­pe­cially given that it some­times feels im­pos­si­ble. I mean, we’re just lit­tle flecks of dust on a tiny rock in outer space—does any­thing we do even mat­ter?_

So… does it?

    

## CHAP­TER ELEVEN Mak­ing Eth­i­cal De­ci­sions Is Hard. Can We Just… Not Make Them?

You’ve prob­a­bly heard the term “ex­is­ten­tial­ism,” and chances are that when you heard it, it was be­ing used in­cor­rectly. Any lit­er­a­ture that’s bleak, or deals with death, or is vaguely Eu­ro­pean, runs the risk of be­ing la­beled “ex­is­ten­tial­ist,” and it’s usu­ally not. “Ex­is­ten­tial” is one of those fancy words peo­ple like to use when the word they re­ally mean is much sim­pler:

|WHAT PEO­PLE WHO WANT TO SOUND FANCY SAY|WHAT THEY MEAN|
|---|---|
|Kafkaesque|Eerie|
|Sur­re­al­ist|Weird-look­ing|
|Ironic|An­noy­ing|
|Ex­is­ten­tial|Dark/sad/bleak/de­spair­ing|
|Freudian|Pe­nis-re­lated|
|Post­mod­ern|Re­cent|
|Or­wellian|I got banned from Twit­ter for be­ing racist|

I sup­pose we can’t re­ally blame peo­ple for us­ing the word in­cor­rectly, be­cause ex­is­ten­tial­ist writ­ing—most closely as­so­ci­ated with a philosoph­i­cal and lit­er­ary move­ment in mid-twen­ti­eth-cen­tury France—is fa­mously dif­fi­cult to un­der­stand. But buried in its texts, un­der a thou­sand lay­ers of Gauloises smoke and Gal­lic angst, is a new an­gle on eth­i­cal de­ci­sion-mak­ing that side­steps most of what we’ve dis­cussed so far and urges us to be good peo­ple in a dra­matic (and, yes, kind of bleak) way.

### Jean-Paul Sartre, Fa­mous Op­ti­mist

Ex­is­ten­tial­ism, in a hi­lar­i­ously re­duc­tive nut­shell, be­lieves the fol­low­ing: Hu­man ex­is­tence is ab­surd. There is no “higher power” or de­ity or mean­ing to be found be­yond the fact of that ex­is­tence, and this con­di­tion fills us with dread and anx­i­ety. The move­ment’s over­all goal (though the de­tails vary from writer to writer) was to make sense of what we can do in the face of that ab­sur­dity, dread, and anx­i­ety. Even at its height, ex­is­ten­tial­ism was largely mis­un­der­stood and crit­i­cized. On Oc­to­ber 29, 1945, French ex­is­ten­tial­ist Jean-Paul Sartre at­tempted to set the record straight, giv­ing a speech en­ti­tled “Ex­is­ten­tial­ism Is a Hu­man­ism” in Paris. The ti­tle it­self was meant to sur­prise peo­ple—a _hu­man­ism_?! This dude is claim­ing that his phi­los­o­phy is “op­ti­mistic” and pro-peo­ple?! We’re talk­ing about Jean-Paul Sartre—one of the most fa­mously grim peo­ple in his­tory. He named his cat “Noth­ing.” He wrote books called _Nau­sea_ and _Be­ing and Noth­ing­ness_. Imag­ine writ­ing a book called _Be­ing and Noth­ing­ness_ and then ask­ing, “Why does ev­ery­one think I’m de­press­ing?”

Sartre was try­ing to dis­pel mis­un­der­stand­ings about ex­is­ten­tial­ism—es­sen­tially, he wanted peo­ple to stop us­ing the term wrong.[^1] He ap­par­ently spoke with­out notes of any kind, which is as­tound­ing, and he comes across like a lawyer mak­ing a clos­ing ar­gu­ment on be­half of his client; he’s (lit­er­ally) de­fen­sive, but for good rea­son—his ex­is­ten­tial­ist writ­ings had made ev­ery­one mad at him. As Ar­lette Elkaïm-Sartre (his adopted daugh­ter, and some­time trans­la­tor) writes in the pref­ace to the 1996 French edi­tion:

> Chris­tians chas­tised Sartre not only for his athe­ism but for be­ing a ma­te­ri­al­ist, while Com­mu­nists re­proached him for not be­ing one.… In many peo­ple’s minds, Sartre was be­com­ing the anti-hu­man­ist par ex­cel­lence: he de­mor­al­ized the French at a time when France, ly­ing in ru­ins, most needed hope.

In a very short time—re­ally be­tween 1943 and 1945—Sartre had man­aged to piss off Com­mu­nists, athe­ists, and artists, even while be­ing an athe­is­tic nov­el­ist who wrote for un­der­ground Com­mu­nist jour­nals. That’s hard to do. This ex­is­ten­tial­ism is pow­er­ful stuff.

The re­li­gious ob­jec­tion to ex­is­ten­tial­ism doesn’t take much ex­pla­na­tion: Sartre com­pletely de­nies the pres­ence of any om­nipo­tent God that watches over us or judges our ac­tions. To Sartre, we’re born out of noth­ing­ness—poof!—and then it’s en­tirely up to us what we are and do, and then we die—poof!—and that’s it. Noth­ing “guides” us, we’re not fol­low­ing any play­book from re­li­gion or spir­i­tu­al­ity or _any­thing_. All we have, and all we ul­ti­mately are, is the choices we make while we’re alive. The be­lief that we ex­ist be­fore there’s any mean­ing at­tached to our lives is a con­di­tion Sartre calls “sub­jec­tiv­ity,” and ex­plains by say­ing: “Ex­is­tence pre­cedes essence.” The most im­por­tant con­clu­sion it leads him to is this: if there’s no gi­ant struc­ture that fills the world with any kind of mean­ing be­fore or af­ter we ex­ist, then: “Man is re­spon­si­ble for what he is.”

> Man first ex­ists: he ma­te­ri­al­izes in the world, en­coun­ters him­self, and only af­ter­wards de­fines him­self. If man as ex­is­ten­tial­ists con­ceive of him can­not be de­fined, it is be­cause to be­gin with he is noth­ing. He will not be any­thing un­til later, and then he will be what he makes of him­self.

For any­one brought up in one of the Abra­hamic tra­di­tions—Ju­daism, Chris­tian­ity, or Is­lam—life with­out God is like a base­ball game with no umps. No one is keep­ing score or en­forc­ing rules, so any­thing goes. As Dos­toyevsky fa­mously wrote: “If God does not ex­ist, ev­ery­thing is per­mis­si­ble.”[^2] If you re­move God from the equa­tion—and thus any kind of grand de­sign for hu­man­ity—then we’re all just a bunch of do­dos wan­der­ing around the planet, ac­count­able to noth­ing but our­selves. And that’s ex­actly what Sartre be­lieved—in fact, it’s the very guts of his en­tire phi­los­o­phy. Ex­is­ten­tial­ism is a lit­tle like when your par­ents yelled at you when you were fif­teen be­cause you did some­thing stupid, say­ing “You’re a grown-up! You’re re­spon­si­ble for your ac­tions!” ex­cept in this case it’s a French philoso­pher yelling at you, and his con­clu­sions deny the ex­is­tence of God.

For Sartre, life with no God to cre­ate sys­temic or­der for hu­man­ity may in­deed be dis­turb­ing, but it’s also _free­ing_. With­out com­mand­ments we have to fol­low, or “mean­ing” to be found in re­li­gion, or na­tional iden­tity, or your par­ents be­ing den­tists and de­mand­ing you be­come a den­tist too, or any­thing else, we’re truly _free_—in like a big-pic­ture, ea­gle-eye-view-of-ev­ery­thing way—to choose what we are. “Signs” or “omens” ex­ist only be­cause we choose to see them, and we should never make a de­ci­sion based on one; or if we do, we should rec­og­nize that the sign isn’t mak­ing the de­ci­sion—_we_ are sim­ply choos­ing to in­ter­pret the sign in a way that points to _our_ de­ci­sion. Re­li­gious in­struc­tion, ed­u­ca­tion, fam­ily tra­di­tions, a Magic 8 Ball—they’re all equally bad crutches to rely on when we face a choice. Ev­ery per­son, whether Pe­ru­vian or Mon­go­lian, a pau­per or third in line for the Dan­ish throne, is per­fectly and com­pletely free to make what­ever choices she wants.

_But_—and this is kind of tricky—when we make our choices, we’re ac­tu­ally mak­ing them for all peo­ple.[^3] Yeah. Wrap your head around that for a sec­ond. When we choose to do things, says Sartre, we’re cre­at­ing an im­age of a per­son as they _should_ be, which can then be viewed and fol­lowed by ev­ery­one else. Here Sartre weirdly con­verges with Kant, be­cause he wants us to ask our­selves, “What would hap­pen if ev­ery­one did what I am do­ing?” He wants us to de­ter­mine our own moral­ity but also model that moral­ity for ev­ery­one else. This might seem like a con­tra­dic­tion: There’s no God, no “mean­ing” to the uni­verse, no guide­book to fol­low, ev­ery­one can make what­ever choices he wants… but also those choices should be a model for ev­ery­one else? Then, we might ask, wouldn’t think­ing of your­self as a model for oth­ers be in con­flict with the idea that ev­ery­one makes choices for her­self, not fol­low­ing any ex­ter­nal guide or rule­book? But don’t worry, there’s a good rea­son that this seems like a con­tra­dic­tion: it’s a con­tra­dic­tion. It’s hon­estly a lit­tle un­clear how Sartre main­tains all of these ideas si­mul­ta­ne­ously, or even why he would want to. He did sym­pa­thize with the Com­mu­nists in post­war Eu­rope, so maybe his po­lit­i­cal be­liefs seeped in a bit here as he tried to find a way that hu­mans were con­nected to each other? All I know is, peo­ple have been writ­ing about this con­tra­dic­tion for sev­enty years, so the odds I un­tan­gle it in this para­graph are… slim.

Now, if you’re think­ing, “You just told me there is no God and no ‘mean­ing’ to our ex­is­tence, and that all we have are our choices, and now you’re telling me to make choices that model be­hav­ior for all of hu­man­ity? I kind of have a stom­achache here, man,” well, that’s ex­actly the point. In fact, Sartre ac­knowl­edges that this par­tic­u­lar hu­man con­di­tion fills us with an­guish—“the kind ex­pe­ri­enced by all who have borne re­spon­si­bil­i­ties.” He knows how hard it is to be a hu­man be­ing on earth un­der the cir­cum­stances he de­scribes, and re­fuses to let us off the hook. Life is an­guish. Wel­come to ex­is­ten­tial­ism!

And yet, for all the an­guish it en­tails, Sartre be­lieved, about ex­is­ten­tial­ism, that “no doc­trine is more op­ti­mistic.”

The way Sartre puts it, in his trade­mark “ev­ery­thing I say is kind of ter­ri­fy­ing, even when I’m try­ing to re­as­sure you” style, is this: “Man is con­demned to be free.” We have no crutches, or “rea­sons” to do what­ever we choose to do, ex­cept that we have cho­sen to do them. (And I know what you’re think­ing—what if I just don’t choose any­thing? No go. “If I de­cide not to choose, that still con­sti­tutes a choice,” he says.[^4]) The “op­ti­mistic” thing about this con­di­tion, for him, is that “man’s des­tiny lies within him­self.” If we em­brace the idea that all we are is our choices, we are _forced_ to freely make any choice we want, when­ever we want. We have no other op­tion—there’s no other way out of this an­guish-filled mess. All of which makes ex­is­ten­tial­ists _su­per_ fun at par­ties. True story—our own Todd May went through a hard-core ex­is­ten­tial­ism phase in col­lege, and re­sponded to ev­ery­one who asked him a ques­tion by say­ing, “I am _choos­ing_ to—” what­ever his an­swer was. So, some­one would say, “There’s a party tonight at my dorm, you wanna go?” and Todd would re­ply, “I am _choos­ing_ to not go to your party.” Todd has been mar­ried for many years and has three grown chil­dren, and when I heard that story I won­dered how any of that was re­motely pos­si­ble.

In his speech from 1945, Sartre gives the ex­am­ple of a for­mer stu­dent, a young man who lived with his mother. The man’s fa­ther had been a Nazi col­lab­o­ra­tor, which shamed the mother, and the man’s older brother had al­ready been killed in the war. He had to de­cide whether to go off and join the free­dom fight­ers in Eng­land, try­ing to avenge the death of his brother, or stay and care for his mother, who had al­ready lost so much. The guy knew he might be killed long be­fore he ar­rived in Eng­land, but he also knew that stay­ing home meant not fight­ing for the cause he be­lieved in or aveng­ing his brother’s death. It was a real World War II–fla­vored pickle. Sartre’s point is that noth­ing can “help” the young man make his choice. There’s no or­a­cle he can con­sult, no Kan­tian rule or moral the­ory or any­thing else that ad­dresses this fraught de­ci­sion. There is only his de­ci­sion, and his de­ci­sion is just his de­ci­sion, what­ever it is, so he should make it, and own it, in­stead of re­ly­ing on the Bible or read­ing J. S. Mill or con­sult­ing a psy­chic at a car­ni­val.

So here we are, two hun­dred pages deep in this book, hav­ing learned all about de­on­tol­ogy and util­i­tar­i­an­ism and con­trac­tu­al­ism and virtue ethics and a bunch of other stuff, and along comes a mo­rose French­man to tell us that there’s no God and peo­ple de­fine them­selves through ac­tion and we have to just make de­ci­sions with no guid­ance ex­cept “the es­sen­tial an­guish of our own ex­is­tence” or some­thing. He’s telling us that Kant and Ben­tham and Scan­lon and Aris­to­tle are about as help­ful to our moral lives as a coin flip. Should we lis­ten to him, and junk all these other the­o­ries?

### Al­bert Ca­mus, the Non-Ex­is­ten­tial­ist Ex­is­ten­tial­ist

Be­fore we even en­ter­tain that no­tion, we should talk about the other great French ex­is­ten­tial­ist, Al­bert Ca­mus (1913–1960). Sartre and Ca­mus were con­tem­po­rary French philoso­phers who both won the No­bel Prize in Lit­er­a­ture, but they also had some key dif­fer­ences. For one thing, Ca­mus ac­cepted his No­bel Prize, while Sartre turned his down, which is su­per punk rock and _ex­tremely_ French.[^5] Ca­mus’s ex­is­ten­tial­ist mus­ings are also even more stripped down and in­tense than Sartre’s. As I men­tioned ear­lier, Sartre did some (kind of con­tra­dic­tory) work to make his phi­los­o­phy com­pat­i­ble with Com­mu­nist po­lit­i­cal move­ments in post­war France; Ca­mus didn’t care about that. Sartre thought we should per­form ac­tions that could serve as mod­els for oth­ers; Ca­mus didn’t care about that ei­ther. His ex­is­ten­tial­ism is like a bal­samic re­duc­tion of Sartre’s—sharper, more in­tense, more po­tent. In fact, Ca­mus ac­tu­ally claimed re­peat­edly that he _wasn’t_ an ex­is­ten­tial­ist, but come on, dude, yes you were. I mean, look at you:

![[f0216-01.jpg]]

You’re telling me _that guy_ isn’t an ex­is­ten­tial­ist?[^6]

Ca­mus broke down his ver­sion of ex­is­ten­tial­ism (which, again, he de­nied it was, blah blah blah) this way: Hu­mans de­sire mean­ing from the uni­verse, but the uni­verse is cold and in­dif­fer­ent and de­nies us that mean­ing; in fact, noth­ing “means” any­thing, re­ally, or at least noth­ing is more “mean­ing­ful” than any­thing else. So we’re just lit­tle specks of noth­ing­ness on a big dumb rock float­ing in space, des­per­ately search­ing for some­thing we’ll never find, and thus, the hu­man con­di­tion is fun­da­men­tally ab­surd.

> I said that the world is ab­surd, but… what is ab­surd is the confronta­tion of this ir­ra­tional[^7] and the wild long­ing for clar­ity whose call echoes in the hu­man heart. The ab­surd de­pends as much on man as on the world. For the mo­ment it is all that links them to­gether. It binds them one to the other as only ha­tred can weld two crea­tures to­gether. This is all I can dis­cern clearly in this mea­sure­less uni­verse where my ad­ven­ture takes place.

… Great. So, then, what do we do? How do we deal with this fun­da­men­tal ab­sur­dity? Ca­mus says we have three choices.

#### 1. We can kill our­selves.

Seems… less than ideal. To be clear, Ca­mus doesn’t say we _should_ com­mit sui­cide. He just says it’s tech­ni­cally a way out of the ab­sur­dity of long­ing for mean­ing in a mean­ing­less uni­verse, be­cause it elim­i­nates half of the equa­tion (the per­son who de­sires mean­ing).

#### 2. We can em­brace some kind of struc­ture—re­li­gion, fam­ily, work, any­thing—and find mean­ing in it.

Bet­ter than sui­cide, right? For Ca­mus, ac­tu­ally, no. Or: barely. He refers to this process of im­bu­ing some­thing with mean­ing as “philo­soph­i­cal sui­cide.” It’s an at­tempt to get rid of the _other_ half of the ab­surd equa­tion—the cold, in­dif­fer­ent, mean­ing­less uni­verse—by man­u­fac­tur­ing mean­ing we can then cling to. But to cre­ate “mean­ing” out of any so­ci­etal struc­ture is to deny the in­escapable fact that we’re just lit­tle specks of noth­ing­ness on a big dumb rock float­ing in space, search­ing for mean­ing in a cold and in­dif­fer­ent uni­verse that will never pro­vide it, and for him that’s ul­ti­mately harm­ful: “The doc­trines that ex­plain ev­ery­thing to me”—that is, the struc­tures that the­o­ret­i­cally of­fer him mean­ing—“also de­bil­i­tate me at the same time.” So what’s op­tion num­ber three?

#### 3. We can ac­knowl­edge the fun­da­men­tal ab­sur­dity of the hu­man con­di­tion, and just kind of ex­ist within it!

I added the ex­cla­ma­tion point to try to hide how bleak a sen­tence that is. But for Ca­mus, that’s the only real an­swer.

> I don’t know whether this world has a mean­ing that tran­scends it. But I know that I do not know that mean­ing and that it is im­pos­si­ble for me just now to know it.… These two cer­tain­ties—my ap­petite for the ab­so­lute and for unity and the im­pos­si­bil­ity of re­duc­ing this world to a ra­tio­nal and rea­son­able prin­ci­ple—I also know that I can­not rec­on­cile them.

The only way to cope with our de­sire for mean­ing in­side an empty, point­less uni­verse is to _rec­og­nize_ how ab­surd it is that we ex­ist in an empty, point­less uni­verse and still de­sire mean­ing. He wants us to stand in the mid­dle of the hur­ri­cane of ab­sur­dity, nei­ther deny­ing it nor al­low­ing it to de­feat us.

In _The Myth of Sisy­phus_, Ca­mus dis­cusses the fa­mous fa­ble wherein Sisy­phus is con­demned to roll a heavy rock up a hill, af­ter which the rock rolls back down the hill, where­upon he has to de­scend and roll it back up the hill, for­ever. He’s been as­signed this eter­nal fate be­cause he pissed off the gods in a bunch of dif­fer­ent ways, so they gave him an ab­surd repet­i­tive task that stretches out in­fin­itely. But Ca­mus saw it dif­fer­ently: So Sisy­phus has to com­plete this same ridicu­lous task over and over for­ever—so what? “The work­man of to­day,” he points out, “works ev­ery day in his life at the same tasks, and this fate is no less ab­surd.” And in the case of Sisy­phus, “His fate be­longs to him. His rock is his thing.” Ca­mus says that Sisy­phus’s ex­is­tence was made _de­lib­er­ately_ and _in­ex­orably_ ab­surd, which means it’s all Sisy­phus can think about, and thus he _un­der­stands_ how ab­surd it is, and there­fore it frees him from the dis­tract­ing il­lu­sion of mean­ing: there is only this sin­gu­lar task, this one strug­gle. Ca­mus con­cludes, in a sen­tence that has been rock­ing the worlds of col­lege fresh­men for sev­enty years: “One must imag­ine Sisy­phus happy.”

So, here we have a cou­ple of new the­o­ret­i­cal ap­proaches to ethics, which have to do with the idea of ab­so­lute, rad­i­cal free­dom. Can they help us, some­how, in our quest to be­come bet­ter peo­ple?

### “We Had No Choice!”

Sartre’s crit­ics of­fered a de­cent come­back, which re­calls the ques­tion I imag­ined some of you may have had at the be­gin­ning of this book: _Who the hell are you to judge me?_ If there is no higher power, how can it be that any in­di­vid­ual has any au­thor­ity to say oth­ers should do what he does? Sartre’s re­sponse was to say that we make our choices in­di­vid­u­ally but “in the pres­ence of oth­ers,” so if we de­ter­mine some­one is re­ly­ing on re­li­gion or some other struc­ture as a “rea­son” for mak­ing a choice, she screwed up—he calls such a re­liance on ex­ter­nal fac­tors or struc­tures “an er­ror” and sug­gests we should an­nounce it as such. It’s not ex­actly an en­tire “eth­i­cal” sys­tem, but Sartre is cer­tainly con­cerned with what we do and why we do it. Sim­i­larly, if our friend asks us what we think of her ugly shirt and we look to Ca­mus for ad­vice, and he smiles in­sou­ciantly and says, _You should sim­ply stand naked within the in­con­gru­ous farce of ex­is­tence_, well, that’s maybe not su­per help­ful. But that doesn’t mean it has noth­ing to of­fer us in our quest to be good.

The com­plete free­dom that ex­is­ten­tial­ists shove down our throats—the in­sis­tence that we can’t de­fend our choices us­ing any ex­ter­nal struc­ture—keeps us from us­ing those struc­tures as a crutch. Let’s imag­ine we’re in one of those re­ally weird eth­i­cal tan­gles where there’s no easy an­swer. Our friend Sue is fu­ri­ous with our other friend Gina be­cause Gina has been spread­ing ru­mors about Sue cheat­ing on her boyfriend. When Sue vents to us, we tell her we are on her side, be­cause Gina tends to do stuff like this. (I mean, you know Gina—she’s a mess.) Then later, co­in­ci­den­tally, Gina calls and asks if we want to use her lake house for the week­end be­cause she has to go take care of her ail­ing mother. We know that do­ing this will an­noy Sue—“How could you ac­cept her of­fer when she’s be­ing so aw­ful to me?!” she’ll likely say (I mean, you know Sue, she has a bit of a mar­tyr com­plex). But on the other hand… we have noth­ing to do with this beef, re­ally, and it sounds re­lax­ing to sit by a lake all day, and also Gina is pay­ing us back for that time last year that we picked her up from the air­port, and say­ing no would re­quire us to ei­ther (a) tell her that we’re say­ing no be­cause of her beef with Sue or else (b) lie to her, and we read in a book some­where that Kant told us we’re never sup­posed to lie, and (c) Gina ac­tu­ally told us we’d be do­ing her a _fa­vor_ by look­ing af­ter her house and she’s al­ready stressed about her ail­ing mother. And so on. These com­plex de­ci­sions arise all the time—they con­tain fifty dif­fer­ent con­sid­er­a­tions and eth­i­cal vec­tors and loy­alty tests, and some­times, even if we’re de­ter­mined to be good lit­tle util­i­tar­i­ans or virtue seek­ers or de­on­to­log­i­cal maxim–obey­ers, it can be im­pos­si­ble to make sense of all of it.

And when that hap­pens, we’re tempted to look for some­thing solid to hang on to, a _rea­son_ that jus­ti­fies what we’re go­ing to do as though that were re­ally the only pos­si­ble choice. Rea­sons make us feel bet­ter be­cause they re­frame our choices as in­evitable, thus ab­solv­ing us of re­spon­si­bil­ity. “We _had no choice_ but to ac­cept Gina’s of­fer, be­cause not do­ing so would be rude.” Or “We _had no choice_ but to re­ject it, be­cause of our friend­ship with Sue.” The ex­is­ten­tial­ists are there to re­mind us: it’s _al­ways_ our choice. For all its con­fus­ing French[^8] lin­guis­tic gym­nas­tics, there’s a sim­plic­ity to Sartre’s ex­is­ten­tial­ism: we choose to act, and the choices are ours and ours alone. And there’s a com­fort, some­times, in Ca­mus’s ex­is­ten­tial­ism: just be­ing hu­man of­ten feels ridicu­lous, and true hap­pi­ness may come from ac­cept­ing that ridicu­lous­ness as in­escapable. Both men also en­cour­age us not to dwell on our mis­takes. Okay, we blew it. Next time: don’t. If Aris­to­tle tells us to keep try­ing dif­fer­ent things in or­der to find the bulls­eye of virtue, ex­is­ten­tial­ists say: keep mak­ing choices, be­cause choices are all we have in our ab­surd, mean­ing­less uni­verse.

How­ever: de­spite Sartre think­ing his ex­is­ten­tial­ism is “hu­man­is­tic,” or how lib­er­at­ing Ca­mus’s ex­is­ten­tial­ism might be for the myth­i­cal Sisy­phus, it can be pretty un­for­giv­ing for real peo­ple. Let’s now imag­ine a low-in­come woman in ru­ral Alaska who wrenches her knee. A doc­tor pre­scribes her ab­surdly pow­er­ful opi­oids be­cause he’s cor­rupt and has a side deal with a phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany to sell as much Oxy­Con­tin as he can. She be­comes ad­dicted to the opi­oids, can’t af­ford her habit, and even­tu­ally steals money from a gas sta­tion to pay the cor­rupt doc­tor. Is she a thief? Sartre would say yes—she made that choice, it’s her choice and hers alone, etc. But ex­hor­ta­tions like _we are re­spon­si­ble for our de­ci­sions_ are not ex­actly help­ful when a di­a­bol­i­cal pharma com­pany has in­vented a pow­er­ful drug and lied about its ad­dic­tive qual­i­ties, and a cor­rupt doc­tor has got­ten you ad­dicted to that drug.[^9] Say­ing that all we are is our choices ig­nores the fact that some­times choices _are made for us_. Peo­ple don’t choose to be put in many sit­u­a­tions that they’re in—they’re just _in_ them, and those sit­u­a­tions of­ten force them to make other choices that in a more for­giv­ing (or at least neu­tral) world they wouldn’t make. We’ll deal with this in greater de­tail in the next chap­ter, but it’s rel­e­vant here: the choices we make may be our own, but the life into which we’re born, and many of the events that be­fall us af­ter that, are things we of­ten have lit­tle or no con­trol over.[^10]

We’ve now heard a large num­ber of the­o­ries, span­ning dozens of cen­turies, all of which have given us rea­sons to care about whether what we’re do­ing is good and play­books for how we might try to be bet­ter. But there’s one es­sen­tial as­pect of the hu­man con­di­tion that none of them re­ally deals with: _con­text_. Few of these philoso­phies grap­ple with the plain fact that moral choices are a lot harder for some of us than they are for oth­ers, de­pend­ing on our cir­cum­stances. How can it be that the same ex­act rules ap­ply to me, Prince William, that poor woman whose doc­tor got her ad­dicted to Oxy­Con­tin, a South Ko­rean den­tal hy­gien­ist, Cardi B, a sug­ar­cane farmer in Guyana, and you? As we’ve talked about what “we” should do in any given sit­u­a­tion, we’ve ig­nored that within “we” are a whole bunch of dif­fer­ent “me”s, and each “me” de­scribes a unique life with unique chal­lenges and priv­i­leges, which might make the work of be­ing good harder or eas­ier for _that_ “me” than the “me” who lives right next door.

So, enough col­lec­tive “we” ac­tion. Let’s get _spe­cific_.

1. [^1] “In­deed, the word is be­ing so loosely ap­plied to so many things that it has come to mean noth­ing at all.”
2. [^2] He ac­tu­ally didn’t write this at all. The real quote is much longer and more in­tri­cate, but that pithy ver­sion is the one you see all the time. It’s an­other “Play it again, Sam” kind of a deal. More than a cen­tury later, Kurt Von­negut would up­date and re­phrase this sen­ti­ment in a way I find much more fun: “I’m telling you, we are here on Earth to fart around, and don’t let any­body ever tell you any dif­fer­ent.”
3. [^3] Sartre, of course, used “men” and not “peo­ple.”
4. [^4] Or, in the words of Cana­dian rock power trio Rush in their song “Freewill,” “If you choose not to de­cide / You still have made a choice.” Bet you didn’t think when you bought this book on phi­los­o­phy and got to the chap­ter on ex­is­ten­tial­ism you were gonna get a Rush lyric thrown at you, huh? Well, too bad. It hap­pened.
5. [^5] Ca­mus had al­ready died by the time Sartre won and turned down the prize, but I bet if he’d been alive he would’ve been an­noyed that he didn’t have the idea to do that first.
6. [^6] Also, not that this mat­ters, but what a looker, am I right? It’s funny to think of philoso­phers as sexy, but you gotta give it up—Ca­mus was a stone-cold hot­tie.
7. [^7] In trans­la­tion, Ca­mus uses “ir­ra­tional” as a noun, re­fer­ring to the un­know­able mean­ing of things in the uni­verse.
8. [^8] Not all ex­is­ten­tial­ists were French. Søren Kierkegaard was Dan­ish, and peo­ple of­ten call some of the great nine­teenth-cen­tury Rus­sian nov­el­ists (like Dos­toyevsky) ex­is­ten­tial­ists. But again: Come on. It’s _so_ French.
9. [^9] Todd notes that Sartre would also say that ad­dic­tion is a choice. Mike notes that Sartre needs to cool it a lit­tle.
10. [^10] Note from Todd, to ward off protests from the pro-Sartre crowd: Sartre sorta, kinda rec­og­nizes this point obliquely in his con­cept of de­spair, which says, “We must limit our­selves to reck­on­ing only with those things that de­pend on our will, or on the set of prob­a­bil­i­ties that en­able ac­tion. When­ever we de­sire some­thing, there are al­ways el­e­ments of prob­a­bil­ity.” But come on, Sartre, it’s poverty we’re talk­ing about, not black­jack.

    

## CHAP­TER TWELVE I Gave a Twenty-Seven-Cent Tip to My Barista, and Now Ev­ery­one’s Yelling at Me on Twit­ter, Just Be­cause I’m a Bil­lion­aire! I Can’t Even En­joy the Soft-Shell Crab Rolls That My Sushi Chef Made for My Pri­vate Di­ri­gi­ble Trip to the Dutch An­tilles! How Is That Fair?!

The ef­fort we put into be­ing eth­i­cal mat­ters, cer­tainly, but it also mat­ters to what de­gree we can even try. To quote the great pre-So­cratic Greek philoso­pher Xeno­phanes on the sub­ject of daily ex­is­tence, “This shit ain’t easy,”[^1] and the play­ing field isn’t ex­actly level. We do not all have equal amounts of time and en­ergy and money to put to­ward mak­ing good de­ci­sions. As our old friend Ju­lia An­nas writes:

> There are very many peo­ple in the world to­day who live in ter­ri­ble con­di­tions of poverty and vi­o­lence (for ex­am­ple, in the slums of large cities) which make it un­rea­son­able to ex­pect them to re­flect on and crit­i­cize the lessons they are taught by the role mod­els they have, peo­ple who fre­quently (and un­der­stand­ably) em­pha­size the im­por­tance not of the virtues but of look­ing out for yourself, not get­ting held back by car­ing about oth­ers, be­com­ing used to vi­o­lence and cru­elty, and worse.… Most of these peo­ple fail to be­come vir­tu­ous be­cause of the dif­fi­cul­ties of their sit­u­a­tion, not be­cause they are not ca­pa­ble of it.

We may all be born with those virtue starter kits we talked about back in chap­ter 1—we all have the _po­ten­tial_ to be vir­tu­ous—but An­nas points out that it shouldn’t be held against peo­ple when cir­cum­stances deny them the chance to de­velop that po­ten­tial into ac­tual virtues. Re­mem­ber how ob­sessed the Greeks were with teach­ers? Well, what hap­pens when we can’t learn from Aris­to­tle be­cause we don’t have enough money to pay for his fancy elite acad­emy, and the “wis­est man” in our neigh­bor­hood is some skeevy guy who sells knock­off Af­flic­tion shirts out of the back of his van? Many peo­ple in this world might want to spend their time think­ing about ethics and virtue, but they have to fo­cus in­stead on more press­ing mat­ters, like _not starv­ing_, or _not dy­ing of dis­ease_, or _not be­ing killed by rov­ing gangs of para­mil­i­tary troops_. How is that their fault?

Kant’s zero-tol­er­ance pol­icy is hardly bet­ter in this re­gard. For­mu­lat­ing and fol­low­ing uni­ver­sal max­ims can be an im­pos­si­ble lux­ury if your life has taken a wrong turn or con­tains too many daily stres­sors to think about any­thing other than sur­vival. And as for util­i­tar­i­an­ism, well, what if we’re not a trol­ley _driver_ but rather one of the con­struc­tion work­ers, slav­ing away on the tracks in the hot sun for min­i­mum wage, vaguely aware that at any mo­ment we might get flat­tened be­cause of faulty brakes? How can we be held to the same eth­i­cal stan­dard as the pas­sen­ger, who can pon­der the cor­rect moral re­sponse to the sit­u­a­tion with­out fear of death? What if we’re not Jim, the tourist who hap­pens upon Pete hold­ing a gun on the ten lo­cals, but _one of the lo­cals_, and our daily lives in­clude the su­per-fun vari­able that at any mo­ment we might get rounded up and shot as a way for Pete to main­tain his de­mented law-and-or­der reg­i­men? Can we re­ally be ex­pected to spend the same amount of time and en­ergy think­ing about ethics as Jim, who hap­pened upon this night­mare ac­ci­den­tally and af­ter it’s over will get to go back to his re­sort and sip a frozen daiquiri by the pool?

### It’s a Hard(er for Some Peo­ple Than for Oth­ers)-Knock Life

It seems un­fair to de­mand the same level of eth­i­cal ef­fort from an un­wit­tingly opi­oid-ad­dicted woman as we would from Jeff Be­zos, or me, or any av­er­age cit­i­zen. But when we’re con­sid­er­ing cir­cum­stance as a fac­tor in our abil­ity to nav­i­gate life’s myr­iad pit­falls, we don’t even need to con­sider some­one liv­ing un­der _rare_ or _ex­tra­or­di­nary_ pres­sure. The most ba­sic facts of ex­is­tence can cre­ate wildly dif­fer­ent liv­ing ex­pe­ri­ences for two peo­ple who oth­er­wise may ap­pear roughly sim­i­lar. The writer John Scalzi crys­tal­lized the prob­lem of ig­nor­ing con­text and priv­i­lege in a 2012 blog post ti­tled “Straight White Male: The Low­est Dif­fi­culty Set­ting There Is.”

> Imag­ine life here in the U.S.—or in­deed, pretty much any­where in the West­ern world—is a mas­sive role play­ing game, like World of War­craft ex­cept ap­pallingly mun­dane, where most quests in­volve the ac­qui­si­tion of money, cell phones and donuts, al­though not al­ways at the same time. Let’s call it The Real World. You have in­stalled The Real World on your com­puter and are about to start play­ing, but first you go to the set­tings tab to bind your keys, fid­dle with your de­faults, and choose the dif­fi­culty set­ting for the game. Got it?
> 
> Okay: In the role play­ing game known as The Real World, “Straight White Male” is the low­est dif­fi­culty set­ting there is.
> 
> This means that the de­fault be­hav­iors for al­most all the non-player char­ac­ters in the game are eas­ier on you than they would be oth­er­wise. The de­fault bar­ri­ers for com­ple­tions of quests are lower. Your lev­el­ing-up thresh­olds come more quickly. You au­to­mat­i­cally gain en­try to some parts of the map that oth­ers have to work for. The game is eas­ier to play, au­to­mat­i­cally, and when you need help, by de­fault it’s eas­ier to get.[^2]

The fun­da­men­tal prob­lem with ap­ply­ing the same eth­i­cal the­o­ries equally to all peo­ple is that all peo­ple aren’t liv­ing equal lives. Cen­turies of his­tory, so­cioe­co­nomic de­vel­op­ment, racism, gen­derism, and co­ag­u­la­tions of power and cap­i­tal mean that two peo­ple born in roughly the same place at the same time may face _very_ dif­fer­ent hur­dles in their lives. Again, while we may be equal in our _po­ten­tial_ for virtue, not ev­ery­one can ap­ply the same amount of pre­cious re­sources to the _de­vel­op­ment_ of virtue. And if _car­ing_ and _try­ing_ are the most im­por­tant as­pects of eth­i­cal en­gage­ment, that means it would be silly to ask all peo­ple to care and try the same amount.

There is a cer­tain strain of mod­ern West­ern so­ciopo­lit­i­cal thinker that ag­gres­sively ad­mires “mer­i­toc­racy.” Ev­ery so­ci­ety should be a mer­i­toc­racy, ar­gue these ad­her­ents, and we should not pass laws that fa­vor one group of peo­ple over an­other, for any rea­son. There should be no af­fir­ma­tive ac­tion laws for uni­ver­sity ad­mis­sions, no ini­tia­tives to gen­der-bal­ance work­forces. The cream shall sim­ply rise to the top! These peo­ple (usu­ally het­ero­sex­ual, rich, white men, with a book­shelf full of Ayn Rand nov­els) con­ve­niently for­get that for a mer­i­toc­racy to work—for a so­ci­ety to prop­erly value and cel­e­brate hard work and in­di­vid­ual suc­cess—the peo­ple within the so­ci­ety _need to start from the same point of ori­gin_. Oth­er­wise, the cream isn’t ris­ing to the top—the peo­ple who were _clos­est to the top al­ready_ are ris­ing to the top, and the whole con­cept of mer­i­toc­racy crum­bles to dust. What they are ac­tu­ally call­ing for, these peo­ple, is a pseudo-mer­i­toc­racy that does not dis­tin­guish be­tween the ac­com­plish­ments of a man with a Mayflower last name who in­her­ited a bil­lion dol­lars from his dad and those of a Black woman who was born into poverty in a red­lined neigh­bor­hood in a state that en­forces dra­co­nian, racist laws. (Some peo­ple, as the old say­ing goes, were born on third base and think they hit a triple.) It’s not a mer­i­toc­racy if some run­ners start the race ten feet from the fin­ish line and some are de­nied en­try to the race be­cause of sys­temic bi­ases within the Rac­ing Com­mis­sion.

We were all born into cir­cum­stances over which we had no con­trol, and which con­ferred on us cer­tain ad­van­tages or dis­ad­van­tages. I was born a healthy white dude in Amer­ica in 1975, to two mar­ried, col­lege-ed­u­cated par­ents, who never had a lot of money but lived a de­cent mid­dle-class life in cen­tral Con­necti­cut. I didn’t have a say in the mat­ter—that was just my roll of the dice. What did that lucky roll mean for me? It meant I was born with im­mu­nity to the fol­low­ing so­ci­etal ills:

- racism
- sex­ism
- ableism
- misog­yny
- famine
- poverty
- low-qual­ity, un­der­funded schools
- war (in my home coun­try)
- lack of clean wa­ter
- lack of med­i­cal care[^3]

I es­caped all of those booby traps, which can throt­tle peo­ple as they at­tempt to make their way in the world, _through no ef­fort of my own_, just be­cause of the ran­dom, spe­cific em­bryo that I grew out of. I started my life with a mas­sive so­ci­etal ad­van­tage, and when we do a gen­eral checkup of my eth­i­cal re­port card it makes per­fect sense to fac­tor that in. De­mand­ing ap­plause for be­ing a gen­er­ally eth­i­cal per­son would be like me start­ing a marathon twenty-five miles in, beat­ing some­one who started at the ac­tual start­ing line,[^4] and then brag­ging about win­ning. I have got­ten to play the video game of life on the eas­i­est pos­si­ble set­ting, so if I make a bad choice, I have made a _re­ally_ bad choice. Think again of Jean Val­jean in _Les Mis­érables_. He steals a loaf of bread to feed his sis­ter’s fam­ily and ends up serv­ing nine­teen years in prison. But he was poor, his fam­ily was starv­ing, and he felt he had no choice. Now con­sider this: What if I—now an adult tele­vi­sion writer with plenty of money and a nice house and no cute lit­tle starv­ing French urchins to feed—steal a loaf of bread, just… be­cause? Kant would say the two ac­tions—Jean Val­jean steal­ing bread and me steal­ing bread—are the same, be­cause both vi­o­late the same uni­ver­sal maxim. Sartre might agree—we both sim­ply made a choice. But I would say that when Jean Val­jean stole a loaf of bread to feed his starv­ing fam­ily, he was coura­geous, valiant, self-sac­ri­fic­ing, and gen­er­ous, whereas when I did it I was just a rich ass­hole who stole a loaf of bread for no rea­son. My crime would be _worse_.

### The Luck of the Draw

Now, af­ter the cir­cum­stances of our births put us on a course we had no choice in tak­ing, our lives un­fold in any of a bil­lion pos­si­ble ways. Peo­ple born white, rich, and male in Amer­ica con­tract de­bil­i­tat­ing dis­eases. Peo­ple born fe­male, bi­sex­ual, and South Asian be­come wealthy pop stars. Lives ebb and flow; for­tunes are made, lost, or ripped away; we’re in the right or wrong place at the right or wrong time and ei­ther ben­e­fit[^5] or suf­fer; our friends and fam­ily de­mand more or less from us. In short, even if we start our jour­neys with a cer­tain level of ease or dif­fi­culty, we’re still some­what at the mercy of chance. A lot of life—be­fore we’re born and af­ter—is just _luck_, good or bad, so we ought to un­der­stand how ex­actly that luck af­fects us and our abil­ity to be good.

Some years ago, a so­cial sci­en­tist named Robert Frank was play­ing ten­nis with a friend and had a mas­sive heart at­tack. His friend di­aled 911, and the dis­patcher called for an am­bu­lance. Emer­gency ve­hi­cles were usu­ally sent from a lo­ca­tion miles away and would’ve taken thirty to forty min­utes to get to the ten­nis courts, but as it hap­pened, two am­bu­lances had just re­ported to the scenes of two dif­fer­ent car ac­ci­dents only a minute from where Frank was ly­ing mo­tion­less. One of those am­bu­lances was able to peel away, get to Frank im­me­di­ately, and save his life. Frank later learned he had suf­fered from “sud­den car­diac death”—a pretty god­damn in­tense-sound­ing med­i­cal con­di­tion that is 98 per­cent fa­tal, and the few who do sur­vive it of­ten have in­tense and last­ing side ef­fects, which he did not.

When Frank woke up and learned what had hap­pened, he had a lovely re­ac­tion: From that mo­ment on, he thought, _ev­ery­thing_ that hap­pened in his life was due di­rectly to good luck. With­out the ran­dom good for­tune of the nearby am­bu­lance he would’ve had no more mo­ments _of any kind_, which means that _ev­ery­thing he ex­pe­ri­enced af­ter­ward_ was fruit from that lucky tree. (It’s also sort of “meta-lucky” that this event hap­pened to a so­cial sci­en­tist who was able to ex­am­ine it in­tel­lec­tu­ally and find mean­ing in it.) That re­al­iza­tion led him to hy­poth­e­size that peo­ple gen­er­ally un­der­es­ti­mate the role that luck has played in their lives. “Why do so many of us down­play luck in the face of com­pelling ev­i­dence of its im­por­tance?” he asks. “The ten­dency may owe in part to the fact that by em­pha­siz­ing tal­ent and hard work to the ex­clu­sion of other fac­tors, suc­cess­ful peo­ple re­in­force their claim to the money they’ve earned.” In other words, peo­ple who achieve (or in­herit) a high level of wealth and suc­cess are in­vested in the idea that they _earned_ it.[^6] That be­lief al­lows us to feel like we have con­trol over this big dumb scary world—that if we’re smart and work hard we will be ap­pro­pri­ately re­warded and ev­ery­thing will be fine. Con­ced­ing that a lot of this is dumb luck—in­clud­ing, most sig­nif­i­cantly, em­bryo-re­lated stuff that hap­pened be­fore we were even con­scious be­ings—is to con­cede that there were other fac­tors at play be­yond our own in­cred­i­ble­ness, and that we’re maybe not as amaz­ing as our lot in life would in­di­cate.

Frank wants us to un­der­stand that a per­son’s jour­ney to suc­cess ac­tu­ally be­gins long be­fore it might ap­pear to. Take Michael Jor­dan, who’s gen­er­ally re­garded as the great­est bas­ket­ball player who ever lived.[^7] No one worked harder, at any­thing, than Jor­dan worked at bas­ket­ball. His de­ter­mi­na­tion was un­par­al­leled, his com­mit­ment to his craft was off the charts, his in­ten­sity and com­pet­i­tive drive are leg­endary. Think­ing of Jor­dan as a guy who didn’t _earn_ ev­ery­thing he got—all the cham­pi­onships, the MVPs, the ac­co­lades—seems lu­di­crous. _And yet_. Jor­dan is six foot six. He didn’t achieve that height be­cause he, like, worked re­ally hard at be­ing tall. He was also born in Amer­ica, to par­ents who sup­ported and en­cour­aged his pas­sion. Those two facts make him _lucky_. If you take Jor­dan’s ex­act per­son­al­ity, tal­ent pro­file, and work ethic, and put them in the body of a five-foot-two goat herder in Bangladesh, he does not be­come Air Jor­dan, six-time NBA cham­pion. He be­comes the most in­tense and ir­ri­tat­ing Bangladeshi goat herder in his­tory, who’s con­stantly yelling at the other goat herders for not be­ing good enough at herd­ing goats. In fact, for­get about chang­ing his height and birth­place—if Jor­dan had been born _ex­actly the same per­son_, but sev­enty-five years ear­lier, we likely never would have heard of him. Base­ball play­ers like Os­car Charles­ton, Cool Papa Bell, Satchel Paige, Josh Gib­son, and Buck O’Neil aren’t of­ten listed among the all-time greats, be­cause they were born into an era of seg­re­ga­tion and de­nied the chance to play along­side Joe DiMag­gio and Ted Williams. Were they less tal­ented, or less dili­gent? Ob­vi­ously not. They were vic­tims of bad luck, born into a racist world that kept them out of the ma­jor leagues.

Think­ing of it this way, ev­ery­one who achieves _any­thing_, no mat­ter how tal­ented or driven, ben­e­fits in some way from chance. Some peo­ple—far too few, but some—un­der­stand that. War­ren Buf­fett, who as noted ear­lier has pledged to give 99 per­cent of his wealth to char­ity, writes this on his giv­ing­pledge.org page:

> My wealth has come from a com­bi­na­tion of liv­ing in Amer­ica, some lucky genes, and com­pound in­ter­est. Both my chil­dren and I won what I call the ovar­ian lot­tery. (For starters, the odds against my 1930 birth tak­ing place in the U.S. were at least 30 to 1. My be­ing male and white also re­moved huge ob­sta­cles that a ma­jor­ity of Amer­i­cans then faced.)

Again, no one would dis­pute that War­ren Buf­fett is a ge­nius. But he is a rare ge­nius in­deed, in that he hap­pily ac­knowl­edges the many strokes of good for­tune that fa­cil­i­tated his rise. Walk­ing us through the his­tory of Mi­cro­soft, Frank writes:

> Most of us would never have heard of Mi­cro­soft if any one of a long se­quence of im­prob­a­ble events had not oc­curred. If Bill Gates had been born in 1945 rather than 1955, if his high school had not had a com­puter club with one of the first ter­mi­nals that could of­fer in­stant feed­back, if IBM had reached an agree­ment with Gary Kil­dall’s Dig­i­tal Re­search, or if Tim Pa­ter­son had been a more ex­pe­ri­enced ne­go­tia­tor, Gates al­most cer­tainly never would have suc­ceeded on such a grand scale.

The peo­ple and events he ref­er­ences there are foot­notes in the life of Bill Gates—early deals or non­deals, events that al­most oc­curred but didn’t—that at the time seemed of mi­nus­cule im­por­tance but which nudged Gates’s life along a slightly dif­fer­ent path from the one he was on. They were, for him, _lucky_—ut­terly un­re­lated to his tal­ent or hard work or any­thing else. Just the Ping-Pong balls of the uni­verse bounc­ing ran­domly around and land­ing in an ar­range­ment that ben­e­fited him as he launched his re­mark­able ca­reer. No one on earth would say Bill Gates and Michael Jor­dan don’t _de­serve_ what they have—they’re ge­niuses! But Frank’s point is: It’s okay to ad­mit that _part_ of what they have is due to luck. It doesn’t di­min­ish their achieve­ments. It sim­ply ac­knowl­edges that we _all_ owe part of our suc­cess to chance, and cel­e­brates those smart and ca­pa­ble and tal­ented enough to cap­i­tal­ize on the breaks that go their way. And as we move around the world, bump­ing into peo­ple and in­ter­act­ing with them in a mil­lion big and small ways, that gives us a cru­cial per­spec­tive on their lives.

### The Gods of Luck De­mand Trib­ute!

I like to go to Las Ve­gas maybe once a year. I play mostly low-stakes black­jack, $10 or $15 a hand, and usu­ally end up los­ing a cou­ple hun­dred bucks. On the rare oc­ca­sion when I end my trip in the black—up $100 or some­thing—I feel ner­vous and un­happy. Why? Be­cause I con­sider my­self to be among the very luck­i­est peo­ple on earth. So when I lose $150 play­ing ac­tual games of chance, it makes sense—it’s like a sac­ri­fice I’m mak­ing to the gods of luck, to thank them for the mil­lion-to-one slot ma­chine jack­pot that helped get me where I am. (The sim­ple fact that I can af­ford to lose a cou­ple hun­dred bucks in a casino with­out it af­fect­ing my life at all means I’m prob­a­bly in the top 0.1 per­cent of all peo­ple on earth, luck-wise.) I work hard, and I think I’m good at what I do. But con­sider the fol­low­ing facts of my life:

1. I stayed home sick from school one day and my mom rented me the movie _Sleeper_, which caused me to fall in love with com­edy.
2. I got into Har­vard—through hard work, cer­tainly—but Har­vard had the _Lam­poon_ mag­a­zine, which had been churn­ing out pro­fes­sional com­edy writ­ers for decades be­fore I got there and joined the staff, which meant that when I grad­u­ated,
3. I had friends work­ing at _Sat­ur­day Night Live_ who agreed to help me sub­mit a packet of ma­te­rial, which led to me get­ting hired there, and when I did,
4. I sucked at writ­ing sketches for a full year. This isn’t false mod­esty—I was _bad_. My sketches bombed very hard at the ta­ble reads, and by any ra­tio­nal mea­sure I should have been fired. Ex­cept that
5. right be­fore I got hired there was a big staff shake-up, be­cause an NBC ex­ec­u­tive had fired Norm Mac­don­ald for mak­ing too many jokes about O.J. Simp­son (who was a friend of the ex­ec­u­tive in ques­tion)—this was a true rar­ity for _SNL_, to have NBC ex­ecs weigh in on staff de­ci­sions. Plus, three weeks be­fore I got hired Chris Far­ley had trag­i­cally died of a drug over­dose and he was be­ing mourned by the show (and the whole coun­try), and those two events had thrown the whole _SNL_ ecosys­tem into tur­moil. So, ba­si­cally,
6. no­body even no­ticed I was there—no one paid at­ten­tion to the new guy who sucked, grant­ing me cru­cial time to fig­ure out how to do the job, which I even­tu­ally did. Af­ter a cou­ple of years my friend Robert, who’d been pro­duc­ing the Week­end Up­date seg­ment, left to take a job in Los An­ge­les, and I was ap­pointed to re­place him, be­cause there weren’t that many other peo­ple who ei­ther wanted it or were that much more qual­i­fied than I was, so
7. I be­gan pro­duc­ing Week­end Up­date, which at the time was hosted by Tina Fey and Jimmy Fal­lon, who were so good at what they did and had such ex­cel­lent comedic chem­istry that the seg­ment be­came in­cred­i­bly pop­u­lar—ar­guably as pop­u­lar as that seg­ment had ever been. Af­ter three years, my girl­friend and I de­cided to move in to­gether, and she lived in Los An­ge­les, so even though I had a re­ally good job, it made more sense for me to move there (where there are more writ­ing jobs) than it did for her to move to New York. I ar­rived in L.A. at the ex­act mo­ment that
8. Greg Daniels had de­cided to adapt the British show _The Of­fice_ for Amer­i­can TV and was look­ing for writ­ers. Be­cause Greg is so thor­ough and hard­work­ing, he read some­thing like five hun­dred sam­ple scripts in or­der to hire his small writ­ing staff, in­clud­ing _my_ sam­ple, which he liked. _The Of­fice_ was a highly risky en­deavor and NBC had only picked it up for six episodes (a very small com­mit­ment, show­ing lit­tle faith in the show’s long-term prospects), and I was po­ten­tially get­ting an­other of­fer from a show that had a thir­teen-episode or­der—ob­vi­ously a safer bet, with more than twice the guar­an­teed salary. But the night be­fore that meet­ing I had in­som­nia (very rare for me) and when I met the pro­duc­ers I was mis­er­ably tired and bor­ing and low-en­ergy, and they didn’t of­fer me a job, so when Greg _did_ of­fer me a job, I took it, and
9. Greg turned out to be the great­est men­tor and teacher in all of show busi­ness, walk­ing me and the other very green writ­ers on the staff through the process of cre­at­ing and ex­e­cut­ing sto­ries step by step (which most peo­ple in his po­si­tion don’t do, be­cause it’s such painstak­ing work). So I learned how to write half-hour com­edy from a true mas­ter of the form—ev­ery­body needs a teacher!—and then we made six episodes of _The Of­fice_ and it de­buted on NBC in 2005 and
10. ev­ery­one hated it. The rat­ings were ter­ri­ble. It had no chance to get picked up for a sec­ond sea­son… ex­cept that the ex­ec­u­tive in charge of NBC at the time, Kevin Reilly, deeply be­lieved in it, and he de­cided to es­sen­tially risk his en­tire ca­reer on its suc­cess (again, not some­thing ex­ec­u­tives nor­mally do). In the in­terim, mean­while, Steve Carell had done a movie called _The 40-Year-Old Vir­gin_, which had been a wild and un­ex­pected suc­cess, so NBC thought, “Well, fine, we have this movie star un­der con­tract, might as well give this show an­other shot.” When we came back for sea­son two,
11. the rat­ings mas­sively in­creased, in part be­cause
12. our times­lot fol­lowed a new show called _My Name Is Earl_, which was very pop­u­lar right out of the gate, and in those days peo­ple would just kind of leave their TVs on and pas­sively watch things that came on af­ter things they _chose_ to watch, so more peo­ple sam­pled _The Of­fice_, and came to en­joy it, thanks in large part to some very smart cre­ative de­ci­sions Greg made be­tween sea­sons. So it took off and be­came an enor­mous hit, which led to
13. Greg ask­ing me to de­velop a show with him. Be­cause NBC was des­per­ate to cap­i­tal­ize on its suc­cess with an­other Greg Daniels show, they said he could do what­ever he wanted, re­ally, and they’d guar­an­tee that it would get a full-sea­son com­mit­ment (com­mon now, an ex­treme rar­ity for the time). So he and I de­vel­oped _Parks and Recre­ation_, but we had no idea who could play the lead role, un­til
14. Amy Poehler de­cided to leave _Sat­ur­day Night Live_, where she had just fin­ished a mul­ti­year run as one of the most tal­ented and beloved cast mem­bers in that show’s his­tory. We asked her to do it and she said yes, which meant that
15. the first show I ever cre­ated (a) had Greg Daniels as my men­tor, (b) had Amy Poehler as the star and cre­ative part­ner, and (c) was guar­an­teed a full sea­son on the air to find its sea legs. And yet it only _barely_ sur­vived, be­cause we didn’t re­ally write it very well in the first few episodes and didn’t fig­ure out how to cre­ate a char­ac­ter that played to Amy’s strengths un­til the end of the first sea­son, but we even­tu­ally did and the show im­proved, and also by the way
16. Chris Pratt was in the cast, mostly be­cause
17. my wife had worked with him on _The O.C._ and told me when we were cast­ing it that he was oth­er­worldly tal­ented, and since he hap­pened to be avail­able we scooped him up, and he turned out to be end­lessly funny and won­der­ful, as did
18. all of the other peo­ple in the cast, like Rashida Jones (whom I’d met on the sec­ond day of our fresh­man year in col­lege and be­came friends with) and Nick Of­fer­man (who’d au­di­tioned for a role in an _Of­fice_ episode I’d writ­ten but was un­avail­able, but whose name I wrote on a Post-it note, vow­ing to cast him in some­thing, some­day), and Aubrey Plaza, who
19. had her­self _just_ ar­rived in L.A. when we were cast­ing the show and hap­pened to ap­pear in the of­fice of our cast­ing di­rec­tor, Al­li­son Jones, who called me and said, “I just met the weird­est twenty-two-year-old woman I’ve ever seen, I think she’s re­ally spe­cial,” and an hour later Aubrey met with me and the other pro­duc­ers and we thought she was hi­lar­i­ous and im­me­di­ately wrote her into the show, and
20. so on and so on and so on, to in­fin­ity.

Do you see why I like to make a sac­ri­fice to the gods of luck? My own abil­i­ties and work ethic not­with­stand­ing, my ac­tual jour­ney through Hol­ly­wood is a god­damn _Jenga tower_ of luck. That list of good for­tune I just laid out doesn’t in­clude about a thou­sand other things that broke right for me at var­i­ous times in my life. They’re count­less. I think about them all the time. I also think about what my life would be if I’d been born some­where else, at an­other mo­ment, in an­other body, with fewer op­por­tu­ni­ties—about how in many cru­cial ways, I have played this video game on the eas­i­est set­ting. And what I take from that is that I can’t just lose a cou­ple hun­dred bucks in Ve­gas to pay off my debt to the gods of luck. It means my moral re­quire­ments, on a day-to-day ba­sis, are far greater than av­er­age. I owe more to most peo­ple than they do to me.

That doesn’t mean un­lucky peo­ple get to run wild through the streets, do­ing what­ever they want. We should al­ways re­mem­ber that there is a base­line of moral­ity—some com­bi­na­tion of cal­cu­la­tions based on virtue ethics, con­se­quen­tial­ism, de­on­tol­ogy, and so on—that ev­ery­one must ad­here to. But it _does_ mean that the higher up the scale we go, with re­spect to good for­tune and wealth and sta­tus and (thus) free­dom to move about the world with­out fear or pain, the higher the eth­i­cal stan­dard is to which we should ad­here. Peo­ple are not all the same—but all peo­ple are sub­ject to forces be­yond their con­trol, and dif­fer­ent peo­ple ben­e­fit or suf­fer from those forces to dif­fer­ent de­grees. A just so­ci­ety ac­counts for the fact that peo­ple can’t choose the con­text into which they’re born, or the ran­dom winds that buf­fet them once they ar­rive. All of which makes me think of John Rawls.

### The Veil of Ig­no­rance: Let’s Level This Play­ing Field a Lit­tle!

Rawls (1921–2002) was a po­lit­i­cal philoso­pher and ethi­cist whose work drew heav­ily from Kant and Mill, and he was a friend and col­league of T. M. Scan­lon. His most fa­mous work is a six-hun­dred-page beast called _A The­ory of Jus­tice_ (1971). Some­time in the 1960s, Rawls fin­ished a much shorter first ver­sion and showed it to a bunch of col­leagues and stu­dents who gave him ex­ten­sive notes and feed­back, which ap­par­ently he in­cor­po­rated _all_ of, be­cause _woof_ is this thing long. But _Jus­tice_ does con­tain one of my fa­vorite eth­i­cal ideas, which is eas­ily un­der­stood: the veil of ig­no­rance.

When kids want to split some­thing—a piece of cake, or a pile of M&M’s, or what­ever—par­ents will of­ten tell one kid she can di­vide it into parts, but must give the other kid the first choice. The veil of ig­no­rance is es­sen­tially this idea, pre­sented more thor­oughly. Rawls says that we ought to de­cide the rules for our so­ci­ety from what he calls the “orig­i­nal po­si­tion”—mean­ing ide­ally, we’d all de­cide how we would divvy up things like salaries and re­sources for our so­ci­ety _be­fore_ we knew which role we were go­ing to play _in_ that so­ci­ety. We’d con­ceive of these rules from be­hind a “veil of ig­no­rance” re­gard­ing who we’re all go­ing to be­come—it’s like de­cid­ing what the rules will be for grown-up hu­mans, back when we’re all em­bryos. This, he says, guar­an­tees a de­cently just world, and fur­ther guar­an­tees that we’ll all _think_ of it as just. “Cer­tain prin­ci­ples of jus­tice,” he writes, “are jus­ti­fied be­cause they would be agreed to in an ini­tial sit­u­a­tion of equal­ity.”

So, let’s say we’re about to start a so­ci­ety, one that (like all so­ci­eties) will have lim­ited re­sources and cap­i­tal, and to­day we’re go­ing to es­tab­lish salary ranges for a bunch of jobs: truck driv­ers, me­chan­ics, base­ball play­ers, nurses, and teach­ers. This so­ci­ety is some kind of cool sci­ence fic­tion so­ci­ety, though, where once we’ve es­tab­lished all the rules, we walk through a magic por­tal and emerge on the other side with a set of tal­ents (and there­fore, a likely ca­reer) that will be ran­domly as­signed to us—so, it’s _pos­si­ble_ that we’ll be­come a base­ball player, but _more likely_ that we’ll be­come a nurse or a teacher (sim­ply be­cause there will be more of them than base­ball play­ers). The por­tal, in other words, is _luck_—it will stamp us with abil­i­ties, qual­i­ties, and life cir­cum­stances that we have no con­trol over, like height, eth­nic­ity, in­tel­li­gence, hand-eye co­or­di­na­tion, bag­pipe-play­ing abil­ity, and a mil­lion other things. When de­sign­ing so­ci­etal guide­lines for how we pay and treat peo­ple of dif­fer­ent pro­fes­sions, then, we might think the fol­low­ing: (a) We could end up be­ing a base­ball player! That would be amaz­ing. Base­ball players’ tal­ents are rare and de­sir­able, so we should make sure that base­ball play­ers’ po­ten­tial salaries are high. But also (b) we’re more likely to end up be­ing a me­chanic, or nurse, or teacher, so we should en­sure that the _min­i­mum_ salaries for them aren’t so low that they end up mis­er­able, and (c) also we might want to en­sure that the laws gov­ern­ing our so­ci­ety pro­vide am­ple re­sources for schools and hos­pi­tals and the like, be­cause if we’re a teacher and our school has no money we’ll be bummed out. Since there’s only so much money and cap­i­tal to go around, we won’t al­low any one pro­fes­sion or sec­tor of so­ci­ety to drain too many of our re­sources.

We can see how Rawls’s work is a close cousin of Scan­lon’s, right? In­stead of propos­ing rules for our world that no rea­son­able per­son could re­ject, Rawls wants to pro­pose them _be­fore we’re out in the world_, walk­ing around and do­ing stuff—be­cause if we make rules be­fore we know what we’ll all be­come, we’ll all surely agree to them. Be­hind the veil of ig­no­rance, we will all im­me­di­ately re­al­ize that there’s no way for any of us to gain an up­per hand here—no one can know any more or less about what any one of us will be­come when we go through the por­tal. Scan­lon (as Pamela Hi­eronymi pointed out to me) took that idea of sym­me­try and just shifted it later in the process—his “rea­son­able peo­ple” for­mu­la­tion asks that all of us en­gage in a sim­i­lar kind of sym­me­try _af­ter_ we’ve (metaphor­i­cally) walked through the por­tal and learned what our lives are like. His ver­sion is more op­ti­mistic—be­cause it sug­gests we can equate our own lives and needs and de­sires with ev­ery­one else’s _af­ter we’ve al­ready been liv­ing them_, mean­ing that peo­ple who have led good and/or lucky lives will rec­og­nize that they need to be em­pa­thetic to­ward those who’ve been less for­tu­nate. But Rawls’s ver­sion would likely be more ef­fec­tive, if it were pos­si­ble in some kind of cool sci­ence fic­tion uni­verse, due to the ex­act re­al­ity we’ve dis­cussed in this chap­ter: peo­ple who are suc­cess­ful are of­ten overly in­vested in the idea that they and they alone are re­spon­si­ble for their suc­cess, and are some­times ig­no­rant to, or un­will­ing to al­low for, the im­por­tant role luck has played in their lives.

So: this isn’t util­i­tar­i­an­ism, where in­di­vid­u­als are co­ag­u­lated and flat­tened out into one big in­dis­tin­guish­able mass of “hap­pi­ness” or “pain.” In Rawls’s world, be­fore we know what job we’re go­ing to have or what set of abil­i­ties we’ll be as­signed, we al­low for and ac­cept the in­evitable dif­fer­ences in tal­ent and “so­ci­etal value” of the the­o­ret­i­cal pro­fes­sions we might be as­signed—in other words, af­ter we move through the por­tal, we re­tain our in­tegrity as in­di­vid­u­als. We ac­knowl­edge that some peo­ple will be bet­ter than oth­ers at cer­tain skills that are more highly val­ued by our so­ci­ety—and thus that some jobs will pay bet­ter than oth­ers—and we’re okay with that. But we also take _luck_ into ac­count. The magic por­tal thingy means that we don’t con­trol what we be­come, so we set a high enough floor for _ev­ery­one_ that means no­body will end up suf­fer­ing due only to the caprices of luck. “No one,” writes Rawls, “should be ad­van­taged or dis­ad­van­taged by nat­u­ral for­tune or so­cial cir­cum­stances in the choice of the prin­ci­ples. It also seems widely agreed that it should be im­pos­si­ble to tai­lor prin­ci­ples to the cir­cum­stances of one’s own case.” In Rawls’s sce­nario we di­vide up the pile of M&M’s, but since the uni­verse de­cides who gets which por­tion, we’re gonna di­vide it (some­what) equally.

Rawls had es­sen­tially the same beef with util­i­tar­i­an­ism that Bernard Williams did. As Rawls phrased it, util­i­tar­i­an­ism “does not take se­ri­ously the dis­tinc­tion be­tween per­sons.” He wasn’t in­ter­ested in try­ing to max­i­mize over­all hap­pi­ness in the world as it stands, but rather wanted to de­sign a so­ci­ety that ev­ery mem­ber would the­o­ret­i­cally sign up for, with the com­fort of know­ing it would be rel­a­tively just. That world could re­ward the Tom Han­kses and Ser­ena Williamses among us by al­low­ing them to be ap­pro­pri­ately com­pen­sated and cel­e­brated, but never at the ex­pense of teach­ers or postal work­ers or nurses or auto me­chan­ics or any­one else. And though Rawls doesn’t deal with this as­pect much, I like to imag­ine an­other ben­e­fit: the Han­kses and Williamses would al­ways ac­knowl­edge the in­cred­i­ble por­tal-based for­tune that al­lowed them to be­come what they are, no mat­ter how much nat­u­ral tal­ent they were born with or hard work they put into de­vel­op­ing it.

### Re­mem­ber the Por­tal!

Let’s take Rawls and Frank on a quick jaunt back to the ques­tion from chap­ter 4: Do we have to re­turn our shop­ping cart to the rack? When we’re faced with one of those mun­dane ques­tions, af­ter we ap­ply con­trac­tu­al­ist rules or seek a golden mean or fol­low a Kan­tian maxim or do all of these things in what­ever com­bi­na­tion we see fit, we need to re­mem­ber one fi­nal thing: If we can even af­ford to be ask­ing what we should do here, it prob­a­bly means we’re pretty lucky peo­ple. We have a car full of gro­ceries—and thus a func­tion­ing car—and the lux­ury of pos­ing philo­soph­i­cal ques­tions, in­stead of hav­ing to think only about our health or safety or where we’re go­ing to find our next meal. If we de­ter­mine that rel­a­tive to oth­ers we’re lucky, which means we _can_ af­ford to do a lit­tle ex­tra, then we _should_ do a lit­tle ex­tra. And I don’t mean “War­ren Buf­fett” lucky—just lucky enough that we’re able to do some­thing to make other peo­ple’s lives a bit eas­ier, at lit­tle or no real cost to our own. There are bil­lions of peo­ple for whom that isn’t the case, so we have a duty to pick up the slack. Do a bit more than we’re eth­i­cally re­quired to do. Pay back the gods of luck. And if we’re _not_ lucky—if life has dealt us a se­ries of blows that mean our in­ter­nal bat­ter­ies are run­ning at 1 per­cent and we’re barely scrap­ing by, well, we fall back on those con­trac­tu­al­ist rules—we do what­ever we can to ad­dress the min­i­mum amount we owe to each other.

We’re al­most at the end of our jour­ney. We’ve learned what we’re do­ing, why we’re do­ing it, whether we could be do­ing some­thing bet­ter, and why it would be bet­ter. We’re flour­ish­ing like eth­i­cal rock stars over here! But we’ve also screwed up. A lot. We knew that would hap­pen—the in­evitable out­come of a life of car­ing and try­ing is a never-end­ing stream of screwups, great and small. So there’s one last thing we have to do, and it stinks. We have to apol­o­gize.

## CHAP­TER THIR­TEEN I Screwed Up. Do I Have to Say I’m Sorry?

Any­one with kids will rec­og­nize this scene, which plays out in my home once a week:

- KID 1: Dad! He yanked the re­mote out of my hand and he won’t give it back!
- KID 2: She wasn’t even us­ing it!
- PAR­ENT: You can’t just yank things out of peo­ple’s hands. It’s not okay to do that.
- KID 2: (_toss­ing it back_) Fine.
- PAR­ENT: Say you’re sorry.
- KID 2:…
- PAR­ENT: Come on. Say you’re sorry. Apol­o­gize.
- KID 2:…
- PAR­ENT: We can stand here as long as you want. But you have to say you’re sorry.

(_They stand there “as long as Kid 2 wants.” Min­utes go by. Then hours. Day turns to night. No one eats. Phones ring and go unan­swered. Some­where in the dis­tance, a lone wolf howls. The sands of time slowly fall through the hour­glass. Civ­i­liza­tions are made and un­made, forests rise and then burn to ash, a re­minder of the only true con­stant in the uni­verse: change it­self. Then…_)

- KID 2: (_mum­bled_) Sorry.

Do­ing some­thing wrong hurts. It stinks. It’s em­bar­rass­ing. But _apol­o­giz­ing_ can hurt more and stink more and be _more_ em­bar­rass­ing. Feel­ing pri­vate guilt is one thing; apol­o­giz­ing com­pounds that guilt with the shame of a pub­lic ad­mis­sion. But tempt­ing though it is to avoid that shame af­ter we screw up, apol­o­giz­ing is the fi­nal as­cent on the moun­tain we have to climb in or­der to be­come bet­ter peo­ple. It’s the punc­tu­a­tion mark on the end of an Aris­totelian sen­tence that de­scribes our search for virtue; it’s an eas­ily for­mu­lated Kan­tian maxim, a util­i­tar­ian hap­pi­ness in­creaser, and a con­trac­tu­al­ist debt we can pay off, all in one. With­out an apol­ogy, the wound of a moral wrong can’t com­pletely heal.

But it stinks!

But we gotta do it.

But it stinks.

Part of the trou­ble with apol­o­giz­ing is that all we can think about, in the mo­ments lead­ing up to the act it­self, is the awk­ward, halt­ing mor­ti­fi­ca­tion of ad­mit­ting fault in front of other peo­ple. The _good_ parts—the heal­ing and growth and res­o­lu­tion—are harder to see. Apolo­gies are not “eth­i­cal” ac­tions, per se, but I feel like they’re ethics-ad­ja­cent. If car­ing and try­ing are the key to eth­i­cal im­prove­ment and fail­ure is the in­evitable re­sult, apolo­gies are like an exit in­ter­view for that fail­ure. What did we do? Why did we do it? What did we learn about how it af­fected other peo­ple? The ick­i­ness we feel when we apol­o­gize—the flushed-face shame that comes from ad­mit­ting fault to a per­son we’ve wronged—is _good_. It means _we_ feel the pain we’ve caused, and we care that we caused it. (A per­son in­ca­pable of shame, said Aris­to­tle, has no sense of dis­grace.) Those feel­ings are like flu symp­toms—it’s our bod­ies work­ing to cure what ails us.

But be­cause apolo­gies are so fraught with that ick­i­ness, peo­ple, as a whole, are _ter­ri­ble_ at them. Like any­thing else, there are good and bad ver­sions of apolo­gies; if we’re go­ing to take a deep breath, con­front our fear of shame, and ac­tu­ally make one, we ought to do it right. In 1985, Tom Petty did a con­cert tour for his al­bum _South­ern Ac­cents_ whose stage de­sign fea­tured a huge Con­fed­er­ate bat­tle flag. Years later, af­ter many peo­ple had pointed out to him what that flag rep­re­sents, he said this in _Rolling Stone_:

> The Con­fed­er­ate flag was the wall­pa­per of the South when I was a kid grow­ing up in Gainesville, Flor­ida. I al­ways knew it had to do with the Civil War, but the South had adopted it as its logo. I was pretty ig­no­rant of what it ac­tu­ally meant. It was on a flag­pole in front of the court­house and I of­ten saw it in West­ern movies. I just hon­estly didn’t give it much thought, though I should have.… It left me feel­ing stupid. That’s the word I can use. I felt stupid. If I had just been a lit­tle more ob­ser­vant about things go­ing on around me, it wouldn’t have hap­pened.… I still feel bad about it. I’ve just al­ways re­gret­ted it.… When [South­ern­ers] wave that flag, they aren’t stop­ping to think how it looks to a Black per­son. I blame my­self for not do­ing that.… It was dumb and it shouldn’t have hap­pened.

I love this state­ment. It’s clear and straight­for­ward. He doesn’t dig in his heels or make ex­cuses; in­stead he just ex­plains how it hap­pened, ac­knowl­edges that he blew it, names the peo­ple he hurt, and ex­presses re­gret. This is the cor­rect way to apol­o­gize. If you were a per­son who felt pain be­cause a pop­u­lar rock star val­i­dated a sym­bol of hate, and then (even years later) you saw this state­ment, the pain might dis­si­pate.

Now let’s swing on over to the other kind of apol­ogy. In July of 2020, Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Ted Yoho ac­costed his col­league Alexan­dria Oca­sio-Cortez on the steps of the Capi­tol, and called her (among other things) a “f*ck­ing b*tch.” Pres­sured to apol­o­gize, Yoho took to the floor of Con­gress and said this:

> I rise to apol­o­gize for the abrupt man­ner of the con­ver­sa­tion I had with my col­league from New York. It is true that we dis­agree on poli­cies and vi­sions for Amer­ica but that does not mean we should be dis­re­spect­ful.

So far so good! I mean, I don’t think you were asked to apol­o­gize for the “abrupt man­ner” of the con­ver­sa­tion as much as the ac­tual words you said, but we’ll give you the ben­e­fit of the doubt.

> Hav­ing been mar­ried for forty-five years with two daugh­ters, I’m very cog­nizant of my lan­guage. The of­fen­sive name-call­ing words at­trib­uted to me by the press were never spo­ken to my col­leagues and if they were con­strued that way, I apol­o­gize for the mis­un­der­stand­ing.

Uh-oh. Any­time some­one who claims to be apol­o­giz­ing for some­thing drags his wife and kids into the mix for no rea­son, alarm bells should go off. I can’t be a bad per­son, be­cause some­one loves me and also I’m a par­ent![1](ch13.xhtml#footnote-004) Also, it’s not re­ally an apol­ogy if you deny the in­ci­dent in ques­tion hap­pened. If it didn’t hap­pen… why apol­o­gize? And fi­nally, “if they were con­strued that way”? How ex­actly _should_ Oca­sio-Cortez have “con­strued” the phrase “f*ck­ing b*tch”? Joc­u­lar, good-na­tured rib­bing? But keep go­ing, Con­gress­man, I guess, and let’s see if we can get this train back on track.

> My wife, Car­olyn, and I started to­gether at the age of nine­teen with noth­ing.

Nope. More off-track. Wheels com­ing loose, dash­board flash­ing red warn­ing sig­nals, omi­nous smoke pour­ing out of en­gine.

> We did odd jobs. And we were on food stamps. I know the face of poverty. And for a time it was mine.

Ted? Buddy? Why are we get­ting into your fi­nan­cial his­tory? You’re apol­o­giz­ing to some­one, re­mem­ber?

> That is why I know peo­ple in this coun­try can still with all its faults rise up and suc­ceed and not be en­cour­aged to break the law.

… I’m lost now. What are you even do­ing here, guy? Which peo­ple? Who was en­cour­aged to break a law? What law?! _What are you talk­ing about?_

> I will com­mit to each of you that I will con­duct my­self from a place of pas­sion and un­der­stand­ing that pol­icy and po­lit­i­cal dis­agree­ment be vig­or­ously de­bated with the knowl­edge that we ap­proach the prob­lems fac­ing our na­tion with the bet­ter­ment of the coun­try in our mind and the peo­ple we serve.

_Woof_. That’s one tor­tured sen­tence. That looks like he typed “I will com­mit” and then just kept hit­ting the “au­to­pre­dict text” but­ton. And fi­nally, at the end, a non­sen­si­cal tooth­pick stuck in this gib­ber­ish sand­wich:

> I can­not apol­o­gize for my pas­sion or for lov­ing my god, my fam­ily, and my coun­try.

So, to sum up: _I’m here to apol­o­gize. But I won’t apol­o­gize. I didn’t do the thing you think I did—you con­strued it wrong. At one point, I was poor. Also I won’t apol­o­gize for lov­ing God and Amer­ica. Yoho out._

This is a very bad apol­ogy. He barely ac­knowl­edged the per­son he was apol­o­giz­ing to, he de­nied the event oc­curred, he brought up be­ing on food stamps for some rea­son, and then he self-righ­teously re­fused to apol­o­gize for his awe­some qual­i­ties, which no one had asked him to do. This is plainly not an apol­ogy. It is—and I swear this is an ac­tual philo­soph­i­cal term—_bull­shit_.

### This Is the Part Where There’s a Lot of Curs­ing (for a Good Rea­son)

Harry G. Frank­furt (born 1929) is pro­fes­sor emer­i­tus of phi­los­o­phy at Prince­ton Uni­ver­sity. He has also taught at Yale, been a vis­it­ing fel­low at All Souls Col­lege at Ox­ford, re­ceived grants from the Guggen­heim and Mel­lon Foun­da­tions, and writ­ten an en­tire book about bull­shit. Specif­i­cally, _On Bull­shit_, a pa­per he pub­lished in 1986 that was re­leased in (adorably small) book form in 2005. It be­came some­thing of a phe­nom­e­non, land­ing on the _New York Times_ best­seller list for twenty-seven weeks—pre­sum­ably be­cause, as he notes in its open­ing sen­tence: “One of the most salient fea­tures of our cul­ture is that there is so much bull­shit.”

Frank­furt aims to dis­tin­guish _bull­shit_ from _ly­ing_. “Telling a lie,” he writes, “is an act with a sharp fo­cus. It is de­signed to in­sert a par­tic­u­lar false­hood at a spe­cific point in a set or sys­tem of be­liefs, in or­der to avoid the con­se­quences of hav­ing that point oc­cu­pied by the truth.” In other words, a liar knows the truth and de­lib­er­ately speaks in op­po­si­tion to it. A bull­shit­ter, how­ever, is “un­con­strained by a con­cern with truth.” The bull­shit­ter couldn’t care less what the truth is—he wants only to make him­self ap­pear a cer­tain way or achieve some ef­fect on the lis­tener. Frank­furt imag­ines, for ex­am­ple, a puffed-up, rah-rah Amer­i­can giv­ing a Fourth of July speech and bom­bas­ti­cally cel­e­brat­ing the Founders, the Flag, Mom, and Ap­ple Pie. It’s im­ma­te­rial what this guy _ac­tu­ally thinks_ about Amer­ica, says Frank­furt—he may truly love the coun­try, he might hate it, he might be in­dif­fer­ent. That’s not the point. The point is that

> the or­a­tor in­tends these state­ments to con­vey a cer­tain im­pres­sion of him­self. He is not try­ing to de­ceive any­one con­cern­ing Amer­i­can his­tory. What he cares about is what peo­ple think of _him_.

The bull­shit­ter has only one goal: to make the lis­tener think of him as a cer­tain kind of per­son, whether it be a pa­triot, a moral avatar, a sen­si­tive and car­ing soul, or what­ever else ad­vances his per­sonal in­ter­ests.[^2] “The essence of bull­shit,” said Frank­furt, “is not that it is _false_ but that it is _phony_.”

Yoho was caught do­ing some­thing bad—ac­cost­ing and curs­ing at a woman he works with, who’d com­mit­ted the un­for­giv­able crime of not shar­ing his po­lit­i­cal stances. When he was caught, the _right_ thing to do was to apol­o­gize. In­stead, he de­liv­ered a line of bull­shit in­tended to make other peo­ple—his po­lit­i­cal al­lies, and not the woman he cursed at—see him a cer­tain way. (This is not a par­ti­san phe­nom­e­non. Con­tem­po­rary Re­pub­li­cans may have raised it to an art form, but the his­tory of po­lit­i­cal or­a­tory re­veals heap­ing mounds of bull­shit from both sides of the aisle.) An­other clas­sic disin­gen­u­ous apol­ogy move—which Yoho em­ployed a ver­sion of—is to say “I’m sorry if you were of­fended,” which of course is less an apol­ogy than an ac­cu­sa­tion. That’s say­ing both “I did noth­ing wrong” and “You’re so dumb you _thought_ I did some­thing wrong and got up­set, so I’m sorry you’re so dumb.” Apolo­gies don’t undo what­ever bad thing we did, but when they’re sin­cere and hon­estly de­liv­ered, they can help heal a wound. They won’t do _any­thing_, how­ever, if we’re de­fen­sive, hedg­ing, or disin­gen­u­ous—if what we of­fer is not ac­tu­ally a sin­cere plea for for­give­ness.

Our re­sis­tance to one-on-one apolo­gies car­ries over to the larger sphere of in­sti­tu­tional or gov­ern­men­tal ones. Pe­ri­od­i­cally, some will call for Amer­i­can state apolo­gies for the na­tion’s large-scale past hor­rors, like the in­tern­ment of Ja­pa­nese Amer­i­cans dur­ing World War II, slav­ery, or the Na­tive Amer­i­can geno­cide. The coun­ter­ar­gu­ment amounts to: “That was a long time ago. What’s done is done. Get over it.” I find this ar­gu­ment… lack­ing. Na­tional sins re­quire na­tional apolo­gies, no mat­ter how long ago they were com­mit­ted. Those apolo­gies can take the form of a sim­ple dec­la­ra­tion, or—far bet­ter—a dec­la­ra­tion _and_ ac­tual resti­tu­tion paid to the de­scen­dants of those who suf­fered. But the first step is the sim­ple ad­mis­sion of wrong­do­ing.

In 1992, Pope John Paul II apol­o­gized, on be­half of his pre­de­ces­sor, for a mis­take made by the Catholic Church. The no­table thing about this was that the man he apol­o­gized to was Galileo Galilei, and the mis­take had been made in 1633. Galileo had con­firmed the Coper­ni­can the­ory of the uni­verse, which posited that Earth re­volved around the sun and not vice versa, and for that he was called a heretic and threat­ened with im­pris­on­ment and death and ev­ery­thing else the church could throw at him. Ul­ti­mately, his fame earned him a mere house ar­rest, con­di­tional on his re­cant­ing his find­ings.[^3] Al­most 360 years later, Pope John Paul said, in essence: “Our bad.” Ad­mit­tedly, he did hedge a bit by say­ing that the Catholic Church was merely work­ing with the in­for­ma­tion they had at the time, but he apol­o­gized, and it mat­tered. He re­solved the open ca­dence of this his­tor­i­cal wrong, and when in­sti­tu­tions do that, it de­clares once and for all that they are fal­li­ble, and that they owe some­thing to those they’ve wronged. If in­stead of apol­o­giz­ing the pope had said, “We never did this, his­to­ri­ans are wrong, and also the church has done a bunch of good char­i­ta­ble work, and we’ll never apol­o­gize for our faith in God,” well, that wouldn’t be an apol­ogy. That would be… you get it.

Peo­ple ought to apol­o­gize when they screw up. So should politi­cians, and re­li­gious in­sti­tu­tions, and coun­tries. Apol­o­giz­ing _mat­ters_. I say this as a per­son who has failed to apol­o­gize for count­less mis­takes I’ve made in my life. My age-forty-ish jour­ney into moral phi­los­o­phy caused me many sleep­less nights, mostly due to the re­al­iza­tion that I’ve hurt peo­ple and never told them I’m sorry for hav­ing done so. If we’re lucky enough to live on this planet for more than a cou­ple of years, we’re con­demned to cause dam­age to peo­ple we love, peo­ple we don’t even know, and ev­ery­one in be­tween. Only re­cently have I fully un­der­stood the in­evitabil­ity of that, or the fact that when we in­evitably do it, we have one move left: Suck it up, and say we’re sorry. And do it sooner rather than later. Wait­ing 359 years to apol­o­gize takes away some of the im­pact.

I have one fi­nal ques­tion to ask, in a book full of them, but this one is easy to an­swer. What do we hope will hap­pen when we apol­o­gize? When we face our fear of em­bar­rass­ment, brave the shame and flushed face and shaky voice and ad­mit our wrong­do­ing? We sim­ply hope that who­ever we’ve wronged will rec­og­nize our sin­cere re­gret and our de­sire to be a lit­tle bet­ter to­day than we were yes­ter­day. We hope for what­ever mix of kind­ness, em­pa­thy, grace, and un­der­stand­ing leads peo­ple to say _it’s okay_ even if they’re still mad at us, even if we lied to them when we knew we shouldn’t have or told them to wear a ze­bra-print fe­dora to an of­fice hol­i­day party to dis­as­trous re­sults. We hope for for­give­ness.

So here, near the end of our jour­ney, is where the rub­ber of ethics meets the rough road of ev­ery­day life, with all its messi­ness and com­plex­ity. We have said, over and over, that car­ing about what we do re­quires us to ac­cept and en­dure a life­time of screw­ing up. Get­ting it wrong. Hurt­ing peo­ple. Some­times the bad we do will be mi­nus­cule—barely a tenth of one do­lor, float­ing off into the uni­verse, hardly no­ticed and largely unim­por­tant. Some­times it’ll be far, far worse: a _real_ pain, felt in a _real_ way by some num­ber of peo­ple whose lives have been made markedly worse be­cause of _some­thing we did_. It’s right and ap­pro­pri­ate to speak up (in the right way, at the right times, in the right amount) when peo­ple fall short of virtue and cause some pain or suf­fer­ing. But if they’ve done some­thing for­giv­able, we should re­mem­ber what we hope for when _we_ screw up, and try to sum­mon that same grace and un­der­stand­ing. (What does “for­giv­able” mean, you might ask? That’s a deeply com­pli­cated philo­soph­i­cal ques­tion that would take a whole other book to an­swer, and hon­estly, I’m not sure Todd has the pa­tience to put up with me for an­other two years.) The point is this: to de­mand per­fec­tion, or to hold peo­ple to im­pos­si­ble stan­dards, is to deny the sim­ple and beau­ti­ful re­al­ity that no­body is per­fect.

1. [^1] The most pop­u­lar re­cent ver­sion of this “I have a fam­ily!” de­fense in­volves men speak­ing about other men’s sex­ual as­saults or of­fen­sive lan­guage to­ward women, and cit­ing the fact that be­cause they have daugh­ters, or wives, or moth­ers, they find those be­hav­iors of­fen­sive. This im­plies that they _wouldn’t_, re­ally, find the be­hav­ior of­fen­sive if they were sin­gle and had no fe­male chil­dren. If you ever hear some­one say “As the fa­ther of a daugh­ter…” just walk away. The rest of the sen­tence is eth­i­cal gob­bledy­gook.
2. [^2] The ex­cel­lent _Gawker_ es­say “On Smarm” by writer Tom Scocca (which uses Frank­furt’s es­say to make its point) lo­cates smarm along­side bull­shit this way: “Smarm is a kind of per­for­mance—an as­sump­tion of the forms of se­ri­ous­ness, of virtue, of con­struc­tive­ness, with­out the sub­stance. Smarm is con­cerned with ap­pro­pri­ate­ness and with tone. Smarm dis­ap­proves. Smarm would rather talk about any­thing other than smarm. Why, smarm asks, can’t ev­ery­one just be nicer?” Both the smarm-meis­ter and the bull­shit­ter have a goal in mind that ig­nores the ac­tual is­sue at hand—the smarm-meis­ter pre­tends to take of­fense at the _tone_ or _in­ci­vil­ity_ of his ac­cuser, while the bull­shit­ter just waves his hand and spews words in­dis­crim­i­nately to achieve the ef­fect he’s af­ter.
3. [^3] Galileo did in­deed re­cant, be­cause, you know, he didn’t want to die, and as the story goes, he then mut­tered un­der his breath: _“Ep­pur, si muove,”_ which means “And yet, it moves.” (“It” be­ing Earth.) This is su­per badass, that he mut­tered this un­der his breath in front of a po­ten­tially mur­der­ous pope, and it makes me think that Galileo was a cool dude.

    

## CODA Okay, Kids: What Have We Learned?

Dear Ivy and William,

Par­ents and moral philoso­phers, I’ve come to learn, are an­noy­ing in ex­actly the same way. Both groups spend their lives think­ing about what makes a per­son good and try­ing to con­vince other peo­ple to buy into their the­o­ries. For the philoso­phers, those “other peo­ple” are ev­ery­one on the planet; for par­ents, mostly, it’s their kids. You had the mis­for­tune to be born to a par­ent who’s also into moral phi­los­o­phy—a real dou­ble whammy. Twice the the­o­ries, and twice as many at­tempts at con­vinc­ing you to lis­ten. But bear with me just for a few pages here as I try to sum­ma­rize why I care about this stuff, and why you should too.

Right af­ter Ivy was born, I took a walk with your grand­mother and mar­veled at how many new things I had to worry about. “You worry about one set of things when they’re ba­bies, and then an­other set of things when they’re tod­dlers,” I re­mem­ber say­ing, “and now I can imag­ine wor­ry­ing about them as kinder­gart­ners, and mid­dle school­ers, and on and on.” Nana said noth­ing. “I guess that’s just the deal with par­ent­hood,” I con­tin­ued, work­ing it out for my­self. “You worry and worry and worry, un­til they’re fi­nally grown-ups and they have jobs and stuff.”

“Oh, it doesn’t get any bet­ter when they’re grown-ups,” said Nana. “I worry about you all the time.”

So far, she’s been proven right. As I write this, William is twelve (!) and Ivy is ten (?!?) and not a day has gone by that your mom and I haven’t wor­ried about you. Some­times it’s be­cause of what you’ve done, or not done—like when William (tak­ing af­ter his mom) gets waaaay too an­gry when he loses at Ping-Pong, or when Ivy (tak­ing af­ter her dad) de­cides the best re­sponse to any kind of con­flict is to just go com­pletely silent. Other times I worry be­cause the world you’re in­her­it­ing feels im­pos­si­ble to nav­i­gate even for the very luck­i­est hu­mans alive—a group you two be­long to—and if it feels im­pos­si­ble for _you_ to nav­i­gate, if its prob­lems and threats and moral tan­gles present a path so treach­er­ous that no par­ent in the world would wish to see her child try to walk it, what that par­ent is left with is _worry_.

But if Mon­tesquieu was right, and knowl­edge makes peo­ple gen­tle, maybe it makes them safer too.

That’s the bet I’m mak­ing, re­ally. I’m plac­ing a de­cent-size bet on the idea that un­der­stand­ing moral­ity, and fol­low­ing its com­pass dur­ing de­ci­sions great and small, will make you _bet­ter_, and there­fore _safer_. Not safer from harm, nec­es­sar­ily—though I hope for that too—but from all of the traps that mod­ern life sets, es­pe­cially for peo­ple lucky enough to be born into priv­i­lege. I’m talk­ing about self­ish­ness, cal­lous­ness, cru­elty, hypocrisy, snob­bery—those qual­i­ties peo­ple dis­play when they de­cide we are not ac­tu­ally liv­ing all to­gether, here on earth, but in­stead are liv­ing alone, in­di­vid­u­ally, eight bil­lion siloed ego states, com­pet­ing with each other in a race that (they seem to for­get) in­evitably ends with ev­ery­one in a dead heat.

So far, I think you’re good peo­ple! You un­der­stand right and wrong, and you gen­er­ally try to do right. You’re kind to your friends, and when you’re not you feel bad and (some­times) apol­o­gize. Your virtue starter kits ar­rived in­tact. You also un­der­stand how very lucky we are, and as of­ten as your mom and I grill you on your un­der­stand­ing of this luck, you’re not likely to for­get about it. But just un­der­stand­ing the _con­cept_ of good for­tune isn’t enough. The world moves fast, and it wouldn’t take much for you to for­get the role luck has played in your lives, which can lead to you feel­ing _en­ti­tled_ to things and toss­ing your moral com­passes aside in fa­vor of an in­flex­i­ble re­sponse to the ques­tions you face. It might lead you to do only what you want, with­out ask­ing your­self some sim­ple ques­tions: _What am I do­ing? Why am I do­ing it? Is there some­thing I could be do­ing that’s bet­ter? Why is it bet­ter_?

You won­der what your mom and I worry about? It’s that. (And cli­mate change. We also worry about cli­mate change.)

But here’s the good news: A lot of very smart peo­ple have been think­ing about these prob­lems—how to be good, how we should act, what we owe to each other—for a very long time. They have ideas for how we might avoid dis­ap­pear­ing into our own lit­tle worlds. Though their ideas vary widely, they’re all based on the sim­ple con­cept that who we are and what we do _mat­ters_—that we should _care_ whether we’re do­ing some­thing good or not, and thus try to do the best things we can. And if you can get past the fact that the peo­ple who for­mu­lated these ideas wrote su­per-con­fus­ing books that will give you an in­stant headache, you can some­day arm your­selves with their ideas, use them when you make de­ci­sions, and be­come the kind of peo­ple that would let your mom and me stop wor­ry­ing all the time about whether you’re okay. Or, at least, worry less.

I’ve tried to ex­plain a few of their ideas in this book so you can have some­thing to re­fer to as you get older, pass­ing through all of the strange and un­set­tling eras of life—each of which will twist you into knots and gar­ble your brains in ways you didn’t ex­pect. One of the great ironies of ag­ing is that ev­ery ten years or so, you look back on the per­son you were ten years be­fore and shud­der—at the mis­takes you made, at your im­ma­tu­rity and thick­head­ed­ness—and then you breathe a sigh of re­lief that you’re so much smarter and more ma­ture now. Then ten years later… it hap­pens again. I’m forty-six, and can only guess which of my cur­rent ac­tions will em­bar­rass me ten years from now. (Hope­fully one of them won’t be: “writ­ing this book.”)

So I very much hope that this book will ben­e­fit you, some­day. But right now you’re twelve (!) and ten (?!?) and even a ca­sual dis­cus­sion of the cat­e­gor­i­cal im­per­a­tive might be kind of a hard sell. (Your mom and I did not take the same ap­proach to your ed­u­ca­tion that J. S. Mill’s dad did with his kid, which means you didn’t learn Greek and Latin in kinder­garten, but also you don’t hate us and aren’t hor­ri­bly de­pressed, which we think is a good trade-off.) So here, at the end, I’m go­ing to tell you in sim­ple terms what I think mat­ters. Think of this as the two-page Quick-Start Guide to this whole project: it won’t cover ev­ery­thing, but it’ll be a de­cent start­ing point.

You are peo­ple on earth. You are not alone here, and that means you owe the other peo­ple on earth cer­tain things. What you owe them, more or less, is to live by rules they wouldn’t re­ject as un­fair (as­sum­ing they’re de­cent, rea­son­able peo­ple). If you, Ivy, are about to do some­thing and you’re not sure whether it’s okay, ask your­self if William would tell you it’s a good idea. William, ask your­self if Ivy would say the same thing. Then keep go­ing—ask your­self if one of your friends would re­ject it as a bad idea—or one of your teach­ers, or even a kid you don’t like that much but who you have to ad­mit is pretty smart. If you feel like those peo­ple could rea­son­ably re­ject your idea for what to do, maybe don’t do it. Maybe do some­thing else.

Or you can try this: You can think to your­self, be­fore you do some­thing, “Would it be okay if _ev­ery­one_ did this? What would the world be like if ev­ery sin­gle per­son were al­lowed to do what­ever I’m about to do?” If that world seems twisted, or un­fair, or non­sen­si­cal, you should prob­a­bly do some­thing else.

Or: Think about what you’re about to do, and imag­ine the re­sult. Think of how many peo­ple will be happy, and how many sad, and how happy or sad they’ll be. Think about how _soon_ they’ll be sad or happy, and _for how long_ they’ll be sad or happy. Try to to­tal it all up in your mind, and think about whether what you’re about to do will re­sult in more to­tal sad­ness or hap­pi­ness. This one is tricky, but some­times it’s the best way to find an an­swer.

And while you’re here on earth, think about the parts of peo­ple you love—their kind­ness, gen­eros­ity, loy­alty, courage, de­ter­mi­na­tion, mild­ness. Aim your­selves at the ex­act right amount of those qual­i­ties, as best you can—not too much, not too lit­tle. And know that you’re of­ten go­ing to get it wrong. You’ll try to be mild, let’s say, and you won’t be mild enough, then you’ll over­com­pen­sate and be­come _too_ mild, and that’ll keep hap­pen­ing, and it’ll an­noy peo­ple, and that will sting. But hope­fully, by try­ing over and over, you’ll get closer and closer to get­ting it right. The try­ing is im­por­tant. Keep try­ing.

Over the course of your lives, you may find your­self drawn more or less to­ward one or an­other of these tech­niques for de­ter­min­ing right from wrong, good from bad. That’s fine! Use the ones you like, the ones that make sense to you, but keep the oth­ers around just in case. There will be mo­ments when you’re be­fud­dled—when the sys­tem you put in place to guide you seems to fail, when you’re caught red-handed de­fend­ing one thing while con­demn­ing an­other thing, and you’ll come to see that con­tra­dic­tion as in­con­sis­tent. It’ll be em­bar­rass­ing. You might have to draw and re­draw the lines be­tween “good” and “bad” over and over, and that’s fine. The im­por­tant thing is that you keep draw­ing them.

I’m al­most done, I prom­ise. I can feel you get­ting an­noyed. But I need to say just a bit more about other peo­ple.

Hu­mans have this prob­lem: we’re kind of trapped in­side our own brains. Our de­fault set­ting is to think about our­selves—how to keep _our­selves_ happy and safe and pro­tected. Some­times that’s good! We have _in­tegrity_, which means (in this case) “a sense of whole­ness, of be­ing un­di­vided.” If some­one asks you to do some­thing that doesn’t seem like it fits with who you are or how you think of your­self, a lit­tle voice in your head might start chirp­ing at you, warn­ing you that _this doesn’t feel right_. Don’t ig­nore that voice. It’s there to help.

But be­ing trapped in­side our own brains also means that some­times we don’t think enough about _other peo­ple_. If you were grow­ing up in South Africa or Zim­babwe, you might have been taught to _live through_ other peo­ple—to think of their hap­pi­ness as your hap­pi­ness, their pain as your pain. But you are grow­ing up in Amer­ica, and Amer­ica, like a lot of other places, teaches peo­ple to look out for them­selves first. There’s even a very fa­mous writer who told peo­ple that self­ish­ness was ac­tu­ally _good_—that the more self­ish ev­ery­one is, the bet­ter the world will be. (I know, it’s bonkers. She was a very silly per­son, and an im­pres­sively ter­ri­ble writer.) So, be­ing raised in Amer­ica, you need to start think­ing about other peo­ple a lit­tle more.

Some­times that will be _re­ally hard_. It’ll take work, con­cen­tra­tion, en­ergy, sac­ri­fice. It’ll be tricky and com­plex and con­fus­ing. These are the times you’ll blow it—you’ll make a mis­take and cause harm you didn’t in­tend to cause. Take a deep breath, and apol­o­gize. Re­mem­ber: We are wrong, all the time. We are wrong, and we try again, and we’re wrong again, and again, and again. _Keep try­ing_. Choos­ing to _not_ try is still mak­ing a choice, and it won’t make you (or any­one else) a bet­ter per­son.

Thou­sands of years ago, in a part of Greece called Del­phi, some peo­ple built a tem­ple. They were wor­ried about their kids too—all par­ents in his­tory have been wor­ried about their kids, it’s not just Mom and me—so they chis­eled a cou­ple of say­ings into a col­umn of that tem­ple to tell their kids, and their grand­kids, and their great-grand­kids, in as few words as pos­si­ble, how to try to pull off the nearly im­pos­si­ble task of liv­ing a good life on earth. Here’s what they wrote:

_Know thy­self_.

and

_Noth­ing in ex­cess_.

Hon­estly, as far as “guides to life” go, I don’t think any­one’s beaten that in the 2,400 years since. _Know thy­self_—think about who you are, check in with your­self when you do things to see if you’ve made good de­ci­sions, re­mem­ber what you value and care about, un­der­stand your in­tegrity, and live a life con­sis­tent with that in­tegrity. _Noth­ing in ex­cess_—be­cause too much (or too lit­tle) of any­thing will screw you up. Prac­tice virtues like kind­ness and gen­eros­ity and courage, but not _too much_ of them. Drink whiskey, when you’re old enough, but don’t drink _too much_ whiskey. (Sin­gle malt, by the way. None of that blended junk.) Watch TV, but don’t watch _too much_ TV. Don’t eat _too many_ tacos, or ex­er­cise _too much_, or curse _too much_ (I strug­gle with that one). Some­where in the mid­dle of ev­ery kind of virtue you can have, and ev­ery thing you do, there’s a per­fect amount of that thing, and your job is to find it. You want a real Quick-Start Guide for how to live a good life? A guide so pithy you can have it tat­tooed on your arm with plenty of room to spare?

_Know thy­self._

_Noth­ing in ex­cess._

There’s more, of course. You can’t _just_ use that. But maybe start there.

Be­ing a good per­son is a job, and a hard one at that. But if you care about it, it may start to seem less like work and more like a puz­zle you can solve. And in those rare times when you have to make a de­ci­sion and you as­sem­ble the pieces in ex­actly the right way, so the im­age of what to do comes sharply into fo­cus—you will feel alive and ful­filled and elated. You will feel like you’re _flour­ish­ing_. Which is re­ally what Mom and I hope for you. We want you to be safe, from harm and from the pit­falls of the spe­cific lives you’re lead­ing. We want you to be happy—not in the eat­ing-pizza-with-your-friends way, but in a deeper, more last­ing way. We want you to be _good_—to act with good in­ten­tions, to cause min­i­mal harm to those around you, to abide by rules you’d want ev­ery­one to fol­low and that other peo­ple wouldn’t re­ject as un­fair. We want you to apol­o­gize when you screw up, and we want you to try to do bet­ter the next time. Do­ing all of these things can help you flour­ish—to be the very best ver­sions of your­selves.

But again, there will be plenty of other times when you do not flour­ish. When you straight-up blow it. And then you’ll try again, and you’ll blow it again, over and over, and you’ll be frus­trated and you’ll feel aw­ful. And if you’ve tried to do some­thing good a thou­sand times, and you’ve failed a thou­sand times, and the peo­ple around you are mis­er­able, and you’re at the end of your rope, and you’re los­ing faith in your­selves, you know what we want you to do then?

Keep try­ing. Keep try­ing. Keep try­ing.

Love,

Dad    

# Ac­knowl­edg­ments

Let’s be hon­est: no one reads this part un­less you are a per­son who thinks you might have been thanked, which means you’re read­ing it ei­ther to see your name or else to _not_ see your name so you can get righ­teously an­gry that I for­got to thank you. If that’s the case, I’m le­git­i­mately sorry. If I _did_ thank you, then con­grats on see­ing your name! It’s cool to see your name in a book. If you are nei­ther a per­son I thanked nor a per­son I should have thanked but for­got to, and for some rea­son you’re read­ing this part, I’ll try to make it more in­ter­est­ing by stir­ring cool lit­tle facts and anec­dotes into these ac­knowl­edg­ments ev­ery so of­ten. Like: There are more than one quadrillion ants on earth! A mil­lion-bil­lion ants?! That’s so many ants!

This book doesn’t hap­pen with­out the wis­dom, knowl­edge, and all-around good spirit of Todd May. He en­cour­aged me, sup­ported the vi­sion of the book un­con­di­tion­ally, and pa­tiently ex­plained the nu­ances of var­i­ous ver­sions of ex­is­ten­tial­ism seven hun­dred times un­til I fi­nally felt con­fi­dent enough to write that chap­ter. Thank you, Todd, for ev­ery­thing. Sorry about all the com­mas.

Pamela Hi­eronymi not only kick-started my un­der­stand­ing of moral phi­los­o­phy, she also vol­un­teered to read the first chunk of this book and give me notes, which I’ve come to un­der­stand is the aca­demic philoso­pher equiv­a­lent of help­ing some­one move into a sixth-floor walk-up. Her notes were in­valu­able. Thank you, Pamela. If you ever need me to help you move, just say the word. And sorry I oc­ca­sion­ally for­get and call you “Pam.”

Al­bert Ein­stein once used a $1,500 check (roughly $30,000 in to­day’s money) for a book­mark, and then couldn’t re­mem­ber where he put the book. And once at a din­ner party his wife mis­took a bou­quet of or­chids for a salad and ate them.

Ea­mon Dolan from Si­mon & Schus­ter pro­vided the per­fect com­bi­na­tion of ed­i­to­rial acu­men, con­ge­nial­ity, tough love, and dis­dain for the phrase “sort of.” He steered a first-time au­thor through the choppy wa­ters of self-doubt with a steady, friendly de­meanor I ap­pre­ci­ated greatly. Thank you, Ea­mon. Sorry I left in all those “like”s and “gotta”s.

A whole lot of peo­ple at S&S (and else­where) had to read this thing a mil­lion times and make sure it wasn’t all messed up, or write me a mil­lion e-mails to en­sure I wasn’t mess­ing it up in some other way: most no­tably, Laura Cherkas, Tzi­pora Baitch, and Kay­ley Hoff­man. Thank you, and sorry you had to read this a mil­lion times. Kate Ki­nast ex­pertly fact-checked the whole thing; any re­main­ing mis­takes are cer­tainly my fault and not hers.

In De­cem­ber of 1997 I signed with 3Arts man­age­ment, mostly be­cause of all the agents and man­agers I’d met, David Miner seemed like the nicest and fun­ni­est. Twenty-five years later, ev­ery move I make in my ca­reer starts with a phone call ei­ther to or from him. I’m eter­nally grate­ful for all twenty-five of those years. And our part­ner­ship is what led me to Richard Abate, who got ex­actly what this book wanted to be and knew ex­actly how to present it to pub­lish­ers. I should also thank Ken Rich­man, Matt Rice, and Julien Thuan, whose guid­ance and ad­vice are a big part of the Jenga tower of luck that is my writ­ing ca­reer.

A fun rid­dle for kids: A wealthy man dies and leaves his col­lec­tion of ele­phants to his three kids. To his old­est he leaves half of his ele­phants, to his mid­dle kid he leaves a third of his ele­phants, and to his youngest he leaves a ninth of his ele­phants. Prob­lem is: He has sev­en­teen ele­phants. The kids seek the ad­vice of a wise woman in their town, and she in­stantly comes up with a so­lu­tion. What is it? (An­swer in the foot­note!)[^1]

One of the most fun side ef­fects of work­ing on this book was that it brought me into con­tact with philoso­phers from all over the coun­try. Dr. Molefi Kete As­ante from Tem­ple lent me his ex­per­tise on the _ubuntu_ sec­tion. I’m also grate­ful to have made the ac­quain­tance of T. M. Scan­lon, who was ex­actly as charm­ing and thought­ful in con­ver­sa­tion as I imag­ined he’d be. Craig Vasey from the North Amer­i­can Sartre So­ci­ety in­vited Todd and me to speak at their an­nual gath­er­ing, which was de­light­ful, and I got a cool NASS pin that I wear with pride. I’m also grate­ful to Pe­ter Singer and Isaac Mar­tinez at Prince­ton, and Meghan Sul­li­van at Notre Dame, for the in­vi­ta­tions to talk to them and their stu­dents about ethics.

Of course, this book would never have been writ­ten if it weren’t for _The Good Place_. Mak­ing that show was a joy from be­gin­ning to end. The con­ver­sa­tions we had in the writ­ers’ room about phi­los­o­phy, com­edy, ethics—and a whole bunch of stuff that was far less im­por­tant than phi­los­o­phy, com­edy, or ethics—leave me for­ever in­debted to that writ­ing staff: Demi Ade­juyigbe, Megan Am­ram, Chris En­cell, Kate Ger­sten, Cord Jef­fer­son, Dave King, An­drew Law, Kas­sia Miller, Dy­lan Mor­gan, Aisha Muhar­rar, Matt Mur­ray, Lizzy Pace, Rafat Sanni, Dan Schofield, Josh Sie­gal, Jen­nifer Statsky, Tyler Straessle, and Alan Yang. Each of their senses of hu­mor is in the show, which means they’re all in this book. I love all of you weirdos, and am a bet­ter per­son for know­ing you. Ad­di­tional thanks to my as­sis­tant, Brid­get Stin­son, and all of the writ­ers’ as­sis­tants and PAs we had over the years for their tire­less work, and to ev­ery­one who watched the show and got some­thing out of it, which was the whole point of mak­ing it.

Once Samuel Beck­ett was walk­ing with his friend in Lon­don on a beau­ti­ful spring day. His friend com­mented on how lovely the weather was, and how nice it was to be walk­ing with his old friend, and Beck­ett agreed. Then his friend said that it was days like this that made you glad to be alive. Beck­ett replied: “Well, I wouldn’t go _that_ far.”

Over the course of the show we had var­i­ous “guest lec­tur­ers” come and dis­cuss mat­ters of ethics and so­cial jus­tice. In ad­di­tion to Todd and Pamela, Joshua Greene and De­Ray Mckesson were gen­er­ous with their time and their words. Da­mon Lin­de­lof wasn’t re­ally a “guest lec­turer” per se—more of a spir­i­tual ad­vi­sor—but with­out his early ad­vice there may have been no show at all.

_The Good Place_ pro­duc­tion team, headed by Mor­gan Sack­ett and David Hy­man, made sure the ideas that came out of the writ­ers’ room could be turned into ac­tual en­ter­tain­ment. Most of what I’ve done in my TV ca­reer has re­ally, ac­tu­ally, been done by them. The tal­ented artists and crafts­peo­ple who put the show to­gether are too nu­mer­ous to men­tion—nam­ing one re­quires me to name them all—so please just know I am for­ever in­debted to ev­ery one of you for your hard work. And then there are the ac­tors and di­rec­tors who took these thorny ideas and trans­lated them for an au­di­ence—most im­por­tantly: Ted Dan­son, Kris­ten Bell, Manny Jac­into, Jameela Jamil, D’Arcy Car­den, William Jack­son Harper, Marc Evan Jack­son, and Drew God­dard. Boy oh boy, do I love and miss you all.

The word “buf­falo” writ­ten out eight times in a row cre­ates a com­plete and gram­mat­i­cally cor­rect sen­tence.

I again thank J.J. Philbin—a ded­i­ca­tion _and_ an ac­knowl­edg­ment? Must be nice—be­cause she read this whole thing when I first fin­ished a draft, and we both know ex­actly how an­noy­ing it is when some­one asks you to read some­thing they wrote, and in this case it was like two hun­dred and fifty pages longer than the kind of thing we usu­ally have to read. The first per­son to read the en­tire man­u­script (out­side of my im­me­di­ate fam­ily) was Dan Le Batard, whose thought­ful notes and gen­eral praise put wind in my sails.

I have been a gain­fully em­ployed writer since 1997, thanks to the gen­eros­ity and tute­lage of count­less peo­ple who gave me a shot, kept giv­ing me shots when I didn’t re­ally de­serve them, taught me how to shoot bet­ter, or liked the way I shoot enough to ex­tend my shoot­ing con­tract: Jon Stew­art, Steve Hig­gins, Lorne Michaels, Mike Shoe­maker, Tina Fey, Adam McKay, Bela Ba­jaria, Tracey Pakosta, Pearlena Ig­bokwe, Steve Burke, and Jeff Shell. Chief among them is Greg Daniels, a peer­less writer and the great­est teacher I’ve ever had. Thank you, all of you, for­ever.

Some Alaskan moose in the West­ern Yukon have been ob­served hav­ing “birth­day par­ties” for each other, com­plete with “presents” (usu­ally smooth rocks or metal ob­jects that they find in na­ture) and even “birth­day cakes” made out of weeds and mud. They even “sing” a song to each other by grunt­ing in uni­son![2](ack.xhtml#footnote-000)

Fi­nally, there are just a whole bunch of writ­ers, some of whom I know and some of whom I’ve never met, whose work has al­tered my brain chem­istry in that way that only great writ­ing can. Thank you all for spend­ing your time writ­ing com­edy, fic­tion, non­fic­tion, plays, mu­sic, TV, movies, jour­nal­ism, any­thing. Writ­ing is a weird job, and I salute ev­ery­one who makes it her life’s work.

Okay, I’ll end this ac­knowl­edg­ments sec­tion be­fore I just start list­ing writ­ers I like. Thanks for read­ing this book. Or maybe just pick­ing it up in a book­store and flip­ping to this page to see if I thanked you.

1. [^1] The wise woman adds one of her ele­phants to the herd, to make eigh­teen. Half of them (nine) go to the old­est kid, a third (six) to the mid­dle kid, and a ninth (two) to the youngest. That’s sev­en­teen, and then the woman takes her ele­phant back, and ev­ery­one is happy! (This comes from the book _A Chil­dren’s Al­manac of Words at Play_ by Willard R. Espy, my fa­vorite book when I was a kid.)
2. [^2] I made this one up. Moose don’t have birth­day par­ties for each other. That’s ridicu­lous.

## CHAP­TER ONE: Should I Punch My Friend in the Face for No Rea­son?

1. [^1] Though if I put it up as an on­line poll, it would prob­a­bly be like 70–30 _in fa­vor_ of punch­ing our friend in the face for no rea­son. The in­ter­net is ter­ri­ble.
2. [^2] “Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none.”
3. [^3] “It doesn’t mat­ter what’s un­der the hood. The only thing that mat­ters is who’s be­hind the wheel.” And also: “I’m gonna knock your teeth so far down your throat you’re gonna stick a tooth­brush right up your ass to brush ’em.” That fran­chise con­tains mul­ti­tudes.
4. [^4] _Te­los_ is a very im­por­tant con­cept in Greek phi­los­o­phy. Its ad­jec­ti­val form is “tele­o­log­i­cal,” which is a word that makes you sound _very_ smart, and which I thus rec­om­mend us­ing of­ten. Any­time any­one says some­thing you don’t un­der­stand in a phi­los­o­phy dis­cus­sion, you can say, “But shouldn’t we be think­ing of this in tele­o­log­i­cal terms?” and the other per­son will nod sagely, like: “Mm, yes, good point.”
5. [^5] I try not to use the word “eu­dai­mo­nia” in con­ver­sa­tion, mostly be­cause I’m never con­fi­dent I’m pro­nounc­ing it prop­erly. Is it “yoo-day-MOH-nee-uh,” or “yoo-die-MOH-nee-uh,” or “yoo-deh-moh-NEE-uh”? I’ve never re­ally known, and ev­ery time I say it out loud, like to Todd just now on a Zoom call, I kind of glide over it or pre­tend to cough so he doesn’t catch on.
6. [^6] Aris­to­tle lists a dozen or so, but given that it’s been about 2,400 years since he made his list, I feel it’s fair and just to make our own ad­di­tions when we dis­cuss virtue ethics in the mod­ern world. Seems kind of silly to take the text of an an­cient doc­u­ment so lit­er­ally, you know?
7. [^7] What a cool baby that would be, though! Man. Would love to meet that awe­some, flour­ish­ing baby.
8. [^8] Many peo­ple I’ve talked to have some ver­sion of this lit­tle voice, to vary­ing de­grees. One friend of mine refers to it as the moral equiv­a­lent of that “ding ding ding” sound your car makes when you haven’t put on your seat belt.
9. [^9] Not very.
10. [^10] Ugh, can you imag­ine how aw­ful that must have been for his par­ents? I know I just in­vented Rob for this book, but I feel re­ally bad for his fic­tional par­ents.
11. [^11] I gave the char­ac­ter Chidi from _The Good Place_ this con­di­tion, and called it “di­rec­tional in­san­ity,” which is how I think of it.
12. [^12] Aris­to­tle, like most ed­u­cated and fa­mous peo­ple in an­cient times, was an in­cred­i­ble snob, so for him there were very few peo­ple who were ca­pa­ble of achiev­ing ev­ery­thing he said we should try to achieve with re­spect to virtue and ex­cel­lence and so on. He also re­stricted the pos­si­ble field of such peo­ple to “free males.” So. You know. Not great.
13. [^13] Who maybe didn’t to­tally in­ter­nal­ize Aris­to­tle’s lessons, it seems, about be­ing a good per­son, given that he spent his life try­ing to con­quer and en­slave the en­tire world.
14. [^14] I stole this joke from Woody Allen, who used it in a com­edy piece he wrote about Socrates. And yes, I am 100 per­cent aware of what it means to ref­er­ence Woody Allen in the year 2022, and am do­ing so very in­ten­tion­ally. Just wait un­til chap­ter 10.
15. [^15] In 2017, Pres­i­dent Trump put his son-in-law Jared Kush­ner in charge of con­struct­ing a new Is­rael-Pales­tine peace plan. Kush­ner had no ex­pe­ri­ence au­thor­ing in­ter­na­tional treaties of any kind, so the an­nounce­ment was met with skep­ti­cism. When Kush­ner re­leased his plan at the be­gin­ning of 2020, he proudly an­nounced that he had “read twenty-five books” on the his­tory of the Is­raeli-Pales­tinian con­flict. To date, Is­rael and Pales­tine have not achieved peace.
16. [^16] The ac­tual term “golden mean” was first used by the Latin poet Ho­race sev­eral cen­turies af­ter Aris­to­tle died, but ev­ery­one at­tributes it to Aris­to­tle any­way. It’s like how Humphrey Bog­art never ac­tu­ally says, “Play it again, Sam,” in _Casablanca_. An­other of Aris­to­tle’s most fa­mous lines, “We are what we re­peat­edly do. Ex­cel­lence, then, is not an act but a habit,” was also never writ­ten by him. Will Du­rant wrote that _about_ Aris­to­tle in his sem­i­nal 1926 work _The Story of Phi­los­o­phy._ But try telling that to the thou­sands of In­sta­gram ac­counts post­ing that “Aris­to­tle” quote over pic­tures of peo­ple do­ing yoga on a beach at sun­set.
17. [^17] All philoso­phers un­til like thirty years ago used, by de­fault, mas­cu­line pro­nouns in their writ­ing—the the­o­ret­i­cal peo­ple they dis­cuss are al­ways “he/him.” Even the fe­male philoso­phers did this. It’s kind of a bum­mer. This book will use gen­dered and non­gen­dered pro­nouns at ran­dom.
18. [^18] Eth­i­cally speak­ing, Yan­kees play­ers and fans de­serve an ex­ces­sive amount of anger. It’s the only ex­cep­tion Aris­to­tle al­lows for. Don’t try to look it up in the _Ethics_; it’s in a dif­fer­ent book. I for­get which one, but it’s in one of them. He also says it’s bad to root for the Dal­las Cow­boys.
19. [^19] We can break all of the virtues down this way—for ex­am­ple, “plea­sure-seek­ing” is a qual­ity, and “tem­per­ance” would be the mean of virtue we’re seek­ing.
20. [^20] Also, im­por­tantly, re­al­ize that those peo­ple are think­ing the same things about you. Prob­a­bly not hard to re­mem­ber a time when some­one hit a break­ing point with you over some de­fi­ciency or ex­cess of a qual­ity that _you_ suf­fer from. That time you got dumped is sud­denly mak­ing sense now, right?
21. [^21] Even think­ing about that guy makes me ner­vous.
22. [^22] I know, I know, I’m name-drop­ping here, but the anal­ogy is worth it. I prom­ise I’ll keep the Hol­ly­wood celebrity ref­er­ences to a min­i­mum. It’s what my very good friend Ted Dan­son would want me to do.

## CHAP­TER TWO : Should I Let This Run­away Trol­ley I’m Driv­ing Kill Five Peo­ple, or Should I Pull a Lever and De­lib­er­ately Kill One (Dif­fer­ent) Per­son?

1. [^1] Though it wasn’t _named_ “the Trol­ley Prob­lem” un­til Foot’s es­say was dis­cussed by a woman named Ju­dith Jarvis Thom­son, whom we’ll meet later and who is largely re­spon­si­ble for many of the mad­den­ing vari­a­tions we’re about to in­ves­ti­gate. In the an­nals of Trol­ley Prob­lem his­tory, Foot gets all the head­lines, but Thom­son de­serves a lot of the at­ten­tion. (Also, Foot was British, so she called it a “tram,” and “the Tram Prob­lem” just doesn’t have the same ring to it.)
2. [^2] This vari­a­tion comes from Ju­dith Thom­son’s sem­i­nal 1985 ar­ti­cle on the Trol­ley Prob­lem; in her ver­sion, it’s an over­weight man. “Thick-necked weight lifter” seems less judgy.
3. [^3] Here are a cou­ple more fun lit­tle tid­bits about the auto-icon from the UCL Cul­ture Blog re­gard­ing the rare oc­ca­sion when they drag it out of its dis­play case: “It takes 3 peo­ple to move and, as Ben­tham’s skele­ton is bolted to his chair, it has to be moved in one go. This in­volves two peo­ple car­ry­ing the chair and body, while a third holds on to the feet to try to keep them still. The skele­ton is held to­gether with cop­per wire and hinges at the joints, which means in the­ory the auto-icon could move like a liv­ing per­son. In prac­tice this means that his feet want to stay on the ground or, if held high enough, dan­gle off the chair. An ab­so­lute night­mare when you are try­ing to move del­i­cately. An­other rea­son why we try not to move it is the fear of pests get­ting on to Ben­tham’s clothes, eat­ing away and caus­ing huge dam­age. The un­der­shirt had to be re­placed in 1939 be­cause of this, and it has been treated twice for in­fes­ta­tions since the 1980’s.” So. That’s fun.
4. [^4] I read _The Sub­jec­tion of Women_ in col­lege, and when I started work­ing on _The Good Place_ I went back and dug out my old copy. I was amused and hor­ri­fied to see that the cover of the edi­tion we used was… pink. You know, be­cause it’s about “girls.”
5. [^5] The dif­fer­ences in con­se­quen­tial­ist branches con­sist mainly in what the aim or ob­jec­tive is—what they’re try­ing to max­i­mize by mak­ing all their de­ci­sions. Util­i­tar­i­an­ism chose hap­pi­ness, while other branches may choose kind­ness or in­come equal­ity or roasted beet con­sump­tion or any­thing else. I use “con­se­quen­tial­ism” and “util­i­tar­i­an­ism” in­ter­change­ably, which would prob­a­bly get me yelled at in a phi­los­o­phy PhD pro­gram, but again, life’s too short.
6. [^6] Ob­vi­ously, Aris­to­tle was also in­ter­ested in max­i­miz­ing hap­pi­ness, but his def­i­ni­tion—_flour­ish­ing_ by ex­hibit­ing virtues in pre­cise amounts thanks to a cease­less process of search­ing for those virtues—holds a lot more wa­ter, at first glance, than Ben­tham just say­ing, “Let’s max­i­mize hap­pi­ness!”
7. [^7] If you re­strained your­self be­fore, I bet you’re mak­ing the jokes now, aren’t you?
8. [^8] Mill de­voted a lot of time to cor­rect­ing the more ba­sic prob­lems in Ben­tham’s work, in­clud­ing this one. “Few hu­man crea­tures,” he wrote, “would con­sent to be changed into any of the lower an­i­mals for a prom­ise of the fullest al­lowance of a beast’s plea­sures.… It is bet­ter to be a hu­man be­ing dis­sat­is­fied than a pig sat­is­fied.”
9. [^9] This is a re­for­mu­la­tion of a thought ex­per­i­ment in­vented by T. M. Scan­lon in his book _What We Owe to Each Other_ that I’ve tin­kered with a lit­tle be­cause I’m us­ing it in a slightly dif­fer­ent con­text. We’ll meet Scan­lon in chap­ter 4.
10. [^10] Well, if there’s _one_ thing peo­ple are bad at, it’s “main­tain­ing com­po­sure dur­ing mi­nor de­lays in air travel.” But draw­ing cor­rect con­clu­sions is a close sec­ond.
11. [^11] And yet I’ve en­gaged in those su­per­sti­tions lit­er­ally thou­sands of times. I forced my wife, J.J., to sit im­me­di­ately to my right for nearly ev­ery game of the 2004 base­ball play­offs, be­cause the first time she sat there (Amer­i­can League Cham­pi­onship Se­ries, game 4), the Red Sox won. They ended up win­ning ev­ery game there­after, and thus claimed their first World Se­ries in eighty-six years. So, you know: It worked!
12. [^12] Note from Todd: It was 1996, I be­lieve, when I saw a bunch of Knicks shave their heads be­fore the play­offs and so I shaved mine. It _didn’t_ work.
13. [^13] Fol­low-up note from Mike: As we were edit­ing this book in 2021, the Knicks made the play­offs for the first time in for­ever. You think it’s a co­in­ci­dence that this hap­pened _ex­actly twenty-five years_ af­ter Todd shaved his head? No way. It was be­cause of Todd. Con­grats, Todd!
14. [^14] Chea­dle plays De­tec­tive “Steady” Ed­die Gray, six months from re­tire­ment. McAdams plays Joelle “Joey” Good­heart, whose im­pec­ca­ble de­tec­tive in­stincts mask a trou­bled past as a teen run­away. Ad­mit it—you’d watch that movie.
15. [^15] If they talked about them at all. Will Du­rant’s seven-hun­dred-page opus _The Story of Phi­los­o­phy_, pub­lished in 1926, doesn’t con­tain so much as a para­graph about util­i­tar­i­an­ism. Ben­tham and Mill are men­tioned in pass­ing, mostly only in foot­notes. That’s some hard-core aca­demic shade.
16. [^16] Rus­sell has the dis­tinc­tion of be­ing one of the most British peo­ple who ever lived. His full name is Bertrand Arthur William Rus­sell, Third Earl Rus­sell, OM FRS (“Or­der of Merit, Fel­low­ship of the Royal So­ci­ety”). He was born at Raven­scroft in Trel­leck, Mon­mouthshire—an ex­tremely British-sound­ing place—into an aris­to­cratic fam­ily, in­clud­ing his grand­fa­ther Lord John Rus­sell, who’d been the dang prime min­is­ter of the whole dang United King­dom. Bertrand also mar­ried four women: Alys Pearsall Smith, Dora Black, Pa­tri­cia Spence, and Edith Finch, which are all deeply British names for women. The dude was _British_.
17. [^17] Of course, there would be other cal­cu­la­tions here… Would my other cus­tomers be sad if I did this, and if so, how sad?… Would my pizza place shut down, thus mak­ing me and my fam­ily sad? And so on. But the im­por­tant part is: Don’t put pineap­ple on pizza. It’s wet and juicy! Noth­ing wet and juicy should go on pizza! Hon­estly, if that’s the only thing you take away from this book, I’ll feel like I’ve done my job.
18. [^18] Williams wasn’t quite as British as Bertrand Rus­sell, but he was born in West­cliff-on-Sea, Es­sex, which is so deeply British it makes “Mon­mouthshire” sound like Akron, Ohio.
19. [^19] Williams ac­tu­ally uses the pretty-stan­dard-for-1973 but very-of­fen­sive-for-2022 term “In­di­ans,” so I changed it. It’s also pretty of­fen­sive that he orig­i­nally set this scene in a vil­lage in South Amer­ica. A lot of things in the cul­ture be­come of­fen­sive very quickly! (More on this later.)
20. [^20] Likely an­swer: Not much. But even if it were a _lot_ of plea­sure, like if Lars is some kind of Philip Glass–type ge­nius whose emo-rock opera based on _Avatar_ is go­ing to sweep the world _Hamil­ton_ style, one of Ben­tham’s ques­tions re­lates to _how quickly it would bring plea­sure_. Emo-rock op­eras prob­a­bly take a long time to write and re­hearse, so the util­i­tar­ian likely con­cludes that the _im­me­di­ate_ hap­pi­ness cre­ated by al­low­ing more peo­ple to, you know, _eat_, is still the right move.
21. [^21] If you want to go down an­other util­i­tar­ian thought-ex­per­i­ment rab­bit hole, imag­ine if the dude weren’t some am­a­teur emo opera com­poser but were in­stead a farmer who him­self grew food he could give to oth­ers. Or a doc­tor who made vac­cines. Or a cli­ma­tol­o­gist work­ing on a plan to re­verse global warm­ing and thus pre­vent more hur­ri­canes in the fu­ture—should _she_ get more food? Those an­swers I’ll leave to the reader to de­ci­pher on her own.*
    
    * This is a _clas­sic_ phi­los­o­phy trick—you just lob huge ques­tions out there and then say, “The au­thor leaves it to the reader to de­ter­mine the an­swers on her own.” Phi­los­o­phy teach­ers do this all the time. I think it’s to­tally un­fair, and a com­plete ab­di­ca­tion of their re­spon­si­bil­ity as ed­u­ca­tors. So why do they do it, then? The an­swer to that I will leave to the reader to de­ter­mine.
    
22. [^22] Still mak­ing the jokes in my head. Can’t stop won’t stop.

## CHAP­TER FOUR : Do I Have to Re­turn My Shop­ping Cart to the Shop­ping Cart Rack Thingy? I Mean… It’s All the Way Over _There_.

1. [^1] When I ar­rived, she… wasn’t there. An hour went by. I emailed her and asked if I’d got­ten the date wrong, but it turned out she was just so deeply lost in her own re­search and writ­ing that she’d for­got­ten about the meet­ing en­tirely. Which de­lighted me. I mean, that’s _ex­actly_ what you want out of your philo­soph­i­cal ad­vis­ers.*
    
    * Hi­lar­i­ously pas­sive-ag­gres­sive sub­note from Todd: Sorry about my prompt re­sponses to your emails, Mike.
    
2. [^2] In the se­ries fi­nale of _The Good Place_ I had Eleanor fin­ish read­ing the book af­ter (quite lit­er­ally) an eter­nity of try­ing.
3. [^3] Ob­vi­ously, we might won­der what hap­pens if some peo­ple _aren’t_ rea­son­able. Sim­ply: they don’t get to weigh in. Pamela de­scribed the cases of “the door­mat” and “the ass­hole.” When we pitch rules to the door­mat, he agrees to ev­ery­thing, be­cause he un­der­val­ues his own in­ter­ests. When we pitch rules to the ass­hole, she agrees to none of them, be­cause she _over­val­ues_ her in­ter­ests. So, nei­ther of these un­rea­son­able peo­ple gets the chance to sit at the metaphor­i­cal ta­ble where we’re com­ing up with our rules. More im­por­tant: if we’re not at a metaphor­i­cal and imag­i­nary ta­ble but rather out in the real world in­ter­act­ing with real peo­ple, it can some­times be up to us (when we en­counter a per­son like this) _to project rea­son­able­ness onto them_. We can’t take ad­van­tage of the door­mat, for ex­am­ple, by re­al­iz­ing he will just agree to what­ever we pro­pose and then propos­ing a bunch of rules that serve to ben­e­fit our­selves at the door­mat’s ex­pense; in­stead, we need to keep _our­selves_ in check by rec­og­niz­ing that there is a dis­con­nect be­tween the way these door­mats/ass­holes are act­ing and the way a rea­son­able per­son would be act­ing, and only pro­pose rules they’d fol­low if they were, in­deed, rea­son­able.
4. [^4] This is as­sum­ing _the gov­ern­ing body_ treated all peo­ple the same—tra­di­tion­ally not the case, in most coun­tries, but we’re cre­at­ing an imag­i­nary and fair so­ci­ety here, so just go with it. If we were ac­tu­ally de­sign­ing rules for our so­ci­ety, we’d prob­a­bly want to start with some rules for the gov­ern­ing body it­self, like “No racism” and “All peo­ple have equal rights re­gard­less of gen­der,” and a bunch of other ba­sic stuff that was left out of the found­ing doc­u­ments of al­most ev­ery na­tion on earth.
5. [^5] The car might not be hot. But I live in Los An­ge­les. It’s al­ways hot here. I hate it.
6. [^6] This is purely the­o­ret­i­cal. I my­self never did this, in 2005. Be­cause if I had, I would’ve torn a huge hole in the only suit I owned and had to buy a new one for an­other wed­ding I had to at­tend the fol­low­ing month, and that would’ve been stupid. And I _def­i­nitely_ didn’t im­me­di­ately get up af­ter wip­ing out and then of­fer to push Nick in the shop­ping cart, caus­ing him to also wipe out and bruise his shin. None of that hap­pened. I was thirty years old in 2005! That would be a ridicu­lous thing for a thirty-year-old man to do.
7. [^7] This no­tion—that if _ev­ery­one_ did it, things would go hay­wire—is of course the essence of Kan­tian the­ory, as we saw in the pre­vi­ous chap­ter. Kant re­ally does pop up a lot—no mat­ter how you slice and dice eth­i­cal dilem­mas, you’re sure to even­tu­ally hear a de­on­to­log­i­cal echo.
8. [^8] Pre­dictably, as soon as we come to this con­clu­sion, we may run into new prob­lems—those un­in­tended con­se­quences rear­ing their ugly heads. What if we all de­cide to start re­turn­ing the shop­ping carts to the rack, and the gro­cery store em­ploy­ees’ union gets mad at us be­cause they rep­re­sent a thou­sand work­ers whose jobs are now ob­so­lete? The an­swer, ba­si­cally, is: We take a deep breath, re­mem­ber that we didn’t in­tend this harm, and we stop. We fall back to the con­trac­tu­al­ist min­i­mum of the rule we set­tled on as un­re­jectable: that we re­turn the carts to the rack if the store does not have peo­ple who were hired to do that job.
9. [^9] Man­dela doesn’t elab­o­rate on what he means here. I choose to see “en­abling the com­mu­nity to im­prove” as a non­ma­te­rial kind of thing; mean­ing, like, when we en­rich our­selves, we shouldn’t do so _at the ex­pense_ of the com­mu­nity, or in such a way that those around us suf­fer. In­stead we should do so in a way that keeps the over­all health and flour­ish­ing of our com­mu­nity as our pri­or­ity. An­other pos­si­ble in­ter­pre­ta­tion would be that he’s more lit­er­ally say­ing, in essence, “We can make money only if ev­ery­one else makes money too.” In a later chap­ter we’ll meet John Rawls, who dealt with this idea in dif­fer­ent terms; Rawls called so­ci­ety a “co­op­er­a­tive ven­ture for mu­tual ad­van­tage,” and aimed to fig­ure out how to di­vide up lim­ited re­sources (like those in any so­ci­ety) not _evenly_, ex­actly, but in such a way that if one per­son gets a lit­tle more, it also ben­e­fits the peo­ple who have the least.
10. [^10] Is philoso­pher name-drop­ping grosser than Hol­ly­wood name-drop­ping? Hadn’t oc­curred to me un­til now, but I think it’s pos­si­ble. I’m leav­ing this in, though, be­cause I got to meet T. M. Scan­lon and it ruled. Sue me.
11. [^11] Note from Todd: Parfit was an ob­jec­tivist about moral­ity: he be­lieved there is an ob­jec­tive right or wrong that doesn’t de­pend on our re­ac­tions to things. Scan­lon, as a con­trac­tu­al­ist, be­lieves that right­ness or wrong­ness is rooted in our (rea­son­able) judg­ments. So from Parfit’s point of view, Scan­lon is root­ing moral­ity in some­thing too sub­jec­tive. Still jerky, though.

## CHAP­TER EIGHT: We’ve Done Some Good Deeds, and Given a Bunch of Money to Char­ity, and We’re Gen­er­ally Re­ally Nice and Morally Up­stand­ing Peo­ple, So Can We Take Three of These Free Cheese Sam­ples from the Free Cheese Sam­ple Plate at the Su­per­mar­ket Even Though It Clearly Says “One Per Cus­tomer”?

1. [^1] This silly ex­am­ple is only slightly kook­ier than the ac­tual prac­tices of cor­po­rate fi­nan­cial ac­count­ing—which is among the least eth­i­cal are­nas in our cul­ture. Some com­pa­nies, for ex­am­ple, use what’s called “mark-to-mar­ket” ac­count­ing, in which they can project fu­ture in­come or as­set val­u­a­tions as if they are cer­tain and not hy­po­thet­i­cal, in or­der to in­flate their stock price. If you’re won­der­ing how that usu­ally works out, do a quick in­ter­net search for “En­ron.”
2. [^2] Okay. So. I am cap­i­tal­iz­ing “Moral Ex­haus­tion” be­cause I re­ally hope it be­comes a thing peo­ple at­tribute to me. All the great philoso­phers have cool-sound­ing terms they’re cred­ited with—Kant’s cat­e­gor­i­cal im­per­a­tive, Aris­to­tle’s golden mean, etc. I fig­ure this is my only shot to get my own cool, pithy, philo­soph­i­cal idea out there into the world. Let’s make this hap­pen, peo­ple!
3. [^3] And then Todd im­me­di­ately brings up the fact that there is al­ready some­thing called “com­pas­sion fa­tigue,” which ac­cord­ing to the Amer­i­can Psy­cho­log­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion “oc­curs when psy­chol­o­gists or oth­ers take on the suf­fer­ing of pa­tients who have ex­pe­ri­enced ex­treme stress or trauma,” and “can re­sult in de­pres­sion and anx­i­ety.” To that I say, “Todd, please just let me have this.”
4. [^4] I was re­cently awo­ken at 3:00 a.m. by a smoke alarm “Bat­tery low!” beep­ing alert and I just ripped it off the wall and threw it in the trash can and even if my house some­day burns down be­cause of that de­ci­sion I will still feel like it was the right move.
5. [^5] Some of you, right now, are think­ing, “Oh yes, ‘leash ag­gres­sion,’ he should try _this_,” or, “I know a woman who can cure Henry by do­ing _that_,” and I po­litely in­vite you to save it. We tried ev­ery­thing. Train­ers, ther­apy, a pet psy­chic—you read that cor­rectly—and noth­ing worked. Henry is a lov­able lost cause. Also, my daugh­ter, Ivy, just found out I men­tion Henry in this book and not our other dog, Louisa, and she thinks that’s un­fair, so I am hereby ex­tend­ing this foot­note in or­der to of­fi­cially men­tion the ex­is­tence of Louisa.
6. [^6] I have no idea what his voice sounded like. But I bet it was flat and emo­tion­less.
7. [^7] Ac­cord­ing to Google Trans­late, that means “No ex­cuses,” which I as­sume is en­graved on Kant’s tomb­stone.
8. [^8] Just kid­ding, it’s Joseph Over­ton.
9. [^9] When I was writ­ing on _The Of­fice_, the showrun­ner (and my men­tor), Greg Daniels, would warn us against jokes that made Michael Scott too car­toon­ishly stupid. He would cite _The Simp­sons_, which he’d writ­ten for, say­ing that in the early days of the show the staff would write a “stupid guy” joke for Homer that stretched the amount of stupid he was, hes­i­tate, then de­cide to put it in an episode. Later they’d pitch an­other joke that made him even stu­pider, and they’d think…, “Well, I mean, he _did_ say that other stupid thing last week, and this isn’t _that_ much stu­pider.” In a mat­ter of a cou­ple of sea­sons, Homer went from a kind of doofy dad to a guy so dumb he once got his arms stuck in two sep­a­rate vend­ing ma­chines at the same time. Now, that show is a car­toon (which makes it more palat­able to have char­ac­ters who are… car­toon­ish), and Homer’s rock-head­ed­ness is one of its great­est con­tri­bu­tions to com­edy, but Greg’s point was that even some­thing as unim­por­tant as the Over­ton win­dow for TV char­ac­ters’ per­son­al­ity traits needs to be watched very closely, or things can spi­ral out of con­trol.
10. [^10] It was Todd.
11. [^11] I read the first 220 or so, to try to un­der­stand her the­o­ries bet­ter, and then gave up. I’d rather read Kant’s trea­tise on wind.
12. [^12] I’m al­most ob­li­gated to point out that at the end of her life, Rand, the self-ap­pointed queen of in­di­vid­u­al­ism and un­fet­tered cap­i­tal­ism, ap­plied for and be­gan to col­lect both Medi­care and so­cial se­cu­rity ben­e­fits.
13. [^13] Os­ten­si­bly, a dif­fer­ent trol­ley car than the one with failed brakes that killed all those con­struc­tion work­ers.
14. [^14] Todd sug­gests that they wouldn’t shout, but rather “mut­ter,” be­cause “they’re not an­gry; they’re dis­ap­pointed.” Whether it’s fun­nier to imag­ine a Ger­man de­on­tol­o­gist _shout­ing_ or _mut­ter­ing_ I will leave as an ex­er­cise for the reader. (This is the kind of “ex­er­cise for the reader” I can get be­hind.)
15. [^15] This is barely a par­ody. Their ar­gu­ments were rarely more co­her­ent than this Stars and Stripes–col­ored word salad.

## CHAP­TER NINE: Oh, You Bought a New iPhone? That’s Cool. Did You Know That Mil­lions of Peo­ple Are Starv­ing in South Asia?!

1. [^1] Sorry. Couldn’t help it.
2. [^2] These num­bers were ac­cu­rate as of the writ­ing of Singer’s ar­ti­cle. Gates’s net worth at the mo­ment I’m writ­ing this has—some­what ab­surdly, given the fact that he re­tired years ago and has given so much away—bal­looned to $127.9 bil­lion. (The fi­nan­cial im­pact to him per­son­ally in the af­ter­math of his di­vorce has yet to be pub­li­cized.)
3. [^3] Four years later, in 2010, Gates and War­ren Buf­fett an­nounced “the Giv­ing Pledge,” in which they promised to give at least 50 per­cent of their wealth to char­ity and worked to get other bil­lion­aires to sign up as well. Buf­fett has ac­tu­ally pledged that 99 per­cent of his wealth will be do­nated.
4. [^4] Singer ac­knowl­edges these sorts of ob­jec­tions, to be fair. “Most of us,” he writes, “put our obli­ga­tions to our fam­ily, es­pe­cially our chil­dren, above ev­ery­thing else. Putting the fam­ily first feels nat­u­ral, and in most cases, it seems right.”
5. [^5] For more, see their an­nu­ally up­dated list of most ef­fec­tive char­i­ties at givewell.org.
6. [^6] I had fea­tured the book in an episode of _The Good Place_. I’m not just philoso­pher-name-drop­ping again for no rea­son. I mean, if I did that, my good friend Tim Scan­lon would be _fu­ri­ous_ with me.
7. [^7] Oh man, it’s an en­tirely new kind of name-drop­ping: _self_-name-drop­ping! This is a huge break­through in name-drop­ping tech­nol­ogy.
8. [^8] Singer, it should be noted, has been crit­i­cized for some of his views on dis­abil­ity and the al­lo­ca­tion of cap­i­tal to those with se­vere health prob­lems (which also come from his strin­gent util­i­tar­i­an­ism, and which read­ers can prob­a­bly tease out for them­selves). But as we’ve al­ready learned, it’s not al­ways a great idea to fol­low util­i­tar­ian views all the way to their log­i­cal ends—whether we’re talk­ing about char­ity, or per­sonal use of re­sources, or any­thing else.
9. [^9] Or, in what I think of as the worst cor­po­rate story from this whole aw­ful mess, su­per­vi­sors in a Tyson Foods fac­tory in Iowa _ac­tu­ally plac­ing wa­gers_ on how many of their em­ploy­ees would con­tract the virus.
10. [^10] There was some con­fu­sion over whether Ama­zon was ac­tu­ally so­lic­it­ing do­na­tions from the pub­lic—they funded the cam­paign with $25 mil­lion, and a spokesper­son later de­nied they wanted the pub­lic to con­trib­ute. But one won­ders: Then why start a Go­FundMe cam­paign at all?
11. [^11] Again, this was back in the mid-aughts. Cal­i­for­nia now gets a third of its en­ergy from re­new­able sources, and has vowed to cre­ate 100 per­cent clean en­ergy by 2045.
12. [^12] It’s gonna catch on. I can feel it.
13. [^13] See?! It’s pop­ping up ev­ery­where!
14. [^14] This would only ap­ply to a world in which cer­tain bag­pipe man­u­fac­tur­ers are some­how cre­at­ing more so­cial ill than other bag­pipe man­u­fac­tur­ers.
15. [^15] I know she means well, but hon­estly, Nancy is the _worst_. I’m done with her.
16. [^16] This Samuel Beck­ett quote, which I also used in the in­tro, was maybe not in­tended to be as… in­spir­ing as we have sug­gested. The work it’s taken from, _Worstward Ho_, is bleak, dreary, de­spair­ing, and gru­el­ing to read. Be­cause it was writ­ten by Samuel Beck­ett. But I al­ways get an odd sense of op­ti­mism from his hi­lar­i­ously grim prose, so I’m choos­ing to see a bit of hope in these six words, placed in this or­der.

## CHAP­TER TEN: This Sand­wich Is Morally Prob­lem­atic. But It’s Also De­li­cious. Can I Still Eat It?

1. [^1] Most (but not all) com­edy writ­ers’ rooms tend to be po­lit­i­cally pro­gres­sive.
2. [^2] It con­tin­ues to shock me how many fa­mous or suc­cess­ful peo­ple from his­tory are deeply prob­lem­atic. As I’ve been edit­ing this book, Bill Gates, he of the record-set­ting phi­lan­thropy, has been charged with work­place ha­rass­ment _and_ ap­par­ently spent much more time with Jef­frey Ep­stein than had been pre­vi­ously re­ported. Lit­er­ally to­day my wife and I lis­tened to a pod­cast about Gertrude Stein, early sup­porter of Pi­casso and Hem­ing­way, god­mother of the Parisian art scene in the early twen­ti­eth cen­tury, nov­el­ist and poet and fem­i­nist and gay icon… and found out she co­zied up to the Vichy gov­ern­ment dur­ing the Nazi oc­cu­pa­tion of France—go­ing so far as to trans­late some of Mar­shal Pé­tain’s anti-Semitic speeches into Eng­lish. I mean, for cripes’ sake—Gertrude Stein?!
3. [^3] Wow, there’s that term again. A lot of peo­ple seem to be us­ing it. Some­one should maybe write an ar­ti­cle about how it’s pen­e­trat­ing the cul­ture.
4. [^4] He also kept right on do­ing bone­headed and/or of­fen­sive and/or thought­less things. Were that ar­ti­cle writ­ten to­day, McKenna would likely have five en­tries for ev­ery let­ter of the al­pha­bet.
5. [^5] Sny­der has of­ten claimed that the name is _not_ racist but rather some kind of “cel­e­bra­tion” of Na­tive cul­ture. This, to quote Jeremy Ben­tham, is non­sense upon stilts. A his­tory of the term in the _Wash­ing­ton Post_ cites this en­try: “1863: The Winona (Minn.) Daily Re­pub­li­can fea­tures an an­nounce­ment that uses the term ‘red­skin’ as a pe­jo­ra­tive: ‘The State re­ward for dead In­di­ans has been in­creased to $200 for ev­ery red-skin sent to Pur­ga­tory. This sum is more than the dead bod­ies of all the In­di­ans east of the Red River are worth.’ ”
6. [^6] Sny­der also, in 2013, wrote a let­ter to his fans in which he cited a bunch of sur­veys and anec­do­tal com­ments that to him proved that Ac­tu­ally the Nick­name Is Fine. “Af­ter 81 years,” he wrote, “the team name ‘Red­skins’ con­tin­ues to hold the mem­o­ries and mean­ing of where we came from, who we are, and who we want to be in years to come.” In other words, as we’re about to dis­cuss: _This is the way it’s al­ways been done_.
7. [^7] This, re­mem­ber, is partly why William James de­vel­oped his prag­ma­tism—to give peo­ple tools to build a bridge be­tween pre­vi­ously held be­liefs and newer, bet­ter, more fact-based be­liefs that arise, from which they might ben­e­fit.
8. [^8] (_ex­hausted sigh_) In or­der not to run afoul of those mean, learned pro­fes­sors from the Q&A in the be­gin­ning of this book, I should point out that there are ac­tu­ally _three_ for­mu­la­tions of the cat­e­gor­i­cal im­per­a­tive; we just didn’t talk about the third one back in the Kant sec­tion. And with an even more ex­hausted sigh I will also add that Kant wrote about some­thing he called the “King­dom of Ends” which some schol­ars count as a fourth for­mu­la­tion, but which oth­ers don’t con­sider a dis­tinct idea. This is a good ex­plainer for how dif­fi­cult Kant’s writ­ing can be—ex­perts can’t even to­tally agree on how many damn cat­e­gor­i­cal im­per­a­tive for­mu­la­tions there are.
9. [^9] It’s ac­tu­ally hard to even con­ceive of a less ap­pro­pri­ate nick­name: The Ari­zona Po­lar Bears? The Kan­sas Moun­taineers? The Las Ve­gas Dig­nity?
10. [^10] To be fair to the util­i­tar­i­ans, they did make an­other ar­gu­ment against the op­pres­sion of the weak by the strong. Mill wrote this, in his orig­i­nal text of _Util­i­tar­i­an­ism_: “The in­ter­est in­volved is that of se­cu­rity, to ev­ery one’s feel­ings the most vi­tal of all in­ter­ests. All other earthly ben­e­fits… can, if nec­es­sary, be cheer­fully for­gone, or re­placed by some­thing else; but se­cu­rity no hu­man be­ing can pos­si­bly do with­out; on it we de­pend for all our im­mu­nity from evil.… Noth­ing but the grat­i­fi­ca­tion of the in­stant could be of any worth to us, if we could be de­prived of any­thing the next in­stant by who­ever was mo­men­tar­ily stronger than our­selves.” He had to come up with _some­thing_, be­cause util­i­tar­i­an­ism’s ba­sic tenets seem to de­fend ma­jori­tar­ian tyranny: If 51 per­cent of us op­pressed the other 49 per­cent, well, that’s (in the­ory) 51 per­cent hap­pi­ness and 49 per­cent sad­ness. A util­i­tar­ian thumbs-up. So Mill con­cluded that a ba­sic safety from op­pres­sion su­per­sedes all other con­sid­er­a­tions, be­cause _all_ peo­ple would fear some­day be­ing in a sit­u­a­tion where _they_ were op­pressed, and with­out ba­sic lib­erty all else crum­bles. It’s not that the ar­gu­ment has no merit, but we might point out that (a) it doesn’t seem to be the case, with a lot of op­pres­sors—they don’t seem to fear be­ing op­pressed them­selves some­day, like _at all_, and (b) if your eth­i­cal the­ory needs to ex­plain why it ac­tu­ally _doesn’t_ give the green light to op­pres­sion as it ap­pears to, there might be some­thing big-pic­ture wrong with your eth­i­cal the­ory.
11. [^11] Re­call the foot­note in chap­ter 7 re­lated to the back­fire ef­fect, which of­ten causes peo­ple who are con­fronted with in­for­ma­tion that chal­lenges their core iden­ti­ties to dig in their heels and dou­ble down on their orig­i­nal be­lief. See es­pe­cially the work of Bren­dan Ny­han and Ja­son Rei­fler, ex­plained in the pod­cast _You Are Not So Smart_. Like most of these thorny, com­plex is­sues, how­ever, there is also some ev­i­dence that the ef­fect is not quite as strong as their work sug­gested.
12. [^12] If you’re keep­ing tabs on my per­sonal meat-eat­ing his­tory, it was soon af­ter the Chick-fil-A in­ci­dent, so at the time of that de­bate, eat­ing at Chick-fil-A was still an op­tion for me.
13. [^13] Shock­ing note from Todd, here, who is also a veg­e­tar­ian: “True con­fes­sion: I have been there, be­cause my old­est son, a weightlifter, eats ham­burg­ers. Not only have I fin­ished the last cou­ple of bites when he doesn’t eat them, but when he wraps it back up in the bag and puts it on the top of the garbage I have oc­ca­sion­ally gone into the bag, pulled out those last cou­ple of bites, and eaten them. Not proud of this. Just sayin’.” Philoso­phers: they’re just like us!
14. [^14] To the best of my knowl­edge, Daniel Sny­der does not stran­gle baby gi­raffes in or­der to achieve sex­ual ex­cite­ment. But also, if I found out Daniel Sny­der stran­gled baby gi­raffes in or­der to achieve sex­ual ex­cite­ment, I would nod and say, “Yeah, makes sense.”
