All Bibles or sacred codes have been the causes of the following Errors:

1. That Man has two real existing principles: Viz: a Body & a Soul.  
2. That Energy, call’d Evil, is alone from the Body; & that Reason, call’d Good, is alone from the Soul.  
3. That God will torment Man in Eternity for following his Energies.

But the following Contraries to these are True:

1. Man has not Body distinct from his Soul; for that call’d Body is a portion of Soul discern’d by the five Senses, the chief inlets of Soul in this age.  
2. Energy is the only life, and is from the Body; and Reason is the bound or outward circumference of Energy.  
3. Energy is Eternal Delight.

### **1 GREGORY BATESON BETWEEN EPISTEMOLOGY AND ONTOLOGY**

In 1923, in a never read preface to a lecture course bearing the title “_Ontology: The Hermeneutics of Facticity”_, Martin Heidegger pointed to the task which, from the point of view of his experience of thought, was more properly entrusted to the care of philosophical meditation, by the following words:

"Asking questions. Questions are not flashes of genius, questions are not even ‘the problems’ today so regular which you fish in hearsay and find in the readings and which are accompanied by a gesture of deepness. Questions arise from confrontation with ‘things’. And things are only there where_eyes_are."

With this statement put almost at the onset of his speculative journey Heidegger definitively repudiated the later insurgent attempts to present his work as overly divorced from the real problem context of modern man, when not simply ideological, and at the same time spelled out the need for a general ontic curvature for every thought that aspired to be seriously and radically hanging from a fundamental ontological question.

From the point of view of this statement, the man’s thinking was configured essentially as an activity inextricably linked to the truth of his thrownness (_Geworfenheit_) into the world, even as the eminent space of the revealing of this thrownness as a historical thrownness. What else did the duty of the “confrontation with the ‘things’ ” declare unless the bond of origin and reference of the philosophical application with the reasons of its own time and with the ontic issues which this time calls into question? In the specific case of Heidegger’s experience the insertion of the fundamental ontological question (_Seinsfrage_) in the most advanced consciousness of his own time and in his knotty problem was realized in the identification of the ‘question concerning technology’ as an intimation always and even more today put to thinking of Being.

Referring to that experience of thought and to its initial quoted statement as to the inspiring intention of the present work, we ask: what is today - in an era that is only partially also Heidegger’s – the ‘thing’ by comparing with the philosophical interrogation should arise?

Of course it is not a matter to give the reflection a “theme” or a “title” and then hold it in terms of an easy and charming “relevance.” Instead, it is to become aware of the fact that the authenticity of all our possible arrangement to ask and to think currently resides in our ability to remain in the vicinity of the event whose happening originally essentializes our time.

The event is the eradication of man from the earth by a technique which in its disturbing and effective operating increases so rapidly its overwhelming power to tend now to achieve a dimension of global domination and the fulfillment of all its chances of provocation and machinations of the being.

Directed to this event - that “happens today and has been for three centuries on the way ”1- attention and willing to investigate shared by all fields of knowledge and common to all civilizations and cultural traditions have arisen from time. The measure of this new attention is itself a sign of the pressure that contemporary thought receives from its ‘thing’.

The historical phenomena in the background of which our practice with the world takes character and visibility in all aspects and moments are, by nature and size, that the thought is not allowed to reject or to neglect a payment.

Felix Guattari wrote that “the great crisis of the end of the millennium seems to announce as the conjunction of all possible convulsions ”2and that “you would not end to enumerate the fields drifting, or which evolve in a catastrophic way (energy, employment , ecology, demography, international relations ...)”3. We all adhere - in a more or less conscious way  
– to this perception of reality. We seem to share the generalized anxiety of those who are in the imminence of the deconstruction of all the axioms of their personal functioning. This feeling echoes indeed at the center of our lives as the fundamental emotional tonality of present age.

1 MARTIN HEIDEGGER,_Nur noch ein Gott kann uns helfen_(Der Spiegel, May 31, 1976)

The historical evolution of our communities on a global scale (which like any other evolutionary process - should always act in a delicate balance of innovation and stability) hangs conspicuously on the side of the innovative elements and accelerates so violently its bike to let us predict the rapid achievement of a kind of vanishing point and the resulting final separation from anchorage to any kind of tradition. That link of transmission and essential derivation that has always linked the present to the past and has allowed its intelligibility at the thought is progressively vanishing.

Our sense of belonging to the world is shaken to its roots, the humanity of man is subjected to a deep process of obsolescence, and the conditions for the survival of the biosphere itself is at risk of being compromised beyond repair. Still, the thought still shows mainly to correspond only in terms of increasing agitation and of a didactic unproductive anxiety, which does not commit its most intimate resources, does not push it forward in understanding but rather condemns it to confine itself among showy and superficial aspects of the thing in question. We are unable to access that “initial appeal” that the radical nature of the events taking place instead demands from meditation.

Above all, we find it hard to establish as a leader of the acquired reflection the awareness that the transformations of our time cannot be grabbed and correctly localized in the space of a merely accidental and historical phenomenology. Namely, the awareness that those

3 _Ibidem_

transformations require instead of being considered as in some way “fated” outcomes of the epistemological premises of our civilization, and that therefore these premises have to be taken as the true reference of philosophical inquiry.

The contemporary knowledge must now become engaged in accounting two needs:  
1) the need to attack the ontic problems of its time by enlightening its essential ontological source;  
2) the need to clarify and thematize its own epistemological premises and their intimate connection with the happening of the event that is currently the focus of its attention.  
There were few experiences of research indeed, to date, that have moved in the direction of this commitment. Among them, we believe it is certainly one of the most significant and full of legacies that, Gregory Bateson led throughout his whole life.

The first difficulty that you are forced to deal with when you try to analyze Gregory Bateson's work is linked to the virtual impossibility of framing such work in the categories that are usually striven to define, classify and recognize the products of culture. Gregory Bateson in fact expressed contributions in various fields of contemporary science, revealing always a presence of the first order in each of them, able to innovate in a radical way - if not even to subvert - the conceptual paradigms of the disciplines with whom he came in contact.

Biologist by training and “vocation”, he devoted himself for many years to anthropology and, therefore, on the basis of the importance of the results from his research in these fields, he was involved in the early development of cybernetics. Then he transposed the ideas gathered during this experience into psychiatry and animated, from the 50s, a true psychiatric movement - the so-called “Palo Alto Group” - which is still one of the liveliest and most important experiences of contemporary clinical practice. Having subsequently radicalized his position as a challenge to the clinical knowledge in general, then he devoted himself to a series of experimental researches on animal communication and to the study of the processes of evolution of cultures. In latest years, finally attempting a synthesis of the ideas that he had acquired in his long life as a scientist, he contributed significantly to the recent disciplines of ecology and epistemology, especially pushing them towards a more effective understanding of the systemic crisis that the our civilization is currently going through.

Yet, despite the diversity of his work, his is not the intellectual biography of an eclectic. Instead, we can rightly argue that he remained throughout his life tied to a single node of problems, of which only gradually he became aware and that only in his late years he was able to explain clearly.

Reading his writings there is the certainty that it was following the trail of a ‘single unthought’ that he felt the need to deal with such a large number of scientific investigations and stress, and that his discoveries, although belonging to very distant and seemingly unrelated areas, are revealed - once assumed the novelty of his point of view - as variants and local manifestations of the same ‘ecosystem of ideas’.

The very structure of his speech, his own way of formulating the questions and of integrating the ideas reflect, with rare and unmistakable elegance, that sense of unity of the biosphere and of the knowledge that he always asserted and towards which he moved his steps.

We can say with some confidence that, as an anthropologist, as a biologist, as an epistemologist and as a psychiatrist Bateson had always faced the same question: to understand the reality of the pragmatic structure of communication, to grasp the formal necessary components of the communicative events, of those events in which dynamics of interaction between co-present entities take place, and - along with it - to lay the foundations of a science that was able to discuss in strict terms the whole series of issues related to those situations in which in some way informational exchanges and formal structures play a crucial role.

Gregory Bateson always moved by the conviction that “such matters as the bilateral symmetry of an animal, the patterned arrangement of the leaves in a plant, the escalation of the armaments race, the processes of courtship, the nature of play, the grammar of a sentence, the mystery of biological evolution and the contemporary crisis in man's relationship to his environment ”4are subjected to the same formal necessity and therefore precisely this kind of necessity must become the specific object of a science, that is, a set of organically assembled hypotheses and ideas.

4 GREGORY BATESON,_Step to an ecology of mind_,_Introduction_, (The University

Of course, it must be said that the contribution of his work nor that of those with him and after him tried to develop his insights was not enough for the birth of such a science. But the fact is that - at least in the last one hundred and fifty years - a long line of thinkers and theories has greatly contributed to indicate a set of goal lines and reference points scattered here and there, under which it would be already possible today to define a new scientific territory.

In particular, Bateson believed that the findings of cybernetics and systems theory and ideas raised in the mathematical theory of groups, Gestalt psychology and ecology had already provided sufficient conceptual tools for thinking - in a renewed form and closer to their complex nature the problems of the interaction between ideas, communication, mental process, organization, differentiation and structure. And that, on the basis of these tools, it was already possible to build “a bridge between the facts of life and behavior and what we know today of the nature of pattern and order ”5.

For this reason, in 1979, on the threshold of his last and most important essay, he declared the explicit intention of asking questions about what kind of necessity asserted the integration of the world and what kind of epistemological errors could compromise it instead, by asking:

"What pattern connects the crab to the lobster and the orchid to the primrose and all the four of them with me? And me to you? And all the six of us the amoeba in one direction and to the back-ward schizophrenic in another? "6

Statements of this type are quite common in the writings of Bateson.

Their wisely disconcerting character has not to be interpreted like a trivial rhetorical device; it must also be understood as the elegant instrument through which he allows his readers to directly access the core of his whole search path . The idea is that to escape from the impasse in which the evolutionary internal motility of our civilization has put us, it is now essential to reformulate the epistemological coordinates of our scientific knowledge and set aside the quantitative and mechanistic vision of the world that science has built on the basis of a passed physics and of a series of cultural premises which have arisen and self-corroborated throughout the course of the Modern Age. It is in fact due to this vision - along with the myth of the substantial separation between mind and body and between man and nature - that long chain of cultural errors and ethical values that today threaten our very survival.

The work of Gregory Bateson has always been intended to shake in depth the image that the knowledge of our age has built for itself. And even though the awareness of its importance is still very recent thing, its intrinsic ‘Socratic’ quality, its uncommon problematic rigor and the unquestioned authority of the author have already made it so that it configures in the contemporary debate as a true place of political confrontation, as a thorny term of distinction between environments and guidance of scientific research. Everything to the point that we believe we can already easily foresee that the work of Bateson become more and more the “stumbling block” of culture in the coming years.

It is necessary therefore to consider at this point: do such considerations and evaluations make Gregory Bateson a problem for the properly _philosophical_thought of these years? Are we not dealing with an author who though undoubtedly brilliant and out of the ordinary - moved in such a close and traditionally ‘scientific’ area to be ultimately alien to the philosophy and its issues?

The objection is not trivial, and - to the extent that it implicitly declares at the same time a review of what is essentially ‘science’, a review of what is essentially ‘philosophy’ and a review of what should be the relationship which exists today between these two regions of human knowledge – it deserves to be discussed and, in our view, contested.

It is quite clear that Bateson’s views about the need for a redefinition of the epistemological foundations of science and the long argument he developed in this sense would be enough already to count him - along with many other scientists of equal value - at least in the ranks of the so-called ‘philosophers of science’. But it is equally clear that, in the specific case of his work, such labeling would not be nothing more than an attempt to neutralize its subversive potential giving him a ‘role’ and a chance of pigeonholing in one of several compartmentalized disciplines the academic contemporary philosophy has been divided in just to protect its own survival.

Keep in mind that the singularity of Bateson's speech consists mainly in its ability to weave together in a single movement a broad range of issues that pertain to ethics as much as to epistemology, to logic as much as to politics, and to deprive each of them of any belong and connotation, and to bring them consistently and tenaciously to the single root of a deeper and more radical question which involves the relationship that original and fundamental human thought historically implemented with the essential necessities of the house (**οίκος**) of man, his environment, his world.

This unique way of weaving and attacking the multi-dimensionality of the problems at the thought of our time, places the works of Bateson beyond any schematic definition. It is indeed a clear and inescapable challenge to the consolidated metaphysical attitude of our culture that drives us to divide knowledge into disciplines and increasingly parceled and non-communicating backgrounds and to conceive science and philosophy (but also art, religion and policy) as inviolably distinct traditions of human work, or even opposed to each other.

Bateson is aware that the dualistic or pluralistic separations of culture reflect a broader and more original dualistic attitude of our civilization, which brings us to separate, in their essential consideration, mind from body, pattern from matter and matter from time, and practice in the world in terms of “God versus man, elite versus people, chosen race versus others, nation versus nation, and man versus nature ”7. And because “it is doubtful whether a species having _both_an advanced technology _and_this strange way of looking at its world can endure ”8, he strongly emphasizes

7 GREGORY BATESON,_Steps toward an ecology of mind_, 337

8 _Ibidem_

the need to reassert the monistic nature of reality from the integration of those margins that perniciously still stand out and away areas of production of thought.

The whole work of Bateson can be interpreted as the experiment of this integration. And it is primarily for this reason that we feel we can look to his position as an eminently philosophical position, marked by a setting of an ontological character, in the sense in which Martin Heidegger, the most radical thinker of the twentieth century, has marked this term.

We have to clarify, however, that the ontology of Bateson is not a meditation on the “sense of Being,” or in any way the explicit and conscious questioning of the link that binds the problematic_Frage nach dem Sein_to the_Frage nach dem Technik_, instead as it emerges and develops in the reflection of Heidegger. It is hard to believe indeed - despite the extraordinary harmony of certain themes and certain settings of their speeches - that the two thinkers have had any attendance or knowledge of each other's research.

The ontology of Bateson has an entirely ontic matrix and continuously measures its own truth in a confrontation with the objects of empirical investigations that are its foundation.

Its character is rather that of a sort of ‘ecographic reconnaissance’ of reality, i.e. a discourse that seeks to recognize and bring about the unity of the echoes from various fields of modern science and to describe by their track the image of that necessary_pattern that connects_and supports, in their essential depth, all things.

Bateson described in a poem the goal of his research as “the lonely Skeleton of Truth ”9and the image of this skeleton he reconstructs in the course of his work always appears - as indeed all true echographic image uncertain and delicate, so as to require a continuous audit and update of the contours and never to allow hard deductions or arrogant certainty.

The ontological dimension of Bateson's speech does not feed on the recording or synthetic possibilities of language, but it builds slowly and with hesitation around the axis of some leading assertions, which together are the preliminary horizon and the landing point of his speculative way.

They can be traced largely to three, namely:  
1) _mind is in matter_, that is, the world of ideas, organization, communication and thought process is inherent in nature and is not separated from it in any way;  
2)_sacred is in matter_, that is, the experiences and knowledge related to religions testify to the existence of immanent mental systems of vast dimensions, of which our ‘ I ’ and our species are only subsystems;  
3)_time is in matter_, that is, the world and every possible description of the world always contain the time and necessarily cannot exist outside or separately from it.  
It is clear that statements of this kind go beyond the field of pure scientific research as well as that of the so-called ‘philosophy of science’, moving clearly in the direction of a strictly speaking ontological issue on always in Heidegger’s words – “the question of Being” and its truth.  
In this issue Bateson brings the contribution of a radical vision that combines together the need for a rewrite of the conceptual paradigm of Western science and the need for a critical consideration of the same metaphysical premises of our tradition of thought, of which contemporary science and technique can be regarded just as the most striking product.  
Precisely because of the identification of this double level of criticism of the underlying conceptual structures of our civilization, the thought of Bateson appears as one of the most advanced points of that broad constellation of experiences which over the last century has variously operated to determine the possibility of a “new beginning” and a “countermovement” for the history of ideas and Western societies.  
To the extent that this thought experiment shows totally committed to integration of new scientific knowledge with philosophy (via this two-way movement: to give empirical research an ontological dimension and to give the philosophical question an ontic dimension), it is intended to remain essentially un-recognizable to both, until they will hire, the problem of a critical revision of their own epistemological frameworks as one of their most pressing issues.  
Let us add that this unrecognizable nature is usually the most characteristic sign of all those places of cultural history (and of natural history) where ‘the new’ arise.  
The purpose of the present research is that ‘new’ that has arisen in the work of Gregory Bateson and the assessment of its implications on the questions of our time, on our way to formulate and implement them in all their epochal meaning.  
Bateson was never meant to provide answers to these questions, as he was aware of the necessarily perverse nature of each response. But we feel we can say, however, that he has certainly provided reasonable evidence of the possibility of looking at them in a totally different and innovative way. And that - as he wrote shortly before his death - in this new look,

_"But mysteries remain.  
The world looks more elegant than it did ... "10_.

### **2 SYSTEMIC DISEASES OF CONTEMPORARY SCIENCE**

Gregory Bateson's epistemological proposal - by virtue of which he can be counted among the most radical and fruitful thinkers of our time - is not actually the result of an organic and purely speculative process. It is rather the derivative product of a complex of critiques that, in the course and on the basis of his own empirical research, he addressed the fundamental connotations of contemporary scientific system.

It is good to point out and emphasize that the objections raised by Bateson to scientific knowledge arise from the very core of the system against which they are directed and that their position makes them automatically essential and authoritative.

To Bateson the point is not indeed to challenge the scope of science as such, nor to give substance to anti-scientific attitudes or suggestions. The point is instead to engage with consistency and rigor all the necessary theoretical implications inherent in the most recent discoveries and the most advanced hypothesis of modern science, and to understand that the image that modern science has built for itself over the past three centuries and the preliminary assumptions still steering the progress openly conflict with the data of its most recent acquisitions and have become outdated quickly in their presence.

That is, although most of the contemporary scientific disciplines has produced - according to Bateson - discoveries and processing sufficient to revolutionize the traditional approach of the issues that concern communication processes and phenomena of self-organization of living matter, the conceptual paradigm these disciplines are still using and - in a broader sense - the metaphysical pattern of the systemic configuration of science as such instead appear totally inadequate to recruit and develop the meaning and scope of innovation which also has come to produce. All this poses to the thought task of clarifying and deeply reviewing the assumptions on which modern science rests and, more generally, the way we know and conceive reality to which we belong. That is, a fundamental question of epistemology is put to the thought.

The concept of epistemology suggested by Bateson does not actually correspond to the one implied in the traditional use of the term. It combines the current definition of epistemology as a branch of science _the discipline that studies how the particular organisms or aggregates of organisms know, think and decide_- with the definition of epistemology as a branch of philosophy – _the question that focuses on the necessary extent and other essential characteristics of the processes of thought, knowledge and decision_.

In this combination, the term 'epistemology' is enriched with an unprecedented density of meaning and is used to denote the set of all necessary formal components (and of ideas through which we reflect these components) of the process by which we know things in general, being included in this pronoun ‘we’ even “the starfish and the redwood forest, the segmenting egg and the Senate of the United States ”.11

It is quite clear that the central assumption of this definition is that our knowing is in general only “a small part of a wider integrated knowing that knits the entire biosphere ”12, namely, that its self-organizing mode and its structural requirements reflect and reproduce in an essential way the broader formal necessities of the immense biological communications network in which it is included.

Bateson devoted great part of its effort of thought to trying to seek and to clarify the structural correspondences that bind the human world of thinking, knowing and communicating to the mental characteristics of the

11 GREGORY BATESON,_Mind and Nature_, 4

12 GREGORY BATESON,_Mind and Nature_, 88

great ecological systems, with the stated goal of rebuilding the fundamental bridge between Nature and Culture that modern Western man seems to have finally demolished. In his view, Nature and Culture do not designate two separate and non-communicating regions of the world, but rather two great systems of interrelationships involved in the same set of formal regularities and structural constraints, ie in the same_epistemology_.

In making this statement Bateson is aware of not being determining the occurrence of a thought absolutely new and eccentric with respect to the Western tradition, but rather to be recovering the fragments of an ancient and consolidated wisdom, which in the West, more than elsewhere, has been buried for centuries under the weight of the Personal God theology and of Cartesian dualistic assumptions. The wisdom of the great theistic religions, the tragic culture of classical Greece, Pythagoreanism, Platonism, mysticism of the Gnostics and that of a poet like William Blake, the epistemology of Kant and the theology of Teilhard de Chardin are to Bateson constant partners in a dialogue through which he tries to reconstruct the trace of a potentially different approach to the problem of the relationship between Nature and Culture, and between Mind and Matter.

What emerges from this dialogue is the awareness of a necessary correspondence between the nature of the ideas that are produced within the human civilizations, and which inspire their self-organization, and the nature of those most basic broad and deep ‘ideas’ that regulate and give substance to the world of biological communication. It can rightly be argued that this kind of awareness represents the true core of Bateson's speculative position, since in fact his criticism of the system of science and epistemology of Western culture is based on it.

What kind of _necessity_, according to Bateson, binds the epistemology of human cultural systems to that of ecological systems and their natural history? That is, in what sense do the ideas we have about the way in which we produce and organize our own abstractions reflect the way in which nature determines and organizes its own processes of communication in the great phenomenon of life?

Not in the sense, of course, of a match that simply exists and cannot admit the possibility of a crack, but in a way that Bateson called_normative13_. As he wrote,

“ The laws of the sequence of propositional steps in argument (or injunctional steps in cooking and embryology) can be, and often are, broken, and their breach is not followed by inflicted penalty or vengeance by man or God. Nonetheless, the outcome of the sequence will depend upon the sequence of steps, and if the sequence is in wrong order or some steps are omitted, the outcome will be changed and may be disastrous."14

The possibility of error and of disease is implicit in all the phenomena that have a systemic and complex nature, especially in those integrated networks of elaborate and delicate processes we call ‘Culture’ and ‘Natural History.’

Yet, according to Bateson, the task of the culture - and in particular of the scientific culture - is to correspond as much as possible, in its own epistemological configuration, the essential features of its reference object. A civilization, in fact, that produces an inadequate view of the nature of the world to which it belongs and of its own evolutionary dynamics, must inevitably come to be in a state of great discomfort and difficulty in managing its relations with the world and understanding all the phenomena it is involved in.

The roots of the ecological crisis that our civilization has determined, and of all other problematic issues of its current historical phase, sink - in this way - right in the misconception of the living and systemic nature of the world with which we interact and the constraints and formal characteristics required by our interaction.

Bateson believes that modern science - structured on data of an outdated physics and on the theoretical assumptions of a unsustainable metaphysics - is one of the central points of this misunderstanding.

There are in particular three epistemological errors that he finds in the contemporary scientific system and to which he places the responsibility for  
13 GREGORY BATESON,_A Sacred Unity,_215

14 G. BATESON, M. C. BATESON,_Angels Fear_, 159

its substantial obsolescence:  
1) the bias that ‘quantity’ is generally more significant and influential  
than ‘pattern’;  
2) the inability to formulate clearly and rigorously the whole series of  
concepts which are habitually used in scientific working (expecially within  
those disciplines that study phenomena with distinct "mental"  
characteristics ) and to make explicit the theoretical assumptions which  
science indirectly refers;  
3) the acquisition of abstract and lineal logic as a model of thought and  
mental process in general.  
From the analysis of these three errors Bateson does begin the  
deconstruction of modern science metaphysics and of its role in the  
systemic crisis of our civilization.

**2.1 Single Vision and Newton's Sleep15**

Of the three grounds that mainly undertake the Batesonian attempt of an epistemological revision of science the one that concerns the conceptual antagonism between the notion of "quantity" and the notion of "pattern" is perhaps the one that can claim more credit in a significant part contemporary scientific culture.

Although the idea of an ordered and measurable universe has its roots in the most distant Platonic-Pythagorean tradition and has been found practically the entire development of Western culture, it was only during the seventeenth century that - in the wake of the astonishing success of the new experimental Galilean physics and Newtonian celestial mechanics setting arose and consolidated the notion that science should deal almost exclusively with quantifiable data and calculations and with forecast.

Without delving into a complex effort of theoretical localization of essence and metaphysical roots of modern science - effort which for obvious reasons could never find here a space worthy enough - we can summarize and assume some pieces of a consideration which now belongs to the critical instruments of contemporary thought and that implicitly frames the reasoning of Bateson. So we remind you that:

15 In a letter of November 22nd1802 to Thomas Butts the great mystic and poet William Blake lashed out at the mechanistic culture of his time by these words: “_May God us keep / From Single vision & Newton’s Sleep!”_. Bateson often quotes these verses at the very beginning of his essays.

- science exists and develops, starting from the modern age, in the essential configuration of what Heidegger called as the “mathematical system of reason”16;  
-according to this configuration, the science establishes itself the “initial foundation of what you may know, from and in prime propositions, which do not themselves have a need for roots” and builds itself as the “unity of a founded concatenation of propositions, propositions supported by the prime propositions and adjusted on them”;  
-the “dominance of the mathematics”, which connotes in a decisive manner the essence of modern science, is the decision to reduce the knowability of the beings to the calculation of their quantitative data and the evaluation of their causative mechanical connections, ie_those aspects that most effectively become available to instances of operation and provocation typical of “manipulative hands” of technology_;  
-the extraordinary correspondence of the initial decisions of modern science with the demands of progress and with success of the technology determines a new and surprising self-validating power of its essential conditions;  
-in virtue of this self-validating power these prerequisites can - in a remarkably short period of time when compared with the much slower and more conservative time of European cultural history prior to the Renaissance - to replace the older and more deeply rooted principles of biblical theology in the metaphysical core of knowledge;  
-prominent places of establishment of modern science as the “mathematical system of reason” should be considered the experiences and metaphysical positions of great thinkers of the seventeenth century as Newton, Galileo, Bacon, and, more than any other, Descartes.

16 See MARTIN HEIDEGGER, _Schelling’s Treatise on the Essence of Human Freedom_(Ohio University Press, 1985)

In the context of a general as implicit assumption of this interpretation of the mechanistic characteristics of modern scientific tradition, Bateson puts great emphasis on the crucial role that the thought of Descartes had in the construction of epistemology that underlies this tradition:

“[…] I find that there are two basic beliefs, intimately connected which are both obsolete and dangerous, and which are shared by contemporary supernaturalists and by prestigious and mechanistic scientists. The mass of superstition now fashionable even among behavioural scientists and physicists springs from a combination of these two fundamental and erroneous beliefs. It is a strange fact that both of these beliefs are connected to the same giant of philosophic thought, René Descartes. Both beliefs are quite familiar.

The first is the idea that underlies the whole range of modern superstition, namely that there are two distinct explanatory principles in our world, “mind” and ”matter”. As such dichotomies invariably must, this famous Cartesian dualism has spawned a whole host of other splits as monstrous as itself: mind/body; intellect/affect; will/temptation; and so [[p_059]] on.

It was difficult in the seventeenth century to imagine any nonsupernatural explanation of mental phenomena, and at that time it was already apparent that the physical explanations of astronomy were going to be enormously successful. It was therefore quite natural to fall back upon age-old supernaturalism to get the problems of “mind” out of the way. This accomplished, the scientists could proceed with their “objective” inquiries, disregarding or denying the fact that the organs of sense, indeed our whole range of approaches to study of “matter,” are very far from being “objective”.

Descartes‘ other contribution also bears his name and is taught to every child who enters a scientific lab or reads a scientific book. Of all ideas about how to think like a scientist, the idea of using intersecting coordinates, the so-called Cartesian coordinates, to represent two or more interacting variables or represent the course of one variable over time, has been among the most successful. The whole of analytic geometry sprang from this idea, and from analytic geometry the calculus of infinitesimals and the emphasis upon quantity in our scientific understanding..”17

17 G. BATESON, M.C. BATESON,_Angels Fear_, 58

From Bateson's point of view the dominance of theoretical notion of ‘quantity’ is only the most striking manifestation of a metaphysical (and therefore epistemological) determination of modern science that leads our vision of the world to differ from the essential nature of the world itself and, for this reason, to generate serious distortions in the preliminary assumptions under which we organize our practical relationship with the world.

“The belief that quantities can determine patterns is surprisingly pervasive and influential. It is, of course, a basic premise in contemporary economics and therefore one of the factors which determines international chaos as well as ecological disaster on the home front. ”18

It is good to note that, at least on the side of these critical considerations, Bateson is not a lone voice in the landscape of contemporary science. If, in fact, it is true that since Galileo we have learned that the book of nature “is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometrical figures,” and if still less than a century ago a physicist like Rutherford could say with contempt that “qualitative is nothing more than badly made quantitative”, it is also true that the "spontaneous" evolution of mathematics, physics and biology in particular, soon led many scientists to notice that, as a matter of fact, in the world of our everyday experience geometric shapes are rather an exception than a rule, and that very unlikely you may interpret exclusively in terms of quantitative and computing a natural reality where colours, forms, aesthetical organization and informational exchange play such an important widespread and obvious role.

It must be said, therefore, that in the light of a now very large scientific literature, which in recent decades has contributed critically to revise the traditional approach of almost all the core issues of research (and which of course we will not account here in detail19), the epistemological paradigm of

18 G. BATESON, M.C. BATESON,_Angels Fear_, 59

19 It was mostly the problems posed by the geometric description of the natural objects of irregular shape, the creation of models that can explain the behavior of

modern science can no longer be regarded as_a theorem_, but necessarily as_a problem_.

And perhaps it should be noted further that around today consciously divergent and antagonistic visions of nature of knowledge and its systemic foundations are increasingly confronting and clashing. It is up to Bateson, of course, the merit of having contributed significantly to determine the feasibility of this confrontation.

**2.2 A science made of “dormitive principles”**

Even the second line around which Bateson make his attempt to challenge the epistemological status of contemporary science originates from the comparison with the problems and the results arising from his experience as a researcher. And even in this case observations initially linked to the specific issue of the scientific work end up raising more radical issues that concern the fundamental determination of our way of producing and organizing knowledge, which is the fundamental determination of our primary reference to the being.

In studies undertaken in the area of the behavioural sciences (anthropology, psychiatry and ethology, in particular) Bateson soon realized that what more than anything else was still keeping these disciplines to a

many messy and unpredictable dynamic systems and the understanding of organizational characteristics and behaviour of living organisms and other complex systems, to progressively highlight the inadequacy of the classical quantitative and linear science. The reference is, therefore, to all those theories that have favoured the recognition of the complex nature of these problems, and among these, particularly to Mandelbrot’s fractal geometry, Thom’s Catastrophe Theory, Prigogine’s study of dissipative structures, the formalization of recursive properties of the systems developed by Maturana and Varela, the hypothesis of Darwinian evolutionism revision developed by Stephen J. Gould, Watzlawick’s pragmatic theory of communication, Haken’s studies in synergetics and other theories of the same epistemological relevance. Needless to reiterate that perhaps many of these theories have influenced the work of Bateson and they were in turn influenced.

low level of scientific rigor and scarce epistemological coherence was the inveterate habit to proceed in an almost exclusively inductive way and multiply the explanatory hypotheses, without, however, achieving the development of any core of ‘basic knowledge’.

In agile introductory pages of his first collection of essays, he exemplifies the cognitive state of knowledge related to the behaviour in these words:

“Moliere, long ago, depicted an oral doctoral examination in which the learned doctors ask the candidate to state the 'cause and reason' why opium puts people to sleep. The candidate triumphantly answers in dog Latin: ‘Because there is in it a dormitive principle (_virtus dormitiva_)’.

Characteristically, the scientist confronts a complex interacting system in this case, an interaction between man and opium. He observes a change in the system - the man falls asleep. The scientist then explains the change by giving a name to a fictitious ‘cause’, located in one or other component of the interacting system. Either the opium contains a reified dormitive principle, or the man contains a reified need for sleep, an adormitosis, which is ‘expressed’ in his response to opium.

And, characteristically, all such hypotheses are ‘dormitive’ in the sense that they put to sleep the ‘critical faculty’ (another reified fictitious cause) within the scientist himself. ”20

It is easy to see - according to Bateson - that the vast majority of the concepts and assumptions which we habitually use in psychology, psychiatry, sociology, anthropology and economics have come out of arguments very similar to what pushes the character of Molière to postulate the existence of a “dormitive principle.”

The incredible “mass of quasi-theoretical speculations” which is the corpus of these disciplines and the hundreds of concepts (“ego”, “anxiety”, “instinct”, “aims”, “mind”, “I”, “hereditary coordination”, “intelligence”, “stupidity”, “maturity” and the like), which resulted from these speculations, they represent a serious obstacle to any attempt to reset the problems related to the reality of behaviour according to an epistemological model that takes into account the true nature and complexity of this reality.

“For the sake of politeness, I call these ‘heuristic’ concepts; but, in truth, most of them are so loosely derived and so mutually irrelevant that they mix together to make a sort of conceptual fog which does much to delay the progress of science.”21

The most serious aspect of this approach in certain sectors of the science is that it also has a remarkable as insidious self-validation power. In fact,

“If we assert that opium contains a dormitive principle, we can then devote a lifetime of research to studying the characteristics of this principle. Is it heat-stable? In which fraction of a distillate is it located? What is its molecular formula? And so on. Many of these questions will be answerable in the laboratory and will lead on to derivative hypotheses no less ‘dormitive’ than that from which we started.”22

Consider, for example, what happens whenever we bring up the concept of “instinct.” Complex phenomena such as the intelligent behavior of a living organism are explained in terms of a mechanical derivation from a supposed causal reified principle. In this way, through a reductionist operation often rougher than useful, you can avoid and exclude from the explanation (preserving, ultimately, the scientific process itself from the danger of a deep epistemological crisis) the analysis of the complex network of interactive processes that is created between the structural data and the ability of learning and informational exchanging of the living organism and those of its environment.

It is an absolutely clear fact that the concept of “instinct” - like for example that of “gravity” - operates simply as a principle of explanation, namely as “a sort of conventional agreement between scientists to stop trying to explain things at a certain point”23. But if on the one hand, Newton seems to have been very aware at the time that he had invented and not discovered his law of gravity, and he was therefore well aware of its exclusively fictitious nature, on the other hand, the modern science of behavior still seem to stay intended to invest time and energy in wasteful and unnecessary laboratory research aimed to identify and isolate the objective correlative of the instincts, that is, of certain reified abstractions arisen from the reductionist anxiety of those sciences themselves.

21 GREGORY BATESON,_Steps to an Ecology of Mind, Introduction_, xxvi

Even more pernicious is perhaps the use to which the concept of "energy" is submitted in this area of science. Of course, if the nebulous ideas that come from many quarters about things like "inner energy" or "psychic energy" fail to let our explanatory hypotheses on the phenomena of life and behavior advance a single step, they certainly denounce an irresistible trend of science in general to think the_thingness_of things always and exclusively in terms of_substance_, and therefore to build its conceptual paradigms by modeling them on that of classical physics.

Wittily Bateson remarks that,

“For at least 200 years, say from the time of Newton to the late nineteenth century, the dominant preoccupation of science was with those chain of cause and effect which could be referred to forces and impacts. The mathematics available to Newton was preponderantly quantitative, and this fact, combined with the central focus upon forces and impacts, led men to measure with remarkable accuracy quantities of distance, time, matter and energy.

(...) The early pioneers of behavioral science not unnaturally began their survey of behavior by desiring a similar rigorous base to guide their speculations. Length and mass were concepts which they could hardly use in describing behavior (whatever that might be), but energy seemed more handy. It was tempting to relate ‘energy’ to already existing metaphors such as ‘strength’ of emotions or character or ‘vigor.’ Or to think of ‘energy’ as somehow the opposite of ‘fatigue’ or ‘apathy.’ Metabolism obeys an energy budget (within the strict meaning of ‘energy’), and energy expended in behavior must surely be included in this budget; therefore it seemed sensible to think of energy as a determinant of behavior.

23 GREGORY BATESON,_Steps to an Ecology of Mind_, 39

It would have been more fruitful to think of _lack_of energy as preventive of behavior, since in the end a starving man will cease to behave. But even this will not do: an amoeba, deprived of food, becomes for a time _more_ active. Its energy expenditure is an inverse function of energy input.

(...) If mass and length are inappropriate for the describing of behavior, then energy is unlikely to be more appropriate. After all, energy is Mass x Velocity2, and no behavioral scientist really insists that ‘psychic energy’ is of these dimensions.”24

It is not improper to detect, on the sidelines of these observations, that Kant25was perhaps the first philosopher to realize the metaphysical habit of knowledge to deal with the explanatory principles as empirical objects and to reify abstractions of thought, when he challenged the rational psychology of his age on fallacy according to which the 'I think' function was reified through the substantial reality of ‘soul’ and related to alleged scientific speculations.

It is clear that even in the case of Bateson's reasoning the very question is not so much a refutation of an epistemological error (here in a strict sense) consolidated in the proceedings of certain disciplines, but rather the identification of an additional constitutive element of that fundamental metaphysical configuration which still exists within the system of contemporary science. The impulse that these disciplines manifest to consider thingness of things in rigid terms of the present and objectified substance evidently has not foundation in any intrinsic need of performance of the sciences as such (the same way the bias that pushes to remove qualitative aspects and a-substantial phenomena from the explanation). It reveals, if anything, instead essentially the appearance of that_initial decision_- we would say in Heideggerian terms - which claimed scientific thinking as a whole to constitute itself in the mode of this kind of_ratio_, or - in terms

24 GREGORY BATESON,_Steps to an Ecology of Mind, Introduction_, xxix

25 See IMMANUEL KANT,_The Critique of Pure Reason_, Book 2: Trascendental Dialectic - Chapter 1: The Paralogisms of Pure Reason - Section1: The Soul is Substance

closer to the language of Bateson - of that _epistemology_which preliminarily and implicitly directs and organizes the practices or the content of our way of knowing.

Right in reference to the possibility of interpreting the group of the criticisms that it moves to scientific knowledge according to this perspective, Bateson's thought shows the roots of a meditation which - as we try to clarify further - should be considered eminently philosophical.

**2.3 “The Syllogism in grass” and the metaphor that we are.**

The need to confront the logic - as the intended form of Western rationality - arises for Bateson away from problems related to the cybernetic theory of circular retroactive causality based systems and those related to schizophrenia and, more generally, to the complicated phenomena of communication between men. Again, lacking a systematic and complete discussion of the matter, it is rather the presence of a long series of references and allusions scattered in the polemical works that allows us to argue that the criticism of the logic as a model of scientific thought is one of the most continuous and important leitmotif in Bateson's work.

It is necessary, before proceeding to present the arguments of this criticism, echoing a famous Heideggerian text26, ask at the outset:: are the allegations against the logic (in particular against the formalized deductive Aristotelian-Scholastic logic) arguments in favor of the Alogical and Illogical, the claim to reject the rigor of thought and access to some kind of suggestive ‘irrationalism?’ Must we agree with those who, intending to defend the traditional epistemological positions of reductionism and mechanism, have argued for years with Bateson, and with those who continued and developed his ideas, linking them to the image of ‘gurus’ adept at producing unscientific suggestions and fascinations but all in all unrelated to the rigor and validity of the orthodox science?

Even without taking a position on the merits of the dispute, it is entitled to highlight the fact that the issue plays certainly a central role in the more general context of the epistemological problem raised by Bateson. And we may also notice that a critical comparison with the logic, to the extent that it is necessarily a comparison with the fundamental mode of organization and self-determination of Western knowledge and thought, can never be solved, or even just set, in the restricted scope of the specific scientific problem, that is in the dimension of a purely technical question or a question concerning science methodology.

26 See MARTIN HEIDEGGER, _Pathmarks, Letter on Humanism_(Cambridge University Press 1998)

Its own very nature makes the question about the logic - whenever and wherever it arises - a question that moves in the direction of fundamental ontological problems (and perhaps it is superfluous, at this point, to make reference again to Heidegger as the other site of the twentieth century thought in which the question of logic openly raises in intimate connection to the most radical and decisive questions of fundamental ontology).

Bateson's first criticism of the logic arises close to the interpretation of the circular causation systems.  
It is known that the cybernetics as a science arose precisely from the development of the concepts of positive and negative feedback, through which it was possible to give a correct and not supernatural formal description of all those complex systems in which the informational exchange proceeds along circular paths. If you think that nature seems, in the light of the most advanced discoveries and theories, practically be organized only in systems that have characteristics of cybernetic circuits, you can perhaps realize the importance of a correct interpretation of them for the advancement of science.  
A very simple example of a cybernetic circuit is given by the common device of an internal combustion engine. Bateson writes:

“Imagine a machine in which we distinguish, say, four parts, which I have loosely called ‘flywheel’, ‘governor’, ‘fuel’ and ‘cylinder’. In addition, the machine is connected to the outside world in two ways, ‘energy input’ and ‘load’, which is to be imagined as variable and perhaps weighing upon the flywheel. The machine is circular in the sense that flywheel drives governor which alters fuel supply which feeds cylinder which, in turn, drives flywheel. Because the system is circular, effects of events at any point in the circuit can be carried all around to produce changes at that point of origin ”27.

In such a system the adjustment mechanism can either be arranged such that the operation of the system grows exponentially until it reaches a certain vanishing point and a component of the system necessarily breaks down, or it can be made so as to react when growth reaches a certain critical threshold, and return the parameters of operation within acceptable values, keeping the system in a state of equilibrium. In the first case the informational exchange between the components of the system gives rise to a “positive feedback loop”, in the second case we speak of a “negative feedback”.

The hypothesis of Bateson (and of all scientists who gave birth to the cybernetics movement in the late 40s) is that the basic scheme of that circuit is common to all mental systems, that is to all those systems in which the interaction between the parties takes place on the basis of an informational exchange.

In particular, all the communication dynamics within the cultural systems, (those which are covered by anthropology), all the self-regulation mechanisms of environmental ecosystems, as well as the whole process of evolution of living species can be properly described and understood only as cybernetic systems.

This assumption – to which Bateson, however, devoted all his work as a researcher and investigator - inevitably leads to a new determination of the concept of ‘cause’ and that of ‘effect.’

If it is true that the complex natural systems always operate in such a way that A produces B and B necessarily affect retroactively the new state of A, the attribution of the definitions of cause and effect within the A-B system loses its traditional meaning and its traditional rigidity. Only a lineal attitude, i.e. a way of thinking that rejects the feedback hypothesis and the idea of circularity, can generate - in front of the given apparently selfcorrecting systems - the two fundamental errors of_mechanism_(the position that the cause determines always unidirectionally the effect) and of_teleologism_ (the position for which the effect is instead to determine the occurrence of a cause to it adequate).

“What is the case is that when causal systems become circular [...], a change in any part of the circle can be regarded as_cause_for change at later time in any variable anywhere in the circle. It thus appears that a rise in the temperature of the room can be regarded as the cause of the change in the switch of the thermostat and, alternatively, that the action of the thermostat can be regarded as controlling the temperature of the room ”28.

The history of modern evolutionism is to Bateson a typical example of how these two perspective errors of traditional science can face each other for generations without being able thereby to improve the level of knowledge and the quality of interpretation.

Classical deductive logic comes into this discussion because it is actually the true implicit model of all lineal positions of this kind, and it is therefore absolutely a bad model of causality. In fact:

“When the sequences of cause and effect become circular (or more complex than circular), then the description or mapping of those sequences onto timeless logic becomes self-contradictory. Paradoxes are generated that pure logic cannot tolerate ”29.

What is in particular the inadequacy of logic as a model of causality? The answer, however simple, it seems astonishing:  
“The_if...then_of causality contains_time_, but the_if...then_of logic is timeless. It follows that logic is an incomplete model of causality ”30.

It is worth venturing incidentally the hypothesis that this annotation on the difference between causality and logical deduction contains the germ of a possible new determination of the essence of time. It seems implicit here

28 GREGORY BATESON,_Mind and Nature_, 60

29 GREGORY BATESON,_Mind and Nature_, 58

the idea that time belongs much more than to the measure of human thought, to the essence of the matter itself. Let us leave unspoken and intentionally not thought this possible implication of the reflection of Bateson, and let us reiterate the idea that this reflection betrays at every point a thickness and a problematic philosophical fecundity much larger than it appears at a first surface and apprehension.

The opposition to the logic however, finds its most fertile ground in another side of Bateson's argument. It is a topic that recurs with some frequency in the writings of the great English epistemologist, and that is well stated in a clear and concise paragraph of the 2nd chapter of the posthumous essay_Angels Fear_. Because, despite its agile and plan style, it contains a number of allegations very complex and full of implications, it is necessary to lend him great attention.

“[…] the ‘logic’ of metaphor is something very different from the logic of the verities of Augustine and Pythagoras. Not, you understand, 'wrong' but totally different. [It may be, however, that while particular metaphors are local, the_process of making metaphor_has some wider significance -- may indeed be a basic characteristic of Creatura].

Let me point up the contrast between the truths of metaphor and the truths that the mathematicians pursue by a rather violent and inappropriate trick. Let me spell out metaphor into syllogistic form: Classical logic named several varieties of syllogism, of which the best known is the ‘syllogism in Barbara’. It goes like this:

Men die;  
Socrates is a man; Socrates will die.

The basic structure of this little monster -- its skeleton -- is built upon classification. The predicate ('will die') is attached to Socrates by identifying him as a member of a class whose members share that predicate. The syllogisms of metaphor are quite different, and go like this:

Grass dies;  
Men die;  
Men are grass. [In order to talk about this kind of syllogism and compare it to the ‘syllogism in Barbara’, we can nickname it the ‘syllogism in grass’]. I understand that teachers of classical logic strongly disapprove of this way of arguing and call it 'affirming the consequent', and, of course, this pedantic condemnation is justified if what they condemn is confusion between one type of syllogism and the other. But to try to fight all syllogisms in grass would be silly because these syllogisms are the very stuff of which natural history is made. When we look for regularities in the biological world, we meet them all the time.

Von Domarus long ago pointed out that schizophrenics commonly talk and act in terms of syllogisms in grass and I think he, too, disapproved of this way of organizing knowledge and life. If I remember rightly, he does not notice that poetry, art, dream, humor, and religion share with schizophrenia a preference for syllogisms in grass.

But whether you approve or disapprove of poetry, dream, and psychosis, the generalization remains that biological data make sense – are connected together -- by syllogisms in grass. The whole of animal behavior, the whole of repetitive anatomy, and the whole of biological evolution – each of these vast realms is within itself linked together by syllogisms in grass, whether the logicians like it or not.

It's really very simple – in order to make syllogisms in Barbara, you must have_identified classes,_so that subjects and predicates can be differentiated. But, apart from language, there are no named classes and no subjectpredicate relations. Therefore, syllogisms in grass must be the dominant mode of communicating interconnection of ideas in all preverbal realms.

I think the first person who actually saw this clearly was Goethe, who noted that if you examine a cabbage and an oak tree, two rather different sorts of organisms but still both flowering plants, you would find that the way to talk about how they are put together is different from the way most people naturally talk. You see, we talk as if the Creatura were really Pleromatic: we talk about ‘things,’ notably leaves or stems, and we try to determine what is what. Now Goethe discovered that a ‘leaf’ is defined as that which grows on a stem and has a bud in its angle; what then comes out of that angle (out of that bud) is again a stem. The correct units of description are not leaf and stem but the relations between them.

These correspondences allow you to look at another flowering plant -- a potato, for instance -- and recognize that the part that you eat in fact corresponds to a stem.

In the same way, most of us were taught in school that a noun is the name of a person, place, or thing, but what we should have been taught is that a noun can stand in various kinds of relationship to other parts of the sentence, so that the whole of grammar could be defined as relationship and not in terms of things.

This naming activity, which probably other organisms don't indulge in, is in fact a sort of Pleromatizing of the living world. And observe that grammatical relationships are of the preverbal kind. ‘The ship struck a reef’ and ‘I spanked my daughter’ are tied together by grammatical analogy ”31.

Let us try to highlight and summarize the ideas that are more or less implicitly assumed in this reasoning:  
1) classical logic, namely that peculiar system of formalization of human thought patterns based on deductive inferences, it is proposed - and is traditionally welcomed - as a model of communication processes;  
2) in particular, in the formulation of classical logic, propositions and deductive links between propositions are based entirely on the ability to _analyze_the sentences, i.e. to distinguish clearly within them a_subject_to a _predicate_, assigning the terms to strictly defined classes;  
3) if logical thinking is essentially organized on the possibilities of a language that distinguishes originally a subject from a predicate, then the metaphor is what most radically opposed to it, since it is precisely the process that originally just ignores the possibility of that distinction;  
4) it is quite clear that the logical thinking finds its possibility only under specific conditions of human language, and that in all pre-verbal areas (but also in very broad areas of human communication) the information has not previously assigned to logical classes and through this assignment then recognized and accepted, but it rather follows transmission rules which are formally identical to those of the metaphor;  
5) deductive logic, as a model of thinking (i.e. as a model of the transmission and organization of ideas) is utterly inadequate to reflect the processes that normally occur in the world of living organisms and mental systems.  
Communication between mammals, the coding of genetic information, but also the organization of behavioral relations among men and a huge range of other natural phenomena presuppose communicative processes that have a consistent internal structural very similar to what we call metaphor, and do not show, however, no trait in common with the patterns of inference of abstract logic.  
To the extent that the natural history of human thinking (which is widely made of curious processes such as humor, puns, associations of ideas, insights, mysticism, schizophrenia and poetic creation) reflects the fundamental modes of the phenomena of the living world (all of which are governed on communicative rules that do not recognize the existence of the subject, but only deal with the identification of predicates, ie the basic information that you give in the form of differences), the assumption the abstract logic as a model of thought itself seems almost comparable to a kind of evolutionary error.  
What are the implications of such a reflection on the more general epistemological problem raised by Bateson in respect of contemporary science?  
The problem, remember, is ultimately escape from the dead end (crisis in relations between men, the crisis of the man/environment relationship) in which our civilization is hunted because of a fundamentally incorrect interpretation of the nature of the world of which it is itself a part. Western science, as has been said, is the eminent place of self-constituting and selfvalidating of this interpretation.  
If the objections raised about the conceptual dominance of the quantity on the pattern, about the disproportionate tendency to proliferate inductive hypotheses without testing and reviewing some of the epistemological premises of such a procedure, and about the metaphysical assumptions of dual nature wherever directing scientific research, already pose problems which cannot be resolved in the context of science itself, the terms of comparison with the unsustainability of logic seem to hint at something even more fundamental.  
What is captured here is in fact the link between the attitude of Western rationality to think the being of Beings always and only in the way of present and objectified substance (and therefore its intrinsic difficulty to relate properly to a world that shows instead to be organized entirely on differences and relationships, that is absolutely non-substantive and nonobjectified events) and the original arrangement of language, within which this rationality is actually to unfold.  
The language (not as this or that specific language, but as the intended form of at least every Western language) is what prepares for the thought the possibility of thinking of reality as if it were made up of subjects which bring upon themselves, act, interpret or undergo predicates and accidents of various kinds.  
The belonging of thought to the language looks absolutely more intimate and original than any other possible determination of it.  
The Western _ratio_ is the inescapable destiny of the language of subjectivity.  
Only where the language waiver of its nature, dissolves its internal structure and frees itself within the ancient possibilities of metaphor (that is to say, in particular, within poetry, art and religion) the thought is allowed a different and alternative way to happen.  
From these observations Bateson outlines and delivery, in response to the epistemological crisis of our civilization, the skeleton of a real project for thought.  
Science will have to rewrite its own language and its own premises experiencing a new integration with those other areas of our tradition which have preserved over time the ability of a different reference to the being of things, especially with art and religion.  
This new integration is the task that awaits the next generation of scientists and thinkers.  
There is still a problem, however, for Bateson as for all of us: to understand in what way we can properly and efficiently devote to it.

### **3 BIRTH OF AN EPISTEMOLOGICAL MATRIX**

One of the most unique characters of Gregory Bateson's epistemological thesis lies in their ability to present itself in the guise of ‘stories,’ that is, arguments that essentially ignore the static finality of definitions and escape the lure of the firm statements, preserving and showing instead frankly all the signs of its diachronic development, its temporal nature. Much of agility and elegance that characterize all the writings of Bateson is linked to this way of turning every idea and every theory - even those of which the author seems to be absolutely convinced always in the form of a _problem_ and never an assertion that rigid. Assumptions are never separated from a clear and aware assessment of their own limitations; observations are always strictly contextualized in the data of subjective experience that produced them; theories never claim to have a reliable and stable form, as if they had never undergone changes over time, but instead they often go along with an open discussion and criticism of their own ‘evolutionary history,’ uncertainties, hazards, setbacks and ‘inexplicable beliefs’ that have directed their development.

These connotations mean that the epistemology of Bateson can rightly be considered as a whole as one big controversy addressed to that knowledge that establish itself in total unawareness or dishonest concealment of its implicit assumptions and inherent temporal limitations.

And, if this is true, then it is also true that this epistemology cannot be taken into consideration as a theory among others, but rather deserves to be taken - in a more original and more profound sense - as a_possibility_for the thought and knowledge, a clear example of how you can actually proceed along a path of questioning and integrate gracefully the fact that this questioning with the explicit consciousness of the reasons of its own internal evolutionary motility.

To respond adequately to this possibility, any exegetical attempt should also try to unfold in a diachronic perspective of time and to avoid the inevitable temptation to ‘photograph’ (that is to stiffen in a motionless and ultimate image) what instead shows to be perfectly set in the dimension of its own mobility, partiality and impermanence.

That would be necessary – for a theoretically profitable work - that comment and interpretation were able to reproduce to some extent the same trend and the same constitution for ‘stories’ of the ideas to which they are directed.

However, since the expectations of this research are very modest and limited, we choose to discuss the conceptual elements of Bateson's epistemology by isolating them from their real discursive context and registering the form in which they present themselves in the most mature moment of the speculative path of the author. At the same time, we admittedly assume all the inevitable dose of arbitrariness and inadequacy inherent in this way of proceeding.

We have already highlighted the fact that Bateson's epistemological proposal has been built, in the course of a long history of scientific research, as an integrated network of ideas, concepts, definitions and methodological principles, which only slowly and with difficulty have come to fit connected in the plot of a larger and recognizable unitary meaning. It was also said that the level of interdependence between these elements is such as to suggest the use of the term ‘ecosystem’ to designate the complex.

In this ‘ecosystem’ of thoughts some ideas serve as general coordinates of the whole matrix, and the frequency with which Bateson uses them to account for any other theory or idea automatically puts them on a level of singular clarity.

None of these conceptual tools are properly invented by Bateson. They are all derived from other cultural sources, in truth also different among them, but in his speech they acquire a significance and a new and interesting dynamic at all.

Finally, let us say at the outset that it is primarily in these ‘places’ of Bateson's epistemology that one can see the traces of that fundamental ontological position which we have repeatedly mentioned so far, and which remains the true leading object of the present exploration.

**3.1 Pleroma and Creatura.**

The distinction between ‘Plèroma’ and ‘Creatura’ dates back, in its first known version, to Valentinus, a mystical thinker of Christian Gnosticism who lived in the second half of the 2nd century AD. It was then taken up and re-actualized by Carl Gustav Jung in one of his recent and less famous writings, entitled_Septem Sermones to Mortuos_.

Bateson believes that this distinction can be a valuable starting point for an epistemology that wants to break free from misunderstandings of materialism and supernaturalism and put in an explicit alternative to the Cartesian Matter/Spirit dualism.

Pleroma and Creatura do not coincide with the two traditionally opposing classes of inanimate things and living things. More generally, these terms and their antinomy do not designate any of the regions in which it is possible to divide the whole of beings in virtue of any ‘substantial’ or ‘essential’ prerogative.

Pleroma and Creature are rather the names of two initial modes of occurrence and conceptual description of the factual reality, two large categorical chances of phenomenal happening, ie, the names of two ‘worlds’. The difference between these ‘worlds’ is the presence or absence in them of what Bateson called “mental process.” In particular, the ‘world’ of inanimate things, considered as accessible to the descriptive possibilities of chemistry and physics, to the extent that it is devoid of those informational exchanges and of that sensitivity to difference that distinguishes the phenomena of life and mental organization, is the ‘world’ of the Pleroma. Everywhere, however, the events are mutually governed and determined by difference, distinction and information, and reveal a complex organization such as to be essentially irreducible to the plane of physical-chemical linear causal explanation, there exists the <world> of the Creatura. Bateson writes:

“The world of nonliving matter, the Pleroma, which is described by the laws of physics and chemistry, itself contains no description. A stone does not respond to information and does not use injunctions or information or trial and error in its internal organization. To respond in a behavioural sense, the stone would have to use energy contained within itself, as organisms do. It would cease to be a stone. The stone is affected by forces and impacts, but not by differences.

I can describe the stone, but it can describe nothing. I can use the stone as a signal – perhaps as a landmark. But it_is_not the landmark. I can give the stone a name; I can distinguish it from other stones. But it is not its name, and it cannot distinguish. It uses and contains no information. ―It‖is not even an_it_, except insofar as I distinguish it from the remainder of inanimate matter. What happens to the stone and what it does when nobody is around is not part of the process of any living thing. For that it must somehow make and receive_news_.

You must understand that while Pleroma is without thought or information, it still contains – is the matrix of – many other sorts of regularities. Inertia, cause and effect, connection and disconnection, and so on, these regularities are (for lack of a better word)_immanent_in Pleroma. Although they can be translated (again for lack of a better word) into the language of Creatura (where alone language can exist), the material world still remains inaccessible, the Kantian _Ding an sich_which you cannot get close to. We can speculate – and we have speculated very carefully and very creatively about it – but in the end, at the last analysis, everything we say about Pleroma is a matter of speculation, and such mystics as William Blake, for example, frankly deny its existence ”32.

It is important to notice that the distinction between Creatura and Pleroma does not in any way call into question the substantiality of the beings, but relates to the organizational principles intrinsic to the phenomena and open, therefore, a different and traditionally forgotten direction to thought in the consideration of the real.

“ Although there is an apparent dualism in this dichotomy, between Creatura and Pleroma, it is important to be clear that these two are not in any way separate or separable, except as levels of description. On the one hand, all of Creatura exists within and through Pleroma; the use of the term_Creatura_ affirms the presence of certain organizational and communicational characteristics which are themselves not material. On the other hand, knowledge of Pleroma exists only in Creatura. We can meet the two only in combination, never separately. The laws of physics and chemistry are by no means irrelevant to the Creature – they continue to apply – but they are not sufficient for explanation. Thus, Creatura and Pleroma are not, like Descartes 'mind' and 'matter', separate substances, for mental processes require arrangements of matter in which to occur, areas where Pleroma is characterized by organization which permits it to be affected by information as well as by physical events ”33.

The Pleroma and Creatura duality is definitely one of the most significant segments of the epistemological matrix described by Bateson's thinking. But it is also one of the places where most evidently the ontological dimension of this thought is to constitute.

It is completely peaceful, in fact, that the radicalism with which Bateson opposes the criteria (descriptive/organizational) on which the Pleroma and Creature antinomy rests to the substantialist determinations that describe the more usual antagonistic pairs Spirit/Matter and Mind/Body, in itself marks a conscious exit of his meditation from the horizon of the PlatonicChristian-Cartesian metaphysics of subjectivity that is pervading the entire tradition of Western knowledge and thought. As we later will show, it is in fact through reconstructions of certain ‘abandoned spaces’ of this same tradition, that Bateson produced the experiment of a fundamentally different ontological position and of a practice of thinking that, in its injunctive connotations, is undoubtedly subversive and divergent with respect to what, in the course of many centuries, has originally let our civilization access the thought and the world.

**3.2 Immanent Logical Types.**

The second "intellectual tool" that Bateson buys from Western philosophy and adapts to the needs of its proposal is the so-called logical ‘type theory’.

This theory was formulated by Bertrand Russell at the beginning of the century in order to overcome a contradiction that he had discovered in the logical system of foundation of mathematics developed by Gottlob Frege.

At some point in his treatise Frege asserted that a class could be a member of another class or of itself, causing by this assertion a number of serious contradictions that threatened to undermine the entire deductive system. Russell clarified the misunderstanding which Frege had incurred and demonstrated the inconsistency of that statement through the elaboration of the concept of logical ‘type’.

The confusion made by Frege was similar to that present in this inference:

The sky is blue;  
Blue is a color;  
So the sky is a color.

It consisted in operating a predicative act between logically noncontiguous elements.  
Russell understood that between the logical plane of the ‘individuals’ and that of ‘predicates of individuals’, between the latter and that of ‘predicates of predicates of individuals’ and so on, there is an unbridgeable distance of a ‘jump’ between logical hierarchical and non-communicating levels, and that, assigned to each of these levels a ‘type’ (0, 1, 2, 3, ...) the only lawful propositions are exclusively those ones in which the subject is of the type n and the logical predicate is of the type n+1. Therefore, the inference presented as an example is incorrect because it lays down a predicative relation between “heaven” and “colour” although these terms are in the speech of non-contiguous logical types, and, likewise, Frege's assertion is incorrect because no class can contain itself as a member (ie, something that is of its same logical type) but a class can belong only to a hierarchically superior set as a ‘class of classes’.  
Similarly to what has been done about the concepts of the Pleroma and Creature, Bateson reveals even for this theory a possibility to use an intellectual fecundity far superior to those conferred by its inventor himself.  
In particular, he realizes that the hierarchical structure of logical types is immanent to a huge number of physical and mental phenomena and it is the rule that is at the source of many of the cases of ‘mistake’ and ‘disorder’ that can occur in the complex world of the Creature.  
Bateson realizes, for example, that the relation between the name and the designated thing (and therefore between the plane of reality and the plane of description) is to be interpreted as a difference between logical types, having in fact the name (and, more generally, the act of the description) a hierarchically higher level than that of the thing and therefore irreducibly distinct and distant from it. Similarly, he discovers that the map has a higher type logical than that of the territory; that acceleration is a physical quantity whose type logical is higher than speed, and that (always keeping to the his most frequent examples) the word “tumbleweed” has the same logical type of “bush” or “tree”, since it does not indicate a species or a genus of plants but a particular set of plants whose members have their own unique way to grow and propagate.  
Bateson also shows, in the course of detailed scientific analysis, that the complex mechanisms of genetic coding and the processes of learning are structured on strict rules of logic type theory and that, in general, these rules are a key piece of the network of “necessary truths” which forms the ontological boundary (or “pattern that connects”) of reality as such. Correspondingly, they are therefore also accepted in the epistemological matrix Bateson means to build to determine the possibility of a description (which we have defined elsewhere ‘echographic’) of this reality.

**3.3 Idea, information, difference.**

It is significant that the text under which Bateson was brought to the attention of a wide audience and not just specialists, namely the collection of essays entitled_Steps Towards an Ecology of Mind_, starts by explaining a few things about the innovative use of the word ‘idea’ that the author proposes in these essays and that he actually takes up in the course of his entire intellectual work.

The notion of ‘idea’ has a very central location in the epistemological matrix I am trying to describe and is the main gateway to the ontological nature of the problem from which this matrix springs and to which it corresponds. Bateson writes:

“The essays, spread over thirty-five years, combine to propose a new way of thinking about ideas and about those aggregates of ideas which I call ‘minds’. This way of thinking I call the ‘ecology of mind’, or the ecology of ideas. It is a science which does not yet exist as an organized body of theory or knowledge.

But the definition of an ‘idea’ which the essays combine to pro-pose is much wider and more formal than is conventional. The es-says must speak for themselves, but here at the beginning let me state my belief that such matters as the bilateral symmetry of an animal, the patterned arrangement of leaves in a plant, the escalation of an armaments race, the processes of courtship, the nature of play, the grammar of a sentence, the mystery of biological evolution, and the contemporary crises in man’s relationship to him environment, can only be understood in terms of such an ecology of ideas as I propose.

The questions which the book raises are ecological: How do ideas interact? Is there some sort of natural selection which determines the survival of some ideas and the extinction or death of others? What sort of economics limits the multiplicity of ideas in a given region of mind? What are the necessary conditions for stability (or survival) of such a system or subsystem? ”34

All scientific and not scientific issues raised by Bateson are constantly presented in the form of questions relating to ‘ecological’ connections and relationships between types of ideas or systems of ideas. Also notable is the fact that this way of expressing the description / understanding of reality has led Bateson to question, in his last and unfinished intellectual fatigue, about the very essence of what is produced in the determination and recognition of an ‘idea’, and - moving from this query - to deal with those questions and that knowledge that traditionally science rejects as foreign to itself and the religion instead preserves as its most intimate resource. In _Angels Fear_in fact, he explicitly declares:

34 GREGORY BATESON,_Steps to an Ecology of Mind_,_Introduction,_xxiii

“Even though we can discuss the ideas which we ‘have’ and what we perceive through our senses, and so on, the enveloping question, the question of the nature of the envelope in which all that ‘experience’ is contained, is a very different and much more profound question, which approaches matters that are part of religion.

I come with two sorts of questions posed by these stories: What is the nature of the continuum or matrix of which or in which “ideas” are made? And what sorts of ideas create distraction or confusion in the operation of that matrix so that creativity is destroyed?”35

Bateson is aware that the vastness of his formal definition of ‘idea’ recalls very closely the fundamental ontological position of the Platonism and, in a lighter brilliant note posted in the_Introduction_of the essay on_Mind and Nature_, explicitly evokes this illustrious precedent to clarify his personal use of this concept:

“ Plato's most famous discovery concerned the ‘reality’ of ideas. We commonly think that a dinner plate is ‘real’ but that its circularity is ‘only an idea.’ But Plato noted. first, that the plate is not truly circular and, second, that the world can be perceived to contain a very large number of objects which simulate, approximate, or strive after ‘circularity.’ He therefore asserted that ‘circularity’ is ideal (the adjective derived from idea) and that such i deal components of the universe are the real explanatory basis for its forms and structure. For him, as for William Blake and many others, that ‘Corporeal Universe’ which our newspapers consider ‘real’ was some sort of spin-off from the truly real, namely the forms and ideas. In the beginning was the idea.”36

35 GREGORY BATESON, M.C. BATESON,_Angels Fear,_70

36 GREGORY BATESON,_Mind and Nature,_4

The notion of ‘idea’ has a clear heuristic connotation in Bateson's speech, being ultimately a conceptual tool almost intuitively learned that preliminarily introduces to the tonal horizon of investigation. But it has also and above all a clear ontological dimension to the extent that it is endeavored to designate in general all those abstractions that operate immanently in reality constituting its own essential structure or primary foundation.

‘Idea’ is defined elsewhere by Bateson as “a complex aggregate of information,” an ‘information’ being “any difference that makes a difference ”37. According to this definition it is clear that the ‘idea’ - as a not material structure which operates in the necessary self-constitution of matter and in its processes of description – belongs to the ontological plane of ‘difference’.

Thinking reality as an integrated unity held in its integration and need by ‘ideas’ ultimately means to be disposed to think the essence of the beings in terms of differing of a difference.

Inquiring about the nature of the difference, in a fast but extraordinarily dense paragraph, Bateson observes:

“[...] difference is dimensionless because it tends to be a ratio between two similars of some kind; and ratios between similars have no dimensions because the dimensional aspect ‘cancels out.’ The difference between these things is still the difference between these things after I mail this thing to Alaska or to any other place. We deal with something that is not localized and that is, in a certain sense, not physical. On the other hand, it can trigger a sense organ.

What you do as a perceiver, always, is to compare. If you do not have an external event to trigger you, you make an event by a scanning process so that the yellow of the paper against the brown of the table can be perceived by micronystagmus. The difference becomes an event in time. ”38

At the end of the same essay, Bateson then clarifies the epistemological

37 GREGORY BATESON, M.C. BATESON,_Angels Fear, Glossary,_209

implications of this recognition:

“[...] although the realm of ideas, information, mind - call it what you will is immanent in, and inseparable from, the realm of physical appearences, it must be approached with its own special preconceptions and premises. The physical analogies will not do, and the analogies of method taken from the hard sciences will not do.

The new science will form around profoundly nonphysical ideas: the nature of the relation between name and that which is named, the nature of recursive systems, and the nature of difference. ”39

On the basis of a juxtaposition of those collected quotations, we are now able to reconstruct a considerable chunk of that ontological position which is being built between the lines of Bateson's reflection and which I assumed to be the prime reference of this work.

Reiterating to be aware of making a markedly ‘plastic’ but - as I believe I have shown - in any event unfounded and arbitrary exegesis let us summary the steps taken by Bateson in the direction of such an ontology:

1) reality is an integrated unity of phenomena and processes whose integration is based on a matrix of abstractions or ideas in itself necessary and immanent;

2) the task of science and thought is to recognize this matrix and take it on the foundation of its epistemological self-determination;  
3) ideas, around which structure the reality of real, are complex aggregates of differences, that is absolutely not physical, not localizable, dimensionless entities, whose last and essential nature is that of_events located in time_;  
4) the knowledge of modern science – guiding in its basic guidelines our relationship with the world – firm in a substantialistic consideration of beings, has become inadequate to resolve the critical inconsistencies in which it also has precipitated this relationship;  
5) an epistemologically well renewed science and able to fit the reality to with reference to which it is made, must abandon its traditional implicit metaphysical position and start from a question that asks about the nature of the difference, which is about the Being of beings conceived as a eventuality.  
Although lacking in Bateson a complete discursive organization of this ontological issue and perhaps even missing a clear philosophical awareness of it; although this way to highlight the speculatively most fruitful legacy of his reflection is equivalent to rush there instead where even “angels fear to tread” and, therefore, all things considered, to betray the complex delicacy and uncertainty of Bateson's thinking, I am nevertheless persuaded that this thought practices to the bottom the injunction to a non-traditional way of experiencing the sense of being and the nature of things, and that only by agreeing to such an ontological initial tone it is possible to capitalize on his legacy.

**3.4 What is a_mind_**

All the conceptual tools by which Bateson defines the framework of its epistemological matrix come together into the formalization of the notion of ‘mind’. The distinction between Pleroma and Creatura, the theory of logical types, the concepts of ‘idea’ and ‘difference’ - developed independently in other parts of his scientific work and meditation - are the indispensable presupposition of the theory of mental systems which Bateson reached in the last years of his life and that, in hindsight, remains its most important contribution to contemporary science. The formal definition of ‘mind’ proposed in the last essay that he was able to publish in life is the instrument through which all the problems of its investigation are reset and, above all, the conceptual horizon within which, for our author, the research their possible solutions must be moved. In particular, the questions about the nature of aesthetic experience and its relevance in the processes of communication and interaction, the question about the nature of the 'sacred' and knowledge held by religion and the meaning of the idea of ‘self’ and ‘consciousness’ - evidently questions on horseback between knowing and thinking, between science and philosophy - are captured and addressed by Bateson in reference to its rigorous and innovative formal rewriting of the concept of ‘mind’. And this is enough to convince us of the central role that it plays in the epistemological problem that we are trying to rebuild and in its possible ontological implications.

Bateson's thesis is that a ‘mind’ is a system that meets a precise list of descriptive criteria and that only within minds it is possible to find those complex phenomena we call _thought, evolution, ecology, life, learning_. These criteria are discussed in detail in_Mind and Nature_(1979), where, however, they are presented together with a remarkable artwork. Therefore, I just summarize them assuming as undisputed the reflection from which they spring and focusing our attention instead on their necessary scientific and philosophical implications. This is the way Bateson enunciates the criteria40:

_1. A mind is an aggregate of interacting parts or components.  
2. The interaction between parts of mind is triggered by difference_and difference is nonsubstantial a phenomenon not located in space or time, difference is related to negentropy and entropy rather than to energy.  
_3. Mental process requires collateral energy.  
4. Mental process requires circular (or more complex) chains of determinations.  
5. In mental process, the effects of difference are to be regarded as transforms (ie, coded versions) of events which preceded them._The rules of this transformation must be comparatively stable (ie, more stable than the content), but are themselves subject to transformation.  
_6. The description and classification of these processes of transformation disclose a hierarchy of logical types immanent in the phenomena._  
It seems clear that, according to such a determination, the concept of ‘mind’ is stripped of all its traditional connotations and becomes the denotative element of a series of very heterogeneous entities, even if all united by the fact of possessing a high degree of complexity and autonomy, and manifesting processes similar to thought and evolution. Animals and people definitely fall under this definition, and indeed more generally, it covers all living organisms. But certain parts of organisms characterized by a certain autonomous functioning and self-regulation, such as single cells or organs, may be considered ‘minds’, in the sense of the definition proposed by Bateson. But the most significant consequence of this definition is that in order to recognize the presence of a mental system

“ there is no requirement of a clear boundary, like a surrounding envelope of skin or membrane, and you can recognize that this definition includes only some of the characteristics of what we call ‘life.’ As a result, it applies to a much wider range of those complex phenomena called “systems”, including systems consisting of multiple organisms or systems in which some of the parts are living and some are not, or even to systems in which there are no living parts. What is described here is a something that can receive information and can, through the self-regulation or self-correction made possible by circular trains of causation, maintain the truth of certain propositions about itself. The two provide the rudiments of identity – unlike the stone, the mind we are describing is an ‘it’. There is, however, no reason to assume that it will be either conscious or capable of self-replication, like some of the minds we count among our friends and relatives. A given mind is likely to be a component or subsystem in some larger and more complex mind, as an individual cell may be a component in an organism, or a person may be a component in a community. The world of mental process opens into a self-organizing world of Chinese boxes in which information generates further information.”41.

40 GREGORY BATESON,_Mind and Nature,_92

The idea of ‘mind’ has such a wide connotation (but at the same time such a rigorous one) that it includes local and planetary ecosystems and certain particular human systems in which the exchange of information and internal interaction reach sufficient levels of complexity and show to behave as autonomous entities in some extent self-correcting and evolving, such as ‘cultures’, ‘communities’ or ‘family groups’.

Remarkable is the fact that instead computers do _structurally_not meet all the criteria set out to recognize the mental process and that therefore they cannot be considered ‘minds’ in any way. Bateson writes:

“We use to argue about whether a computer can think. The answer is, ‘No’. What thinks is a total circuit, including perhaps a computer, a man, and an environment. Similarly, we may ask whether a brain can think, and again the answer will be, ‘No’. What thinks is a brain inside a man who is part of a system which includes an environment ”42.

41 GREGORY BATESON, M.C. BATESON,_Angels Fear,_19

We understand, without great difficulty, that the idea of the mental process proposed here fits in many of the discussions in which contemporary science is involved, revolutionizing their same basic approach and giving them an absolutely new and rare conceptual and methodological clearness.

Of particular interest are the implications regarding the consideration of concepts such as ‘I’, ‘self’ and ‘subject’, which receive, on the basis of that analysis of the characteristics of mental systems, a complete renovation and a revision of its epistemological and philosophical meaning. In fact

“if mind is a system of pathways along which transforms of difference can be transmitted, mind obviously does not stop with the skin. It is also all the pathways outside the skin relevant to the phenomenon that you want to account for ”43.

And also:

“To draw a boundary line between a part which does most of the computation for a larger system and the larger system of which it is a part is to create a mythological component, commonly called a ‘self’. In my epistemology, the concept of self, along with all arbitrary boundaries which delimit systems or parts of systems, is to be regarded as a trait of the local culture – not indeed to be disregarded, since such little epistemological monsters are always liable to become foci of pathology. The arbitrary boundaries which were useful in the process of analyzing the data become all too easily battlefronts, across which we try to kill an enemy or exploit an environment ”44.

Bateson appears to be quite convinced that the concepts of ‘I’ and ‘identity’, especially when they are interpreted in a strong way - as traditionally happens in Western scientific philosophical and religious culture - are the expression of a metaphysical position concealing the recognition of systemic connections subsisting in the whole of beings, pushing to suppress the perception of being partakers of processes and needs greater than our small individual subjectivity and leading to ethical attitudes marked by hubris and violence.

43 GREGORY BATESON,_A Sacred Unity,_165

Without anticipating the issues that will be the last part of this work, let us point out that the notion of ‘mind’ not only represents the central block of the whole matrix epistemological profiled by Bateson but it establishes itself as the most significant point of intersection of the scientific matter with more philosophical and ontological issues. ‘Mind’ is in fact the most complex and important one of those necessary pattern of reality identified by Bateson's epistemological discourse, as well as the means by which this discourse is ready to deal explicitly with the task of a ‘break’ with the fundamental philosophical dualist and substantialist position of Western thought and knowledge and with the metaphysics that underlies them, pointing to a possible monistic solution of the question at the basis of all human civilization: the mind / body problem.

Bateson is aware that, only on the basis of the response which is prepared to this initial question, the man interprets and builds its relationship with the world, its historical identity, the nature of everything he is to be and do. This answer, which automatically determines the center and the pattern of every possible human epistemology, has for Bateson a meaning similar to that which in (not so distant) Heidegger's meditation has the initial reference to the Sense of Being. I take this analogy, of course, just to clarify the speculative_extent_of the problem.

Around the mind / body problem reflection about the implicit patterns of thought and knowledge, reflection on the patterns of the actual and necessary ethics and ecology are to defile and get confused. Bateson himself moreover - legitimizing considerably the present reading of his work openly declares that if “for all human purposes with what can be known, there can be no clear line between epistemology and ontology ”45.

45 GREGORY BATESON, M.C. BATESON,_Angels Fear,_19

### **4 THE BEAUTIFUL, THE SACRED, THE DEATH. TOWARDS A MONISTIC SOLUTION OF MIND / BODY PROBLEM.**

Bateson often defined his research as the relentless attempt to clarify the nature of the Riddle of the Sphinx and the deadlines by which it is generally possible to answer it. The Riddle of the Sphinx is the question that puts man moving towards the understanding of his own humanity, and therefore, in this sense, the metaphysical center around which every civilization historically implements its self-understanding, makes up and perceives the image of its own place in the world and assesses the nature and extent of its own contradictions. That is why Bateson thought of primary importance that our answer to the Riddle of the Sphinx was “in accordance with the current functioning of living systems” and that contemporary science undertook to devote all its resources to build and defend the reasons for this agreement and this fragile as necessary consistency.

The Riddle of the Sphinx is the place where every culture faces and solves - or sometimes leaves unspoken and hidden - the problem of fundamental epistemology (in the meaning this word is characterized by Bateson), and so it is easily recognizable as the implicit content of all those forms of knowledge that play a somehow foundational role in human civilization, such as religion or art. But, more specifically, what is the question which it is placed and is likely to grow in importance as radical for the purpose of considering that mankind in general has of itself and of its relations with what we call “the world” ? The question is, according to Bateson, - as has already been partially anticipated at the end of the previous chapter - that of the relationship existing between ‘mind’ and ‘body’.

The problem of the mind/body relationship is the necessarily preliminary stress which, according to Bateson, each activity carried out from inquiring of science refers to. At the same time, it is also the only authentic interface that connects knowledge arising in the body of the more and more distinct and not communicating traditions of human work. In fact, the set of ideas that, in the fields of science, art, religion or politics, are to play a role somewhat analogous to that an epistemological framework always finds its first roots and its ultimate reference in this problem. To the extent that these ideas, on the one hand, are necessarily influenced in their appearance and in their structure from the initial understanding of the mind / body relationship and, on the other hand, contribute indirectly and constantly to redefine the meaning and consideration of this relationship, they inevitably interact validating each other or each other giving rise to more or less significant and disturbing contradictions.

Conversely to what happens in the epistemological constitution of human cultural systems, even in the system of ideas woven from Gregory Bateson, the problem of the mind / body relationship has the character of a hub and a unifying axis between the various regions that comprise his interest as a scientist and thinker. We can indeed say that, precisely because of the fact that every question raised by Bateson in the various fields in which his research ranged (from anthropology to psychiatry, from epistemology to ontology) was always a question having in mind that one and the same question, his thinking ultimately realized his original aspiration to build itself as a local subsystem of the larger system of ideas that binds the human culture and the biosphere itself, of which it was able to reproduce the internal consistency, epistemological constraints and necessary features, as well as the unmistakable grace.

It is good to clarify that the problem of the mind / body relationship, as it is conceived by Bateson, does not coincide with the problem of the relationship between _our_ mind and _our_ body. This specific theme is accepted in reflection only as it exemplifies the sense of a problem that is instead thought of in terms much broader and more inclusive.

The question asking about the mind / body relationship is actually a question that asks about the connections that bind the abstract ideational and organizational components of reality to its material substrate. Only as such it is a question that brings together the foundation of any possible investigation directed to any of the aspects of the being and has the dignity of the initial query and foundational knowledge. Of whatever nature the relationship of knowledge that binds man to his environment, it can never avoid to face the need to provide an explanation to some extent understandable of the way in which concrete elements and tangible things in the world that is around us interact with abstractions, and of how forms and ideas come to determine the behavior of matter. For this reason, the effort to make the ‘mental’ with ‘corporeal’ coexist in understanding is the problematic basis on which every tradition of knowledge and the epistemological self-building of every civilization rest on.

In an attempt to demonstrate the importance that this kind of question has historically played in the determination of the fundamental characteristics of cultures, Bateson compares the contents and structure of creation myths of ancient religions, highlighting the fact that - despite the interpretations within which they were subsequently imprisoned - their most authentic content is in close relation with the initial problem of the mind / body relationship and that religion is, in general, a form of knowledge developed almost for the purpose of protecting and preserving the answer with respect to this problem peoples have historically developed. This comparison is significant in the context of a discussion that tries to explain how at the origin of the systemic crisis of our civilization there is a concern relating to this question, that there is an explosion of a conflict between the epistemological assumptions on which traditionally it our vision of the world was ruled and the structural needs of the biological nature of it. The discussion also indicates to contemporary science the task of finding a solution to this conflict as its most urgent and important task.

Bateson writes:

“Consider, for example, the central origin myth of Judaeo-Christian peoples. What are the fundamental philosophic and scientific problems with which this myth is concerned?

In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.

And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.

And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so. And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.

And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so. And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.

Authorized version

Out of these first ten verses of thunderous prose, we can draw some of the premises or fundamentals of ancient Chaldean thought and it is strange, almost eerie, to note how many of the fundamentals and problems of modern science are foreshadowed in the ancient document. (1) The problem of the origin and nature of matter is summarily dismissed. (2) The passage deals at length with the problem of the origin of order. (3) A separation is thus generated between the two sorts of problem. It is possible that this separation of problems was an error, but—error or not—the separation is maintained in the fundamentals of modern science. The conservative laws for matter and energy are still separate from the laws of order, negative entropy, and information.  
(4) Order is seen as a matter of sorting and dividing. But the essential notion in all sorting is that some difference shall cause some other difference at a later time. If we are sorting black balls from white balls, or large balls from small balls, a difference among the balls is to be followed by a difference in their location—balls of one class to one sack and balls of another class to another. For such an operation, we need something like a sieve, a threshold, or, par excellence, a sense organ. It is understandable, therefore, that a perceiving Entity should have been invoked to perform this function of creating an otherwise improbable order.  
(5) Closely linked with the sorting and dividing is the mystery of classification, to be followed later by the extraordinary human achievement of naming.

It is not at all clear that the various components of this myth are all products of inductive reasoning from experience. And the mat-ter becomes still more puzzling when this origin myth is compared with others which embody different fundamental premises.

Among the Iatmul of New Guinea, the central origin myth, like the Genesis story, deals with the question of how dry land was separated from water. They say that in the beginning the crocodile Kavwokmali paddled with his front legs and with his hind legs; and his paddling kept the mud suspended in the water. The great culture hero, Kevembuangga, came with his spear and killed Kavwokmali. After that the mud settled and dry land was formed. Kevembuangga then stamped with his foot on the dry land, i.e., he proudly demonstrated ‘that it was good.’

Here there is a stronger case for deriving the myth from experience combined with inductive reasoning. After all, mud does re-main in suspension if randomly stirred and does settle when the stir-ring ceases. Moreover, the Iatmul people live in the vast swamps of the Sepik River valley where the separation of land from water is imperfect. It is understandable that they might be interested in the differentiation of land from water.

In any case, the Iatmul have arrived at a theory of order which is almost a precise converse of that of the book of Genesis. In Iatmul thought, sorting will occur if randomization is prevented. In Genesis, an agent is invoked to do the sorting and dividing.

But both cultures alike assume a fundamental division between the problems of material creation and the problems of order and differentiation.”46

Of the many and extraordinary ideas and suggestions that it would be possible to draw from this beautiful page of anthropology (which for understandable reasons it was necessary to quote in full), we limit ourselves here to discuss those most relevant to our reasoning.

It is useful to insist - also on the basis of reported speech - that the problem of the mind/body relationship is never reduced by Bateson to the theme of the relationship between the human body and his mind, so that the intellectual thickness of his meditation stands out and away from the work of many of his followers or the content of certain debates that currently hold court at some pseudo-scientific environments.

The mind/body question is the issue that involves the essential relationship that must exist between the formal (or abstract) components and the material components of reality as such. In this sense it is a purely ontological issue attacked by Bateson at the crossing point between his experiences of empirical scientific research and his path of epistemological reflection. Anyway, it is the connotation itself of the concept of “mind” made by Bateson to strictly impose this approach to the problem.

The mind / body relationship, so considered, is the authentic content of the basic knowledge that is expressed in science, as well as in religion and in other dominant regions of the human culture. With it the tradition of many civilizations on the planet has paid a dualistic interpretation essentially based on the recognition of a dissociation between two dimensional planes of the being and, at the same time, on the unaware misunderstanding of the complex nexus of integration that exists between them as well. This kind of interpretation is at the origin of epistemological confusion and systemic crisis that our society is going through: to correct its character in a markedly monistic way must be the task of the thought and knowledge of our age.

Which way, according to Bateson, can you access this new integrated rather than dualistic interpretation of the relationship and interaction between the ‘mental’ and the ‘corporeal’? In part this question has already been answered. The previously considered formal redefinition of the concept of ‘mind’, in fact, plays a role in this regard as an absolutely essential conceptual tool. Only through a different - more abstract and more rigorous – assumption of the category of ‘mental system’, and then through an innovative assessment of the ‘holistic’ properties of these systems, Bateson believes that we can tackle the task of an epistemologically correct apprehension of those events and phenomena in which the complex interpenetration of material needs and immanent abstractions becomes primarily evident.

Therefore let us reconstruct the main steps taken by Bateson toward a monistic solution of the mind / body problem by examining just the way he sets the analysis of three of these particular categories of phenomena: the aesthetic experience; the experience of the sacred; the manifestation and dissolution of individual consciousness.

**4.1 The holistic properties of mental systems.**

Before passing on to the way in which Bateson rereads in the prospect of a new monistic epistemology, the themes of the beauty, the sacred and the consciousness, it is necessary to clarify the terms under which he strictly defines and uses the concept of ‘holism’, in order to clear up some misunderstandings of our discussion in which some contemporary literature could make us incur. Bateson himself was very aware of the fact that the category of ‘holistic properties’ was in need of a precise conceptual connotation that evades the mystification of “the preacher, the hypnotist, therapist and missionary”47. As he wrote in the last years of his life:

47 It is worth quoting in full a poem published in_Angels Fear_, 5, which makes clear the way Bateson sees its cultural legacy and the dangers to which it is necessarily exposed. Title of poem is_The manuscript_: “So there it is in words / Precise / And if you read between the lines / You will find nothing there / For that is the discipline I ask / Not more, not less / Not the world as it is / Nor ought to be - / Only the precision / The skeleton of truth / I do not dabble in emotion / Hint at implications / Evoke the ghosts of old forgotten creeds / All that is for the preacher / The hypnotist, therapist and missionary / They will come after me / And use the little that I said / To bait more traps / For those

“ ‘Holistic’ is a popular word today, occurring most often in phrases like ‘holistic medicine,’ referring to a multitude of views and practices, ranging from homeopathy to acupuncture, from hypnosis to psychedelics, from the laying of hands to the cultivation of the alpha rhythms, from Hinduism to Zen, from the bedside manner to the ultimate depersonalization of diagnosis by astrological typing. And so on.

Men have hoped for holistic solutions for a long time. The word itself goes back to Smuts in the 1920s and is defined in the OSD as ‘the tendency in nature to produce wholes from the ordered grouping of units’. The systematic thinking that makes it possible to give precise, formal, and nonsupernatural meaning to the word goes back to the nineteenth century. It is there we find the early contributors to this thinking about wholes and to the formal relations between information and organization, including Claude Bernard (the ‘milieu interieur’), Clerk Maxwell (his ‘demon’ and his analysis of the steam engine with a governor, 1870), Russel Wallace (natural selection, 1858), and a man of special interest to doctors – the 'Old Doctor' Dr Andrew Still. Old Still was the founder of osteopathic medicine. In the late nineteenth century, he got the idea that the pathologies of the body could be due to disruption of what we today call communication – that the inner physiological organization of the body could be a matter of message transport and that the spinal cord was the principal clearinghouse through which all messages had to pass. He argued that by manipulation of the spine it should be possible to cure all pathologies. He went a little crazy, I think, as men do who have ideas a hundred years too soon. He came to believe that his ideas would cover not only the may defects whose focus indeed is related to the spine, its postures and its messages, but also that similar theories could be applied to bacterial invasions and so on. This got him into trouble, but still and all, he was an early_holist_in precisely the sense in which I want to use the word.

”48  
who cannot bear / The lonely / Skeleton / of Truth”.

48 GREGORY BATESON, M.C. BATESON,_Angels Fear,_179

This passage contains some very important assertions to understand Bateson's use of the concept of ‘holism’ and its implications in contemporary scientific debate.

As it is written in the Glossary published as an appendix to almost all his works and collections of writings, ‘holism’ is defined as “the tendency in nature to produce from the ordered grouping of parts complex wholes with properties that are not present in or predictable from the separate parts”, and its adjective ‘holistic’ refers to “modes of acting and observing that are attentive to holistic properties.” Defined in this way it becomes the key concept to be able to interpret, without recourse to supernatural explanations or crude reductionist positions, all those phenomena that show a complex integration of matter and abstract components.

If you accept the idea that a system - as such - always has properties greater than the sum of the properties of its parts, then there is no need to resort to mechanistic and spiritualist extremism to set a comprehension of such events as the functions of a living cell, the intelligent behavior of an organism or the aesthetic attitude of men, because all these realities appear as epiphenomenal properties of particularly complex mental systems.

Bateson writes:

“I want to suggest that the word 'holistic' has taken on an almost new and much more precise meaning since World War II, and that this new and precise meaning gives hope of a deep revision of occidental culture. It is becoming clear that the mysterious phenomena we associate with ―mind‖ have to do with certain characteristics of systems that have only rather lately come within the purview of science. These include:  
- The characteristics of circular and self-corrective systems,  
- The combination of such systems with information processing,  
- The ability of living things to store energy (I use the word in its ordinary physical sense – ergs, foot-pounds, calories, etc), so that a change in some sense organ (the receipt of news of a difference) may trigger the release of stored energy.

There are a few other points that go to make up the new ways of thinking about purpose, adaptation, pathology, and, in brief, life, and these are being explored in the fields of cybernetics, information theory, systems theory, and so on. But here I want to call attention to a condition of our time – that as the conventional ways of thinking about mind and life collapse, new ways of thinking about these matters are becoming available  
– not only to ivory-tower philosophers but also to practitioners and to the ‘man in the street.’ Historically, the new developments, which became conspicuous in Word War II and the period following, have almost totally altered everything that we say and think about mental process and about the body-mind as a total, living, self-correcting, and self-destroying entity. Cybernetics in its widest sense is, so far as I know, the only serious beginning of thinking about wholes in any formal way.

If we approach the phenomena of mind with these new tools, then genetics and the whole determination of shape and growth – that which determines the symmetry of your face, with an eye on each side of a nose  
– all of that which is steered by message material from DNA – can be recognized as a part of the mental organization of the body. A part of the _holism_. If, the, we pose the double question,_‘What is a man that he may recognize disease or disruption or ugliness?’_and _‘What is disease or disruption or ugliness that a man may know it?’_the new ways of thinking provide a bridging answer, in the assertion that a self-recursive communication system may be aware of disruption of its own function. It may have pain and many other types of awarenesses. It may also be aware or harmony in its own function and that awareness may become the basis for awe and an awareness of beauty in the larger and more inclusive system.”49

Here we find already the core argument of the discussions that will be developed later.  
It is very important to note, finally, that the question concerning the notion of ‘holism’ is posed by Bateson in explicit connections with the theory of mental systems, and thus with the problem of the mind/body relationship of and the epistemological crisis of our civilization. The fundamental belief that moves Bateson is that

“It should now be possible to find a more stable theoretical stance. We need such a stance to limit the excesses both of the materialists and these who flirt with the supernatural. And further, we need a revised philosophy and epistemology to reduce the intolerance that divides the two camps. ‘_A plague on both your houses!’_Mercutio exclaims as he dies.

49 GREGORY BATESON, M.C. BATESON,_Angels Fear,_180-181

And I assert that we know enough today to expect that this improved stance will be unitary, and that the conceptual separation between ‘mind’ and ‘matter’ will be seen to be a by-product of – a spin-off from –_an insufficient holism_. When we focus too narrowly upon the parts, we fail to see the necessary characteristics of the whole, and are then tempted to ascribe the phenomena which result from wholeness to some supernatural entity.”50

On the basis of this rigorous intellectual tool Bateson developed his original interpretation of the issues relating to beauty, the sacred and the nature of individual ego.

**4.2 Epistemology of the beautiful.**

The research Bateson carried out around the problem of the nature of aesthetic experience - as well as those he carried out about the meaning of the sacred and of religious knowledge, and the limitations of the concept of ‘consciousness’ - actually offer insights so wide as to be legitimately objects of specific meditations and essays. The way I deal with here, however, is consciously approximate and synthetic. Recall, in fact, that the purpose of this work is not to provide an exhaustive exposition of Bateson's point of view on each of the many issues with which he came in contact, but it is, much more modestly, to suggest the possibility to see through the cracks of his complicated intellectual legacy the features of a ‘different thinking,’ an ontological position that is essentially innovative relating to prevailing Western metaphysical tradition.

The consideration of the problems related to the aesthetic experience is not developed by Bateson in a unified and organic way. Rather, it is left to a series of assertions and observations we find in all his production, according to the tested method of “keeping a little bit of everything everywhere,” without ever worrying about running out or leading to systematic fulfillment of any of the themes that he held under his reflection.

The first thing you are required to think about the problem of aesthetics is the already discussed distinction between Pleroma and Creatura. The phenomena of artistic creation, production and recognition of the beauty in fact represent an area of experience that undoubtedly privileges Creatural ways of thinking. A work of art is, by Bateson, the outcome of mental process just like “the conch or the crab or the human body.”

“The thought that enters into its creation generally involves multiple cycles of self-correction, repeated testing and listening, correcting and editing. Sometimes we may see the results of calibration in the swift curve drawn by the practiced hand of the Zen master, as sure as the hawk stooping to its prey after eons of evolution. [...] Every work of art depends on a complexity of internal relations and can be seen as another in that family of examples that can be looked at to understand 'the pattern which connects' and the nature of Creatura.”51

The beauty of an artwork, just like the beauty of living organisms, is such because it can be seen as an epiphenomenal sign of a complex mental system which works (ie_thinks_) in an integrated, circular, self-correcting way and which is able to tirelessly restore the conditions of its internal balance. Such a system - a system that is able to create art or to express beauty - always gives rise, according to Bateson, to stochastic processes, namely processes that are the outcome of the combined action of deterministic and epigenetic components with random components.

Insofar Creatural realities are all characterized by such holistic properties, it is clear that the aesthetic attitude is no longer something that only covers the narrow experience of man, but it is rather a sphere of phenomena that puts human experience in close relationship of affinity and correspondence with what happens in the whole world of the biological and mental process. In this sense, the epistemology that supports the understanding of aesthetic reality is necessarily a _monistic_ epistemology in a double meaning: because through the assumption of the ideas of ‘self-correcting system’ and ‘mental process’ it unifies in its explanatory model material factors and abstract factors; and because it may be seen as a possible starting point to overcome the traditional view of the specificity of the human condition as separate and opposed to the rest of nature and to affirm the essential epistemological and ontological unity of the living world.

Aesthetics is one of the fundamental modes of internal organization of the organisms of Creatura and at the same time, it is their mutual relation. For this reason the knowledge that develops around it (the knowledge accumulated by those who create art, the knowledge in general responsible for the recognition of the beauty and the same knowledge that comes from the reflection that takes place around this kind of problems) undergoes the conditioning of all those epistemological patterns that filter and establish our relationship with reality and, in equal measure, contributes to validate or modify its essential aspects. Knowledge that deals with aesthetic problems cannot therefore be separated from knowledge that deals with the behavior, because it is intimately linked to the processes by which we build the image of ourselves and of our place in the world.

“ It may be, however, that the dichotomy between moral and aesthetic is a by-product of the premise of mind/body division or of the similar division between consciousness and the remainder of mind. Certainly occidental people expect to be more aware of and more articulate about moral judgments than about aesthetic. We say,_‘de gustibus non est disputandum'_as though the aesthetic were no suitable subjects for doubt or scientific analysis. And yet we agree that some people, more skilled in this matters than others, are able to contrive objects or sounds which those others can agree are beautiful.

We know little of what makes some teachers, some political leaders, some gardeners, some psychotherapists, some animal trainers, and some aquarium keepers great. We say vaguely that these skills depend upon_art_ rather than science. Perhaps there is a scientific truth behind this metaphor.

We know virtually nothing about the processes whereby a baseball pitcher computes his action or whereby a cat estimates her jump to catch a mouse. But it is certain that these computations are_not_done the way an engineer would do them: the cat and the pitcher do not use the differential calculus.”52

The real core of aesthetic experience is for Bateson the ability for a mental organism of a certain complexity to_recognize_the characteristics of its own deeper systemic organization in _other_mental systems. On this basis, the aesthetic expertise is basically the skill to use ideas derived from perceiving your own internal organizational model as the "central metaphor" in reference to which you build your relationship with the world.

“ If it be true that certain people are specially gifted in the art of acting upon complex systems with homeostatic or ecological characteristics, and that these people do not operate by spelling out the interaction of all relevant variables, then these people must use some inner ecology of ideas as an analogic model. (By ‘ideas’ I mean thoughts, premises, affects, perceptions of self, etc.)

But if this skill is, in some sense, really an ‘art’, then it is possible that the inner ‘ecology of ideas’ is a close synonym of what might also be called _aesthetic sensibility_.”53

Of course, as the aesthetic skills has an intimate connection to the problem of recognizing systemic integration, its proper exerting can become one of the avenues for reasserting, at the epistemological bottom of our civilization, the awareness of the monistic nature of the world we belong to and a no more confrontational and antagonistic vision of our

52 GREGORY BATESON,_A Sacred Unity_, 255

53 GREGORY BATESON,_A Sacred Unity_, 256

relationship with the being.

The meditation on the aesthetics set by Bateson thus becomes a tool used to explicitly raise the issue of our initial and foundational reference to the essence of beings and to the _ethos_that necessarily arises from this reference. Gracefully writes our author:

“ [...] I shall argue that the very nature and purpose of art and poetry is to exemplify the creativity of mind and that this is the appropriate fundamental theorem for a science of aesthetics. In creativity, mind is brought together, and this integration is a close synonym of ‘beauty’. Wordsworth mocks that, to ‘Peter Bell’,

A primrose by a river’s brim A yellow primrose was to him, And it was nothing more.

To the poet, the primrose can be something more. I suggest that this something more is, in fact, a more self-reflexive recognition. The primrose resembles a poem and both poem and primrose resemble the poet. He learns about himself as a creator when he looks at the primrose. His pride is enhanced to see himself as a contributor to the vast processes which the primrose exemplifies.

And his humility is exercised and made valid by recognizing himself as a tiny product of those processes. Even within his own living, his conscious self is little more than a middleman, a publisher and retailer of the poems.

[...] the creative filter between us and the world, is always and inevitably there. This it is to be both creature and creator. This the poet knows much better than the biologist.”54

54 GREGORY BATESON,_A Sacred Unity_, 263-264

**4.3 Epistemology of the sacred.**

If the epistemology of aesthetic facts seems to be closely connected with the idea that certain mental systems are able to perceive and recognize their own internal systemic organization, the epistemology of those experiences that arise in the context of singular things we call ‘the sacred’ revolves around the idea instead of the special type of relationship that, in general, necessarily constrain_the part_to_the whole_.

Since the reflections on the nature and significance of the sacred are perhaps the most problematic and difficult to manage heritage of Bateson’s, and because he himself seems to consider these observations particularly relevant, especially in last writings, it is necessary to address the issue by adopting the same measures of methodological caution taken by our author.

Bateson was perfectly aware that this is the only territory “where even the angels fear to tread”, and that there is no way to approach it with the vehemence or anxiety typical of those who want summarily resolve in a few rigidly defined concepts the thickness of the problematic issue, perhaps to draw from such a solution tools and techniques to manipulative acting. He knows also that the role historically played by religion in our civilization (largely associated with the experiences of intolerance, obscurantism and violence) and the language by which we are traditionally used to deal with these questions inevitably are likely to affect the very meaning of reflections he developed and to seal off access to the chance of thinking about the sacred and religion in radically renewed terms.

Any statement made in this area of things is always and only a problem. Any issue you are able to reach through thinking about this kind of assertions is always necessarily partial and provisional. This is the kind of discipline to which the reasoning of Bateson (and in general of every great thinker) constantly invites us.

Proceeding, however, in a consciously reductive way (and therefore to some extent necessarily in a risky and inadequate way), let us now summarize the main observations that Bateson inferred from the interpretation of certain places (of literature, wisdom and experience) traditionally associated with religion and the sacred. According to Bateson:

1. the experience of the sacred is generally linked to the recognition sudden and not searched – of the_biological nature_of the world to which we belong;

2. it is in some way connected with the idea that it is necessary _not to communicate_something in certain circumstances;  
3. the sacred has always an _integral_dimension and its most striking feature is the ease with which this dimension may be _disturbed or compromised_;  
4. the idea of the sacred is radically and fundamentally opposed to the idea of ‘conscious purpose;’  
5. knowledge of religions preserves the awareness of the constraints and necessary epistemological rules on which rests the functioning of the great environmental ecosystems and those complex interaction systems that are human communities;  
6. knowledge of religions reflect in its intimate constitution the characteristics of the sacred, in particular its dependence on the need not to communicate some informations to avoid compromising the integrity of the whole;  
7. the way of conceiving the ideas of ‘god’, the ‘sacrament’ and the nature of religious experience strongly influences the way we relate the reality as a whole;  
8. the theology of the ‘personal god’, with its idea of a creator separated from his creation and a purposeful order immanent in the world is the implicit model of each dualistic position as well as the metaphysical root of each provocative and manipulative attitude to the Being. All these observations are not taken simply as the outcome of an acute anthropological intuition and left to the status of more or less empirical thoughts, but are instead made the subject of an attempt to a formal and rigorous explanation carried out through the use of the conceptual tools of cybernetics and systems theory.  
Thus, for example, the bond between the sacred and the need not to communicate is read in relation to the problem of how the information propagates within complex systems. The debate is Bateson:

“What is it that men and women hold sacred? Are there perhaps processes in the working of all living systems such that, if news or information of these processes reaches other parts of the system, the working together of the whole will be paralyzed or disrupted? ”55

And elsewhere:

“If we think of information as traveling in a network of trains of cause and effect, does it then become possible for us to describe in some formal way how any given message is located in the network and thence to identify which (even ‘true’) messages should not - for the sake of the whole system  
- be located where? ”56

The interpretation of this aspect of the experience of the sacred in relation to issues that affect the circuital organization of mental systems would pave the way for asking in another passage, the question whether it is necessary to add to the criteria already identified to describe the formal structure of ‘mind’ an additional criterion: the need that in mental process the information should be distributed unevenly among the interacting parts. The remarkable thing about this part of Bateson’s argument is that, through explanatory models derived from cybernetics, he determines the opportunity to discuss in a non-allusive or suggestive way, but rigorously and formally issues that relate to the nature of not-knowing and secrecy , that is, of what in religion is generally called and known as the ‘mystery’.

This type of investigative procedure is adopted for each of the issues Bateson raises about the sacred and religion. Placed in a position of equidistance between the lineal unilateral and therefore unsustainable opinions of spiritualism (which makes a rational and not-imaginative discussion and understanding of the reality of the sacred virtually impossible) and materialism (which solves the complex and problematic phenomena linked to religious experience essentially by denying them in their consistency and their actual meaning), Bateson’s analysis has the merit of addressing traditionally far from science issues by employing the very tools of advanced and rigorous science, even if renewed in its epistemological basis. It states tersely a_monistic_viewpoint, which is able to correspond the complexity of the real by matching in the explanation mechanical needs and formal principles of organization, and by refusing any dualistic separation between material and immaterial.

55 GREGORY BATESON,_Angels fear_, 81

But the very core of Bateson’s theoretical reflection about the nature of the sacred lies within the idea that when a ‘mental body’ makes a religious experience what happens to him is actually to discover that his individuality is not in any way separate from the world around, and to recognize that he is only a part of a system with mental characteristics far more vast and complex and to change, for this recognition, the perception of its own identity and its place.

“What has been said so far can be read as argument or evidence for the reality of very large mental systems, systems of ecological size and larger, within which the mentality of the single human being is a subsystem. These large mental systems are characterized by, among other things, constraints on the transmission of information between their parts. Indeed, we can argue from the circumstance that some information should not reach some locations in large, organized systems to assert the _real_ nature of these systems – to assert the existence of that whole whose integrity would be threatened by inappropriate communication. By the word ‘real’ in this context, I mean simply that it is_necessary for explanation_to think in terms of organizations of this size, attributing to these systems the characteristics of mental process (as defined by the criteria listed in chapter 2). But it is one thing to claim that this is necessary and not surprising and quite another to go on to say, however vaguely, what sort of mind such a vast organization might be. What characteristics would such minds expectably show? Are they, perhaps, the sort of thing that men have called gods? The great theistic religions of the world have ascribed many sorts of mentality to the highest gods, but almost invariably their characteristics have been derived from human models. Gods have been variously imagined as loving, vengeful, capricious, long-suffering, patient, impatient, cunning, incorruptible, bribable, childish, elderly, masculine, feminine, sexy, sexless, and so on. What mental characteristics are to be expected in any large mental system or mind, the basic premises of whose character shall coincide with what we claim to know of cybernetics and systems theory? Starting from these premises, we surely cannot arrive at a lineal, billiard-ball materialism. But what sort of religion we shall develop is not clear. Will the vast organized system have free will? Is the ―God‖capable of humor? Deceit? Error? Mental pathology? Can such a God perceive beauty? Or ugliness? What events or circumstances can impinge upon this God‘s sense organs ? Are there indeed organs of sense in such a system? And limitations of threshold? And attention? Is such a God capable of failure? Frustration? And, finally, consciousness? The great historical religions of the world have either answered such questions without pausing to note that these are questions that permit more than one answer, or they have obscured the matter under a mass of dogma and devotion. To ask such questions may indeed disturb faith, so that the questions themselves might seem to define a region where angels would appropriately fear to tread. ”57

Without dwelling on all the possible implications of Bateson’s reasoning and on all its internal development, let us stress the fact that redefining the very concepts of ‘god’ and ‘the sacred’ apart from the traditional Creator-creature dialectic and anchoring them to the issue of recognition fabric regularity and structural constraints on which rests the proper functioning of immanent mental systems of ecological dimensions and of the relationship between the ‘whole system’ to the various 'local systems', it means the possibility of preparing a radical innovation of the epistemological basis deep in our way of thinking and putting us in touch with the world.

The challenge Bateson intends to launch is to recognize among the most advanced scientific discoveries of our time, a number of fundamental principles kept in some of the epistemological components of traditional religions and make them the basis for a rapprochement between these two regions of knowledge, for the purpose of establishing a new integrated and monistic vision of reality and knowledge. Mainly because of this intent, therefore, the reflection on the sacred is one of the most significant theoretical places where evidently the decisive change of reference to the ontological dimension of reality - which entire Bateson's thinking seems geared toward – prepares to arise.

**4.4 The boundaries of ‘Self’.**

The third problematic junction around which the possibility of a monistic approach of the mind/body relationship outlines is the nature and meaning of what we mean by the notion of ‘Self’ or ‘individual consciousness’. Also in this case the amplitude of the themes that Bateson raised in reference to this problem is such that our discourse necessarily must be turned into a concise summary. It is, again, to retrace the central places of Bateson's thinking in order to show its relevance to the more general question of the ontological dimension of this thought.

The arguments around the aesthetic experience and the experience of the sacred have shown that from the point of view of a strictly monistic epistemology it is possible to developed an explanation of phenomena in which the mixture of material and immaterial reaches extraordinary levels of complexity by interpreting them as epiphenomenal properties of systems that possess 'mental' organizational and procedural characteristics. The basic hypothesis is that such a system may include within its spontaneous abilities the skill to recognize the pattern of its own internal organization in other systems in some way similar to it, and to recognize itself as a part (or a subsystem ) of a system with similar characteristics but of enormously larger dimensions.

In the same terms arises, according to Bateson, the problem of ‘consciousness’. It is quite reasonable (and explainable by the conceptual tools of cybernetics and systems theory) that a mental system, which has achieved a remarkable degree of organizational complexity, can manifest among its properties even something like a self-conscious feeling or that intricate web of ideas and perceptions which we call ‘Self’.

Bateson knows that such an interpretation of the reality of those phenomena that refer to a ‘conscience’ first forces to revise our most traditional and deep-rooted ideas about the boundaries and limitations of the individual mind system.

“The basic rule of systems theory is that, if you want to understand some phenomenon or appearance, you must consider that phenomenon within the context of all_completed_circuits which are relevant to it. The emphasis is on the concept of the completed communicational circuit and implicit in the theory is the expectation that all units containing completed circuits will show mental characteristics. The mind, in other words, is immanent in the circuitry. We are accustomed to thinking of the mind as somehow contained within the skin of an organism, but the circuitry is_not_contained within the skin.

Consider the case of a man felling a tree with an ax. Each stroke of the ax must be corrected for the state of the cut face of the tree after each chip flies. In other words, the system which shows mental characteristics is the whole circuit from the tree to the man’s sense organs, through his brain to his muscles and the ax, and back to the tree. This is not the unit which psychologists are accustomed to considering but it is the unit which systems theory will force them to consider.

Very little thought will show that this change in relevance from thinking of man versus tree to thinking of man as part of a circuit that includes the tree will change our ideas of the nature of the self, the nature of power, responsibility, and so on.

It might even lead the human race to a sort of wisdom that would preclude the wanton destruction of our biological environment and preclude some of the very peculiar attitudes we exhibit toward patients, foreigners, minorities, our spouses, and our children - and even each other.”58

If consciousness is an epiphenomenal property of mental individual systems, and if the boundaries of this system do not coincide with those that we are used to assign, ie do not coincide with either the brain or the body of the individual, nor are able to be in any case rigidly fixed, then something fundamental in the way we perceive ourselves and practice the world is shaken and questioned: the dualism between ‘subject’ and ‘object’ which, even in its strictest interpretation, has been assumed throughout the Modern Age as one of the pillars of the epistemology of our civilization. Again, Bateson’s meditation shows to be aimed at those fundamental metaphysical positions which unconsciously lead our thinking in his reference to Being of beings, and to language, as the place of its actual constitution and self-validation.

“[...] the whole of language, as we are accustomed to using it, assumes that you can talk about ‘this’, and the uses of ‘this’, and the single purposes, and given the effect of ‘this’, and so forth and so forth. And right center of saying things of that kind is our use of the first person pronoun, ‘I’. [...] When you use the word ‘I’, what really do you mean in terms of a language which would be acceptable, not so much to Buddhism, but just to ordinary natural science? What is this entity, ‘I’, ‘you’, ‘me’? Well, we mean one end of an interaction, yes? One end of a lot of interactions. ‘I’, at the moment, ‘am’. If you make a diagram of the room, I’m that which you can’t see inside of, and this differentiates me. In a sense, my existence is demonstrated by my opacity.

If you could see what is happening in all my nerve fibers and all my inputs and all my outputs, then it wouldn’t be very sensible to draw a line around me and say he is limited there. There is a mass of pathways for messages and information to travel on in this room. [...] They go through the skin. The skin is a pickup affair. It’s not the blind man’s stick. It’s the end of the blind man’s stick, not the stick. The stick is the pathway it goes along. Where does the blind man begin? Can we cut him off halfway up the stick? But you are cutting the line of communication when you cut there. The rule for any sort of systems theory is to draw around the lines of communication, as far as you can. Of course, there aren’t any isolated systems, really.

So that we arrive, as we push this at a world which is very unlike the world represented by ordinary language [...] ”59

From all that we have quoted it is clear that Bateson’s reflection about the nature of consciousness and the notion of 'self' can be interpreted as an argument against substantialist positions of science and, more generally, against the metaphysics of subjectity from which it seems to arise “the pathology of wrong thinking in which we all live”60. So, in this sense, especially along with the arguments set out about the sacred and aesthetics, it is one of the main places where the work of Bateson takes on an ontological connotation.

But, as we have previously argued, it also plays the role of _an interface_, thanks to which the epistemological and ontological problems are placed in close contact with the ethical one. It is common ground that a different assumption of the meaning and reality of consciousness necessarily implies a profound change in our view of life and death.

Not account for all the many observations made by Bateson in this sense, we simply express the two main ideas on which he built his thinking in this area.

The first idea is that consciousness is by its very nature to produce and feed those purposive / appetitive attitudes which in general involve at each epistemologically dualistic position and are the implicit model of the technique, in its draft manipulation of the beings. Bateson writes:

“ [...] conscious-purpose very rapidly becomes destructive. ‘Purpose’ is a very dangerous concept. Consciousness, I don’t know. [...] The trouble with consciousness is that in the nature of the case it focuses in. There is something that they call the ‘screen of consciousness’, and this to me is almost a mechanical analogy. We receive the products of our mental activities, the _resources/books//Ontology of Complexity_ A Reading of Grego - Gianfranco Savino, but the creation of those _resources/books//Ontology of Complexity_ A Reading of Grego - Gianfranco Savino is beyond us. It is an extraordinary and miraculous process. It is a beautiful process. But what in the end I am conscious of is a subtraction from the totality and the totality cannot be reported to consciousness. The more you have to report to consciousness the more machinery it requires to operate the whole thing, and soon the head gets bigger than the body and then the head has the problem of reporting on itself and it has to get bigger than herself. Consciousness is always going to be selective. When you get the other two, the sacred and the aesthetic, which are very closely related, you are partly standing off to see a whole. Consciousness is tending to focus in, whereas notions like the sacred and the beautiful always tend to be always looking for the larger, the whole. That is why I distrust consciousness as a prime guide. ”61

The second idea concerns the way a renewed consideration of consciousness can change our relationship with death. Constantly in the course of his work, Bateson has shown to be absolutely convinced that the problem of death plays an essential significance in the epistemological construction of all civilizations and in the fundamental perception that every man experiences of himself, of his own existence and his relationship with the world. Long pages of his last essays are devoted to the way his personal experience as a terminal cancer patient has contributed to a restructuring of deep levels of his own personal epistemology (an experience in some ways similar to what the Buddhists call_enlightenment_or_awakening_) and has allowed him access to a not more and not only traditionally intellectual understanding of problems that occupied him throughout his life as a scientist and thinker.

If what we call ‘self’ is a manifestation of a mental system whose processes and reality are not rigidly circumscribed, if the distinction between ‘subject’ and ‘object’ loses its traditional character and gets rid of the dualistic separation between mind and matter, if a new monistic epistemology allows us to affirm the absolute immanence of mind to matter, and therefore the absolute belonging of man’s consciousness to his body, then the idea of death is emancipated from the old myths and beliefs and the very existence leaves behind every heartache, every neurotic attachment to things, all forms of epistemological panic.

As Bateson wrote elegantly, as if to seal his intellectual journey:

“ And last, there is death. It is understandable that, in a civilization which separates mind from body, we should either try to forget death or to make mythologies about the survival of transcendent mind. But if mind is immanent not only in those pathways of information which are located inside the body but also in external pathways, then death takes on a different aspect. The individual nexus of pathways which I call ‘me’ is no longer so precious because that nexus is only part of a larger mind.

The ideas which seemed to be me can also become immanent in you. May they survive - if true. ”62

### **5 FINAL THOUGHTS**

Throughout the course of the twentieth century Western philosophy has been discovered engaged in a confrontation, in many ways unprecedented, with itself, with the reasons of its own movement and its very survival. The outcome of this comparison seems to be still uncertain and in no way predictable. The perception that in the history of our century something absolutely decisive has been consumed, accompanied, however, all major meditative experiences of this time. And - thus showing that, to some extent, the lessons of Nietzsche and Heidegger were metabolized by our culture - the idea that the internal motility of Western tradition of thought has exhausted, or deployed, or led to its own extreme evolutionary possibilities and that it is somehow necessary to seek an injunction and a new form to thought, may well be regarded as the most authentic inspiration of philosophy in recent decades.

Warning intimately to still be in the middle of the ford, and, echoing a Heidegger’s famous adage, warning that a transition of this magnitude could commit a whole ages of our history, we experience the occupation of philosophy, ie the commitment of those who feel compelled to take on their own era in thought, without being able to rely on the tools and usual places of such employment and, at the same time, without even being able to predict new words that it will be confidential.

In times of crisis and navigation without landing, who can determine in advance where and how will arise the possibility of the new and the initial? Heidegger himself argued (much more in the last years of his life) that the boost to the production of such a possibility would come from fields and forms at all far from those of philosophy, and that, indeed, cybernetics would soon be replaced metaphysics in its traditional role of the founding knowledge.63

In the background of this consideration of cultural issues of our civilization, the intellectual legacy of Gregory Bateson acquires a decidedly and from every point of view not secondary importance.

As it is now clear, the experience of Bateson cannot be considered a philosophical product, neither can it be framed with easiness in any of the categories which we usually use to define the areas of culture. It is rather the very explicit attempt to give rise to a knowledge that is such without further specification, to cross the fields of science, meditation, art, and religion taking away from them all what is useful to the experiment of their courageous and radical integration.

What is the result of this experiment? The extent to which is the experiment successful? What legacy does it leave over us?  
Bateson himself showed to be very polished in this regard, interpreting his work as a reasonable testimony in support of the feasibility of a different, fruitful and not yet beaten, pathway for thought and Western science, but certainly not as the definitive end of such a road. That’s why, ultimately, his way to ask the questions and to build connections and joints between apparently very distant questions remains a lesson entrusted to science as well as religion, philosophy and politics, at a time when these traditions are shocked in their own epistemological foundation and experience an unprecedented need for hearkens to one another and to reshuffle the paradigmatic elements of their identity.  
The reflections developed around the pathologies of contemporary science, the reactivation of certain abandoned or left out spaces of our intellectual heritage, the definition of a new concept of epistemology and new epistemological questions and issues, the monistic setting of the mind / body problem are not separate pieces of an eclectic research, but tightly interrelated explorations, among which, with delicate clarity, emerges the appearance of a thought that thinks in a very non-traditional reference to Being of beings and its meaning.  
In Bateson’s production the essential communality of ontology, epistemology, aesthetics and ethics shows itself so perfectly obvious, and the ontological dimension of meditation penetrates the plane of its ontic event and it is from this, in turn, focused and determined, without this in any way disturbing the elegance and the tenor of his stature.  
The impulse to sprout the seeds that writing and example of Gregory Bateson have left us has already given many successful results. Since the years when he was still alive, his radical point of view had led some intellectuals to make it a real term of distinction, recognition and aggregation inside the rooms professionally engaged in scientific research or cultural debate. There are even movements of opinion which refer explicitly to his thought (or some interpretation of it) and who engage actively in its disclosure.  
Not for us to determine the value and merit of such initiatives. But we can sustain with good reason that, in any case, the attempt to lock the subversive quality of Bateson’s work in some form of organized and completed system of ideas and theories will always be the best way to cheat and remove the original fertility of this work.  
Perhaps it would be more correct to leave innovation brought forward by Gregory Bateson the meaning that it is always to be associated with any major change that is to occur in the history of thought, viz. a necessary possibility “that shakes silently and without consequences all the real and all of reality”64.

### APPENDIX  
GREGORY BATESON’S NOTION OF THE SACRED.

STEPS TOWARDS A POSTMODERN DETERMINATION OF THE ESSENCE OF RELIGION**

*Reprinted from_Atti dell’Accademia di Scienze Morali e Politiche_, vol. CXI, Napoli 2000.

It may be that in the history of the concept of ‘sacred’ has occurred, with the break-in scene of the proposals put forward by Gregory Bateson, what is usually defined as an ‘event’. It is right to be always wary with such assessments, in view of a philosophical research interpreted primarily as a requirement of rigor; but if the transformations of a civilization are eminently the transformations of its essential places (and apprehensiondetermination of the ‘sacred’ is certainly one of these places) and if our civilization has reason to feel itself as basically in the center of a radical transformation, then it is perhaps appropriate to consider that the ‘sacred’ in this era is subjected to deep stresses and its possible transmutations have been to some extent anticipated and recognized (and thus therefore put on the way) in the abstract and powerfully ineffective world of ideas. Now, if this is true, things supported by Bateson in the course of a lifetime devoted to the study of the relations between ‘mental’ and ‘corporeal’ cannot fail to be considered as decisively operating in the sense of that anticipation and recognition.

Why then are we so late to recognize the meditative work of Bateson as central in a debate about the essence of the ‘sacred’ that really wants to be current, viz., that really wants to be in actual relation to the needs of this season of the world? Is there something essential - that concerns the very nature of thinking of Bateson - which prevents the full assumption of the_novum_so obviously produced by his legacy?

Already twenty years have passed since the death of Bateson and the publication (just shortly front) of his most important essay, _Mind and Nature_(1979), and one is not still aware of the reasons why he remains in the context of contemporary knowledge still largely misunderstood. The critical literature which occurred in the meantime around his work has drifted mostly between some moralistic ecologist positions and some naive attempts to promote, through it, the revenge of irrationalism and mysticism on the arid rationality of contemporary technology and science, all in perfect fulfillment of a warning prophecy bequeathed by Bateson himself to those that were to follow:

“So there it is in words / Precise / And if you read between the lines / You will find nothing there / For that is the discipline I ask / Not more, not less / Not the world as it is / Nor ought to be - / Only the precision / The skeleton of truth / I do not dabble in emotion / Hint at implications / Evoke the ghosts of old forgotten creeds / All that is for the preacher / The hypnotist, therapist and missionary / They will come after me / And use the little that I said / To bait more traps / For those who cannot bear / The lonely / Skeleton / of Truth”65

The preachers, the hypnotists, therapists and missionaries in truth flock to the places of an increasingly widespread Batesonian exegesis. But next to them is no less dense the swarm of professional detractors, the officiants of the intellectual establishment who condemn Bateson for his irreconcilable differences, for his talent to express himself with the words of the 'sacred' even in contexts where it is assumed , the ‘sacred’ should be approached only in strict form (viz., in the _rigid_form) of an object to speculative and scientific investigation. These two variants of deception and misunderstanding are precisely united by the lack of discipline, the inability to precision, the inability to remain in the dutiful hesitation of the ‘new’ without rushing with crude violence in the territory of the implications, definitions and peremptory solutions expressed in terms of the already-known, as well as a sensational negligence for the fact that, ultimately, it is the inadequacy of these terms that Bateson’s reflection wants to show.

65 G. BATESON, M.C BATESON,_Angels Fear_, 5

The Batesonian text requires, however, as the only form of rigor, the availability to abandon all that is already settled in the plant of our fundamental epistemology (that is, in the system of premises determining our own reference to the being of the world). And all the more so in places where the word of central inspiration is the ‘'sacred, viz. a word of ambiguity and critical misunderstanding par excellence, a word weighed down by centuries of obscurantism and division as well as by a tremendous potential for ideological manipulation. Subtracted from the tradition of Western metaphysics to the possibility of formal thought and to the knowledge of the sciences, the ‘sacred’ remains unspeakable (for those who aspire to say on the basis of an_initial_rigor) within this tradition itself, and that - more than anything else - means that the text-machine brought into the world by Bateson is unable to work there where the tradition continues to tyrannically perpetrate itself, well beyond the completion (by Nietzsche and Heidegger definitively announced) of its own evolutionary possibilities.

The philosopher cannot but be embarrassed in front of the text of Bateson, to the extent that he is a philosopher just on the basis of an inherited and indestructible desire to retain and defend the safety of the concept from sliding, on the basis of the anxious possibility of its own construction and, therefore, ultimately, the certainty of himself, of his own epistemological identity. For him, that text is inevitably full of stumbling, that is, in the original sense of the word, it is a_scandal_.

The scientist is no less in a crisis in front of the text of Bateson. He recognizes in it the nakedness of the process that is the basis of his own doing as a scientist, but right because of this unveiling he considers it intolerable, an unbearable infringement of his own status. Since he still thinks of himself as a builder of knowing and on this apperception he implants his own role-power, he cannot accept the unveiling of the building process, its revelation as artifice, convention, attempt, and especially as a place of a crisis which is not today concealable. He warns in this operation a fundamental threat to his own personal functioning and, therefore, he reacts almost always in defense of the inviolability of it.

In the face of philosophy and science, Bateson’s adventure (meaning with the word ‘adventure’ to designate a totality prior to the separation of the man from his work) is exactly something _unrecognizable_, a place originally stranger to both, to the extent that they still metaphysically choose to succumb to the needs of their traditional systems.

Indeed, the scientific investigation takes on by Bateson always an “illegal” ontological curvature, which leads him to approach problems which are - under the statute assigned to science by the Modern Age metaphysics – extraneous to science itself. At the same time, philosophical questions are deformed by him through an ontic aggravation leading to languages and informative tools, which are not traditionally frequented, if not neglected at all, by philosophy. Through this movement which constrains them to biunivocal correspondence, philosophy and science are subtracted from Bateson to themselves (well beyond what has ever happened in any so-called philosophy of science), making them as well - in the body of his thought experiment - unrecognizable. The text therefore becomes the space in which actually arises the experiment of the recovery of the initial and lost integration between knowledge and thinking, and it is, in particular, as an area of this original unity - prior, as a possibility, to the occurrence of any metaphysics - that the work of Bateson in his destiny is conditioned by the stretch of its unrecognizability. It is, by necessity, a beginning, the tracing of the boundary of a still almost completely unknown region, whose exploration firmly calls the forces which live as their fundamental situation the fact of completion/exhaustion of all resources of the Western tradition movement, and rejects all those who decline the experience of this fact. And of this opening essence the discourse on the ‘sacred’, more than any other, bears the entire burden.

Even acknowledging that, with respect to the determination of the concept of ‘sacred’ which occurred in the course of anthropological debate of the last one hundred and fifty years, Bateson does not seem to make any relevant changes but seems indeed to take such a determination as a matter of starting, you cannot ignore the fact that the interpretation of this term in reference to a set of problems not previously been placed in relation to it is an interesting intellectual operation.

Bateson was trained as an anthropologist, but it is not from the point of view of a traditional anthropological research that he leads his investigation of the ‘sacred’. That is, there is not in his work any purely descriptive and cataloging study of positive or institutionalized category of the ‘sacred’, nor a search of the motivations that have historically resulted in the variety of human cultures the same formation of the spheres of social objects and events that anthropology generally leads to the ‘sacred’. His research has never been circumscribed by sociological or historiographical criteria and has never had the purpose to reconstruct from an evolutionary viewpoint the genesis of the forms of the religious perhaps by starting from the identification of a temporally and historically most basic species. The materials of the typical anthropological investigation - places, people, times, acts, behaviors, reports and testimonies literary or artistic - are taken on by Bateson with a freedom which, under the guise of the disorder and the absence of method, however, reveals the determination of an absolutely accurate intention, and are made the subject of comparisons and interpolations that very little recall any other similar work.

Bateson's recognition of the problem of the ‘sacred’ lacks theoretical elements that might let us relate it to a whole wide range of issues, and even modes of expression (social function of rituals and religious institutions; existential meaning and social-historical implementation of transcendence; relationship between religion and ideology; meaning of the religious dynamic in the constitution of power relations; sacred / violence relationship, etc ...), which are very typical of the more usual philosophical and anthropological reflection. These issues simply do not appear in the Batesonian text, except in the form of short and quite peripheral references to the fundamental direction of the speech, which goes in another direction.

The intention of Bateson is precise: to abstract abductively from the data of the religious phenomenon confirmations of some fundamental theses drawn about the nature of the systemic and biological world in which we are immersed, and to support, through them, the need to a new monistic epistemology that unifies in the coherence of a single system of ideas and elementary abstractions the ‘mental’ and the ‘corporeal’ and, with them, all those areas of reality traditionally kept separate and opposing by the essentially dualistic ontology underlying knowledge of Modern Age. Under the exclusive focus of this plan arises the discourse on the ‘sacred’, made mostly of a series of texts and fragmentary reflections scattered throughout the body of his work and of a single final unfinished attempt to summarize the basic lines of meditation: the volume _Angels Fear_ (1987), completed and published by his daughter Mary Catherine and an admirable example of writing intended and built as an experiment of ecological interaction.

In which role and to what extent, however, does the legacy of the previous anthropological reflection comes to this discourse?  
First, the method through which Bateson interprets and refers to the material chosen for its reflection reveals an unmistakable _functionalist_ imprint. Tied to the lesson of Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown - his masters in anthropology in the years of the first experiences of researcher and strongly marked by the reflection of Durkheim, Bateson in his work presupposes the interpretation of the term ‘sacred’ as a category-possibility by which men in general think and live the reality, and only in a partial and derivative way, as an objectification of the historical configuration of human cultures. What is therefore essentially investigated is the role this category-possibility plays in the functioning and dis-functioning of systems of relations in which human presence is involved. Durkheim's statement that

“the division of the world into two domains, one including all that is sacred, and the other including all that is profane, is the distinctive character of religious thought ”66

thus plays as an important premise in Bateson’s work, anyway interpreted in the sense 1) of an unbridgeable ontological distinction between sacred experiences and profane experiences and 2) a determination of the ‘sacred’ and the ‘profane’ not as domains of historical and social objectification genetically (ie in a temporally ultimate way) determined, but as spaces of the happening, genealogically open for the functioning of every event of human existence.

66 EMILE DURKHEIM,_Les formes elementaires de la vie religieuse_, Paris 1912

Thus, differences with more traditional settings do not exist at the level of method, but rather at the level of the basic questioning reference. As written by Mary Catherine Bateson

“Gregory's answer to the question ‘why religion?’ is, like Durkheim’s, a functional one, but it is one that treats religion as addressing unavoidable epistemological problems: the limitations on knowledge, the unavoidable gaps in every description, the paradoxes produced by recursiveness. ”67

One typical feature of Bateson’s procedure is the ability to make explicit and subject of an aware theming the epistemological premises themselves assumed by the research. If, in fact, already in_Naven_(1936) he reflected the need to problematize the concepts of ‘function’ and ‘structure’ and their complex relationship, thus outlining the lintels of an analysis method for the most part - and for explicit recognition - due to the example of A. R. Radcliffe-Brown, in the course of subsequent investigations on the ‘sacred’ this ability to meta-problematization reaches extreme levels of refinement, up to turn into an authentic and unmistakable characteristic of Bateson's writing style: his ability to speak and to reveal, while speaking, the process of thinking which is taking place behind that speaking itself. The awareness of the importance of working in scientific discovery with the culturally privileged intention to make the practice of discovery itself the main subject of reflection is, therefore, very likely, to Bateson the greatest legacy of his initial training as an anthropologist, but it's pretty no doubt that this attitude has acquired over time a highly autonomous dimension, after all, irreducible to examples from the prior intellectual debate.

Any reflection belonging to the so-called Irrationalism appears then basically unrelated to the theme of the ‘sacred’, as well as developed by Bateson; they are necessarily excluded from the interest (and also absent in the text as mere polemical references) as bearers of a point of view that very badly goes along with by the need (for Bateson absolutely central) to rejoin the ‘sacred’ to the matter, to affirm the possibility of a new integration between the knowledge of religion and science, and to divest the approach to the religious of its traditional moral teachings.

67 G. BATESON , M.C. BATESON,_Angels Fear_, 200

The only data that can let us read Bateson's analysis of the ‘sacred’ in continuity with the research of the twentieth century anthropology is, therefore, the taking over of the definition of the sacred as sacred-power, as the dimension of the unpredictable superpower, of what in essence eludes the capacity of man for knowledge and control.

In fact, if all of the most well-established interpretations of the terminological-ideological groups which write in the history of the cultures the ideogram of the sacred (the group generally referred as ‘classic’:_sanctussacer, qadōš, αγιος-αγνος, heilig-holy_, and the group known as ‘primitive’:_mana, taboo, manitu, Orenda, etc_...) converge to include in its conceptual roots the warning of the power of that which is beyond human control (the power of natural event unknown in its reason, the power of the disruption of the normal functioning of ecological systems, the power of the entity - god, priest, magic item, sacrificial beast, etc ... - that could intervene in this disruption and bring it back to ‘normal’ condition, and so on), even in observations conducted by Bateson plays an absolutely central role the binding scope of what we call the ‘sacred’ with the unleashing of sequences of events ontologically impossible to forecast and control of human knowledge. I will return later to this aspect of the question, but let us say with reasonable certainty that this character of the religious element is also taken by Bateson in a rather unproblematic way, just like an element of established contemporary anthropology, and therefore, to some extent, as a premise of the speech itself.

A fundamental and irreducible difference of the reflections of Bateson from more classical interpretation of the same documentary material is marked, however, once again, by the functionalization of such material in a discourse that has as its main purpose to put in the connection the ‘sacred’ and religion to epistemological issues. It is worth quoting in this regard an example of typical Bateson’s way to proceed. In this agile page of anthropological hermeneutics he gleans arguments in support of his consideration of the essential contents of knowledge of religions through an interpretation, at least unusual, of a famous passage in_Genesis_of the Bible. Bateson writes:

“Consider, for example, the central origin myth of Judaeo-Christian peoples. What are the fundamental philosophic and scientific problems with which this myth is concerned?

In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.

And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.

And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so. And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.

And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so. And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.

Authorized version

Out of these first ten verses of thunderous prose, we can draw some of the premises or fundamentals of ancient Chaldean thought and it is strange, almost eerie, to note how many of the fundamentals and problems of modern science are foreshadowed in the ancient document. (1) The problem of the origin and nature of matter is summarily dismissed. (2) The passage deals at length with the problem of the origin of order. (3) A separation is thus generated between the two sorts of problem. It is possible that this separation of problems was an error, but—error or not—the separation is maintained in the fundamentals of modern science. The conservative laws for matter and energy are still separate from the laws of order, negative entropy, and information.  
(4) Order is seen as a matter of sorting and dividing. But the essential notion in all sorting is that some difference shall cause some other difference at a later time. If we are sorting black balls from white balls, or large balls from small balls, a difference among the balls is to be followed by a difference in their location—balls of one class to one sack and balls of another class to another. For such an operation, we need something like a sieve, a threshold, or, par excellence, a sense organ. It is understandable, therefore, that a perceiving Entity should have been invoked to perform this function of creating an otherwise improbable order.

(5) Closely linked with the sorting and dividing is the mystery of classification, to be followed later by the extraordinary human achievement of naming”68.

This text clearly reveals the uniqueness of a survey method which gives up with any idea of scientific rigor as an instance of completeness, and which knowingly abandons all traditional hermeneutic attitude to free the possibilities of thought towards new directions. Traditionally unrelated regions of subjects and questions are combined and placed in relation, and through their difference the unseen is allowed to appear. This way to practice thinking – to which Bateson often referred by the term ‘abduction’ - is exactly what prevents the reduction of his research to the language and content of traditional anthropology.

As a matter of fact, the discourse on the ‘sacred’ is located for Bateson at the crossroads of a number of knowledge (anthropology, psychiatry, logic, ecology, systems theory, epistemology), and escapes substantially to the single possibilities of understanding offered by each of them, requiring unequivocally the need for a new integrated thinking that knows how to approach the reality of the real and its inseparable unity. The atomising of knowledge wrought by its metaphysical configuration appears to be unsustainable when you face a level of experience and a phenomenon in which unity and integration of all play an absolutely crucial role. For this reason, the discourse on the ‘sacred’ unveils and undermines the virtuality and the inadequacy of the various**λογος**in which the Modern Age has shattered the knowledge and proposes itself as an experiment in their reintegration into a unity that is not antique, not arbitrarily pre-modern, but necessarily original, historically placed already beyond the closing of the Modern Age, and so, in the first and non-trivial sense,_post-modern_.

68 GREGORY BATESON,_Steps to an Ecology of Mind, Introduction_, xxx

Thus, despite the obvious presence of traces of the especially anthropological debate, which has arisen around the question of the ‘sacred’ over the last century and more, the text of Bateson is essentially _eccentric_with respect to the contents and language of this debate and irreducible, in its fundamental determination, to the metaphysical presuppositions of modern science.

What makes - you have to wonder - such eccentricity possible in the building and functioning of this text?  
Of course, you do not have to provide a merely philological answer, but rather to take note of something which is, however, very obvious even to an only superficial survey of Bateson’s works. The figure is that Bateson does not take on as privileged references of dialogue and discussion the authors of the mainstream tradition of Western science and thought, but rather the places where this tradition comes clearly in crisis and shows its bias. It is clear that when referring to the expression ‘tradition of Western metaphysics’, you do not refer to the indistinct whole of all that has been written and thought in the West, but rather to a certain line of cultural products that share the fact that they can all be traced back the determination of a single fundamental ontological position, which acts in them in the function of a center. Assuming - with Heidegger - the identification of this ontological position in the so-called ‘metaphysics of subjectness’, ie ontological attitude to consider Being itself as substance, as a subject of predicates, present and stable in its persisting identity, you can interpret the historical movement of our modernity at least as an affirmation-deployment of this metaphysics, and you have a theoretical object that allows you to recognize those places (authors, productions of thought and knowledge) which conflict with the needs of the its deployment and subtract at its center, ie which are, compared to it,_eccentric_. Bateson shows to attend with great ease and with a declared unique interest these places - which are nothing but, ultimately, the testimonies of positions alien to the groove of Aristotelian-Christian-Cartesian dualist ontology - and founds on their support the possibility of giving birth to an interpretation of the ‘sacred’ which is already in itself a spill by movement (accomplished, exhausted, short-circuited, prisoner of a dangerous dead end) of Western_onto-theo-logy_.  
It is therefore the mysticism of poet William Blake and that of the Gnostic tradition filtered through the mediation of Jung to become, along with the meditation of Kant (eminent place of the unveiling of the metaphysical configuration of the Western_episteme_), the definition points of perspective through which Bateson reads the issue of the ‘sacred’. And next to them a no less decisive role is played, in this perspective construction, by all the issues raised by cybernetics, systems theory, nonlinear dynamical systems and ecology (real frontier areas of western science), in which the results of scientific inquiry itself cannot be received and understood in their innovative capacity without rewriting the fundamental epistemological paradigm within which science, as a whole, still defines itself.  
This is, then, the functional mechanism that makes the Batesonian text extraneous, in its underlying reason, to all the traditional philosophical or anthropological literature on the ‘sacred’: a decisive attendance of the marginal and neglected currents of Western thought and most advanced of scientific speculation, and their abductively free and creative integration. This is the theoretical tool that allows him to discuss in innovative means the essence of religion and the phenomenology of the ‘sacred’ and to put this discussion in a brand new (and utterly full of implications) connection to purely epistemological inevitable questions.

What does it mean, however, that religion and the sacred exist as a reality in some way involved in the problems of epistemology?  
It is important to clarify at this point of the survey, that the concept of epistemology developed and used by Bateson does not coincide exactly with the traditional one, and that this divergence plays an extremely relevant role in the context of the reflection on the sacred. In his seminal essay_Mind and Nature_(1979) he expresses this difference and on it rests, therefore, the entire ability to understand the meaning of theses proposed later. Combining the current definition of epistemology as a branch of science _the discipline that studies how the particular organisms or aggregates of organisms know, think and decide_- with the definition of epistemology as a branch of philosophy –_the question that focuses on the necessary limits and other essential characteristics of the processes of learning, thinking and decision_- Bateson comes to assign a wider meaning to the term and use it to denote_the set of all necessary formal components (and also of ideas through which we reflect these components ) required by the process through which we know things in general_, being included in this pronoun ‘we’ even “the starfish and the redwood forest, the segmenting egg and the Senate of the United States”69and, in general, any other entity (singular or complex) that give rise to processes of mental type. And, as Bateson himself writes, thinking aloud about the process of thinking that is the basis of the thesis of his essay,

“And in the _anything_which these creatures variously know, I included ‘how to grow into five-way symmetry’, ‘how to survive a forest fire’, ‘how to grow and still stay the same shape’, ‘how to learn’, ‘how to write a constitution’, ‘how to invent and drive a car’, ‘how to count to seven’, and so on. Marvelous creatures with almost miraculous knowledge and skills.

Above all, I included ‘how to evolve’, because it seemed to me that both evolution and learning must fit the same formal regularities or socalled laws. I was, you see, starting to use the ideas [...] to reflect, not upon our own knowing, but upon that wider knowing which is the glue holding together the starfishes and sea anemones and the redwood forests and human committees”.70

The concept of epistemology formulated by Bateson finds its reason in the central thesis that all biological systems (organisms or aggregates of organisms or parts of organisms or sets of organisms and non-organic entities) are the protagonists, as such, of a series of processes generically classified as ‘mental’. These processes have the characteristic to be bound by a common set of formal requirements (structural conditions or _elementary truths_). The universality of these abstractions, which hold in their ontological necessity all the ‘mental’ processes, founds the intimate communality and unity of these processes and their systemic substrates, and therefore, ultimately, it founds the unity and coherence of the real. _Epistemology_is, by Bateson, properly the name of this set of abstractions

69 GREGORY BATESON,_Mind and Nature_, 4

70 Ibid.

and, at the same time (and for the fundamental reason that human knowledge itself is a process subject to the same conditions of epistemology which is object of its own interest and speculation ), of the knowledge that focuses on them and their essential and binding character.

Epistemology is therefore the knowledge that knows the conditions of itself as a knowledge and of every other possible knowledge. Thus, it knows the conditions for existence and proper functioning of biological and mental systems and operates immanently in each of these systems as the fundamental data of their own organization. Epistemology is the “pattern which connects” (a topical phrase of Bateson’s) all things in their very setting-up, it is the event (absolutely nonsubstantial and unobjectivable, as such) of subsisting in the totality of Being of a necessary fabric of powerful elementary abstractions, which constitute the necessity, consistency and elegance of the very nature of the world. Getting closer to the nodes of biological world epistemology means, therefore, getting closer to the necessity, and that is the ‘sacred’, which is - according to Bateson and on the basis of an acquired outcome of modern anthropology  
- the word designating in all human cultures the inviolable sphere of ideas and things required for the proper functioning of the world. The ‘sacred’ and the necessity are to Bateson the terms of a relation of identity, as necessity is the center of the recognizing experienced by all the mystics and the object of the warding witnessed by all sacred texts and practices of all religions, and at the same time, is the term of reference and selfdefinition (**τελος**) of the scientific demand itself, and so the only possible place of a new integration between religion and science.

It is no coincidence, in fact, that the reinterpretation of all the categories related to the phenomenology of the ‘sacred’ is carried out by Bateson through the mediation of a theoretical object rigorously formulated, ie, via the formal definition of concept of ‘mind’. According to this definition (which, mind you, most of the essay on_Mind and Nature_ (1979) is devoted to and which is the inescapable premise to_Angels Fear_ (1989), the essay on the epistemology of the ‘sacred’), a ‘mind’ is an aggregate of interacting parts and components that meet certain specific functional conditions: 1) the interaction between parts of the system called a ‘mind’ is triggered by difference, which is an event in itself absolutely nonsubstantial and not located in space or time, and 2) difference and its coded versions (transforms) give rise to chains of circular or more complex chains of determinations, ruled by positive or negative feedbacks and powered by collateral energy, ie energy which is external to the mental process itself, and 3) the description and classification of these processes of transformations implicit in mental process disclose a hierarchy of logical types immanent in the phenomena.71

The concept of ‘mind’ that is emerging in this definition, built entirely by notions derived from systems theory and cybernetics, is of central importance in the whole reflection of Bateson, because it enables him to set up the problem of the ‘sacred’ ( but, more generally, all matters pertaining to the phenomenology of the biological world) in an epistemologically non-dualistic perspective, not irrational yet, at the same time, freed from the anxieties of mechanism. Recognizing, in fact, the mind as a feature of the self-organization of matter itself and evaluating all the processes related to it as epiphenomenal properties of systems that meet certain precise formal conditions is equivalent to laying the foundation for the assertion of absolute immanence of ‘mind’ within the ‘body’ and their fundamental ontological homogeneity. Only in this way it is possible, for Bateson, to give an acceptable interpretation of the phenomena of life and communication and escape from the impasse in which knowledge has been driven by the dialectical opposition of the two epistemological positions that have marked the development of modernity and which belong - albeit in a mirror – to the same metaphysical outlook and, therefore, the same distortion: materialism of mechanistic science and supernaturalism of the followers of the irrational. Bateson writes:

“These two species of superstitions, these rival epistemologies, the supernatural and the mechanical, feed each other. […]

It should be possible to find a more stable theoretical stance. We need such a stance to limit the excesses both of the materialists and of those who flirt with the supernatural. And further, we need a revised philosophy or epistemology to reduce the intolerance that divides the two camps. […]

And I assert that we know enough today to expect that this improved stance will be unitary, and that the conceptual separation between ‘mind’ and ‘matter’ will be seen to be a by-product of – a spin-off from _an insufficient holism_. When we focus too narrowly upon the parts, we fail to see the necessary characteristics of the whole, and are then tempted to ascribe the phenomena which result from wholeness to some supernatural entity”72.

71 GREGORY BATESON,_Mind and Nature_, 92

‘Holism’ is the “tendency in nature to produce from the ordered grouping of parts complex wholes with properties that are not present in or predictable from the separate parts”73, and the concept of ‘mind’ proposed by Bateson is precisely a holistic perspective on the problem of the ‘sacred’ and the relationship between material and immaterial. Shape, difference, information, relation exist within the matter as the data of its immanent organization, yet they are not material, have no substance, ie they are - from the point of view of fundamental ontology of Western metaphysics _non-entities_, as they can be understood only in the mode of _events_. In their interactions, however, there is the ‘mind’. The cause-effect relationships that govern the phenomenality of these data are never_lineal74_, but they always have a circular (ie retroactive) or more complex character, which makes them difficult, if not entirely inaccessible to the understanding of a scientific knowledge that still think - on the basis of the metaphysics of subjectity and ground recognized and deconstructed by Heidegger - the causality as a mechanical determination. However, there is a wide constellation of experiences and processing arisen from the same and most advanced contemporary scientific research, which has already provided, according to Bateson, sufficient tools to produce a holistic interpretation, that is, ontologically monistic, of the link between ‘mind’

73 GREGORY BATESON,_Angels Fear_,_Glossary_, 208

and ‘body’ . But the full recognition of the implications of this research and the resulting upheaval of epistemology of Western knowledge remain, however, still unrecognized tasks.

The criticism of mechanism and taking the idea of ‘mind’ into the group of explanatory principles of science are not Bateson’s innovations but belong to a well-established scientific literature that has its strongholds within quantum physics, cybernetics, systems theory as well in linguistics, logic, and in that broad area of investigation that goes by the name of _cognitive science_. It is also true that precisely in the context of cognitive science, the concept of ‘mind’ has found its first rigorous formulations and has been used in an epistemological controversy as opposed to what Fodor called the “Common-Sense Materialism”75. But the specificity of Batesonian use of this concept lies in its total lack of objective and preliminarily and exclusively determined referents, that is, in its entirely insubstantial character, which makes it therefore particularly appropriate, from a purely theoretical point of view, to encourage the affirmation of an ontological position consciously subversive of the Western metaphysical tradition. Although cognitive science, indeed, moves from recognizing the conceptual shortcomings of materialism and its claim to reasonably explain the phenomena of life and communication using only the presence of entities with spatial extent and physical activity (and thus excluding differences, information, relations and all other notions of mental type), it almost always ends up reducing the problem of mind and matter relationship to the more narrow issue of the functionality of intelligent human behavior, and anchoring the idea of ‘mind’ to the physical substrate of the brain, falling in a position which still underlies in its essence to the metaphysical necessity to define reality as present objectivity and which does not escape, therefore, a fundamentally reductionist epistemology. The most interesting and innovative characteristic of Bateson’s definition of ‘mind’ lies, however, in the fact that, according to it, to recognize the presence of a mental system

“there is no requirement of a clear boundary, like a surrounding envelope of skin or membrane, and you can recognize that this definition includes only some of the characteristics of what we call ‘life’. As a result, it applies to a much wider range of those complex phenomena called ‘systems’, including systems consisting of multiple organisms or systems in which some of the parts are living and some are not, or even to systems in which there are no living parts. What is described here is something that can receive information and can, through the self-regulation or self-correction made possible by circular trains of causation, maintain the truth of certain propositions about itself. These two provide the rudiments of identity [...] There is, however, no reason to assume that it will be either conscious or capable of self-replication, like some of the minds we count among our friends and relatives. A given mind is likely to be a component or subsystem in some larger and more complex mind, as an individual cell may be a component in an organism, or a person may be a component in a community ”76.

75 JERRY FODOR,_The language of thought_, New York 1975

Mainly on the basis of its formal wideness Bateson's idea of ‘mind’ plays an essential role in the considerations on the ‘sacred’. If this notion were not, in fact, sufficiently flexible to make possible a cybernetic analysis of ecological systems or human life complex relations (family, culture or community), the holistic interpretation of the phenomenology of ‘sacred’ advanced by Bateson simply would not be possible.

Not surprisingly, on the basis of the considerations up to this point, Bateson clarifies the meaning of his reflections made in the first part of _Angels Fear_(1987) around the possibility of a cybernetic reading of the concepts of ‘faith’, ‘mystery’, ‘sacrament’, ‘sacrilege’ and all other most topic conceptual places of the phenomenology of the ‘sacred’, by stating:

“What has been said so far can be read as argument or evidence for the reality of very large mental systems, systems of ecological size and larger, within which the mentality of the single human being is a subsystem. These large mental systems are characterized by, among other things, constraints on the transmission of information between their parts. Indeed, we can argue from the circumstance that some information should not reach some locations in large, organized systems to assert the _real_ nature of these systems - to assert the existence of that whole whose integrity would be threatened by inappropriate communication. By the word ‘real’ in this context, I mean simply that it is_necessary for explanation_to think in terms of organizations of this size, attributing to these systems, the characteristics of mental process [...].

But it is one thing to claim that this is necessary and not surprising and quite another to go on to say, however vaguely, what sort of mind such a vast organization might be. What characteristics would such minds expectably show? Are they, perhaps, the sorts of thing that men have called gods? ”77

The relationship between the survey of the ‘sacred’ and the concept of ‘mind’ is clarified here in its true meaning, suggesting theoretical implications perhaps not yet sufficiently meditate. Let's try to summarize in a schematic way the main ideas advanced in this passage:

1) it is not the assumption of the existence of mental systems described by the criteria of _Mind and Nature_(1979) to urge a re-reading of the phenomena of the ‘sacred’ from the point of view of cybernetics, but it is rather the possibility to read those phenomena in this way to push the affirmation of the reality of mental systems;

2) affirming that these mental systems immanent in phenomenality of nature are_real_does not mean, in any event, supporting their objective (ie substantial) existence, it simply means that the notion of ‘mind’ is needed to arrive at a plausible description of the factuality of certain phenomena, and that this _epistemological necessity_is the only form of reality that the thought can never grant to “patterns that connect” and, ultimately, to the real itself;

3) in order to affirm the reality (in the sense of present objectivity here) of a mental system we should define the exact boundaries of the system itself, which, by reason of the essential and insurmountable unity of the world of mental process, is not possible in any case. Mental systems (including ecosystems) are never circumscribable as separated from each other, do not have linearly traceable contours and, therefore, exist only in the way of powerful immanent abstractions, which are recognizable in their operations only through a conventional and arbitrary delimitation of their outlines, that is, of their identity;

4) once you have defined the extent and existence of these systems, you can give a functional cybernetic description that allows you to interpret with rigor and consistency the full range of events that are usually traced back to the realm of the ‘sacred’;

5) religions have traditionally acknowledged the _fact_of the systemic and mental organization of the world, have produced a descriptive knowledge of this fact and have, in general, appointed its actuality by employing the word ‘god’.

What do you think, then, according to Bateson, initially behind the word ‘god’? You think the necessity (ie the immanence) of a plot of elementary and necessary truths which rule the functioning of our biological world and establish its systemic organization. You think that, in terms of Western metaphysics, is traditionally called the ‘ground’ of beings.

This thesis - reaffirmed and clarified, though never in such an explicitly ontological way, through the entire discourse developed around the ‘sacred’ - is remarkably consonant with the interpretation of the same problem provided by Martin Heidegger, surely another of most eccentric and subversive of the Western metaphysical tradition movement meditative experiences. It is no documented neither appears in any way likely a mutual attendance of the two authors, but as it has already been noticed78, the points of contact between their speculative positions are varied. It is worthwhile, therefore, to give a short fragment of the reflection that Heidegger expressed around the question of the essence of the concept of ‘god’, particularly in order to let Bateson come out from a certain isolation and to show that the possibility of another interpretation of the sense of religion and of the ‘sacred’ already exists as an operating eventuality in the philosophical culture of our time. In 1936, helping to lay the foundations for a new integration of knowledge, Heidegger writes:

78 See in particularEUGENIO MAZZARELLA,_Un’appendice ontica: ecologia cibernetica e circolo linguistico. Bateson e Heidegger. La_Froemmigkeit _come compito ineludibile del pensiero_, Appendix to ID.,_Tecnica e metafisica. Saggio su Heidegger_, Naples 1981.

“Every philosophy is theology in the original and essential sense that the conceptual understanding (**λογος**) of entities as a whole raises the question of the ground of Being, and this ground is called**θεος**, god. [...] But you should not assess the theology found in philosophy on the basis of any dogmatic and ecclesiastical theology, that is you have not to believe, in particular, that philosophical theology is simply the rational and ‘Enlightenment’ form of an ecclesial theology [...]. Rather the opposite is true, namely, that Christian theology is the Christianization of an extrachristian theology, and that only for this reason the Christian theology could again be secularized. [...] Theo-logy means here, once again, to raise the question of the beings as a whole. This question of the beings as a whole - the theological question - cannot be taken without the question of the Being as such, the essence of Being in general. This is the question of **ον η ον**, the question of' ‘ontology’.

The philosophical question is always and in itself twofold, onto-logic and theo-logic, in the broadest sense. The philosophy is onto-theo-logy. The more originally it meets this duality, the more authentically it is philosophy. [...]

We shall employ these ancient determinations because they are still the ones that indicate in the best way the most original problem area of philosophy and that always maintain this tradition ”79.

And later, pondering the essence of the concept of ‘pantheism’:

“In his formal meaning, pantheism means: **̟αν - θεος**, ‘All-God’, each being is in relationship with God; each being is related to the ground of the Being. This ground is the One,**εν**, it is, as a ground, all (**̟αν**) the rest that is in it, in the ground. [...] This be-and-stay-inherent in God is called ‘immanence’. All knowledge relating to the entities as a whole must somehow think the whole as one with its ground, and as a result, every system implies in some way such immanence ”80.

79 MARTIN HEIDEGGER,_Schelling’s Treatise on the Essence of Human Freedom,_ Ohio University Press 1985

While in the obvious difference of modes of expression and the underlying problems, Bateson’s meditation and Heidegger’s meditation converge on the need to put of the concept of ‘god’ in relation to the idea of the ‘necessity’ (ontological and epistemological) which founds in its essence the deployment-operation of the beings as a whole. And this ‘ecological’ taking of the notion of ‘god’ - common, therefore, for both interpretations - allows Bateson, in particular, to seek in the religious literature of various human cultures traces of the acknowledgement of the ‘sacred’ as acknowledgement of systemic necessity and, thereby, to keep in contact with the traditional anthropological determination of the ‘sacred’ as ‘sacred-power’, as the scope of the unfolding of sequences of events related to extremely broad and essentially inaccessible to the forecast and human control systemic contexts.

In the sense of this research, for example, we can read those pages of _Angels Fear_(1987) in which Bateson ponders the meaning of the concept of_ananke_in the Greek tragic literature (identified as the only authentic place of recognition of the ‘sacred’ in classical Greek culture ) and compares that with the Hindu concept of_karma_, and with the notion of _ngglambi_belonging to Iatmul populations of New Guinea, or those pages in which he discusses the _dual_organization of all the great religious systems, considering it as a metaphor (ie a trans-lation of the same essential structure) of the necessary duality of every ‘mind’ as such. This kind of analysis is exactly what enables Bateson to say that

“It is time to reverse the trend which since Copernicus has been in the direction of debunking mythology, to begin to pick up the many epistemological components of religion that have been brushed aside. In doing so, we may come upon important notions partly displaced by trash (particularly the kind of trash produced by religious people pretending to scientific authority, which is not their business) or partly lost by the failure to understand what religion was about, that has characterized most of the scientific debunking. [...]

Religion does not consist in recognizing little bits of miracles ( _miracula_, ‘little marvels’), such as every religious leader tries to avoid providing but which his followers will always insist upon, but vast aggregates of organization having immanent mental characteristics. I suggest that the Greeks were close to religion in concepts such as_ananke_,_nemesis_and_hubris_, and diverged from religion when their oracles claimed supernatural authority, or when their mythologists embroidered the tales of the various gods in the pantheon ”81.

And to further clarify the meaning and intent of his investigation of the concept of ‘god’, Bateson makes a unique proposal, with an the effective and obvious _ironic_talent (ie revealing failings necessarily implied in any authentic saying):

“I am trying to investigate the communicational regularities in the biosphere, assuming that in doing so, I shall also be investigating interwoven regularities in a system so pervasive and so determinant that we may even apply the word ‘god’ to it. The regularities we discover including regularities and necessities of communication and logic - form a unity in which we make our home. They might be seen as the peculiarities of the god whom we might call Eco.

There is a parable which says that when the ecological god looks down and sees the human species sinning against its ecology - by greed or by taking shortcuts or taking steps in the wrong order - he sighs and involuntarily sends the pollution and the radioactive fallout. It is of no avail to tell him that the offense was only a small one, that you are sorry and that you will not do it again. It is no use to make sacrifices or offer bribes. The ecological God is incorruptible and therefore is not mocked”82.

81 GREGORY BATESON,_Angels Fear_, 142

The ‘god’ Bateson is looking for is the ‘god’ of ecological necessity, recognized and unrecognized many times and in many forms in the history of religious knowledge, but ever operating in the biological functioning of the world, as a fabric of insurmountable epistemological constraints. The epistemology of each mental system is part of this a-substantial and immanent ‘god’ (ie far from being a_person_who can become the object of worship and theological speculation). The necessity which establishes things as always inviolably distinct from the ideas representing them, from their perception and description, the necessity which establishes the ontological gap between “the map and the territory”, the necessity expressed in the self-evidence of logical tautologies and the necessity holding the evolution of living matter are just some versions or fragments of the ‘god’ which is immanent in this world. This ‘god’ - which is nothing but the_event_of its own immanence - has been for a long time kept but also hidden by traditional religions and their tendency to hopelessly become a mystified and institutional version of the original experience of the ‘sacred’. But it is also the end of a recognition process that contemporary science is being urged to make by the data of its own most recent acquisitions. In the concept of such a god is, therefore, to define the territory - whose exploration Bateson always considered as his prior intention - where knowledge of science, myth and art meet the possibility of their initial integration.

The notion of ‘god’ defined by Bateson with reference to cybernetic properties of mental systems immanent in the nature of the world acts as a center, in the context of the whole discourse raised around the meaning of the ‘sacred’. All other inquiries and statements flow from the premise of this notion or refer to it or are instrumental to its possibility. Looking to the idea of the epistemological nature of the ‘sacred’, Bateson therefore develops his investigation of the meaning of the categories of religion, and in particular the meaning of ‘faith’.

If the purpose is to build and defend a monistic view of reality, it is clear that the nature of that event we call ‘faith’ cannot be located on the premise of the _reality_of the object towards which the act of ‘faith’ is addressed. Indeed, the problem of the existence or non-existence of the external referent of ‘faith’ (ie a person ‘god’ or any other substantial entity) is negligible, and the mental functioning of the process ‘faith’ should be clarified, for Bateson, only in the context of itself and in connection with the most basic problems of epistemology. Epistemology is, as has been said, the whole of the conditions of possibility (ie constraints) within which a ‘mind’ implements that process we call ‘knowledge’. The first one  
- in an ontological sense - of these constraints is to Bateson the gap which separates the world of things - considered according to Kant as things-inthemselves - and the world of ideas, or abstractions (differences and transforms of differences), which knowledge and therefore the life of every mental system is made of. This necessary unbridgeable hiatus is a problem that recurs at every level of epistemology of any mental system and often gives rise to confusion and serious errors. In relation to it the event-process called ‘faith’ finds its own meaning and function.

What Bateson asserts in this regard appears remarkably in tune with the core of Kant's insights about the organization of that function of the human mind which he called ‘intellect’, and seems to be nothing but the clarification and deployment of this critical passage of the_Kritik der reinen Vernunft_in which Kant notes that

“it must still remain a scandal to philosophy and to the general human reason to be obliged to assume,_as an article of mere belief_, the existence of things external to ourselves (from which, yet, we derive the whole material of cognition for the internal sense), and not to be able to oppose a satisfactory proof to anyone who may call it in question ”83.

Bateson writes:

83 IMMANUEL KANT, _The Critique of Pure Reason_, _Preface to Second Edition 1787_, Pennsylvania State University Ed., 23

“[...] the jump is always there. If I look through my corporeal eyes and see an image of the rising sun, the propositions ‘I look’ and ‘I see’ have a sort of validity different from that of any conclusion about the world outside my skin. ‘I see a sun rising’ is a proposition that indeed, as Descartes insists, cannot be doubted, but extrapolation from this to the outside world –_‘There is a sun’_- is always unsure and must be supported by faith. Another problem is that all such _resources/books//Ontology of Complexity_ A Reading of Grego - Gianfranco Savino are retrospective. The assertion of the image qua description of the external world, is always in a past tense. Our senses can only tell us at best what_was_so a moment ago. We do in fact read the causal sequence backwards. But this fundamentally unreliable information is delivered to perceiving self in the most convincing and indubitable form as an_image_. It is this faith - a faith in our mental process that must always be defended!”84

The mental process, therefore, has among its epistemological constraints, the need to bridge the gap between the thingness of things, and the ideality of ideas, of which only it is composed, through an act of ‘faith’. This original and irreplaceable ‘faith’ is a precondition of the process of ‘mind’, and therefore of life. It must be preserved and protected, because its disturbance or even a revelation to the conscience of its very nature could cripple seriously the functionality of the ‘mind’. Bateson, moreover, dedicates - as it is known - a large part of his research as a scientist to lay the foundation for an interpretation of schizophrenia as a disease of the ‘faith’ of the perceiving self towards its own perceptions and its representative possibilities, and to highlight the large structural similarities between the mental process of the schizophrenic and that of the mystic. In the context of this reading of the functional significance of the ‘faith’, religion becomes necessarily that knowledge which the mental system of human culture entrusts the task of preserving the awareness of the fundamental epistemological importance of ‘faith’ and educating its discipline.

Bateson puts it this way in the world the opportunity to give a completely initial sense to intimacy of the act of ‘faith’, revealing the unique nature and the only mode of subsistence that the real may exist to us as mental entities.

“If we had continual awareness of our image-making processes, our _resources/books//Ontology of Complexity_ A Reading of Grego - Gianfranco Savino would cease to be credible. It is indeed a merciful dispensation that we know not the processes of our own creativity - which sometimes are the processes of self-deceit.

To be unconscious of these processes is the first line of our defense against loss of faith. A little faith in perception is vitally necessary, and by packing our data into the form of _resources/books//Ontology of Complexity_ A Reading of Grego - Gianfranco Savino, we convince ourselves of the validity of our belief._Seeing is believing_. But faith is in believing that seeing is believing. As Blake said of the ‘corporeal’, which we believe we know, ‘It is in Fallacy, and its Existence an Imposture’ ”85.

In a similar way to what is done around the concept of ‘faith’, Bateson then proposes an interpretation of all the other main sites of the phenomenology of the ‘sacred’, always moving from a functionalist consideration of the epistemological necessity of mental systems.

The mental systems that he examines are varied. They are compared from the point of view of their structural connotations to highlight the set of formal patterns that unites them. Developing, for example, a survey of the major myths of some human cultures and combining the results with the analysis of some mechanisms of the biological world, Bateson wonders if there is a meaningful identity between the fact that “the body that is adjusting itself to the stresses and vicissitudes of experience shall not communicate with the DNA, the carrier of genetic instructions for the next generation”86, the fact that “it is apparently necessary that we have no knowledge of the processes by which in our perception _resources/books//Ontology of Complexity_ A Reading of Grego - Gianfranco Savino are formed”87 and the fact that relevant pieces of religious literature from

85 GREGORY BATESON,_Angels Fear_, 96  
86 GREGORY BATESON,_Angels Fear_, 88

87 Ibid.

around the world “share the notion of _not communicating_something under some circumstances”88. If the circuitry of genetics, those of the relationship between the outside world and perceiving self and those of cultural systems all have characteristics that fit to the formal definition of ‘mind’, we should wonder, on the basis of these observations, whether the essential need to the proper functioning of the ‘minds’, in general, that certain messages, certain information (also true) are not located in certain positions of the circuit is just another piece of that epistemological necessity that is mentioned behind the word ‘sacred’. And we should wonder, according to Bateson, whether just this kind of constraints are from the perspective of a systemic and ecological evaluation of religious knowledge - the essence of those issues typically associated with ‘sacred’, that is ‘secrecy’ and ‘mystery’. The discussion that he leads in this regard is highly articulated and rich of examples. It comes to the determination that, in general, “secrecy can be used as a _marker_to tell us that we are approaching holy ground”89and that some form of non-communication is to such an extent necessary and desirable for the smooth operation of the mental process that it would already be possible to start writing a different and more coherent apprehension of the concept of ‘sacred’ only on its basis.

Of course this precise connection between the ‘sacred’ and noncommunication, ‘mystery’ and the need not to say, echoes the long tradition of mystical knowledge produced by all civilizations, but also, for example, the last famous statements of the attempt to recon thought (mental process) and its nature (epistemological organization) built by Ludwig Wittgenstein in his_Tractatus Logico-philosophicus_.

The need not to say, in order to preserve the integrity of the ‘sacred’, ie the proper functioning of mental processuality (whose most evident sign is, according to Bateson, the condition men call the ‘grace’) - which is also, as Wittgenstein states, the need to_sacri_fice what has been said to access the space instead of what can never be said - operates in the same Batesonian text as a fundamental norm. And this is the reason why that text never claims the unrealistic completeness of a theoretical system made of peremptory assertions. Even where the holistic interpretation of the phenomenology of the ‘sacred’ seems to exhaust convincingly the organic totality of the theme that it examines, Bateson never shows to be selfsatisfied: the circle is never closed, and through a difficult balance of revelations and suggestions, the text on the ‘sacred’ reveals an unusual ability to copy empathically the nature of its own object and gets characterized by the unequivocal sign of elegance and ‘grace’.

88 GREGORY BATESON,_Angels Fear_, 79

As has been sharply written, Bateson is “the man of science who got to the very limits of language” and made himself a living metaphor of the same argument that he tried to recognize and define by his own research. This integral dimension of communication is perhaps the very core of his taking of the essence of the ‘sacred’.

“Integrative dimension of experience” is the phrase by which Bateson defines the ‘sacred’ as the way reality exists, that is a mode of perceiving and building the reality. ‘Sacredness’ is an event and, according to its determination, basically it is that event which reveals the systemic nature of the whole in which we are immersed and lets us perceive that the process through which we are in relationship with reality (the very fact of our every perception, therefore) is part of a larger mental process, that is the facticity of our world as a biological world. In the ‘sacred’ experience reaches its own boundaries and senses itself as such, ie includes in its epistemological construction even the awareness of the constraints inherent in such a construction. Sacred experience is therefore integrative experience, that is impossible to every representation duality and, therefore, ontologically impossible to say. This necessary ineffability is, as has been said, what the mystics (and great artists and great poets) have always been trying to show, striving to accomplish a task that cannot in any case be acquitted, but which sometimes - as Bateson remarked - they do “very prettily”90.

Integrity is the condition of the ‘sacred’ in the sense that it is the core of its essence and of its meaning, but also in the sense that it is what the ‘sacred’ behaviors strive to protect and what ethical behavior of man – his righteous living within the measure of earth - is focused on. As opposed to that dimension there is, for Bateson, the dimension of_conscious-purpose_, that is the typically human capacity to act in order to preliminarily defined purposes. This capacity presupposes a required splitting of the experience in a series of dualistic pairs (subject-object, I-World, purpose-mean, useful-useless, etc. ...) that prevent the perception of the unity of the whole and lead to behaviors almost always disturbing the proper functioning of the biological world. Appetitive attitudes are therefore what is most radically opposed to entirely aesthetic quality (ie free from any conscious purpose) of the ‘sacred’ and knowledge that knows it. These attitudes extend, however, more and more their relevance in determining our relationship with the world, and the spaces within which we are allowed to recognize the ‘sacred’ unity of the real contract at an alarming rate, to the point that as Bateson notes, “we are even becoming incapable of committing sacrilege”91.

90 GREGORY BATESON,_Steps to an Ecology of Mind_, 138

It is then to bring to life - through the most advanced tools of contemporary scientific knowledge - the sense of an ancient word, ‘_sacer_’, which has never stopped meaning the basic necessity of our biological nature, although it has been seriously forgotten by centuries of a rigidly dualistic metaphysical tradition (scientific, religious, political), which pushed the situation of Western humanity in the dead end of an unprecedented ecological crisis (in the formally broadest sense of the term).

‘Sacer’ is - since the beginning of linguistic and ideological history of the word – ‘that which cannot be touched’, and perhaps Bateson's interpretation of the ‘sacred’ is nothing more than an attempt to revive the original meaning of this definition from the fate of concealment and mystification. ‘Sacred’ is, in fact, in Bateson’s use of the term, ‘that which cannot be touched’ first in the purely descriptive sense of the assertion. As already shown, in fact, ‘sacred’ is the limit of the experience, what cannot be achieved by the possibility of reason and conscious representation; ‘sacred’ is the need not to situate certain information in certain points of the mental circuit and therefore ‘sacred’ is the inability to reach certain segments and certain levels of knowledge and communication. ‘Sacred’ are, finally, those dimensions of the systemic organization of natural events that are beyond human contact, that is, the ability of man to forecast, control and manipulate.

But ‘sacred’ is ‘that which cannot be touched’ even in the normative sense of the statement, as it is true that ‘sacred’ is the need to preserve certain constraints and certain properties of the mental process from the knowledge (and thus, ultimately, from the possibility of their appetitive and purposive acquisition) and not to intervene, in particular, in the functioning of mental systems of ecological size.

Recovering the initial knowledge guarded in the experience of what men call the ‘sacred’, the text of Bateson then testifies the existence of a reasonable opportunity to escape from the plant of the Western metaphysical tradition, through a critical and aware attendance of the most advanced production of this tradition itself. It opens the perspective of a research that could lead to a monistic conception of the meaning of religion, that is, towards an_alive_understanding of the intimate unity of all the reality, the absolute communality of mind and body and full immanence of the ‘sacred’ and the ‘divinity’ in the matter. This perspective already exists in the marginal and forgotten saying of mystics and great poets, but its affirmation requires the definitive overcoming of the fundamental ontological position of metaphysics, which led us to consider the being of all beings (and therefore also the being of ‘god’) as present substance, and prevents us from thinking about the pattern that connects all things, that is the very fact of their connection, as an event, a nonentity, what is_other_than the substance and the present.

“Consciousness is tending to focus in, whereas notions like the sacred and the beautiful tend to be always looking for the larger, the whole. That is why I distrust consciousness as a prime guide. [...] I think the sacramental is being damaged all the time. The damage is the taking apart. The sacredness is the coming together. The sacred is the hook up, the total hook up and not the product of the split. [...] It is always surprising when you want to do a little meditating to discover the difference between thinking of the things and thinking of the relationship between the things. This has to do with the sacred very much ”92.

Overcoming Western metaphysics means finding in the evolutionary history of our own knowledge (and in non-Western knowledge) the reasons for declaring the unsustainability of each ontological and epistemological dualism and to return the meaning of the experiences which point out our participation in the organic nature of the world to its original determination. The dualism exists initially as a possibility always open to the wandering of thought, but it also exists as a privileged form of an era of our civilization, that age we call ‘modern’. In fact belongs to this age the claim of the absolute substantial separation between mind and body, between what is material - objectively present in space and in time and what is, in this sense, not material. Also belongs to this age the whole series of antinomian oppositions that arise from this first pair by analogy and govern, on the ontic plane, our reference to entities: good vs evil, man vs nature, subject vs object, purpose vs mean, believer vs infidel, elected races vs other races, etc... This array of logical and ideological divisions cannot but have an essential relationship with the first and most rooted dualistic assumption: the one that at the beginning of European history gives birth to the idea of ‘god’ as a person (substance), a creator infinitely distant and opposed by essence (that is, in its fundamental predicates) to his creature. If the thought that thinks ‘god’ thinks the ground of beings and therefore performs an absolutely primary ontological function, then it is clear that the initial Christian consideration of ‘divinity’ and the nature of the world has the meaning of a model and an implicit legitimation for each later dualist pair. It triumphs, therefore, in the age of modern and, to the extent that Western modernity tends to become the ontic configuration of the whole planet, it is bound to find success in the ongoing transformation of all the civilizations of the globe. The issue is that, as Bateson tirelessly points out, the assumption of a metaphysical dualism, the idea of a personal god, the religion springing from this idea and the ecological crisis in which we stand, are fundamentally the same. And it is not lawful for thought, to believe that the ontic difficulties humanity is now forced to deal with can be understood apart from a critical consideration of their ontological (epistemological) premises.

Overcoming metaphysics means, therefore, on the basis of Bateson’s meditation, coming out of the modern age and its initially Christian character, that is, going all the way through it as a destiny in the space of its productions of thought and knowledge and laying from the platform of these productions themselves a bridge to an age of thought (and therefore of human history), we still know nothing about, except the fact - simple but indispensable - that its character, in the first and authentic sense, will be_post-modern_. There are perhaps reasons enough to consider the research of Bateson as an important first segment of this bridge, but you cannot be assured that this segment will be followed necessarily by others or that the outcome of such a transition will resemble the vision outlined by Bateson. But it's worth recognizing with sincerity that, observed from space of this vision, the problems certainly remain, nevertheless “the world looks more elegant than it did ...”93.
