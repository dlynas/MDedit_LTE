Class Attitudes in America

This book explains a long-standing puzzle in American politics: why so many Americans support downwardly redistributive social welfare programs, when such support seems to fly in the face of standard conceptions of the American public as antigovernment, individualistic, and racially prejudiced. Bringing class attitudes into the investigation, Spencer Piston demonstrates through rigorous empirical analysis that sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich explain American support for downwardly redistributive programs – not only those that benefit the middle class, but also those that explicitly target the poor. The book captures an important and neglected component of citizen attitudes toward a host of major public policies and candidate evaluations. It also explains why government does so little to combat economic inequality; in key instances, political elites downplay class considerations, deactivating sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich.

Spencer Piston is Assistant Professor of Political Science at Boston University. He studies the influence of attitudes toward racial and class groups on public opinion and political behavior.

# Acknowledgments

In a way, this book began when I was a community organizer for the Greater Lansing Association for Development and Empowerment (GLADE) in Lansing, Michigan. On a daily basis I worked with people who gladly paid the substantial costs of political action in order to build a more just world. They were willing to do so much in part because they saw the distribution of wealth in this country as profoundly unfair. In many cases their deepest sympathies were for the poor, and their greatest resentments were of the rich. Imagine my surprise when I began graduate school and was informed by social scientists that Americans do not care about class! Much of the evidence in this book can be viewed as corroboration of what the members of GLADE showed me long ago.

My greatest thanks go to the co-chairs of my dissertation committee: Vince Hutchings and Skip Lupia. Before I had even thought about what my dissertation might be about, I started a research paper on a separate topic and each of them met with me weekly (and sometimes more) over the winter semester of 2009. For the rest of my life I will be grateful to their contributions to that paper, to this book, and most of all to my development as a scholar. I would be remiss if I did not also mention the downside to having the two of them for advisors; because their mentorship was so exemplary, for years I was denied the opportunity to join in the graduate student ritual of complaining about faculty, which kept me from fully bonding with my peers.

Perhaps the most precious resource in graduate school is faculty time. It is only from faculty that graduate students can learn the art and science of conducting research, and there is no substitute for hours upon hours in their company, figuring out how they think. By this measure, Vince’s generosity ranks above all other faculty I have known (or heard of). I have taken up a greater portion of his time than I ever expected I would, and every hour has been well spent. Vince also provided funding for much of my time in graduate school, allowing me time to conduct much of the research presented in this book. Finally, Vince’s attention to detail, his professionalism, and above all his skepticism set an example that I hope to follow for the rest of my career. More than anything, I hope that as a professor I can be as kind and as generous to graduate students as he has been to me.

I first met Skip in his formal modeling course in 2008, and I was immediately impressed by the values that guide him as a researcher and a teacher: transparency, logic, rigor, and above all the production of knowledge of use to an audience. It has taken years to internalize these goals, but I have done so, and I am glad. Skip also has the ability, upon listening to a description of a research project, to select what is best about it and discard the rest. What he calls “just repeating back to you what you told me” has always in fact been a key contribution to my scholarship. Skip also invited me on many occasions to participate in the research process when I was a graduate student. Learning how he approaches the thorny problems associated with taking a research project from start to finish informed the process I went through that resulted in this book.

During my early stages in graduate school, I did not think I would have the chance to work with Don Kinder, as he was either chair of the department or on sabbatical while I was taking courses. Yet he took a chance on me, showing great patience in discussing my initial ramblings (that fortunately never made it into this book). It is no stretch to say that his scholarship has influenced my own more than anyone else’s has. I believe that every publication of mine cites him more than it does any other author – this book included. His research is of course widely lauded, and deservedly so; yet I wonder whether his talents as a mentor likewise receive the recognition they deserve. Don is especially gifted at detecting not only what is wrong with a project but also what could be right about it; at numerous presentations I have seen him give a single constructive comment that, if followed, would make a good project great.

Rob Mickey may be the most well-read person I know, and because of knowing him I am much more well-read than I thought I would ever be; for that by itself I am grateful. His perspective on politics is mind-boggling. It is refreshing and more than a little intimidating to discuss politics with someone who thinks as historically and globally as he does. I fear that from his vantage point this book appears thin and shallow; yet it is both thicker and deeper than it would have been without him. I caution graduate students that Rob appears to remember not only every piece of scholarship he has read, and every class for which he assigned it, but also everyone who didn’t read it. Given his intellect, it is surprising that he doesn’t value his own comments more: he is the only person I’ve ever known who told me not to write down something he was saying. He did so because it was something that had just come to mind and seemed to him to be a trivial observation. But I believe many of his top-of-the-head considerations to be more profound than many political scientists’ entire research agendas.

A number of additional people made key contributions to this project. Mary Corcoran gamely joined the dissertation committee at a late date and I am grateful for her suggestions: they proved particularly helpful as the dissertation evolved into a book. Ted Brader, John Jackson, and Chuck Shipan each played an important role in my development at the early stages of graduate school and beyond. Yanna Krupnikov and Adam Seth Levine provided valuable mentorship and friendship throughout the course of this project (and many others). Davin Phoenix taught me, and continues to teach me, that scholarship should benefit people’s lives – and not only the scholar’s.

Portions of this research have benefited from comments from participants at the 2012 Annual Meeting of the American Political Science Association, especially Philip Paolino; the 2011, 2012, and 2013 Annual Meetings of the Midwest Political Science Association, especially Chris Ellis, Nathan Kelly, Gary Segura, Taeku Lee, and Cara Wong; the 2012 Annual Meeting of the International Society of Political Psychology, especially Erin Paige Hennes; the University of Michigan’s Center for Political Studies Workshop, especially Graeme Boushey, Nancy Burns, Jowei Chen, William Roberts Clark, W. Abraham Gong, David Magleby, C. Daniel Myers, Paul Poast, Gary Uzonyi, and Nicholas A. Valentino; and participants in a graduate course taught by Ted Brader: Matias A. Bargsted, Katie Brown, Allison Dale-Riddle, Nathan P. Kalmoe, Kristyn L. Karl, Ashley Jardina, Yioryos Nardis, and Timothy J. Ryan. Also at the University of Michigan, Logan S. Casey, Daniel Mintz, Joshua Shipper, Christopher Skovron, and William Zimmerman provided helpful comments.

I also presented the research described in this book at a number of institutions, including Northwestern University, the University of Maryland, the University of Washington, the University of North Carolina, Washington University in St. Louis, Grinnell College, Villanova University, St. Olaf College, State University of New York atGeneseo, and Soka University of America. I received many helpful suggestions from members of these higher education communities, especially Antoine Banks, Tony Chen, Pam Conover, Jamie Druckman, Megan Francis, Jim Gibson, Frances Lee, Ben Page, Chris Parker, Jon Rogowski, Stella Rouse, Betsy Sinclair, Mark Smith, and Steve Smith.

After I obtained my doctoral degree from the University of Michigan, I moved to Syracuse University, and my colleagues there provided helpful advice as I worked to turn this dissertation into a book. A book workshop run by Peggy Herman, Audie Klotz, and Sue Wadley, with the generous support of the Moynihan Institute, came at the perfect time, infusing me with new energy as I reframed the project and collected additional survey data. Matt Cleary, Chris Faricy, Shana Gadarian, Brandon Metroka, and Danielle Thomsen were exceptionally helpful in reviewing critical portions of the manuscript and discussing what makes a book different from an article (and a dissertation). I was proud to be a part of the warm, constructive community created by these colleagues and friends. It was a hard place to leave, and I still miss it there.

That said, my new colleagues at Boston University could not have been more welcoming. They also provided fantastic suggestions as the book manuscript entered its final stages. I am especially grateful for comments from Taylor Boas, Dino Christenson, Katie Einstein, John Gerring, Doug Kriner, Cathie Jo Martin, David Mayers, Max Palmer, and Gina Sapiro. I cannot say enough about how happy I am to be part of the political science department at Boston University.

While I was preparing the manuscript for submission for review, Larry Bartels and Marty Gilens both challenged me to think about the book project in new ways. This slowed the process down a bit, but it was well worth the delay to incorporate their insights. Jenn Chudy, Ashley Jardina, and Nathan Kalmoe read the entire manuscript, and they each helped me with both large-scale organizational issues and important details. The participants of my undergraduate course on public opinion in the spring semester of 2017 also provided valuable comments as an important supplement to the formal review process. These participants were Lara Adekeye, Christopher Alexander, Kyle Bechet, Jacquie Carcamo, Matt Clark, Alex Coleman, Oriana Durand, Sophia Eppolito, Mark Haddad, Courtney Hagle, Saraann Kurkul, Alexa Lamanna, Daniel Lattarulo, Tara Martin-Chen, Gianpaulo Pons, Elise Renner, Curtis Stoychoff, and Sylvester Toldsted.

After the review process was complete, no single person, with the possible exception of the author, contributed to the final version of book more than Logan Strother. I tend to either get lost in the details or gloss over them; he somehow manages to look at both the forest and the trees at the same time. During the time he provided research assistance with this book, Logan’s own scholarly career went through a number of changes, including finishing his dissertation and moving to Princeton University to begin a postdoctoral fellowship. In the midst of the upheaval, his attention to this research project never flagged. Logan is a fantastic scholar, and it has been my pleasure to work with him. This book is much better for his contributions to it.

Sara Doskow at Cambridge University Press has been the editor every author wishes to have. Her thoughtful comments were especially helpful in making the book clear and accessible to a broad audience. She made the transition from book manuscript to book seamless, expertly shepherding the manuscript through the review process – I am happy to say that the comments I received from the anonymous reviewers were among the most helpful I received on the project. Sara is particularly attuned to the unique challenges faced by authors who are junior faculty members on the tenure clock. I often recommend her to my colleagues, and I will continue to do so.

Survey research costs money and takes time. This book would not have been possible without financial support from a wide range of sources. The American National Election Studies, funded by the National Science Foundation, administered questions I proposed (after review through the Online Commons Process) on the 2013 ANES Recontact Study, a re-interview of respondents to the 2012 ANES Time Series. The National Science Foundation also subsidized a module I purchased (sharing costs with Shana Gadarian, Chris Faricy, and the Campbell Institute at Syracuse University) as part of the Cooperative Congressional Election Studies (Award #1430505). While I was still at the University of Michigan, each of the following financial awards supported the collection and/or analysis of data presented in this book: the Clark & Robin Chandler Award, the William Zimmerman Award, the Rackham Centennial Fellowship Award, the Gerald R. Ford Research Grant, the Rackham Research Grant for PhD Candidates, the Rackham Research Grant for PhD Pre-Candidates, the Department of Political Science Thesis Grant, and the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program. Each of the following financial awards at Syracuse University also supported the research project reported here: the Appleby-Mosher Award, the Maxwell Summer Project Assistantship Program, and the Campbell Institute Research Grant.

I also thank Hakeem Jefferson, Rachel MacMaster, Zac Hardwick, Tara Lanigan, Laura Meyer, and Troy Schott for their exemplary research assistance.

Finally, for love and support above and beyond the world of political science, I thank my friends Benjamin Maixner, Brian Quirk, and Nadav Tanners, and my family: my parents Rob Piston and Jane Piston, my brother Drew Piston, my sister Eliza Piston, my daughter Maya Bergom, and my wife and beloved partner in life, Inger Bergom.1Introduction: Reigning Myths about Class Attitudes




# A Look Ahead

In Chapter 1]], I conduct an initial investigation of the possibility that attitudes toward poor people and rich people influence political preferences. I do so by analyzing nationally representative samples from four separate ANES surveys: those conducted in 1992, 1996, 2000, and 2008.[^42] Contrary to claims of class indifference in American politics, the results reveal that respondents frequently mention poor people and rich people when discussing what they like or dislike about political parties and candidates for public office. Furthermore, their discussions of the poor are predominantly sympathetic in nature: respondents often complain that a given candidate for office, or a given political party, does not do enough to help the poor. Meanwhile, references to the rich typically take on a resentful tone: respondents often say that they dislike a candidate or a party because that party seems to favor the interests of the rich at the expense of the interests of the rest of America.

To place the findings of these analyses in context, I also assess how often the survey respondents mention “inequality.” I do so because a vibrant strand of recent scholarship addresses the topic of how increasing economic inequality has affected public opinion in the United States.[^43] While research in this tradition is important and has yielded valuable insights, much of it begs a key question: How much do Americans rely on the concept of economic inequality to make sense of politics in the first place? Interestingly, the open-ended responses reveal only a few instances in which ordinary individuals use terminology related to inequality. This is consistent with research from Eunji Kim, Rasmus Pedersen, and Diana Mutz, which finds that economic inequality is a highly abstract concept that is often misunderstood by individuals and not tightly connected to their political judgments.[^44]

It is not at all clear, then, that ordinary individuals have economic inequality on their minds when forming their political preferences. But Americans do routinely refer to class groups such as the poor and the rich when talking about candidates for public office and political parties. The chapter concludes by charting the boundaries of the concepts “poor” and “rich” in the public mind, by asking ordinary Americans what these terms mean to them.

The responses to these open-ended questions are especially useful because they take Americans on their own terms, pointing a clear path forward for the remainder of the book. For example, I find that respondents rarely refer to subgroups of the poor (such as the “working poor,” “poor children,” or the “deserving poor”). While policymakers have often made use of such subcategories, it is not at all clear that ordinary individuals do the same. I therefore theorize and test propositions about public thinking about broad class groups – poor people and rich people – in the subsequent chapters.

Furthermore, the open-ended responses suggest that when it comes to thinking about politics, public views about poor people and rich people are unidimensional, centered on questions of deservingness. In theory, of course, it is possible for Americans to evaluate class groups along a variety of dimensions: one might, for example, resent the rich but also view rich people as talented, hard-working and intelligent. But in practice, those Americans who spontaneously mention these class groups tend to do so with one central consideration in mind; as Pamela Conover puts it, their political thinking about these groups is centered on “the desire to know who is getting what and whether they deserve it.” Those class groups perceived to get less than they deserve (typically the poor) are viewed with sympathy, and those class groups perceived to get more than they deserve (typically the rich) are viewed with resentment. I therefore place sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich at the center of the theory-building and empirical analysis of this book.

The development of a theoretical framework for this study of attitudes toward poor people and rich people in the United States is the task of Chapter 2]]. Here I grapple with four essential questions: How do Americans view the poor and the rich? Where do their attitudes about these class groups come from? Under what conditions do individuals link their class group attitudes to their political preferences? And how do attitudes toward poor people and rich people organize policy attitudes and candidate evaluations? The chapter concludes by presenting an overview of the data used to answer these questions, along with an overview of the tests of the empirical implications of the theory.

I examine the contours of public thinking about poor people and rich people in the United States in Chapter 3]]. The chapter begins by introducing and defending the strategy for measuring class group attitudes adopted here. Next, I examine responses to original survey questions in three national survey datasets. Consistent with the results of the analysis of open-ended responses in Chapter 1]], the findings demonstrate that sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich are pervasive, though far from universal, in American society today – and this has probably been true for decades. Furthermore, the multiple survey questions that are used to measure attitudes toward the poor and the rich yield similar results, leading to greater confidence in the findings.

Next, I show that sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich are stable over time. They are also distinct from such standard fixtures in contemporary accounts of public opinion as partisanship, ideological principles, beliefs about economic inequality, beliefs about economic mobility, and demographics. I find that racial prejudice plays an important role; those whites who hold negative stereotypes about blacks express less sympathy for the poor than those whites who do not. This is consistent with the finding from Chapter 2]] (and other scholarship) that many people overestimate the percentage of the public that is black. But the power of racial prejudice is limited; while it places an upper bound on sympathy for the poor, sympathy for the poor nonetheless remains widespread.

Once we recognize the importance of sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich, the scales fall from our eyes, and we see the landscape of American politics more clearly. In particular, the insights about class group attitudes gained from the analyses in Chapters 1]], [^2], and [^3] equip us admirably to address the long-standing puzzle[^45] of public support for downwardly redistributive policies: those policies that aid those at the bottom of the economic distribution or take from those at the top. Chapter 4]] begins by showing that consistent with the findings of past research, support for downwardly redistributive policies is high and stable over time, as revealed through descriptive analyses of secondary survey datasets of nationally representative samples of Americans over decades. I also scrutinize existing explanations for public opinion about downwardly redistributive policy. Research has made important advances, illuminating the importance of such factors as economic self-interest and core values or principles such as individualism and egalitarianism. Yet even after taking these factors into account, widespread American support for downwardly redistributive policy remains puzzling, particularly in the context of a few important cases in which Americans actually oppose downward redistribution. My task, therefore, is to explain both the pattern of support for downwardly redistributive policies and the exceptions to this pattern.

To do so, I conduct statistical analyses of original survey data, uncovering strong associations between class group attitudes and opinion about a wide range of policies. I also simulate what public opinion about downwardly redistributive policy would look like in the absence of sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich. The results show that class group attitudes help explain American support for downward redistribution. In comparison, beliefs about economic inequality and beliefs about upward economic mobility are only weakly associated with policy opinion.

But the survey data also suggest that in some key cases such as the federal estate tax and the homeowners’ mortgage interest tax deduction, wide swaths of the American public are not informed about the distributive consequences of policy. I test the consequences of this ignorance through a series of embedded survey experiments in Chapter 5]]: some subjects, but not others, are randomly assigned to exposure to information about who benefits from, and who pays the costs of, these policies.[^46] I find that among those subjects exposed to information, downward redistribution is much more popular than among those subjects not exposed to information. Furthermore, this effect is driven by those individuals who are high on sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich.

Taken together, these findings imply that sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich bolster support for downward redistribution – but only when one key condition is met. When Americans know which class groups are the likely beneficiaries (or victims) of a policy, they are able to bring their attitudes toward these class groups to bear on their opinion about the policy. In such cases, sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich lead many Americans to support downwardly redistributive policies. But for an important set of policies, it is not clear to most Americans who reaps the benefits and who pays the costs. In these cases, Americans are unable to bring their class group attitudes to bear on their policy opinions, and support for downward redistribution remains low. Sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich help us understand why – and when – majorities of Americans support downward redistribution.

The influence of class group attitudes extends beyond the domain of policy opinion. In many cases, sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich organize public thinking about political candidates as well. In Chapter 6]], I present the results of original survey experiments that isolate the effects of a hypothetical candidate’s legislative record on public support for the candidate. Contrary to reigning myths about how Americans think about class, the results suggest that a candidate actually becomes more popular if his record indicates that he is likely to use government to transfer resources to the poor. Critically, these results do not appear to be driven by social desirability pressures – that is, by the desire for survey respondents to conform to social norms.

Building on these experimental results, the chapter next moves outside the laboratory, examining the effects of attitudes toward poor people and rich people on vote choice in real-world elections. I begin by returning to the open-ended survey responses presented in Chapter 1]], this time focusing on the 2008 presidential election. In the nationally representative 2008 American National Election Studies time series survey, respondents were asked to say in their own words whether there is anything about Obama that would make them want to vote for him (or make them not want to vote for him), and respondents were also asked the same about McCain. I focus on those responses that include mentions of poor people and rich people, and the results add up to a clear advantage for Obama. While there is important variation in these responses, on balance they reveal confidence that Obama would look out for the interests of the poor, combined with fear that a McCain presidency would benefit the rich. This analysis is not definitive, but it does corroborate the evidence provided in the experiments; Americans tell us that all else equal, they will reward those candidates who seek to help the poor or hurt the rich.

Next, I analyze the role of class group attitudes in the presidential election of 2012. By the time of this election (unlike in 2008), I had developed measures of sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich. This makes possible a quantitative analysis of associations between class group attitudes and vote choice, again through the use of nationally representative ANES survey data. As discussed above, those social scientists who study vote choice rarely include class attitudes in their analyses. My findings suggest that this omission leads to a pinched sense of the considerations that influence Americans’ voting decisions. After holding constant standard political variables such as partisanship, ideological principles, racial attitudes, and demographics, I find that attitudes toward class groups were tightly bound up with the voting decisions of American citizens in the 2012 presidential election. On balance, it appears that class group attitudes benefited Obama: sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich bolstered his vote share at the expense of Romney’s.

Finally, a statistical analysis of the 2016 election reveals that resentment of the rich helps explain Sanders’ unlikely run in the Democratic presidential primary; however, attitudes toward the poor and the rich had little impact on the general election between Clinton and Trump. In key instances, then – though not in all – class group attitudes help Americans decide who they want to represent them in public office.

The findings discussed so far reveal important evidence in support of the proposition that sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich are important ingredients in the stew of considerations that influence public thinking about policy and candidates for public office.[^47] But as powerful as sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich are, they have not proven potent enough to abate rising economic inequality. Why is the gap between the poor and the rich increasing so rapidly, seemingly unabated by government action? Chapter 7]] reviews a number of possible answers to this question from existing literature and also explores two additional possibilities. First, it is likely that public officials and interest groups have made the same mistake as academics, misperceiving the American public’s attitudes toward class groups. It is for this reason, I argue, that many candidates for public office avoid talking about poverty and wealth in the contemporary United States:[^48] they underestimate the extent, and the power, of sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich. Second, even when political elites perceive public attitudes toward class groups correctly, they do not necessarily heed the wishes of the public. Rather, political elites attempt to shape public opinion about policy by framing issues in ways that downplay the relevance of class. In an additional survey experiment examining opinion about the estate tax, I show that this strategy makes it less likely that the public will bring sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich to bear on policy opinion, thereby decreasing mass support for downward redistribution. Due to the misperceptions and strategic actions of political elites, then, sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich can coexist with increasing economic inequality.

Donald Trump’s election to the presidency represents another key case in which attitudes toward poor people and rich people proved politically unimportant. In contrast to the 2012 presidential contest between Obama and Romney, neither Trump nor Clinton provided the public with clear, consistent messages about the likelihood that their policy proposals would help or hurt poor people or rich people. On numerous occasions, Trump suggested that he would raise taxes on the rich and increase spending on a variety of social welfare programs. Clinton, meanwhile, rarely talked about poverty and wealth – while her primary opponent, Bernie Sanders, had made increased taxes on the rich the centerpiece of his campaign. This is not to say that class was irrelevant to the election. It is possible, for example, that Donald Trump won over much of the white working class on his behalf, although Nicholas Carnes and Noam Lupu’s analysis of recent survey data suggests that this is unlikely; the best available evidence suggests that Trump’s victories were with white people in general rather than with class subgroups of white people in particular.[^49] In any case, more important for the purposes of this book is that in the 2016 presidential election, clear cues about where the candidates stood with respect to poor people and rich people were not easily found. As a result, I find, sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich had little effect on Americans’ voting decisions. This finding further reinforces my contention that the political importance of these attitudes toward class groups is variable.

I draw all of these various results together and explore their implications for the character and quality of American democracy in the book’s conclusion. One of the primary purposes of democratic forms of government is to represent the will of the people. For this reason, foundational theories in political science hold that in democratic forms of government, economic inequality should be low, as majorities of Americans will vote to redistribute wealth downward. Yet the book illuminates a disconnect between American political preferences and policy outcomes: while majorities of Americans believe the poor to have less than they deserve and the rich to have more, the gap between the richest and the rest has been widening for decades, and government does much less than it might to aid its poorest citizens. The concluding chapter discusses reasons for this breakdown in majoritarian democracy. It also examines the implications of this book’s findings for scholars’ understanding of a range of important topics, including public opinion and political behavior, economic inequality in the contemporary United States, race and welfare state policy, and unequal government responsiveness to American citizens. I conclude on an optimistic note, identifying a path forward for activists and policymakers who, like me, are troubled by abject poverty in the midst of decadent wealth.In Their Own Words










# Conclusion

In this chapter, I have mapped out the territory ahead, providing a better sense of the phenomena under investigation: American attitudes toward the poor and the rich. This brush-clearing exercise is also important for its own sake, as it yields important substantive insights. Chief among these is that Americans seem to think about poor people and rich people fairly often when forming their evaluations of political entities such as the two major parties and candidates for public office. This is especially interesting because a common scholarly approach to this topic is to conduct survey analyses of American beliefs about economic inequality. Yet when we ask Americans to talk about politics in their own words, they rarely use inequality terminology, but mention “the poor” and “the rich” frequently. If I had only analyzed mentions of economic inequality, I would have erroneously concluded that the American public does not think about class when forming political judgments.

Additionally, ordinary Americans’ discussions of poor people and rich people follow consistent patterns. The most common portrayal of the poor is as a group that receives insufficient assistance, such that a political party or candidate who helps the poor merits accolades. The rich, meanwhile, are often depicted as receiving too much help from government; by this logic, a political party or candidate who channels resources toward them warrants condemnation.

As will be seen, a key claim in this book is that sympathy for the poor is widespread among the American public – to which a skeptic might respond: “Which poor?” While subcategories of “deserving” and “undeserving” poor have dominated the discourse of policymaking elites, it is not clear that the thinking of the mass public follows this distinction. Political elites might well have a variety of subgroups in mind when they design policy, such as “able-bodied poor people,” “the working poor,” “the white poor,” or “poor children” – but the public at large appears to have a broader focus on poor people in general.

We also have a rough sense of what individuals mean by the terms “poor” and “rich.” To be sure, people do not come to unanimous agreement on the precise boundary lines of “poor” and “rich” categories, and their conceptions of poverty overrepresent black people. But the boundaries of poverty do not need to be clear, accurate, or universally shared for attitudes about poor people to figure into mass political judgments.

Indeed, the evidence so far suggests that these attitudes toward class groups are bound up with how Americans think about politics. That is, the concepts “poor” and “rich” do appear to figure in the political judgments of at least some Americans. There appears to be potential, then, in an approach that places class attitudes front and center. In the next chapter]], I develop a theoretical framework of attitudes toward the poor and the rich and the political consequences of these attitudes.A Theory of Attitudes toward Class Groups and Their Political Consequences




















# Conclusion

In this chapter I have developed expectations about the character of two attitudes toward class groups and their importance to public opinion. The theoretical framework presented here integrates the open-ended responses discussed in the previous chapter, existing findings about class group attitudes from across the social sciences, and research on group attitudes from the discipline of social psychology. I argue that many Americans view the poor with sympathy and the rich with resentment. Sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich are two distinct attitudes that are shaped by fundamental processes of social learning that vary across geographic contexts. These attitudes toward poor people and rich people have the potential to influence public evaluations of policies and political candidates in powerful ways. This potential is realized under two conditions. The first is when it is clear how the poor and the rich are affected by the policy or candidate under evaluation; the second is when issues are framed in ways that emphasize rather than downplay class considerations.

Much of the remainder of this book is devoted to testing the empirical implications of these theoretical propositions. In the next chapter]], I examine whether sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich are widespread, able to be measured reliably, and distinct from standard political predispositions. Then, in Chapters 4]] and [^5], I investigate my contention that sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich influence opinion about redistributive policy, but only when the distributive consequences of policy are clear. In Chapter 6]], I seek to determine whether sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich influenced candidate evaluations in recent elections – those in which it was clear how the candidates would benefit or victimize these class groups. Finally, in Chapter 7]] I analyze two recent instances in which political elites downplayed or obscured class considerations: in debates about the estate tax and in the 2016 presidential election. In these instances, I test my expectation that attitudes toward the poor and the rich had little influence on public thinking. Taken together, these analyses allow me to assess the empirical support for my claim that the sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich powerfully influence public opinion, but only under certain political circumstances.

The theoretical claims I advanced in this chapter are inconsistent with prevailing conceptions of the mass public in the United States. One common view is that the American public is unconcerned with class, at least when considering politics. Indeed, the absence of attitudes toward class groups in canonical models of policy opinion and vote choice suggests, by implication, that class thinking is irrelevant to public opinion.[^93] Another is that when public does think about class, it tends to do so in ways that derogate the poor and praise the rich. The argument I have put forward here will be tested against these rival understandings in the remainder of this book.Attitudes toward the Poor and the Rich in the United States


# How Americans View the Poor and the Rich

High-quality measures of attitudes toward the poor and the rich do not exist in available data. The American National Election Studies includes feeling-thermometer scores about these class groups, which are ratings of how the respondent feels toward these groups from 0 (cold) to 100 (warm). These measures are adequate and will be examined in the sections that follow, but they also have serious limitations. Chief among these is that it is not clear whether a person who rates a class group at a “70” actually feels less warmly toward the group than another respondent who rates the group at an “80.”[^1] Perhaps more importantly, such measures also fail to capture important “affective reactions differentiated beyond liking and disliking” – here, of course, the affective reactions I am interested in are sympathy and resentment.[^2]

Accordingly, in this section I present the results of original surveys that measure attitudes toward the poor and the rich. Prior to conducting the research presented here, I administered a pilot study to a convenience sample of 135 adults (through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform) in April 2012; subjects responded to open-ended questions about class politics in the United States, and I studied their responses in order to determine the vernacular through which attitudes toward poor people and rich people are expressed, so that I could develop question batteries.[^3] Based on these responses as well as the open-ended responses to the ANES discussed in Chapter 1]], and following Conover’s “cognitive-affective model of the role of social groups in political thinking,” I developed survey questions measuring attitudes toward the poor and the rich. These questions ask about deservingness – whether the poor and the rich have more or less money than they deserve – and about “stored affective reactions” to these class groups, including sympathy, compassion, anger, and resentment.[^4] The questions are listed in Figure 3.1]].

1. For each of the following groups, please say whether most people in the group have more money than they deserve, less money than they deserve, or about the right amount of money.

POOR PEOPLE, RICH PEOPLE

2. How often have you felt each of the following toward POOR PEOPLE?

Compassion, Sympathy, Anger, Resentment

3. How often have you felt each of the following toward RICH PEOPLE?

Compassion, Sympathy, Anger, Resentment

Notes: Response options for Question 1 are: A LOT MORE money than they deserve, SOMEWHAT MORE money than they deserve, SLIGHTLY MORE money than they deserve, About the right amount of money, SLIGHTLY LESS money than they deserve, SOMEWHAT LESS money than they deserve, A LOT LESS money than they deserve. Response options for Questions 2 and 3 are: Always, Most of the time, About half the time, Once in a while, Never. Furthermore, while the above is accurate for the 2013 YouGov Study and the 2014 CCES Module, the questions on the 2013 ANES Recontact Survey were different in two ways, because of changes to the question wording made by the ANES. First, the wording for Question 1 was “The right amount of money” rather than “About the right of money.” Second, “Disgust” was asked rather than “Resentment” for Questions 2 and 3.

Figure 3.1

Question wording of sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich

Conover writes that political thinking about social groups is dominated by “the desire to know who is getting what and whether they deserve it.”[^5] To some readers, it might go without saying that the poor have less than they deserve while the rich have more. Yet existing scholarship does not necessarily support this expectation. If the logic of individualism dominates public thinking – if, that is, sociologists Kluegel and Smith are correct that individuals are held “personally responsible” for their “economic fate” – we should expect that both the poor and the rich will be perceived to have exactly what they deserve: no more, no less.[^6] Or, if Americans are persuaded by the Wall Street Journal’s[^7] description of the poor as “lucky duckies” (since they pay no federal income tax), and if they view the rich as “job creators” unfairly penalized by government, they should actually expect poor people to have more than they deserve and rich people to have less.

Leading theories in social psychology might also lead us to expect that the poor are viewed more negatively than the rich. According to social dominance theory,[^8] for example, high-status groups maintain their position in the social hierarchy through “legitimizing myths” – widely shared cultural ideologies denigrating low-status groups (such as the poor) and extolling high-status groups (such as the rich). Relatedly, both just world theory[^9] and system justification theory[^10] argue that individuals possess a psychological motivation to view existing social arrangements as fair outcomes, leading them to view low-status groups as deserving of their inferior position and high-status groups as worthy of their privilege.

Against these common claims, I test my expectation that sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich are widespread. I do so by analyzing the distribution of responses to the deservingness question for the poor in three studies: the 2013 ANES Recontact Survey, the 2013 YouGov Study, and the 2014 CCES Module (Figure 3.2]]). Consistent with my expectations, but inconsistent with claims from existing scholarship, in all three national samples majorities of respondents report that the poor have less than they deserve. That said, the figure also reveals substantial variation in the responses. Some respondents appear to follow the logic articulated by Kluegel and Smith that people get what they deserve: across the three studies, between 20 and 35 percent of respondents claim that the poor have about the right amount of money.[^11] Other respondents share the view of the editorial in the Wall Street Journal that the poor have more than they deserve – but these respondents only make up about 5 percent of the sample in each of the studies. The modal response, then, is that the poor have less than they deserve, while important heterogeneity also exists.

![[42698fig4_2.png]]

Figure 3.2

Perceptions of deservingness of the poor and the rich

y-axis values indicate the percentage of respondents that gave each response option (response options shown on the x-axis). The data source is given in the heading for each chart. Exact question wording is provided in Figure 3.1]].

Also consistent with my expectations, the distribution of attitudes toward the rich approximates the inverse of the distribution of attitudes toward the poor. Majorities of respondents report that the rich have more than they deserve across all three studies. We also see heterogeneity in responses once again: between 30 and 45 percent of respondents claim that the rich have about the right amount of money. Finally, some respondents, albeit less than 5 percent in each of the three datasets, claim that the rich have less than they deserve.

I now turn to emotional reactions to the poor and the rich, presented in Figure 3.3]]. When interpreting these results, it is important to remember that as a general rule, survey respondents less often express negative attitudes than positive attitudes toward social groups.[^12] It is not surprising, therefore, that subjects report feeling sympathy more often on average than resentment. Bearing this in mind, the comparisons between attitudes toward the poor and attitudes toward the rich are instructive. Across the three studies, respondents are about four to six times as likely to express sympathy toward the poor as toward the rich. Furthermore, respondents are only about half as likely to express resentment toward the poor as toward the rich. The additional emotions questions reveal similar patterns.

![[42698fig4_3.png]]

Figure 3.3

Sympathy and resentment toward the poor and the rich

y-axis values indicate the percentage of respondents feeling the indicated emotion “always,” “most of the time,” or “half the time.” The ANES 2013 Recontact Study is not included in the second figure because it asks about “disgust” instead of “resentment.”

One might wonder whether the finding that the poor are viewed more positively than the rich is limited to the early twenty-first century, which includes one of the biggest recessions in American history as well as the Occupy Wall Street movement. While I cannot of course ask respondents from previous points in history survey questions that I developed recently, I can use what measures exist in available data. Relying on American National Election Time Series cross-sectional surveys dating back to 1993 (the earliest year containing a thermometer score for the rich), I compare feeling thermometer scores toward the poor and the rich in Figure 3.4]].

![[42698fig4_4.png]]

Figure 3.4

The poor have been viewed more warmly than the rich for decades

Bars represent average feeling thermometer scores (0–100; high scores indicate greater warmth) for all respondents in a given year; analyses are weighted to approximate national representativeness. Missing bars indicate that feeling thermometer questions about the group were not asked in that year. Also, terminology varies somewhat across years for the rich: in 1993 and 1994, the term “wealthy” is used, while in the other years, the term “rich” is used.

Source: American National Election Time Series Surveys.

The results show that on balance, the American public views the poor more warmly than the rich across the period of examination, even during the period of welfare reform in the early- to mid-1990s. It is also important to note that while at first it might seem that the rich are still viewed somewhat favorably – above the midpoint of “50” in all years – this appears to reflect a general tendency for respondents to resist reporting cold feelings toward groups. As Larry Bartels has noted, placing these attitudes in context with attitudes toward other groups reveals that the poor are rated relatively high, on par with other popular groups such as Christians and the military, while the rich are rated quite low, in company with other unpopular groups such as atheists and feminists.[^13]

In sum, the results are remarkably consistent. Whether the survey question asks about deservingness, emotional reactions, or warmth, the dominant attitude toward the poor is one of sympathy and the dominant attitude toward the rich is one of resentment – across multiple nationally representative samples and across multiple points in time. Again, important variation in these attitudes also exists: later chapters will examine whether this variation is politically consequential.

# Assessing the Validity of Measures of Sympathy for the Poor and Resentment of the Rich

It is important to be certain that the questions used here are valid measures of attitudes toward the poor and the rich. I therefore combine the questions about deservingness and emotional reactions to these groups (weighted equally) into two separate indices – one measuring sympathy for the poor and another measuring resentment of the rich – and then subject these indices to validation tests.[^14]

One way to assess the validity of an index of survey questions is to assess the extent to which responses to one question in the index correlate with responses to another question in the index. For example, those respondents who report that they feel sympathy for the poor should also be likely to claim that the poor have less than they deserve. Indeed, the indices hang together well across all three national datasets. The Cronbach’s alpha for the index of sympathy for the poor is 0.74 in the YouGov 2013 sample, 0.72 in the CCES 2014 sample, and 0.72 in the 2013 ANES sample; the Cronbach’s alpha for the index of resentment of the rich is 0.79 in the YouGov 2013 sample, 0.76 in the CCES 2014 sample, and 0.73 in the 2013 ANES sample. These tests of internal reliability support the conclusion that the indices presented here are valid measures of attitudes toward the poor and rich.

Another validation test is to examine whether these indices of class group attitudes are stable over time. This is especially important given the theoretical expectation, developed in the previous chapter]], that attitudes toward the poor and rich are predispositions: meaningful and stable attitudes, not fleeting top-of-the-head considerations. The three national surveys presented above were too expensive to allow me to interview the same respondent at more than one point in time, but I did conduct a two-wave panel survey of a convenience sample of Mechanical Turk respondents (n = 1,585) between June and August of 2012; the time between the waves ranged from six to twelve weeks. For the sympathy for the poor index, the wave 1-wave 2 correlation is 0.73, and the correlation for the resentment of the rich index is 0.69. This is an admittedly brief time period, but it does speak to the test-retest reliability of the measures. By comparison, the correlation for a standard index of questions measuring another important and stable predisposition, the value of limited government, is 0.73.[^15]

To examine further the question of whether class group attitudes are stable over a longer time period, I now turn to the 2000–2002–2004 American National Election Studies panel, which uses a nationally representative sample. The survey contains an identical feeling-thermometer measure of attitudes toward the poor (but not the rich), which allows me to compare responses from the same individuals across different points in time. As Table 3.1]] shows, responses to the feeling thermometer about poor people at one point in time are moderately associated with responses to same question at another point in time, up to four years later. Critically, these over-time correlations are of similar magnitudes to over-time correlations of measures of attitudes well known to be stable over time: attitudes about race.

Table 3.1 Continuity of Individual-Level Attitudes toward the Poor (2000–2002–2004 ANES Panel)

||Poor people|Whites|Blacks|Hispanic-Americans|Asian-Americans|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|2000–2002|0.37|0.35|0.35|0.40|0.37|
|2002–2004|0.36|0.32|0.38|0.46|0.40|
|2000–2004|0.46|0.38|0.41|0.43|0.45|

Cell entries are Pearson’s correlation coefficients between warmth (0–100 feeling thermometer) toward the indicated social group in one year and in another (see left-most column). This analysis reveals that attitudes toward poor people are as stable as attitudes toward racial and pan-ethnic groups.

As a final series of tests of the validity of the measures of class group attitudes developed here, I examine whether these measures relate to other variables in predictable ways. I begin by noting that sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich appear to be independent attitudes, as correlations between the two are low to moderate: 0.20 in the YouGov 2013 Study, 0.21 in the CCES 2014 Module, and 0.25 in the ANES 2013 Survey. This is as expected, since at least some antecedents of sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich should be different; for example, personality traits we would expect to facilitate sympathy, such as trait empathic concern,[^16] are independent of those that we would expect to facilitate resentment, such as trait aggression.[^17] Similarly, we might expect that ethnocentrism, or the general tendency to prefer ingroups to outgroups, should be negatively associated with sympathy for the poor but positively associated with resentment of the rich.[^18] The low correlations are also consistent with a small proportion of open-ended responses (Chapter 1]]): some survey respondents express negative sentiments toward both the poor and the rich, arguing that the poor get help from government, the rich do not need help, and the middle class get left out.

Next, I examine associations between attitudes toward class groups and an array of traditional variables of interest to political scientists in Table 3.2]]. These analyses rely heavily on the 2013 ANES Recontact Survey, supplementing when necessary from the 2013 YouGov Study and the 2014 CCES Module. The table, which presents bivariate Pearson’s correlation coefficients, indicates that those respondents who subscribe to negative stereotypes about blacks or report indifference to black suffering are somewhat less likely to feel sympathy to the poor. These racial attitudes are not tightly associated with resentment of the rich, however. This is consistent with expectations, given that the poor are disproportionately perceived to be black (Chapter 1]]).

Cell entries are Pearson’s correlation coefficients. The primary data source is the 2013 ANES; the 2013 YouGov Study and the 2014 CCES Module are used to supplement when questions are not available in the 2013 ANES. Republican, Conservative, Humanitarianism, Egalitarianism, Limited Government, Education, and Income indicated respectively by abbreviations.

Associations between class group attitudes and partisan ideological orientations also yield predictable results. Republicans and conservatives are less likely than Democrats and liberals to report both sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich. Those with humanitarian principles are more likely to report sympathy for the poor (but no more likely to report resentment of the rich), consistent with the contention that humanitarianism captures the belief that concrete groups are in need of assistance.[^19] Those with egalitarian principles, meanwhile, are more likely than their counterparts to report both sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich. This is also as expected, given that extreme poverty and wealth are likely to be perceived to violate egalitarian principles. Finally, those who believe in the value of limited government are relatively unlikely to sympathize with the poor and resent the rich; while I did not anticipate this result, it may be that beliefs about the proper size of government are contingent on perceptions of which groups are perceived to benefit from government action. In sum, those who sympathize with the poor and resent the rich are more likely to stake out liberal positions when it comes to evaluations of the parties, ideological self-identification, and core values or principles. Yet the strength of these relationships is moderate at best: class group attitudes appear independent of these standard political variables.

Existing research has also illuminated the importance of beliefs about economic outcomes, and here we see limited relationships between such beliefs and attitudes toward class groups. Those who believe that income inequality is a bad thing, for example, are slightly more likely to sympathize with the poor and resent the rich. Those who believe success is the result of hard work rather than luck, meanwhile, are relatively likely to resent the rich and relatively unlikely to sympathize with the poor, although the correlation here is weak. Perceptions of economic mobility are also related to class group attitudes: those who think they are likely to become rich someday are less likely to resent the rich and (very slightly) less likely to feel sympathy for the poor, while those who think they are likely to become poor are somewhat more likely to sympathize with the poor and resent the rich. Attitudes toward class groups, then, are related to, yet differentiable from, beliefs about economic outcomes.

Finally, demographic characteristics are not tightly bound up with class attitudes. Income is slightly negatively correlated with sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich, but no other consistent patterns are evident. Sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich pervade social divisions among the mass American public.

# Conclusion

This chapter has shown that many Americans view the poor with sympathy and the rich with resentment. Furthermore, these class group attitudes can be measured reliably: the indices hang together well, they are stable over time, and they correlate with other variables in predictable ways. Finally, there is important variation in attitudes toward the poor and the rich. I now turn to the task of assessing whether this variation is consequential for Americans’ political preferences.Why So Many Americans Support Downward Redistribution


# A Puzzling Pattern

Why are so many welfare state programs so popular in the United States? As scholars have argued for decades,[^7] and as confirmed by my original data in Table 4.1]], majorities of Americans prefer increased government spending on the elderly, making college affordable, and improving public health. They also support tax breaks on college expenses, student loans, and health care expenses. Perhaps these policy attitudes could be explained by self-interest, if Americans are thinking of themselves as likely to become elderly (if they are not elderly already), to attend college or have children or grandchildren who will attend college, or to become ill. But we also see that pluralities, and often even majorities, of Americans also support policies that do not appear to benefit them directly: increased government spending on aid to the poor and the homeless as well as tax breaks on low-income earners. Furthermore, the strong tendency even among Republicans and conservatives is to support these policies, although support is somewhat reduced among these groups. The results also do not change much if the analyses are restricted to respondents in the top third of the income distribution. Widespread public support for downward redistribution in the United States cannot easily be explained by partisanship, ideology, or self-interest.

One might interpret support for government efforts to redistribute wealth downward as consistent with past findings that Americans subscribe to on one hand a general, philosophic conservatism and on the other a pragmatic liberalism when it comes to specific policy programs.[^8] While this interpretation undoubtedly fits many aspects of public opinion, it falls a bit short here. Majority support for increased government efforts to redistribute wealth downward extends beyond specific policy programs to general orientations,[^9] such as the objective of reducing the gap between the rich and poor and the broad goal of bringing all families up to the poverty line. Public support for downward redistribution is evident in both practice and principle.

More puzzling still is that the findings in the table show important exceptions to the dominant pattern of American “strong and sustained support for concrete policies that would expand opportunity and reduce economic inequality.”[^10] As previous research has found, some forms of government spending are unpopular, such as welfare and aid to blacks. This exception has been explained by existing scholarship[^11] as follows: a subgroup of the poor, welfare recipients, are commonly viewed as lazy and therefore undeserving, in part due to white prejudice against African Americans and racialized depictions of poverty. But there are additional exceptions, such as the federal estate tax on large inheritances; this downwardly redistributive policy is also unpopular, a fact that scholars have struggled to explain.[^12] Its unpopularity cannot be explained by either resistance to taxes generally[^13] or resistance to taxing the wealthy in particular; the table also shows that taxes on those making more than $250,000 per year, as well as taxes on millionaires, are quite popular. Neither does the popularity of these downwardly redistributive taxation policies cohere easily with widespread support for the home mortgage tax interest deduction, a highly upwardly redistributive policy.[^14] What we need is an explanation of not only the pattern of support for downward redistribution but also important exceptions to this pattern.







# If Sympathy for the Poor and Resentment of the Rich Were to Evaporate, What Would Happen to Public Opinion about Redistributive Policy?

An additional implication of the argument that attitudes toward class groups explain the popularity of downwardly redistributive policy is as follows: if sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich were to evaporate, public support for downwardly redistributive policy would decline precipitously. In order to assess this implication, I now generate simulated values of policy opinion based on the regression models presented above. All control variables are set to their means, and sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich are set to their lowest values.[^50]

The results of these simulations, presented in Figure 4.4]], suggest that sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich play an important role in bolstering public support for downward redistribution. The y-axis of the figure presents average opinion; since the coding is transformed onto a 0 to 1 scale, values greater than 0.5 indicate that average opinion is favorable toward the policy, while values less than 0.5 indicate that average opinion is unfavorable. The black bars indicate actual average opinion about each policy, while the gray bars indicate simulated opinion: what the average opinion about each policy would be in the absence of sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich.

Figure 4.4

Simulating support for social welfare policies in the absence of sympathy for the poor, resentment of the rich

Black bars indicate the respondents’ average level of support for each policy, transformed on a 0 to 1 scale, where 0 is the lowest and 1 the highest level of support. Gray bars represent the respondents’ average level of simulated support for each policy when sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich are set at the lowest possible value, based on regression analyses presented in the Appendix (4a, 4b, and 4c).

A comparison between the black and the gray bars suggests that the average level of support for these downwardly redistributive policies would plunge in the absence of sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich. Support for increased government spending on aid to the unemployed, for example, would be cut by more than three-quarters, dropping from 0.61 to 0.13. Support for government efforts to reduce the gap between the rich and poor, meanwhile, would be halved, declining from 0.50 to 0.24. Other policy changes are of similar magnitudes, with two exceptions: for taxes on those who make more than $250,000 per year and taxes on millionaires, support does not drop as precipitously.[^51] Still, the balance of the findings indicates that support for a wide range of downwardly redistributive policies would decline substantially if sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich were to disappear. Sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich help explain why Americans support downward redistribution.



# Conclusion

I have argued that political scientists have yet to provide a compelling account of support for downward redistribution in the United States.[^53] To be sure, social scientists have conducted valuable analyses of the determinants of public attitudes about economic inequality and government-led downward redistribution.[^54] However, this line of research has been more productive at explaining opposition to downwardly redistributive policies than support for such policies, even though the latter is much more common.

Therefore, I have presented a powerful explanation for the long-standing puzzle of widespread public support for downward redistribution. When it is clear how a policy will benefit (or hurt) the poor or the rich, sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich bolster support for downward redistribution. But in other cases, the public is ignorant about the distributive consequences about the policy under consideration. What happens in these cases? The next chapter]] investigates this question.The Role of Political Knowledge


# The Role of Political Knowledge

The analyses conducted so far have examined “most likely” test cases of the proposition that sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich bolster public support for downwardly redistributive policies. Survey questions that spell out class consequences of public policy satisfy a critical condition for the influence of group attitudes on public opinion: as Phil Converse explains, “the actor himself must perceive some meaningful link between membership in a particular group and preference for a particular party or policy alternative.”[^1] Group attitudes are most likely to be associated with responses to survey questions about policy opinion when the link “is made explicit by the very nature of the situation,” as they have been in the survey questions analyzed as dependent variables so far. To be sure, such survey questions are perfectly appropriate, as they reflect many real-world policy debates. For example, on November 5, 2014, voters in four states, Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska, and South Dakota, passed legislation raising the minimum wage. It is likely that as in the survey questions asked here, voters perceived the minimum wage to benefit the poor, since the policy explicitly singles out those at the bottom of the economic distribution as beneficiaries. The analyses conducted up to this point, then, reflect an important subcategory of real-world political activity.

But when the link between class groups and policy opinions is less explicit, political knowledge plays a critical moderating role. Converse argues that the following condition is necessary for group attitudes to shape an individual’s evaluation of a policy:



# Why Is the Estate Tax So Unpopular?

I now turn to two prominent exceptions to the pattern of public support for downwardly redistributive policies: opinion about the federal estate tax and the home mortgage interest deduction (HMID). I begin with the estate tax, a federal tax on large inheritances.[^5] Previous research has shown that this policy is unpopular.[^6] I argue that this is because many people are not aware that only the richest Americans pay the costs of the estate tax; they are therefore unable to bring resentment of the rich to bear on their opinions. If the public were better informed, resentment of the rich would become activated, increasing support for the estate tax.

The proposition that Americans are not aware who pays the costs of the estate tax follows existing research. Bartels’ analysis of the 2003 NPR/Kaiser Foundation/Kennedy School survey, for example, finds that “two-thirds of the American public apparently failed to recognize the single most important fact about the estate tax: that it is paid only by very wealthy people.”[^7] That said, my argument that ignorance about the estate tax helps explain its unpopularity directly contradicts some prominent scholarship on the topic. For example, Graetz and Shapiro’s comprehensive account of estate tax repeal in 2001 argues that ignorance about the estate tax had little to do with public opinion: “folk wisdom in Washington, which attributes the widespread support for repeal to the gap between belief, rhetoric, and reality, misses the real story”[^8] – which, they argue, is the success of conservative groups at framing the estate tax as a moral issue. Graetz and Shapiro do not provide rigorous analysis of survey data in support of their claims; but Bartels does, and he reaches similar conclusions about the irrelevance of political knowledge. Bartels’ observational analysis finds that “better-informed people in the 2002 NES survey were actually slightly more likely than those who were less well-informed to favor repeal.”[^9] He concludes that, “even if the entire public somehow became splendidly well-informed about politics and public affairs, the overall distribution of public opinion about estate tax would change rather little.”[^10]

Yet because Bartels’ analysis relies on the 2002 ANES, it is not possible for him to include a measure of knowledge about the estate tax. Neither can his analysis include a direct measure of more general knowledge about politics; as Bartels laments, “Unfortunately, the 2002 NES survey did not include [a] battery of factual questions about politics.” He therefore understandably relies on the best available measure, which consists of interviewer assessments of respondents’ political information. But serious critiques of the interviewer assessments have emerged, leading some scholars to conclude that they should be significantly modified or abolished entirely.[^11]

To build on this important line of scholarship, therefore, I conducted a survey experiment[^12] in the 2014 CCES Module. Of the experimental subjects analyzed here, half were randomly assigned to the Ask Condition, which includes a direct measure of knowledge about the estate tax. These respondents were asked, “What percentage of Americans have a large enough estate to be affected by the federal ‘estate tax’ on inheritances?” The other half, in the Tell Condition, were informed that “only the wealthiest 0.14 percent of Americans, those individuals who have over $5.25 million, have a large enough estate to be affected by the federal ‘estate tax’ on inheritances.” Next, all respondents were asked whether they favor or oppose the estate tax.

This approach improves on previous research by measuring the impact of information on opinion about the estate tax with substantially more precision. It enables an assessment of the impact of ignorance about the estate tax in two complementary ways: correlational, by looking within the Ask Condition for associations between ignorance and opinion about the estate tax, and experimental, by comparing opinion about the tax across the Ask and Tell Conditions.[^13]

Beginning with the correlational approach, I look within the Ask Condition, in which no respondents were informed that only the wealthiest respondents are affected by the estate tax. Consistent with the findings of previous research, the tax is unpopular: only 17 percent of respondents support the tax, while 49 percent oppose it (the remainder neither support nor oppose). Also reinforcing previous results is the finding that ignorance about the estate tax is widespread, as shown in Figure 5.2]]. Less than 13 percent of respondents correctly respond that less than one percent of individuals were eligible for the estate tax.

![[42698fig6_2.png]]

Figure 5.2

Widespread ignorance about who is affected by the Federal estate tax (2014 CCES Module)

Respondents are asked what is the percentage of individuals who are wealthy enough to be subject to the federal estate tax. Very few respondents correctly report that less than 1 percent of individuals have to pay this tax.

Next, we see that this more fine-grained measure of knowledge about the estate tax in the 2014 CCES Module allows me to detect some effects that elided some previous research on the topic. Among those respondents who incorrectly respond that more than 1 percent of households are eligible for the tax, only 15 percent support the tax, while 50 percent oppose it (again, the remainder neither support nor oppose). In contrast, among those who respond that only the wealthiest 1 percent (or less than the wealthiest 1 percent) of households are eligible, a narrow plurality support the tax, 36 percent, while 35 percent oppose it. Contrary to some existing claims,[^14] those who are aware that few households are eligible for the estate tax are substantially more likely to support it.

Further analyses suggest that the effects of information about the estate tax operate by activating resentment of the rich. Figure 5.3]] plots the effects of resentment of the rich on policy opinion (y-axis) across different levels of information about the estate tax (x-axis). Among those respondents who correctly perceive that a very small percentage of individuals are wealthy enough to be affected by the estate tax (seen on the left side of the x-axis), the effects of resentment of the rich on policy opinion are enormous, associated with nearly half the range of the dependent variable. In contrast, among those respondents lacking this knowledge (on the right side of the x-axis), the effects of resentment of the rich fade to zero.

![[42698fig6_3.png]]

Figure 5.3

The effects of resentment of the rich on policy opinion are only evident for those who know that the estate tax does not affect a majority of Americans (2014 CCES Module)

This figure reports the marginal effects of resentment of the rich on public support for the estate tax (y-axis), by the percent of Americans that the respondent perceives to be affected by the estate tax (x-axis). Results are based on an ordinary least-squares regression analysis in which the dependent variable is support for the estate tax and the independent variables are (1) resentment of the rich; (2) the percent of Americans thought to be subjected to the estate tax; (3) the interaction of the two. Only respondents in the control condition (“Ask Condition”) are analyzed here.

These findings are consistent with the explanation of the estate tax’s unpopularity advanced here. It appears that knowledge that only the wealthy are affected by the estate tax is necessary for respondents to bring resentment of the rich to bear on their opinions about the tax. But many respondents lack this necessary knowledge – and among these respondents, resentment of the rich lies dormant and the estate tax remains unpopular.[^15]

# Why Is the Home Mortgage Interest Deduction So Popular?

I now turn to an additional exception to the pattern of American preferences for downward redistribution: the Home Mortgage Interest Deduction (HMID). While this policy is highly upwardly redistributive, research suggests that much of the public is unaware of this.[^16] Parallel to the case of the estate tax discussed above, I argue that ignorance depresses the impact of resentment of the rich on public opinion. That is, if more people were aware that the benefits of the HMID accrue to those at the top of the economic distribution, resentment of the rich would be activated, eroding support for this upwardly distributive policy.

To assess this proposition, I analyze another experiment embedded in the CCES 2014 Module. In the first wave of the survey, all respondents are asked their opinion about the policy: “Do you favor, oppose, or neither favor nor oppose the Home Mortgage Interest Deduction?” In the second wave of the survey, and in an extension of an experiment designed by Suzanne Mettler and Matt Guardino,[^17] half of the respondents are assigned to an Information Condition, in which they are provided information about the distributive consequences of the policy.[^18]

Now, here is some information about the federal Home Mortgage Interest Tax Deduction. This policy is a tax benefit for homeowners. It allows them to reduce the amount they pay in income taxes based on the amount they pay in interest on their home mortgage. The people who benefit most from this policy are those who have the highest incomes. In 2005, a large majority of the benefits went to people who lived in households that made $100,000 or more that year.

Respondents in the Information Condition also receive a graphic display of information about the distributive consequences of the policy (Figure 5.6]]). Respondents assigned to the Control Condition, meanwhile, receive no such information. Finally, all respondents are asked their opinion about the policy once again. The analytic approach enabled by this experimental design is a difference-in-differences that capitalizes on variation both within-subjects and across-subjects: I examine whether there is a difference in respondent opinion across the two waves of the survey that itself differs by information exposure.

![[42698fig6_6.png]]

Figure 5.6

Design of the Home Mortgage Interest Deduction experiment (2014 CCES Module)

Subjects assigned to the treatment condition (“Information Condition”) are asked to look at this graph and are then asked their opinion about the home mortgage interest deduction. Students assigned to the control condition are not shown this graph before being asked their opinion about the home mortgage interest deduction. This design extends the research of Suzanne Mettler and Matt Guardino (Mettler [^2011]).

We see first that consistent with Mettler’s conclusions, informing people that the benefits of the HMID accrue disproportionately to the wealthy has the effect of drastically decreasing support for the policy. This effect is displayed in Figure 5.7]]. In wave 1, support for the HMID is high, and does not meaningfully vary across the Control Condition and the Information Condition: in the Control Condition, 77 percent of respondents say they support the policy, and in the Information Condition, 72 percent of respondents support the policy. This 5 percentage point difference is statistically indistinguishable from zero, which is as expected, since no respondent received additional information until wave 2. It is in the analysis of wave 2 that we see meaningful differences across conditions: in the Control Condition, 61 percent support the policy, while in the Information Condition, only 38 percent support the policy. This statistically significant, 23 percentage point difference crosses the majority threshold of policy support. Furthermore, the change between support for the policy in wave 1 and wave 2 varies substantially across experimental conditions: among those assigned to the Information Condition, support drops by a statistically significant 18 percentage points more than it does among those in the Control Condition. As expected, information about distributive consequences decreases support for the home mortgage interest deduction.

![[42698fig6_7.png]]

Figure 5.7

Information decreases support for the Home Mortgage Interest Deduction (2014 CCES Module)

The figure plots the percentage of respondents who support the Home Mortgage Interest Deduction (y-axis), by survey wave and experimental condition (x-axis).

Now we turn to the question of central interest here: whether the information effect observed above is driven by those respondents who resent the rich. The answer can be seen in Figure 5.8]]; the figure plots the marginal effect of assignment to the Information Condition on policy opinion (y-axis) by resentment of the rich (x-axis; regression coefficients in the Appendix). Among those respondents with high levels of resentment of the rich (right side of the x-axis), assignment to the Information Condition is strongly, and negatively, associated with support for the HMID. But among those with low levels of resentment of the rich (left side of the x-axis), assignment to the Information Condition has a null relationship with policy opinion.[^19] This finding is consistent with my argument that who resent the rich would hold drastically different opinions about the HMID if they were aware of the extent to which its benefits accrue to the economically well-off; those who do not resent the rich, meanwhile, would remain unaffected. Ignorance suppresses the influence of resentment of the rich once again.

![[42698fig6_8.png]]

Figure 5.8

HMID information only changes opinions among those who resent the rich (2014 CCES Module)

The figure plots the marginal effect of assignment to the Information Condition (in which respondents are informed of the distributional consequences of the Home Mortgage Interest Deduction – see Figure 5.6]]) on predicted support for the Home Mortgage Interest Deduction (y-axis), by resentment of the rich (x-axis). The figure is based on the regression analysis reported in Appendix 5c.

I have also conducted additional studies of the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Retirement Tax Savings Deduction, two additional policies whose distributive consequences are largely hidden from the public; to avoid redundancy I do not present the findings here, but the results follow the same pattern.[^20] That is, ignorance about the Earned Income Tax Credit suppresses the impact of sympathy for the poor on opinion about the policy, and ignorance about the Retirement Tax Savings Deduction suppresses the impact of resentment of the rich. The two cases I have presented here are not unique: in key cases in which distributive consequences of policy are unknown, class group attitudes lie dormant, and downward redistribution is less popular than it would otherwise be.

# Conclusion

In many cases, sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich organize public opinion about redistributive policy. In other cases, they do not. I have shown that the power of these attitudes toward class groups on political thinking hinges on information. When it is clear that a policy will either transfer resources to the poorest Americans or increase taxes on the richest Americans, the policy is likely to be popular, because in this case attitudes toward class groups are especially likely to influence public opinion. But when the distributive consequences of a policy are unclear, citizens are not able to connect sympathy for the poor or resentment of the rich to the policy. In these instances, downwardly redistributive policies enjoy less support from the public than they otherwise would.

These findings identify an important condition under which the public supports downwardly redistributive policies. The obvious implication for activists seeking to increase public support for policies that would reduce economic inequality is to talk about class – to discuss which class groups benefit from, and which class groups are victimized by, the public policies under consideration.

The results also shed light on the power of sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich in contemporary American politics. The previous chapter]] analyzed important circumstances in which these attitudes toward class groups shape policy opinion. Building on those findings, in this chapter I have revealed important instances in which the potential for these attitudes toward class groups to influence political thinking remains unrealized.

I now turn to the following question: Do the effects of these class group attitudes extend beyond policy opinion to vote choice? If sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich affect how Americans think about policy, but not how they think about political candidates, we might not expect politicians to respond much to class group attitudes. If, on the other hand, sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich do influence electoral choice, but government still does little to redistribute wealth downward, this might lead to disturbing conclusions about the quality of representation in the United States. The next chapter]], therefore, examines the potential of sympathy of the poor and resentment of the rich to shape candidate evaluations.Effects of Class Group Attitudes on Vote Choice




















# Conclusion

Elections are thought to be the defining feature of democratic countries. They are, at least in theory, the “critical technique for insuring that governmental leaders will be relatively responsive to non-leaders.”[^50] Accordingly, political scientists often attempt to identify forces that shape voting decisions, and these attempts have often been successful. We know, for example, that voters are motivated to affirm their partisanship[^51] and to reward or punish the governing party for its performance in office.[^52]

Among the factors with the potential to influence vote choice, I argue, are attitudes toward class groups. Sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich can motivate voters to support some candidates and oppose others. This chapter has shown that my argument is supported by a plethora of evidence. First, in survey experiments I activated class group attitudes by manipulating candidate legislative records, increasing support for those candidates perceived to assist the poor. Second, open-ended comments made by survey respondents about the 2008 presidential election indicate that some individuals were drawn to Obama because they perceived him to help the poor (and not the rich), and some were repelled by McCain because they perceived him to help the rich (and not the poor). Third, sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich were associated with support for Obama over Romney in the 2012 presidential election, and fourth, resentment of the rich was also associated with support for Sanders over Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primary.

None of this discussion is intended to imply that sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich always influence vote choice. This chapter has intentionally selected instances in which clear cues were provided to voters about the connections between candidates for public office and class groups. In the next chapter]], I will examine a very different case: the 2016 general presidential election. For now it is sufficient to note that in many key instances, both in the laboratory and in recent presidential elections, voters tell us that they believe the poor have too little, while the rich have too much – and that they have these attitudes toward class groups in mind when choosing elected representatives.

These findings also build on the results from previous chapters. Earlier in the book I showed that sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich are widespread, and that these attitudes explain why downwardly redistributive policies are so popular. Building on those results, this chapter has illustrated the depth of the public’s commitment to assisting the poor and taking from the rich. Sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich help determine not only which policies Americans support but also which public officials Americans choose to represent them.

At the same time, the findings of this chapter open up an important puzzle: Why does government not do more to redistribute wealth downward? If welfare state programs are popular, if sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich are widespread, and if these class group attitudes influence vote choice, wouldn’t it be in politicians’ interest to cater to public opinion, redistributing wealth downward in order to win elections? Yet government does much less than it might to assist the poor and to take from the rich. The question of why this is the case will be taken up in the next chapter, which identifies important limitations on the power of sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich. 

# 7 Why Don’t Politicians Listen?















# Conclusion

Politicians walk a fine line. In order to obtain and hold onto power, they need money from the rich and also votes from the public. But the preferences of the rich and the public can run against each other. rich people want to increase their wealth (or at least hold onto it), while the public, on balance, wants government to take it away.

One of the two masters that politicians serve is more pliable than the other. It is difficult to escape the wrath of rich donors, but there are strategies available to politicians who seek to mollify the public. First, as discussed in Chapter 5]], much of the public is ignorant of the distributive consequences of many policies. By hiding who pays the costs and who reaps the benefits of such policies as the Home Mortgage Interest Deduction[^64] and the so-called “Bush tax cuts,”[^65] politicians can not only get away with failing to increase taxes on the rich but also can actually pass legislation that transfers wealth upwards. Second, the public is susceptible to framing effects. Here we have seen that when the federal estate tax on large inheritances is framed as a “death tax,” this causes resentment of the rich to fade to the background, eroding public support for the tax. Critically, public ignorance of politics and framing effects can work in conjunction. For example, opponents of the estate tax seek to confuse and distract at the same time – to confuse by falsely claiming that “small family farms” are subject to the federal estate tax,[^66] and to distract by framing the policy as a tax on the dying rather than as a tax on the rich.

As it is with policy, so it is with elections. It can be hard for voters – many of whom are not paying much attention – to tell where candidates stand in relation to the poor and the rich. If clear cues are not present, citizens cannot bring sympathy for the poor and resentment of the rich to bear on their voting decisions. This was the case in 2016. Had Trump made it clear that his policy proposals would distribute wealth away from the poor and toward the rich, he might have lost votes. Perhaps this is why he did not do so.

Caught between a rock and a soft place, politicians search for wiggle room by confusing and distracting the public. It is easier for government to do little about the growing gap between the richest and the rest when the public is kept in the dark.140Conclusion: The Path Behind and the Path Forward














# The Path Forward for Activists

Academics are not the only ones who should let go of the myth that Americans hate the poor and love the rich; political activists who seek a more equitable distribution of wealth should do the same. The findings in this book demonstrate that all else equal, revealing that a policy or a candidate is propoor or antirich is likely to increase its appeal – not for all Americans, of course, but on balance. Participants in political efforts to distribute wealth more fairly would do well to view the American public not as an inevitable enemy but as a potential ally.

For an example of how political rhetoric about class can facilitate efforts to mitigate economic inequality, consider the debate over the “fiscal cliff” of January 2013.[^58] At that time a group of laws that had been enacted previously were scheduled to take effect simultaneously, increasing taxes for a wide range of citizens and businesses while also cutting spending in a number of government programs. The Congressional Budget Office predicted that this fiscal cliff would lead to a mild recession.[^59]

In the midst of this looming crisis, President Obama saw an opportunity to garner public support for his reelection bid. In an interview on July 9, 2012, he vowed to veto any bill that would extend Bush-era tax cuts on the richest Americans, claiming that, “to extend tax breaks for that top 2 percent of wealthiest Americans would cost us $1 trillion over the next decade.”[^60] Obama repeated this message throughout the summer and the fall of 2012.[^61] This was good strategy: his promises to raise taxes on the rich likely won him votes.

Just two days after Obama’s reelection victory, the GOP pushed back. On November 8, 2012, GOP House Speaker John Boehner was asked by “World News” anchor Diane Sawyer, “[Obama] campaigned on specific increases in tax rates from 35% to 39%. So, is that on the table right now?” Boehner’s response was telling. He did not criticize Obama for “class warfare” or defend the rich as job creators. Instead, he sought to reframe the issue: “Raising taxes on small business people is the wrong prescription given where our economy is.” Sawyer followed up, referencing poll results indicating that majorities of Americans supported increased taxes. Boehner again downplayed class, framing the issue as about increased taxes generally and about political infeasibility: “Raising tax rates is unacceptable. And frankly, it couldn’t even pass the House. I’m not sure it could pass the Senate. So the votes aren’t there.”[^62] On November 14, Obama responded, emphasizing class considerations once more to argue that his plan to extend tax cuts for all but the wealthiest Americans would eliminate half of the fiscal cliff.[^63]

This dynamic continued for the remainder of 2012. President Obama, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, and other prominent Democrats coordinated on a simple message: the nation was headed for a fiscal cliff because of Republican unwillingness to increase taxes on the rich.[^64] On December 30, Obama went onto political talk shows to make a final pitch: “They say that their biggest priority is making sure that we deal with the deficit in a serious way, but the way they’re behaving is that their only priority is making sure that tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans are protected. That seems to be their only overriding, unifying theme.”[^65] The Democratic talking point appeared to pay off: December polls suggested that voters were substantially more likely to blame Republicans than Democrats for lack of progress toward a fiscal cliff resolution.[^66]

It was a close call, but eventually Republicans caved. On January 1, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012[^67] was passed by Congress and signed into law the next day by President Obama. The legislation amounted to a large downward redistribution of wealth. Unemployment benefits were extended, at a cost of about $30 billion, and college tuition credits for poorer families were extended as well. The Earned Income Tax Credit, which transfers resources to working poor people, was expanded. Meanwhile, the federal estate tax rate on large inheritances increased from 35% to 40%, the capital gains rate increased from 15% to 20%, and income taxes on high-income earners[^68] increased from 35% to 39.6%. In this instance, it appears that a clear, consistent focus on class considerations mobilized public opinion, changing politician incentives by increasing the rewards to those who supported a bundle of policies that aid the poor and take from the rich.

This success story suggests that activists seeking to decrease economic inequality would do well to make the distributive consequences of policy clear if they want the public to rally to their side. Of course, the public is not the only political actor that matters. Fighting inequality requires a multipronged effort that involves social movements, think tanks, candidates, the media, both major political parties, and more. If activists want the public to be an ally in this struggle, they will do well to place class considerations front and center.BITS2EPUB

# Conclusion: The Path Behind and the Path Forward

1.]] Converse ([^1964]).

2.]] Kinder and Dale-Riddle ([^2012]), Kinder and Kalmoe ([^2017]), Kinder and Kam ([^2009]), and Nelson and Kinder ([^1996]).

8.]] Kinder and Sanders ([^1996], pp. 261–262).

9.]] Recent reviews include Huddy and Feldman ([^2009]) and Hutchings and Piston (2011a]]).

10.]] For an overview of scholarship on attitudes about gender and the effects of these attitudes on public opinion, see Burns and Gallagher ([^2010]).

11.]] In turn, white opposition to immigrants is often driven by prejudice against Latinos (e.g., Brader, Valentino, and Suhay [^2008]; Hajnal and Rivera [^2014]).

12.]] For important recent examples, see Lajevardi ([^2016]) and Tesler ([^2016]).

13.]] See, for example, Ayoub and Garretson ([^2017]) as well as Lupia et al. ([^2010]).

14.]] In their analysis of perceptions of competition among whites, blacks, Latinos, and Asians, Bobo and Hutchings ([^1996], p. 968) write: “coverage of the items tapping perceived threat should be expanded to assess whether and why racial minorities perceive White Americans as competitive threats. In hindsight, this was a serious omission in our survey design and should be a high priority in future research.”

15.]] Suzanne Moore ([^2016]) of The New Statesman argues, “I think that any intelligent women hates men.” Elsewhere in the essay, she ties this emotion to politics: “As a class, I hate men … I want to see this class broken. There can’t be even basic equality for women without taking away the power of men – and by that I don’t mean feeling sorry for them because they have no friends or suggesting that they have small genitals. I mean the removal of their power.” Similarly, in an article titled “Why I Hate Men,” Julie Bindel ([^2006]) of The Guardian ties anger toward men, or a subgroup of men, to gender consciousness: “I will say loud and proud, yes, today I hate men, and will tomorrow and the day after. But only the men who perpetrate these crimes against my sisters, and those who do nothing to stop it. Are you in either one of those categories? If so, then I despise you.”

16.]] While I know of no research in political science on this topic, the following news account is suggestive: in Provincetown, Massachusetts, straight people have complained of being taunted with the term “breeders,” and one woman claimed that dog feces was put next to her car as an act of harassment. Antipathy to straight people may arise as a reaction to heterosexism; much of the conflict reported in the news account appears to be based in gay people’s anger over Provincetown residents signing a petition to pass a statewide constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. This became public knowledge when the names of 43 Provincetown residents who signed this amendment were published on knowthyneighbor.org. See Liu ([^2006]).

18.]] Conover ([^1988]). For an important review of the importance of attitudes about gender to American politics, see Burns and Gallagher ([^2010]).

19.]] Hochschild and Weaver ([^2007]).

20.]] Along with other social characteristics such as gender, age, ablebodiedness, and history of military service (Gordon [^1994]; Skocpol [^1992]).

21.]] See Alesina and Glaeser ([^2004]).

22.]] This section draws heavily on the scholarship of Linda Faye Williams ([^2010]) and, to a lesser extent, Ira Katznelson ([^2005]).

23.]] All this despite the fact that Bureau programs were structured to ensure that recipients were working in some way. As Williams ([^2010], p. 52) notes, in several Southern states, black women who received aid but did not have jobs (even if there were no jobs available) were gathered into a central location and forced to do “community service” as a condition of receiving aid, such as washing the clothes of any white people who wanted it done without payment. Williams writes: “It was as if slavery had been a 250-year holiday from work.”

24.]] Some black people benefited from the Civil War veterans’ pensions program as well. But as Williams observes, the vast majority of black veterans came from and returned to slaveholding states. These veterans had a very hard time proving their identity (they had often been designated by their masters’ last name), and their widows had an even harder time doing so. The procedures to prove eligibility were often prohibitively costly and time-consuming; black veterans were disproportionately unlikely to receive benefits from the program.

25.]] That said, even as these programs reinforced racial inequality they also provided resources to black people (Williams [^2010]).

26.]] Gilens ([^1999]).

27.]] Hancock ([^2003], [^2004]).

28.]] “Welfare reform” legislation in 1996 replaced Aid for Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). Under the AFDC, the federal government had committed to pay for welfare for all those people who met the states’ eligibility criteria. These criteria varied tremendously from state to state, but prior to 1996 all of those who were deemed to be eligible under the criteria could enroll. Under TANF, this was replaced with the following: the federal government allocates a fixed sum of money to the state, and the state decides how to spend it. In addition, the new program – TANF, or temporary assistance for needy families – made it much more difficult to be eligible to receive benefits. States can exclude teenage mothers, for example, or they can impose a family cap, where if a mother on welfare has another child, the state can deny the mother benefits. All in all, these changes have resulted in government becoming significantly less responsive to financial need. See Howard ([^2007], chapter 5]]) and Soss, Fording, and Schram ([^2011], chapter 11).

29.]] That said, debates about the meaning and measurement of racial prejudice continue (see Huddy and Feldman [^2009] for a review).

42.]] Garner ([^2017]).

43.]] From Cramer (2016a]]).

44.]] It is unclear why this method resulted in discussions of class while Cramer’s did not. One possibility is that class is more salient to national politics than local or state politics; another is that the people in the small groups in Wisconsin differ in substantial ways from people across the country who participate in surveys.

45.]] Taibbi ([^2014]). The entire quotation is: “Unquestionably, however, something else is at work, something that cuts deeper into the American psyche. We have a profound hatred of the weak and the poor, and a corresponding groveling terror before the rich and successful, and we’re building a bureaucracy to match those feelings.”

46.]] See Campbell ([^2014]).

47.]] See Piven ([^2015], p. 1115).

48.]] See McCall ([^2013], p. 181). Again, McCall does not endorse this claim; rather, she subjects it to critical scrutiny.

49.]] From Page and Jacobs ([^2009], p. 31)

50.]] As discussed previously, previous research has already shown that one subgroup of the poor – comprised of welfare recipients – is viewed quite negatively (e.g., Bartels [^2008]; Gilens [^1999]). Negative views of this subgroup turn on intersections among class, race, and gender, as scholarship about the public identity of the “welfare queen” has revealed (Hancock [^2003], [^2004]).

68.]] However, the threshold for “high-income earners” was not $250,000 ($300,000 for couples) as Obama had proposed, but rather $400,000 ($450,000 for couples). This victory was a partial one.
