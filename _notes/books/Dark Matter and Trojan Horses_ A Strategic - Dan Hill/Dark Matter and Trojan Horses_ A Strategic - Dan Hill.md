This essay is written from a personal perspective, though my colleagues at Sitra’s Strategic Design Unit — Bryan Boyer, Justin W Cook and Marco Steinberg — have been hugely influential in terms of my thinking, and much of what follows is based on daily conversations with them, as well as our projects. Numerous other conversations with numerous other people, in and out of various projects over the last 15 years, have also informed this essay. My thanks to them too.   

What is The Problem?

BACKDROP

When I started writing this essay, Athens was burning again. Muammar Gaddafi had been killed the day before. Occupy Wall Street was in its sixth week of protest in downtown Manhattan, its participants growing in number every day such that it has effectively become a curious melange of a functioning shanty town with celebrity endorsement and global media presence, in what is a private space, Zuccotti Park.

The Occupy movement had spread worldwide, from small, almost timid protests in my hometown of Helsinki, to violent running battles with police on the streets of Rome. More than 950 cities took part in a coordinated global protest on 15 October 2011 across 82 countries, five months after the first Occupy protest in Spain. Some 500,000 people took part in the 15 October protest in Madrid alone (in Spain, almost half of all youth are unemployed). Unified by the #occupy hashtag and the slogan “We are the 99%”, the movement continues to grow.

A few months earlier, from 6 to 10 August 2011, many towns and cities in the UK — mainly in London, Birmingham and Manchester — suffered violent riots of a scale and ferocity that had not been seen for a generation, if ever. While the UK was briefly close to breakdown in the early 1980s, and had witnessed mass protests and unrest many times before, the nature of the rioting, looting and arson attacks in August was essentially unprecedented as their cause was not clear.

Whereas the earlier poll tax riots and miners’ strikes, for example, had a clear ideological disagreement at their heart, these riots seemed to be about something else. But what, exactly? After the recriminations and finger pointing, we are no closer to an answer. Explanations offered veer between feckless nihilism, moral breakdown and consumer culture, through to the belief that an entire generation has been systematically disenfranchised and discarded by 30 years of neoliberal social and economic policy. Either way, the cause was so deeply embedded, so fundamental, as to appear beyond the core capacity of government itself.

This last year has also seen the Arab Spring unfolding across north Africa, with Tunisia and Egypt undergoing revolutions, Libya in civil war, civil uprisings in Bahrain, Syria and Yemen, and numerous other countries and states witnessing major protests — Algeria, Iraq, Jordan, Morocco and Oman among them.

In July 2011, the USA was hours away from “shutting down government”, due to its own inability to agree on appropriate levels of federal government spending. The episode is expected to be played out again at the next opportunity.

Japan, the world’s third largest economy, careers from political crisis to environmental disaster. The world’s-largest-economy-in-waiting, China, despite a millennium of practiced statecraft behind it, still faces an awkward developmental road ahead, pitted with the inequality and social unrest familiar to previous episodes of mass urbanisation.

When I finished writing this piece, Occupy Wall Street was still occupying Wall Street, despite the slowly falling temperatures. Similarly Occupy movements around the world were continuing to dig in. Yet it was Oakland, California that was now burning, because of the increasingly violent clashes between the Occupy Oakland protesters and police, after a 3000-strong march had more or less shut down the fifth busiest port in the US.

Two days before, the G20 summit had failed to strike any kind of deal to resolve the eurozone debt crisis. The summit had been described as a “make-or-break” moment.

It broke.

The same day, the UK thinktank Demos published research indicating that the far-right was on the rise across Europe. The Guardian reported “a continent-wide spread of hardline nationalist sentiment among the young, mainly men. Deeply cynical about their own governments and the EU, their generalised fear about the future is focused on cultural identity.” The data was gathered before the worsening of the eurozone debt crisis from September 2011. Were these movements the counterpoint to Occupy, similarly poised to fill the gaps emerging where mainstream political practice used to be?

As I write, up to 50,000 people are on the streets of Moscow and around 50 other Russian cities, defying the cold and threat of crackdown to protests against the prime minister Vladimir Putin, amid allegations of election fraud.

George Papandreou, the Greek prime minister, has just been removed in favour of a new coalition government, after proposing a referendum on new austerity measures and membership of the euro. In his speech announcing the cancellation of the referendum, he said: “I believe deeply in democracy.” The referendum was considered by Europe’s leaders to be too dangerous to be deployed.

A few days later, Italy — where Silvio Berlusconi, the country’s longest serving prime minister, had finally been forced out (not by voters but by the markets) — joined Greece in being led by unelected “technocrats”, in something of an implicit snub to democracy itself.

> “The sidelining of elected politicians in the continent that exported democracy to the world was, in its way, as momentous a development as this week’s debt market turmoil.” (Financial Times, 12 November 2011)

As the journalist Gillian Tett admitted: “The situation calls for very firm, forward-looking action that is almost impossible in a rowdy democratic political system at the moment.” (The Guardian, 11 November 2011)

When this sorry scene, too rowdy for democracy, is viewed in comparison with the last decade’s rapid economic growth in emerging economies, often with very different cultures of decision-making, the sense of despair is somehow sharper.

CRISIS

Common to all of these stories — from violent, sometimes randomly directed explosions of civil unrest to carefully targeted peaceful protest — is this lack of faith in core systems. The systems in question could not be more fundamental, encompassing the economic foundations of western development to the particular structures of governance and representation in all of the countries concerned, and essentially democracy itself.

At its most visceral, we see this lack of faith manifested in violence, and strikingly similar footage has been shot on the streets of London, Athens, Cairo and New York. We must be careful to pick apart the different drivers of each, yet we can also understand them all as distrust, disbelief and dismay with existing systems.

In Athens, smoke from burning cars and litter bins mixes with billowing shrouds of tear gas because of another austerity bill being awkwardly manoeuvred through the Greek parliament. The riots across England were triggered by the shooting of Mark Duggan in Tottenham, north London, by the police, and exacerbated by similar austerity measures to those in Greece. With the Arab Spring, the drivers concern fundamental political models rather than economic hardship as such, whereas the Occupy movement directly addresses the core ideologies and practices underpinning a globalised economy. Occupy is global in outlook, shifting positions subtly but still expressing a lack of faith in a loosely defined “system”.

These protests, many of which are not violent, are not the work of “a disconnected underclass”. The BBC’s economics editor, Paul Mason, in his blog post “Twenty Reasons Why it’s Kicking Off Everywhere”, described a new sociological type — “the graduate with no future” — later going on to describe the “economic permafrost” (apparently a phrase coined internally at HSBC) underpinning Occupy Everywhere.

The International Labour Organisation’s report The World of Work 2011 (based on Gallop World Poll Data 2011) finds significant drops in “People reporting confidence in their national government, 2006 to 2010” in so-called advanced economies. Everywhere except sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America saw a diminished confidence in their national government with South Asia the most pronounced. The presence of Asian countries, as the new fulcrum of global economic activity, indicates that it is not easy to make a straightforward link between lack of confidence and poor economic performance.

![[00004.jpeg]]

Equally, the report also finds significant increase in “Change in risk of social unrest between 2006 and 2010” in advanced economies. This data emerges before the various examples of unrest described above. Again, everywhere except sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America saw an increase in the likelihood of social unrest, although the increase was greatest in the advanced economies.

![[00005.jpeg]]

Less dramatically perhaps, we can also see a lack of faith across the various incarnations of parliamentary democracy with weak or coalition governments. At the time of writing, weak governments exist across much of the world, either in the form of shaky coalitions, small majorities or tenuous claims to power. In Europe, most states are in coalition. Other major coalition governments elsewhere include Brazil, Chile, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Israel, Japan, Kenya, Lebanon, Mali, New Zealand, Pakistan, Thailand and Zimbabwe. Moreover, there are non-coalition governments in positions of relative weakness in theoretically influential countries such as France, Australia, the USA.

Across the various cultures represented above, decision-making at the institutional level is proving particularly hard. This, the practice of politics itself, is being directly challenged.

Before October’s emergency summit of all 27 European Union nations to discuss solutions to the eurozone debt crisis, America and China urged EU leaders to resolve the debt crisis and prevent the world sliding into another slump.

This “slump” seems a little beyond something that might be resolved in a weekend. It’s worth bearing in mind the scale of the initial bailout in the US alone — estimated at $4.6 trillion in 2009-10:

> “That number is bigger than the cost of the Marshall Plan, the Louisiana Purchase, the 1980s Savings and Loan crisis, the Korean war, the New Deal, the invasion of Iraq, the Vietnam war and the total cost of Nasa including the moon landings, all added together — repeat, added together (and yes, the old figures are adjusted upwards for inflation).” (John Lanchester, 2010)

That impossible macro-economic scale, just as with the other big-picture indicators such as riots and revolutions, may merely be proxies for deeper fissures emerging in the fabric of society. All of the examples above are from this year alone, yet their roots are in the complex tangle of issues that have emerged in the last few decades. In the face of all this, many of our existing cultures of decision-making seem to be cracking under the strain.

REALLY, REALLY WICKED PROBLEMS

Essentially, strategic design, the focus of this essay, is focused on the systemic redesign of cultures of decision-making at the individual and institutional levels, and particularly as applied to what we can think of as the primary problems of the 21st century — healthcare, education, social services, the broader notion of the welfare state, climate change, sustainability and resilience, steady state economic development, fiscal policy, income equality and poverty, social mobility and equality, immigration and diversity, democratic representation and so on.

The familiarity of this list does not mean that we know how to deal with it. Each of these problems is a direct challenge to existing methods, ideologies, practices and structures. There are no clients for these problems. Who is the client for climate change, except perhaps the entire human race? Clients purport to exist for many of these problems; sometimes too many clients, even, which is a different kind of problem.

But a systems-oriented view of problems challenges the idea that healthcare, say, is the responsibility of a Department of Health. Health is directly affected by urban planning, transportation and other infrastructure, patterns of employment, food, education, industrial policy, retail policy and so on, most of which will sit outside of the neatly defined boundaries of one department.

The problems themselves are not neatly bounded or defined. These are often known as “wicked problems’, after Horst Rittel and Melvin Webber’s 1973 paper “Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning”. Here, scientific bases for confronting such problems, which for Rittel and Webber is social policy, are bound to fail.

> “There seems to be a growing realization that a weak strut in the professional’s support system lies at the juncture where goal-formulation, problem-definition and equity issues meet.” (Rittel and Webber, 1973)

If problem-definition was a problem then, it certainly is now. Reading Rittel and Webber, it is sobering to reflect upon how little has changed, or improved, despite them writing such a clear and ultimately influential paper. These problems still need addressing in new ways.

> “It has become less apparent where problem centers lie, and less apparent where and how we should intervene even if we do happen to know what aims we seek … By now we are all beginning to realize that one of the most intractable problems is that of defining problems … and of locating problems.” (Rittel and Webber, ibid)

WHAT KIND OF FAILURE?

It has become a cliché to point out that we have increasingly globalised economies, moving with increased scale and pace, and powered by rapid technological development. That this is a cliché doesn’t alter its veracity, however, and as a result problem systems are now entwined in almost impossibly complex, interdependent ways. Addressing core problems is beyond simple policy or process improvement at a local level.

The sociologist Saskia Sassen understands the Occupy movements pitched in cities worldwide, or the protests in city squares throughout the Arab Spring, as being knitted together with a new kind of political fabric.

> “The making of a globality constituted through very localized issues, fought locally, often understood locally but which recurred in all globalizing cities ... Today’s street struggles and demonstrations have a similar capacity to transform specific local grievances into a global political movement, no matter the sharp differences in each of these societies. All these struggles are about the profound social injustice in our societies — whether in Egypt, Syria or the US and Spain.” (Saskia Sassen, Domus, 2011)

The eurozone debt crisis, just as with the American sub-prime mortgage crisis, are talked about as local problems, albeit continent-wide, when they are ruptures in a globalised economic system. Their failure is felt locally and globally.

> “Just as we never consider the ground beneath our feet until we trip, these glimpses into the complex webs of inter-dependencies upon which modern life relies only come when part of that web fails. When the failure is corrected, the drama fades and all returns to normal. However, it is that normal which is most extraordinary of all. Our daily lives are dependent upon the coherence of thousands of direct interactions, which are themselves dependent upon trillions more interactions between things, businesses, institutions and individuals across the world.” (David Korowicz, 2011)

Korowicz’s point about failure is well made, but it becomes visceral when experienced locally. During the Brisbane floods of January 2011, despite a week of warning floods in the Queensland area, systems for food, power, transport, and some drinking water, all failed. Supermarket shelves emptied of fresh food, batteries and candles within hours. Local electricity substations succumbed to floodwater almost instantly, with no real distribution of energy generation at a local level (despite a climate that is near-perfect for solar generation). Essentially no agricultural capacity existed locally, and so communities reliant on food being trucked in every day were instantly without supplies, and with the roads underwater, no clear idea about when trucks might return. In the heavily sprawling suburban city typical of a rich western country, movement was instantly curtailed as the Brisbane river swallowed up key arteries.

Overnight, Brisbane residents within a wide radius of the flood zone were left with only a handful of people to talk to face-to-face, with no way of communicating electronically, no new food to eat, no power and no way of moving around. System failure occurred due to the lack of resilience built into systems of everyday life. The gap between policy and everyday life was suddenly very clear. The sociologist Richard Sennett might describe this as a brittle city.

But this is a modern city, built essentially within the last century, of at least 1.5m people in one of the wealthiest countries in the world. Of course that wealth is another manifestation of a globalised economy — Brisbane was rich on resource profits made by shipping minerals to China and other developing economies.

Yet the Queensland-based food security expert Shane Heaton has described how western cities such as Brisbane are only ever a few days away from disaster in terms of food stocks.

There is a deep contradiction to such systems being so strong that they can construct the modern world and yet so brittle that they break within hours. This can, in part, be conceived of as a design problem.

It’s tempting to look at how some other interconnected systems have been designed to deal with failure. For example, the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) concept of redundancy essentially means over-scaling a system to enable back-up in the case of failure ie having spare capacity on servers that are ready to boot up at a moment’s notice. Yet a virtual enterprise, in which physical matter comes into play only in scalable data-centre and sunk data connections, is an easier system to make resilient than those involving, say, logistics, energy transfer, water and so on. Matter matters, in this respect.

It should be noted, however, that it is also possible to build redundancy into physical systems. The architect Adrian Lahoud’s notion of “post-traumatic urbanism” is useful here, derived from cities such as Beirut where the availability of infrastructure and state of its fabric can change daily. There, a form of”‘network redundancy” exists through meeting everyday needs locally; everything — grocers, hairdressers, bakers, tailors, builders — is replicated in each neighbourhood, rather than centralised or aggregated into malls as a so-called developed city might. It is a far more resilient system, through reducing the risk associated with interdependency. Yet, ironically, it is an approach to systems that has been “designed out” of many contemporary cities. Sprawl is an outcome of active policy, of design.

Interdependency is felt in a failure to deal with this physical matter, rather than the wider context. As Korowicz also pointed out, the eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland led to “the shut-down of three BMW production lines in Germany, the cancellation of surgery in Dublin, job losses in Kenya, (and) air passengers stranded worldwide.” The cost of the Brisbane floods was estimated to be at least AUD$10 billion, but distributed right across the continent.

But again, after the drama fades, these modern systems of living snap back to the same non-resilient state they exhibited pre-failure. In Brisbane, there was little talk of genuinely reconstructing the city with a more resilient distribution pattern in mind; instead, the perhaps natural, if nostalgic, first instinct was to rebuild what was there before.

After the 2008 credit crunch crisis in the USA, the writer Kurt Andersen saw a similar opportunity presented at the scale of America:

> “I see the gobsmacking crash and resulting flux as a rare limited-time-only opportunity to significantly update and reform the system and the habits of mind that are its cause and effect. Thus we now have a chance to remake our medical and energy and educational and urban planning systems along vastly more sensible lines.” (Kurt Andersen, 2009)

That didn’t happen either.

There is good failure and bad failure. The former is failure that enables a system to learn, becoming more resilient, more adept. The latter is exhibited within a non-learning system. Are these non-learning systems due to their fundamentally out-of-control characteristics, systems whose complexity has grown beyond our comprehension and capability? Or is it simply that policy is too dislocated from its realisation?

This clear separation of policy and delivery appears to be a particular facet of government in many developed countries. The UK Cabinet Office has been undertaking a “Transforming Civil Service” programme throughout 2011, and is actively trying to close this gap between policy and delivery. The Institute for Government, a Whitehall-based thinktank working with the Prime Minster’s Strategy Unit on the “change programme”, has published papers talking instead of civil servants as “systems stewards” who work within a network in order to enable delivery and craft policy. (Whether the civil servants in question have the capacity and motivation to become “systems stewards” remains to be seen.)

Our public services have been designed, operated and measured to within an inch of their lives. Every possible eventuality within a system, such as healthcare or education, say, will have been considered and catered for, at least in theory.

And yet we see system failure all around us. For all its strengths and successes, the UK’s National Health Service, said to be the third largest organisation in the world, will not have been designed to produce lengthy waiting times and overly full triage centres, yet that is what we see. The system has been designed in enormous detail, from a policy perspective, and often works like a dream; and yet it can also often produce appalling failure.

The IFG’s report “Making Policy Better” consistently highlights the gap left by “realistic policy ambitions” followed by no specification of “how they will be achieved in practice”. The authors write that “the (policy) system as a whole leaves too much to chance, personality and individual skill”. This is what we see around us every day.

Yet everything around us is also the result of a choice, a design decision in effect. So when we see failure, we can only assume a breakdown between policy, the intended design, and delivery, the outcome.

Roger Martin, Dean of the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, has written recently on the folly of separating strategy from execution in the context of the business world, countering the prevailing wisdom of the previous decade or so in management theory.[^1]

“The idea that we have to choose between a mediocre, well-executed strategy and a brilliant, poorly executed one is deeply flawed — a narrow, unhelpful concept replete with unintended negative consequences.” Roger Martin, Harvard Business Review

Yet the gap exists, and this means that failure is rarely learnt from in any structured sense, as a way of garnering insight as to necessary systemic change in order to build resilience.

But thanks to Occupy Everywhere and its ilk, there now seems to be something else happening, some new level of tension and conflict, a form of forced attention on to an ongoing problem of complex interdependent systems failing, and the lack of faith that runs alongside, beyond momentary crisis.

> “When you see spontaneous social protests erupting from Tunisia to Tel Aviv to Wall Street, it’s clear that something is happening globally that needs defining. There are two unified theories out there that intrigue me. One says this is the start of “The Great Disruption.” The other says that this is all part of “The Big Shift.” You decide.” (Thomas L Friedman, New York Times)

But how to decide? We can’t possibly hope to uncover the right solution, without first understanding what the problem actually is. What is the question here?



   

What is The Question?

TRANSITIONS

Tellingly, Friedman didn’t define how the Great Disruption or the Big Shift might move in a positive direction. We need a sense of how transitions might not be violent ruptures, or in some cases a sad, inexorable demise. We need to find a new approach to complex interdependent problems, given that our primary institutions are increasingly ill-fitted to doing so.

We need in particular to find courses of action to address climate change, healthcare, social services, education, fiscal policy and local economic development within a globalised economy. We need to find a way of moving forward without certainty, without prescribed courses of actions or existing best practice.

We need to find a way of addressing and building on the many positive aspects of recent protests while fixing or removing the core system faults that they are predicated upon. We may need to redesign many of our existing models of public-service provision, but without throwing the baby out with the bathwater and recognising the folly in inadvertently returning (“recovering”) to the ideologies that got us into this mess in the first place.

We need to find productive ways of articulating questions in order to better understand the nature of the problems we now face, in terms of the architecture of the problem.

Having suggested why we need to do this, this essay will now focus on a few examples of how some of these challenges are being tentatively explored, through strategic design.

I work at Sitra’s Strategic Design Unit (SDU) in Finland.[^2] Strategic design has a direction, over and above being a set of tools, a vocabulary and a series of projects. Its focus is in enabling systemic change through re-shaped cultures of public decision-making at the individual and institutional levels, applied to the primary problems of 21st-century governance.

A brief sidenote on Sitra: “Sitra, the Finnish Innovation Fund, is an independent public foundation promoting the wellbeing of society under the supervision of the Finnish Parliament.” (sitra.fi/en) Founded in 1967, as a kind of birthday present from the nation to the nation on the anniversary of Finland’s independence, Sitra is engaged in long-term systemic change, through project work, research and investment funding. The Strategic Design Unit (SDU) at Sitra, led by Marco Steinberg, is a direct attempt to embed design practice at the heart of systemic change, through engaging with policy, public service, social innovation and wider civil society. Projects include Low2No and Helsinki Design Lab. The latter is inspired by one of Sitra’s earliest investments. This first event, known as the Industrial, Environmental, and Product Design Seminar, ran in 1968 on Helsinki’s island fortress of Suomenlinna, and was intended to address multidisciplinary problems, including what we would now call sustainability. Those in attendance included Buckminster Fuller, Victor Papanek and Christopher Alexander, as well as an intriguing collision of Finnish designers (including Kaj Frank, Antti Nurmesniemi and Juhani Pallasmaa) engineers, industrialists and policy-makers. Design was a core component. Sitra’s SDU now continues this work, and is the platform upon which much of this essay is built.

This essay will not attempt to produce precise boundaries around the notion of strategic design, however, or describe a coherent and complete set of tools, techniques and tactics. It recognises that design is a messy business, despite the clean lines of its coffee table monographs. By making legible its seams as strategic design emerges, we hope to better understand it ourselves, as well as open it up for constructive critique and progression through as many useful dialogues as possible. This essay is part of this process, testing out a new language as much as anything. A vocabulary gives us a way of talking about something, after all, and a more active discussion of constructive possibilities may be what we need right now. Note that it is not genuinely intended as a “playbook” to simply adopt, despite the language, or a simple set of ideas and instructions to co-opt and follow — legibility is simply intended to prompt thoughts and start conversations.

In terms of extending this legibility further, other elements of strategic design practice as conducted by Sitra’s SDU are outlined and discussed on the Helsinki Design Lab (HDL) website at helsinkidesignlab.org. In addition, SDU has published a book, In Studio: Recipes for Systemic Change (2011), which focuses in particular on the HDL Studio model, which is designed to rapidly prototype vision in complex, interdependent problem areas by better understanding the architecture of the problem.

This vocabulary follows on from “the studio”, then, by starting to concentrate on stewardship — the vital, messy reality of taking a vision, transforming this into a strategy, and then making it happen — in the context of public decision-making, as a new design challenge.

But can the structures of the public sector and civic life, and the content of the social contract, be seen as design challenges?

This could clearly be critiqued as more than a little arrogant and hubristic. What gives designers the right to approach such complex areas, usually the domain of political scientists and civil servants? Aren’t these essentially beyond the capacity and capability — if not remit — of design? Culture is not something that can be designed, after all; is it even ethical to consider that it could be?

However, a different conception of design — one not overly focused on problem-solving, or pretending to embark towards a resolution with a clear idea of the answer — could provide one way of addressing this concern, following an idea of prototyping and heuristics in a space of “unknown-unknowns” (after Donald Rumsfeld).

There may be something in the role of designer as outsider, too — the naive position of not being a political scientist enables a different perspective, which could have some value. Designers, often used to working across different contexts from job-to-job, are used to rapidly absorbing context and content, but also asking the unspoken “obvious” questions to understand the architecture of the problem from as many angles as possible. As Steven Johnson notes when discussing research into innovation patterns in scientific research: “Coming at the problem from a different perspective, with few preconceived ideas about what the ‘correct’ result was supposed to be, allowed [outsiders] to conceptualize scenarios where the mistake might actually be meaningful.”

It is of fundamental importance that strategic design gauges the right mixture of ambition and humbleness at this point: ambition in order to move into a space full of problems, inertia, legacy and resistance, and yet underpinned by the notion that, as the industrial designer Naoto Fukasawa has it, “design is a humble trade”, that this is an area traditionally untouched by design, at least consciously, in which designers have a lot to learn and a lot to prove. To be clear, any successful strategy is likely to emerge from a multidisciplinary perspective, in which design and designers play a part, no more.

Equally, however, we are motivated by the belief that the current structures are themselves design decisions, no matter how unconscious. And if it was designed in one way, it follows that it can be designed in a different way. But it also seems clear that it would be equally unethical, or at the very least irresponsible and negligent, to stand on the sidelines while no coherent transition seems to be emerging. The idea of public service itself, for instance, which is variously under attack, is too important to let wither on the vine because of poor management, inappropriate metrics, or the demise of one particular funding model.

DESIGN IS A PROBLEM TOO

But there is one further problem to solve — design itself.

Design has been too wasteful for too long. Not in the sense that it has often been focused on producing unnecessary or harmful commodities or addressing problems that didn’t need solving, though these are also true, but design has been wasteful in terms of its core proposition, its essential mode. Design has too often been deployed at the low value end of the product spectrum, putting the lipstick on the pig.

In doing this, design has failed to make the case for its core value, which is addressing genuinely meaningful, genuinely knotty problems by convincingly articulating and delivering alternative ways of being. Rethinking the pig altogether, rather than worrying about the shade of lipstick it’s wearing.

Design may possess these characteristics — at least these capabilities are well within its grasp — but its orientation and direction has too often been elsewhere, and rarely addressed towards the more meaningful contexts described above.

Among design disciplines, architecture can work in this mode, clearly.

> “Sometimes an architectural work can make these processes palpable, or like a delicate servo-mechanism guiding a much larger machine, it can modulate the larger system’s output in such a way as to make its dynamic apprehensible.” (Sanford Kwinter, 2010)

This notion of the designed artefact guiding a much larger machine sounds like a crisp definition of strategic design, as we will see. But, as Kwinter suggests, if only one or two buildings a generation can perform this act, one wonders what the other buildings are doing.

> “The course and consequences of the present world economic crisis are unpredictable. In a few months, the vast balloon of expectations built on false assumptions about the world’s resources was pricked. On balance, despite the difficulties and hardship that must result, we can be thankful that the crisis has exploded prematurely, for political reasons, while the world still commands enough time and resources to effect the far-reaching changes that are required to bring our demands on nature into harmony with nature’s ability to satisfy them. One consequence must be that the practice of architecture will have to undergo a transformation, requiring a return to first principles and the release of the latent skills and energies that are now being misused or frustrated.” (Malcolm MacEwan, Crisis in Architecture, 1974)

Although this reads like something written yesterday, it was written in 1974. While MacEwan is to be congratulated for being ahead of his time, albeit in another world economic crisis, architecture should bow its head given that so little has moved on. MacEwan’s essay discusses the idle resource depletion and energy inefficiency involved in construction, the need for social mobility and income equality, the need for the profession to better understand the sources of human happiness, the exploitation of land value by property developers and the complicity with which architects bow to that business model, an obsession with growth, a public disenchantment with architecture and architects and a loss of confidence within the profession, the problems of architectural representation derived from photographs of buildings without people in them. It is immensely sad that so little of this has developed in the subsequent decades.

Architecture is not alone in this misdirection, of course. Partly because of the design thinking commercial bandwagon of the last decade, and partly because of some more meaningful interventions, such as the Royal Society of Arts Design and Society programme[^3], the idea that design can play a wider role can almost be read as an implicit critique that it has been cooling its heels for too long, standing on the sidelines of core questions, rarely addressing more fundamental structural problems.

For instance, the RSA publication, “You know more than you think you do: Design as Resourcefulness & Self-reliance” (2009) by Emily Campbell, suggests the following attributes: “Ready to improvise and prototype, brave in the face of disorder and complexity, holistic and people-centred in their approach to defining problems, designers have a vital role to play today in making society itself more resourceful.”

Yet most of these interventions, as good as they are, do not suggest a repositioning of design at a deeper level within the architecture of society; say, embedded within government as a genuinely strategic capability.

Actually, design is usually deployed as problem-solving within a defined space, as process-improvement within a bounded system, or new product development within a market.

Design is usually applied to problems that are either, in Rumsfeldian terms, known-knowns or known-unknowns. The creative city, the sustainable development, the usable interface, the clearer taxation form, the appealing magazine layout, the energy efficient building, the seductive car, the recyclable toothbrush — most of these fall into those categories of knowns. There are either well-known technical solutions, and the real problem may be a lack of commitment, funding, skill, or motivation, or they are at least clearly defined problem spaces, that process improvement, nuanced analysis, elbow grease and the odd bit of luck could easily solve. Design’s value is often couched in terms of problem solving in these environments.

Yet although it can solve problems, design should be about much more than this. Indeed, the problem-solving ability is perhaps the least important aspect, coming as it does at the end of a potentially more valuable exploratory process or approach.

Nor is problem solving unique to designers. As the designer Jack Schulze, principal at the design consultancy BERG, has pointed out, dentists solve problems too. Schulze prefers instead to think of design as “cultural invention”, a phrase with a lot more leeway and agency. It suggests a much wider remit in terms of uncovering, shaping and conveying alternate trajectories.

This is partly inflected through an understanding of contemporary design in the context of the internet — “the internet of things”, as well as “the internet of things that are not things as such” — wherein cultural or symbolic value can be hosted in almost anything.

Yet the idea predates the internet. Norman Potter presented a wry classification of designers in his seminal What Is A Designer (1969), which included the designer as “culture generator” (the others are “impresarios”, “culture diffusers”, “assistants” and “parasites”).

Equally, designers seem to be exploring different business models, including cultural production, rather than simply service provision to clients. (BERG is a good example, actually, with a range of products, services and platforms originated in-house, as well as client-facing work.)

Yet too often, the stance of the designer is oriented almost solely towards problem-solving. Too often, that’s what they’re trained for. The issue here is something rarely considered at school: what do you do when you realise you are addressing the wrong problem, your bounded remit having been the outcome of the wrong question in the first place? This happens frequently in design work in practice, and yet stuck at the wrong end of the value-chain, simply problem-solving, it is difficult to interrogate or alter the original question. You simply have to solve within the brief you’ve been set; you can’t challenge its premise. Just try harder.

As it turns out, you can’t solve that problem[^4]. (It must be noted that much in the designer’s unhelpful positioning here is self-inflicted, through their own inability or lack of desire to address more meaningful aspects of the problem.)

Even a Pritzker prize-winning architect such as Richard Rogers cannot, for example, challenge the basic premises of the Barangaroo urban development in Sydney. The combination of masterplan, financial model, political context, local history and local cultures created a tight frame within which the architectural design work must occur. Many of the architects and other designers within the project team knew that the way the question was being framed was fundamentally flawed, but from their relatively lowly position in the value chain of the built environment business, even the best in the world cannot interrogate the frame itself. They can only problem-solve within it. A middle-manager at the local property developer running the project probably has more agency, due to the positioning of design as problem-solving, as consultancy service, within an industry that is oriented towards the bottom-line, almost allergic to innovation, and seeing strictly limited value in the role of design. Under these conditions, a designer cannot address the question itself.

Amid the “white heat of technology” phase of mid-1960s Britain, and as a believer in the promise of many of the technologies that the British prime minister Harold Wilson was referring to, the architect Cedric Price said: “Technology is the answer. But what is the question?”

He was right to, well, ask the question.

Thus, design must make clear that its remit is expanded from simply problem-solving to context-setting. The limited impact of focusing solely on the “lipstick on the pig end” of the “value chain” — the product, the service, the artefact — must be expanded on by addressing all aspects of this chain, and perhaps most importantly the strategic context of the chain itself.

In other words, the question.

In 1964, the Swiss designer Karl Gerstner wrote “To describe the problem is part of the solution.” A few years later, Norman Potter reinforced why this is necessary simply from the point of view of efficacy.

> “When something goes wrong, it can usually be traced back to the beginning, from the acceptance of false premises. Hence on the one hand the importance of questions, and on the other, of the resourcefulness of attitude that prompts them.” (Norman Potter, 1969)

In terms of practice, design’s core value is in rapidly synthesising disparate bodies of knowledge in order to articulate, prototype and develop alternative trajectories.

But if these are simply deployed to apply lipstick to pigs, it’s a waste of time. So much of architecture and design is wasteful. Strategic design is also, then, an attempt to reorient design to the more meaningful problems outlined in the introduction. A force should have a direction and a magnitude, after all.

A DESIGN CHALLENGE

This direction is towards the unknown-unknowns, the problems suggested above, the problems lying somewhere behind these various indicators of unease and unrest, the problems that existing approaches cannot handle.

Sitra’s Marco Steinberg says we have ended up with18th-century institutions, underpinned by philosophies and cultures of a similar vintage, now facing 21st-century problems. The distinguished Canadian public servant Jocelyne Bourgon[^5] pins the date considerably later, but reinforces the essence of the statement:

Former Deputy Minister across several departments of the Canadian government, and Emeritus Professor of The Canadian School of Public Service

> “Many of our public institutions and public organizations were born in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They retain some fundamental characteristics from that era … Preparing government for the challenges of the 21st century requires viewing the role of government through a different lens than the one inherited from the industrial age.” (Jocelyne Bourgon, 2011)

The primary institutions of academy, government, hospital, corporation, and even our trade relations perhaps, in play across most of the developed world at least, are post-Enlightenment and Industrial Age formations and not designed to deal with these new problems of a very different nature. The social contract, defining an individual’s relationship with government, was written for another time.

So if the traditional tools of governance, policy, and scientific knowledge no longer work, what do we do? How do we know what to do when it is not clear how to even discuss the problem? This is not something you can write a traditional brief for.

The collapse of knowledge, of authority, of institution can leave a dizzying sensation, a kind of vertiginous drop into an abyss of uncertainty. We might suddenly empathise with, as the old adage goes, the blind man in the dark room looking for the black cat. That isn’t there.

Yet put yourself into that (admittedly unlikely) scenario and the most likely course of action would be to improvise: to feel around in the dark, while listening carefully. This is what you do when you don’t know, yet still have to take action.

The sociologist Bruno Latour sees the lack of certainty and “fact” in political representation as a clearer, and perhaps overdue, recognition of how actually things are:

> “We are asking from representation something it cannot possibly give, namely representation without any re-presentation, without any provisional assertions, without any imperfect proof, without any opaque layers of translations, transmissions, betrayals, without any complicated machinery of assembly, delegation, proof, argumentation, negotiation, and conclusion.” (Latour and Weibel, 2005)

Some of this “machinery” feels like the language of design: of contingency and compromise, of hunch and sketch[^6]. This is an heuristic, an improvisation, a prototype from which one learns a course of action, rather than having a preconceived idea of a solution. It recognises, perhaps, that the strategic act is in knowing how to capitalise on the sketch, to explore through prototyping.

Of course, some of it feels like the language of other cultures too, such as scientific research and technological innovation, where Steven Johnson, for instance, also talks of things like the “slow hunch”.

But this more exploratory mode is also a different kind of design. Much existing design practice falls neatly within an analytical context of problem-solving, broadly speaking, yet the idea that policy and governance can be convincing through mere presentation of fact supported by clear analysis is also being directly challenged. In-depth analytical approaches can no longer stretch across these interconnected and bound-less problems, where synthesis is perhaps more relevant than analysis.

> “The problem is that transparent, unmediated, undisputable facts have recently become rarer and rarer. To provide complete undisputable proof has become a rather messy, pesky, risky business.“ (Latour and Weibel, 2005)

Design produces proof, yet as “cultural invention” it is also comfortable with ambiguity, subjectivity and the qualitative as much as the quantitative. Design is also oriented towards a course of action — it researches and produces systems that can learn from failure, but always with intent. In strategic design, synthesis suggests resolving into a course of action, whereas analysis suggests a presentation of data. Analysis tells you how things are, at least in theory, whereas synthesis suggests how things could be.

Our systems of governance still lend more weight to analysis than more qualitative synthesis. Yet the more we learn about the science of the brain, the less appropriate this seems. In The Social Animal (2011), David Brooks suggests the persistent failure of policy-making is because of this preference for rational analysis and simplistic quantitative metrics, despite the evidence that “we are not primarily the products of our conscious thinking. We are primarily the products of thinking that happens below the level of awareness”.

> “The failures have been marked by a single feature: Reliance on an overly simplistic view of human nature. Many of these policies were based on the shallow social-science model of human behavior. Many of the policies were proposed by wonks who are comfortable only with traits and correlations that can be measured and quantified. They were passed through legislative committees that are as capable of speaking about the deep wellsprings of human action as they are of speaking in ancient Aramaic. They were executed by officials that have only the most superficial grasp of what is immovable and bent about human beings. So of course they failed. And they will continue to fail unless the new knowledge about our true makeup is integrated more fully into the world of public policy.” (David Brooks, 2011)

(It’s an intriguing thought to stop and consider how we might better create our cultures of decision-making that take into account the emerging findings of neuroscientists about how humans preference short-term decision-making. Given our need to make long-term decisions — around climate change, healthcare, demographics — should we design systems that deliberately mitigate against, and compensate for, how we are wired for short-termism?)

Tristram Carfrae, one of the key leaders at the global multidisciplinary design and engineering firm Arup, has suggested the firm’s greatest challenge lies in the shift from analysis to synthesis, recognising how different this mindset is for the traditionally trained engineer. Synthesis is quite different to the apparently objective approach of the analyst or engineer, or that of management consultant; again, not least as it requires judgement in order to decide what to do, as synthesis produces.

> “To an ability for sorting, ordering, and relating information he must bring qualities of judgement and discrimination as well as a lively imagination. There is a diffuse sense in which the seemingly ‘objective’ procedures of problem analysis are in practice discretionary, embedded as they are in a whole matrix of professional judgement in which relevant decisions are conceived.” (Norman Potter, 1969)

While other consultant practices have other attributes, this ability to produce, to do, as a way of generating insight, of enacting and reorienting strategic intent, is a key differentiator to design in this context.

> “Through the action of designing we come to know the world in ways that we did not know it prior to designing. What is critical in design research is that the observing is intrinsically tied to designing. Without the designing happening there can be no meaningful observation.” (Richard Blythe)

This emphasis may be cautiously welcomed in itself, given the near-paralysis involved in decision-making described earlier. Indeed, reactions to the Helsinki Design Lab Studio Model from policymakers have been extremely positive, noting in particular the shift in the tone of conversations.

So we have new kinds of problems, but potentially new kinds of design to address them. How might we begin to understand the value of strategic design? What kind of techniques, approaches and structures might get traction with these new design challenges?

   

What is The Matter? What is The Meta?

CASE #1: THE EDGE — FROM MATTER TO META AND BACK

Strategic design attempts to draw a wider net around an area of activity or a problem, encompassing the questions and the solutions and all points in between; design involves moving freely within this space, testing its boundaries in order to deliver definition of, and insight into, the question as much as the solution, the context as much as the artefact, service or product.

Call the context “the meta” and call the artefact “the matter”. Strategic design work swings from the meta to the matter and back again, oscillating between these two states in order to recalibrate each in response to the other.

> “A case study: project work at the State Library of Queensland in Brisbane. Initially, Arup pitched a ‘post-occupancy evaluation’ of the library’s popular wi-fi service. This ultimately involved several days on-site, observing, interviewing, filming and photographing, as well as building 3D models of wi-fi signal strength in order to understand its relationship to physical space. This largely matter-based work then progressed to meta-based work over the course of three years, ultimately becoming embroiled in the strategic direction of the library itself.”

The wi-fi service was extraordinarily popular; it was effectively in-use 23 hours out of 24 every day, thanks to the largely open ground floor designed by Donovan Hill architects and Brisbane’s sub-tropical climate. Visitor numbers had rocketed since the renovation, and the research indicated that wi-fi was responsible for a large part of this increase. The wi-fi had transformed the use of public space in and around the library, and was transforming the function and character of the library itself.

In documenting this ethnography-lite, and in conversation with the client, it became clear that the library needed a strategic context in which to understand the wi-fi service. Despite its popularity, many staff could not connect the service with the library’s existing strategy, or indeed their preconceived ideas about what a library was, what it was for.

So the work developed a strategic edge to accompany the practical suggestions about outdoor power sockets, amenities for late-night users, signage and visibility and so on. This strategic side delved into the function of libraries in the 21st century, as well as the possibilities for this particular library on the south bank of the Brisbane river, in terms of its immediate physical and organisational context.

A key focus was on how the particular service — the wi-fi — might scale across the city in terms of coverage, but also how the new applications and functions that wireless networks enable could be fruitfully incorporated into the idea of what a library was, and thus reinforce the idea of libraries in the first place. In effect, this meant building on the particulars of the existing wi-fi service to deliver wider strategic change across a number of dimensions.

This in turn led to further work, as the same client needed to deliver a new “digital culture centre for young people” further along the same riverbank. Involving a retrofit of an early-80s building by the architect Robin Gibson, The Edge project was essentially without coherent strategy and yet was halfway through the architectural design process, having selected the Brisbane architects m3 and several sub-consultants.

So the project for The Edge rapidly retrofitted a strategy for the organisation and the building. This included the vision for The Edge, expressed through a variety of strategic artefacts, as well as work explaining what a “digital culture centre” might be — and indeed what “young people” might be. It also included the ICT strategy, the approaches to audio-visual equipment, the definition of various productive spaces internally, including the naming of the various labs, the design of the pods along the window, the web services and social media activity, whether there was a coffee bar, what kind of coffee it should serve, whether the staff should wear uniforms, the organisation structure, job titles, artist-in-residence formats, interim brand identities, the selection of magazines and other periodicals for the informal library/kiosk space, the approach to sponsorship opportunities, the design of modular furniture systems, wayfinding options, operational criteria for media façades and so on.

Along with my colleagues Marcus Westbury and Seb Chan, we called this compendium of minutiae and overview the “operating system” for the building. The use of such terminology implied a construct for moving backwards and forwards seamlessly between the detail of a particular instruction and the operational framework within which it sits, between data and metadata, almost. This work was zooming from matter to meta and back again constantly. It meant being close to the detail of the architecture and engineering — discussing the strategy for a handrail, or curtain, or a slice through concrete — as well as designing the context within which the building sits: the organisation and its intentions, operations, its business model. Without rigorous definition of exactly the right artefacts, products and services, couched in exactly the right way, the project would have failed in a core objective: to appeal to young people on their own terms; to be “authentic” and compelling in a way that a government usually isn’t. But the same rigour was used to shape the organisation.

At this point, it becomes clear that the meta — the organisational vision and strategy — is being richly informed by the detail of work conducted at the matter level.

Finally, almost a year after the successful opening of The Edge, this same client required a foresight-oriented piece of work describing the likely challenges and opportunities facing public libraries over the next decade. This was pure meta-work, in essence, disconnected from any particular building project. Yet the detailed insight gathered from the previous projects informed the sense of possibility for the organisation — what would the client countenance? What could this particular organisational culture handle?

Equally, the contextual research conducted for the matter-based work had located networks, resources and case studies that would inform the foresight project, and help extrapolate accurately and imaginatively from what the current library was capable of doing. It would define possible trajectories that would stretch the client, but with a realistic and manageable sense of ambition drawn from being able to locate their interests and capacities relatively accurately.

Without the rigour and robustness required to deliver a building — The Edge — the foresight and strategy work would have been light at best. Without the wider insight garnered from strategic vision work, and access to the clients and stakeholders at that level, the details of the building project and architecture would not have been as well-tuned.

With this project, as with any project that tries to break a mould, it’s clear that the context had to be designed, as well as the built outcome. Here, the context means a new organisation (The Edge), the existing host organisation (the State Library) and stopping off at almost every node in the network of relationships emerging from the project.

This basic idea, zooming back and forth from matter to meta, and using each scale to refine the other, is core to strategic design. There are several emerging ideas — again, a vocabulary as much as anything — that we can use to organise our approaches to this idea. They are described as “plays”, as in a football playbook, to suggest they might be adopted and altered, and deployed elsewhere.

PLAY #1: THE MACGUFFIN

With this idea of designing the context as well as the artefact, in a form of strategic symbiosis, what kind of outcomes might actually emerge, and how might they be organised?

Our core case study here is the Low2No mixed-use development in Jätkäsaari, Helsinki (the name comes from moving from “low carbon to no carbon”) and one of our core tactics is the MacGuffin.

The MacGuffin comes with a particular provenance. The phrase is attributed to Alfred Hitchcock, and has become associated with him ever since. The dictionary defines it as “an object, event, or character in a film or story that serves to set and keep the plot in motion despite usually lacking intrinsic importance.”

And in Hitchcock’s words:

> “A MacGuffin you see in most films about spies. It’s the thing that the spies are after. In the days of Rudyard Kipling, it would be the plans of the fort on the Khyber Pass. It would be the plans of an airplane engine, and the plans of an atom bomb, anything you like. It’s always called the thing that the characters on the screen worry about but the audience don’t care… It is the mechanical element that usually crops up in any story.”

According to the British Film Institute’s Mark Duguid, the MacGuffin, is “the engine that sets the story in motion”. In Notorious, it’s uranium ore hidden in wine bottles. In North by Northwest, it’s the entirely vague “government secrets”. There is a long history to the idea of the plot element that kick-starts and drives the narrative but is somewhat inconsequential in the end. More obviously, the golden fleece is what drove Jason and his Argonauts through multiple narrative scenarios in Greek mythology. More recently, the briefcase in Quentin Tarantino’s Pulp Fiction is a good example.

Low2No uses the MacGuffin of a low-carbon building project. It is a mixed-use city block comprising around 150 apartments and commercial space, such as office space, incubator spaces for start-ups, food and other retail spaces, connected through shared public spaces and services. While at face value, Low2No looks like a modern block project, it actually carries with it a host of innovations, which are not immediately obvious.

For example, Low2No is designed to be a largely wooden building, of some scale (around 11-12 storeys in places). This is partly as timber is such a strong contender for a low-carbon building material, given the way it “locks up”, or sequesters, carbon, as compared with the more carbon-intensive concrete and steel.

This is now possible because of the existence of cross-laminate timber as a building technology, which is fire-safe and structurally sound. And this is preferable as Finland has a vast and mature forestry and timber industry, which is nonetheless threatened by cheaper, faster timber production from developing economies nearer the equator.

If it can compensate for this potential loss of paper and pulp processing, its traditional business, via timber as construction material, the Finnish forestry industry has a new trajectory to explore.

In order to enable the use of timber in the building, the project had to change the fire codes within Helsinki. These were a legacy from the 19th century, when timber buildings burnt with regularity, and hadn’t been updated in this respect since.

Again, the building project acts as a MacGuffin, in that it drives the plot with enough momentum to ensure that fire codes are actually changed; it provided enough of a gravitational pull of importance that it gave the relevant actors the motivation to reach into the policy apparatus and alter the codes.

So timber is a building material, but also a strategic outcome. In itself, at Jätkäsaari, it is literally a design detail, a construction choice, but with these external outcomes in mind, this detail is connected to strategic impact well beyond the physical reality of the particular building.

When viewed in these wider strategic contexts, the entire building itself is a mere detail, a distraction almost, which simply carries the other projects, gives them a reason to exist, lends an excuse to develop them — and the ordeals of a construction project provide the necessary rigour to develop them well. It feels frivolous to say that a building costing millions of euros is but a mere detail, but in a sense it is.

Despite that, however, the artefact is also essential. In the case of Low2No, the building is a platform for a wider series of strategies, all of which are harnessed through the gravitational pull of the building itself.

These strategies could not exist without the building. It’s easy to get work as a consultant to pitch ideas — “Have you thought of doing a timber building? That would be great!”; “How about doing some of that smart city stuff? It looks like this, wouldn’t it be nice?”

The idea is not enough. In fact, the idea is the easy bit. Yet while it’s easy to put a PowerPoint together pointing out the virtues of timber construction, it doesn’t actually make it happen. Without the excuse of the building project, it’s unlikely the building codes would have been rewritten in the near future.

And for timber in this case, read many other potential innovations. For example, something similar has occurred with “smart city” technologies and services, which companies such as IBM, Cisco, General Electric and others have spent millions on promoting, with little return so far. It’s not that it’s a bad idea; it’s just there is not enough motivation to make it happen. It’s missing a MacGuffin.

The problem is in taking clear design intent — the stage where “smart city” concepts are rife — into development, procurement and commissioning, and emerging from the other side with the intent intact, perhaps even improved by the process, such that further strategic outcomes can be realised.

The MacGuffin helps drive this process through its gravitational pull, through its requirement for rigour. It gets the ideas out of PowerPoint and into the “meta” of context, into redesigning the organisational, policy or regulatory environment in order to get things done. Legislation and policy is the “code” that enables replication elsewhere.

When the conversation is abstract, as it often is in strategic work or the realm of “good ideas”, it is difficult to resolve. By building something we pull conversation towards consensus. We have to agree in order to build; the physical reality of something pulls discourse into a more meaningful, more tangible territory. So the motivation provided by the MacGuffin in question can be allied to realising strategies with rigour, in detail.

There is a clear tension with this approach to strategic design work; without the proxy of the building project, these wider strategies would not pull focus or resonate, and often end up as the policy equivalent of vapourware. They remain abstract, and easy to ignore.

Yet the project can pull focus so much, it is sometimes difficult to keep the wider strategic outcomes on the table. Construction, for example, has a habit of dissolving innovation on sight, so while the focus pull of the physical matter is important and useful, it can also quickly eradicate strategic aspects or innovation agenda. Low2No has, on occasion, suffered in this respect.

Lose track of a building project by focusing on the strategic layer too much, and nothing gets realised. Focus pull on the building layer and all you have is that: a building, with no strategic impact. So the MacGuffin is to be chosen and handled carefully. This is the practice of design stewardship.

To extend the metaphor of a MacGuffin, the audience (eg the users of Low2No) are unlikely to care about the building project as such; whereas the characters (the clients, the designers, the planners) are focused on it to the exclusion of almost everything else.

The building’s residents, visitors, workers, shoppers, etc are rarely interested in a building’s intrinsic architectural or engineering qualities. They are interested in what it can do for them, what new patterns of living and working supports and enables. They are rarely interested in the details of timber as building material, which is a key focal point of the construction phase, but may well be interested to know that a primary Finnish industry may have a new trajectory that continues to enable wealth creation.

And yet the MacGuffin as building is also useful as it gives audience something they can easily understand, something that they can grasp on to, even if the idea of building is then expanded a little. Patricia Highsmith, the author of Strangers on a Train and The Talented Mr Ripley, noted that an audience’s credulousness and goodwill can be stretched quite a bit in this way, though not indefinitely.

Equally, a wider audience might be influenced by the possibilities within Low2No. These elements are transferable in a way that the physical experience of Low2No as building can only occur on a few hundred metres square of currently windswept Jätkäsaari.

So this influence on audience is well beyond the influence of the building as architecture, which can only really meaningfully exist within the world of architectural practice and architectural criticism.

So from the point of view of the wider Low2No project, and compared with the replicable strategies that might ripple across Finland, and beyond, the building is a mere detail. It is a classic MacGuffin; not especially relevant in itself, but the entire plot cannot exist without it. It is the reason for the entire story, and yet beside the point. The wider story is ultimately more interesting, more affecting.

Each strategic design project might ask: what is the MacGuffin here? What is the plot device that will drive the picture? What is the artefact that will motivate the various actors to create a richly rewarding experience for the audience, and enable strategic outcomes by also addressing the context?

PLAY #2: THE TROJAN HORSE

A second variation on the idea of the strategic vehicle is the Trojan Horse. This aspect of the project also uses an artefact as the hook for a series of other activities, though its role is in suggesting that an artefact can contain multiple strategic elements.

The MacGuffin is a simple artefact that provides motivation; the Trojan Horse is an artefact that carries “hidden” strategic elements.

So Low2No is a building, yes, but it contains

• a platform for exploring how to use procurement more creatively

• how to rethink food culture in Finland in terms of food retail and food production that emphasise local, organic and sustainable approaches including urban agriculture

• how to provide new futures for the Finnish timber industry

• how to develop new ownership and tenancy models

• explore carbon accounting

• develop new forms of innovation environment

• build communal facilities such as shared sauna which reverse trends towards privatised sauna,

• how to introduce the built environment industry to participatory design processes,

• how to prototype informatics-led “smart city” behaviour change amongst residents, workers and visitors,

• how to enable organisational change within the client organisations, and so on.

• Each strategy is designed to be replicable elsewhere.

Although this particular language wasn’t used at the time, Low2No was conceived with these principles in mind from the start. The project is about systemic change, first and foremost, with the building as an enabler of such change, rather than the end in itself. This approach is evident even in the competition and procurement process, which was designed to foreground replicable approaches and a team capable of producing a diverse range of strategies, rather than a particular proposal for a particular building. The competition was not about drawings, renderings, built outcomes — but about designing an approach, a strategy.

This is highly unusual in the world of architectural competitions, which tend to favour the image of a physical proposal over any deeper understandings of what a building can be, strategic or not. This is sometimes inadvertent, but is often a simple tactic to generate capital — financial, cultural and political — through imagery, and tacitly supported by an architectural media hungry for the latest renders.

Low2No’s competition was instead designed to emphasise long-term systemic change for Finland, particularly around the shift to a low-carbon country. As Sitra’s Director of Strategic Design, Marco Steinberg, said at the time: “We are not interested in your solution, we are interested in the mindset you bring.”

Yet, again, this meant simultaneously working in two modes: dealing with the strategic, while working on the particular. Steinberg said of the competition framework:

> “If we had done a standard architecture competition people would have all known what the expectations were. We struggled with how to keep a balance between developing a big picture perspective and yet not disconnecting from the architecture. We didn’t want abstract concepts.”

It is worth noting though that the winning team was led by Arup, a global multidisciplinary design consultancy, leading a team including architects (Sauerbruch Hutton from Germany), service designers (Experientia from Turin), carbon financing experts and so on. This in itself was a reversal of traditional practice — usually architects lead, with Arup as a sub-consultant — and emphasised the need for a multidisciplinary approach that could produce multiple strategies. As such, the team was able to design an approach that matched the strategic ambition of the clients (Sitra, SRV and VVO) and incorporate numerous strategies, such as those listed above. (Disclaimer: I was a designer on the Arup team, before “jumping the fence” to become a designer on the client side at Sitra.)

So the Low2No building is Trojan Horse, a carrier of multiple strategic outcomes well outside of a traditional building. With the emphasis on replicability[^7], each outcome is in effect a different platoon pouring out of the Trojan Horse, and marching across Finland.[^8]

Matthias Sauerbruch, of architects Sauerbruch Hutton, said “(We) were trying to make buildings that could be applied elsewhere as well. That’s partially the reason why the project is relatively typological. It is trying to define certain types that are being applied in this case, but could also be applied in Jätkäsaari or elsewhere.” (quoted in Berthold and Kane, 2011)

The developer SRV, a key client on Low2No along with Sitra and VVO, has subsequently announced two new timber projects, one in the city of Tampere and another in Jätkäsaari.

Every building has the potential to be a Trojan Horse — recall architectural writer Sanford Kwinter’s quote on buildings as “delicate servo-mechanisms”, which he applied to the Pompidou Centre in Paris. But most building projects, perhaps forced by the strictures of the generally non-strategic construction business, are not Trojan Horses. In fact, Kwinter sees 1977’s Pompidou as the last major building project that genuinely reflected and actively changed wider cultural patterns.

Facing the problems we do, it is no longer good for projects to be one-offs. We must now take advantage of the Trojan Horse potential implicit within each in order to strategically address our wider culture. Here, the building project is a fulcrum for addressing a wider culture of decision-making. As we’ll see, this is then a form of “bait-and-switch” in which what looks at first like a simple “artefact” project — like a building — is in fact a way of rethinking and redistributing the Nordic Model of governance itself.

PLAY #3: THE PLATFORM

Strategic design projects such as Low2No are also conceived of as platforms.

The platform is perhaps one of the core ideas to have emerged in the business world in the last decade. Instinctively almost, designing services for the web has driven this thinking. It is increasingly commonly understood that the success of Facebook, say, is in its ability to provide a platform for people to do “whatever they want” (of course, a simplification) to organise and run their lives, to calibrate and project their identity in terms that are as intimate as they like, to built third-party applications with the system via “applications programming interfaces”.

And yet it’s the exact same codebase, the exact same offering, shared by 800 million highly diverse users. It’s quite a trick.

Similarly the success of the iPod, and then iPhone, in terms of media consumption is due to the wider platform in which it sits — the iTunes, iTunes Music Store, App Store ecosystem. This latter in particular, in which users can make apps that sit within and upon Apple’s platform, is key to its success. So Apple does not make the majority of the content for its users — others make the music, the movies, the apps — but by enabling and controlling the platform, it enables and controls the value.

So the particular product or content by itself is not enough; the wider context as a platform is what makes it sing, what makes it a success. Karsten Schmidt, the designer behind PostSpectacular, a London-based design agency, has suggested that contemporary design practice, primarily embedded within the social, cultural and technical relationships of the internet, means that we should “think of everything as a platform.” The platform’s core characteristics — including, but not limited to, being scalable, replicable, malleable, and user-centred — have proved to be extraordinarily successful so far.

Yet this platform thinking is not yet common outside of the web.

Working on a metro project in Sydney, it seemed obvious to use the same data around the real-time location and behaviour of metro trains across three or four different devices (installation, multi-touch interactive map, mobile app, etc). Yet this was relatively radical thinking for a built environment project — particularly a public infrastructure project — used to thinking about procuring services for different spaces as discrete packages, independent of each other. The way data moves, as a medium in itself, could begin to change the way we think about such services.

More importantly, it also suggests strategic improvements to such environments. In articulating the idea of the “coherent user experience” across multiple devices, one is quickly in a discussion about a unified approach to service branding and delivery, oriented around the user, across different modes of transit. This, again, is very different to the current situation, whereby these different modes of transit are independent service contracts almost in competition with each other. So the Sydney Buses “system” doesn’t talk to that of Sydney Ferries, doesn’t talk to CityRail, doesn’t talk to Metro Light Rail, and so on.”System” here is used to describe the business, the organisation, and the resultant service experience, as well as the technologies of infrastructure.

This may have once made sense from an asset sales and privatisation point of view, but it didn’t make sense for the user. Where once this wouldn’t have mattered, this is now thrown into sharp relief through the possibility of a platform approach to transit data, influenced by similar platforms such as social media beginning to run almost everything else.

Designing transit data on a smartphone leads to a total reconceptualisation of Sydney’s public transport infrastructure. Matter to meta, product to platform.

With Low2No, the block will be a platform for start-ups in the incubator spaces, and through Sitra’s presence as a form of innovation-driven venture capitalist within the same block.

It will be a platform for a new kind of food retail business, for example. In a reversal of traditional property development practice, in which a new building is constructed with a “To Let” sign on the outside, and then absorbs whatever businesses the market can throw at it, Low2No has started from the principle of “curating” particular food retail businesses before the building is even designed. Experientia and Sitra have led participative approaches, in which more organic, sustainable and local food businesses have been approached to be potential tenants in Low2No. Through this active curation, tied to urban agriculture strategies that are designed into the built fabric, Low2No becomes a platform for a new kind of food culture in the city.

With “smart city” systems, the building produces and publishes data about its performance in real-time, enabling others to build visualisations, apps and other artefacts using that data. This is perhaps the most obvious sense of platform, but also draws additional value to the block, over and above the typical building project.

These strategies are lifted from the context of web design and introduces them to policy and planning contexts where such practice is still rare, never mind common. There are numerous characteristics that define the successful “platform play” — this essay won’t dwell on them, as they can be readily found elsewhere, perhaps most usefully in Steven Johnson’s Where Good Ideas Come From (2010).

As The Edge case study illustrates, the shift between matter and meta, working on some traditional output of design practice yet with strategic or systemic effects as a further goal, describes some of the core characteristics of strategic design. Yet the design practice and business strategy of the platform also has this zooming effect at its core.

Here, the particular product or service has to be realised in detail in order to derive network and platform effects once it achieves critical mass. So Apple’s iTunes has to work in terms of some core system functionality — managing files, playing media, payment and account handling, and so on. Yet iTunes becomes a platform through strategic licensing deals that enables the file management system to become the primary store for digital content, and incorporation into other hardware and software platforms that are part of a coherent, almost seamless system of “content experience”.

At this point, such a service can enable a systemic change — by 2009, iTunes was responsible for over 25% of all music sales in the US; in just a few years, it had removed a huge chunk of the physical record store sector, which had been around for almost a century.

Note the symbiotic relationship, though: without the attention-to-detail required in executing high-quality interaction design or industrial design, for example, the strategic elements will not be realised; without the strategic alliances opening up the platform, the particular products and services will not be used enough.

Whether the designer is at the core of the business strategy or not, one has to be intimately aware when designing of how a system works on both scales and at all points in-between; to understand the pixel and the platform.

It could be argued that the good architect likewise has to be aware of the detailing on a door handle as well as a building’s relationship with the wider system of built fabric, community and infrastructure it sits within, whether that’s a log cabin on the edge of a forest or an apartment block in a dense urban core. Similarly, a particular breed of industrial designer is simultaneously aware of the curve of an electric car’s wheel arch and how it might suggest a new infrastructure of charging points rather than filling stations.

Each of these suggests that a strategic element to design can be entertained as a core part of design practice. Some aspects of design have drawn this scaling between meta and matter out more than others, and sometimes simply through the proclivities of a particular designer or design firm.

This feature is common to design processes and design-led organisations, though not necessarily unique to designers or present in all designers. Norman Foster reflected on working with Apple’s Steve Jobs recently:

> “He encouraged us to develop new ways of looking at design to reflect his unique ability to weave backwards and forwards between grand strategy and the minutiae of the tiniest of internal fittings. For him no detail was small in its significance and he would be simultaneously questioning the headlines of our project together while he delved into its fine print.“ (Norman Foster, 2011)

With Low2No, the development of the “smart city” services layer as a platform implies that similar code, similar interfaces — and ideally interchangeable data — can be developed for other blocks at Jätkäsaari, as well as at other urban renewal projects elsewhere in Helsinki, such as Kalasatama and Arabianranta, and ultimately combine to form a smart city platform for Helsinki and beyond. It’s not only easy to imagine how a building-based service might replicate, and gain in value as a result of a greater network, but it’s actually imperative to build in replicability with a platform-based service for it to succeed. As with the development of Twitter, it could be seen that Low2No starts to materialise first as an applications programming interface, rather than wood, glass and concrete.

Returning to the fire codes issue, a traditional approach would have been for a new timber building, which would be an exception, to warrant an associated exception being made in terms of building regulations. Yet an exception does not enable systemic replicability; it only enables one instance — the exception. So the strategy was to change the general fire code permanently; that would enable other buildings to follow after Low2No.

Even the architecture itself was designed to be replicable to some degree.

This is not common in building projects, as there is usually no financial incentive contained within the business model to justify it. This is not a question of technology or architectural qualities, but of business model and cultural attitudes. For Low2No to try to break this mould was tough. As noted, the smart systems layer is far easier to understand in terms of replicability, partly due to the relative lack of “matter” involved ie a smart services layer. Building on contemporary urban informatics thinking, smart services are integrated into physical matter to some extent — in terms of apartment fittings, lobby spaces and building façades — but the bulk of it exists as digital media, and so is innately transferable. It is also a medium in which platform-thinking is, if not inherent or mandatory, well understood and at the core of most business models. By positioning smart services at the core of Low2No however, we have a chance to “infect” the built environment business with some of this thinking.

The challenge is to draw platform thinking into other areas of public life, including built artefacts and physical services where appropriate, in order to unleash its associated systemic effects outside of digitally mediated environments or contexts. For example, what would a platform for local, public cultures of decision-making look like?

PLAY #4: THE LAYER

The additional benefits of prototyping, in the context of governance or public-service culture, are that they provide a way of moving forward in the first place, through activity that generates learning (analysis) and human-centred system design as a side-effect of doing something (synthesis). A prototype suggests a way of mitigating risk, through iterative approaches, while delivering ambitious change — it enables the platform and policy to develop structurally, finding a way to move free of the straitjacket of over-analysis and over-consultation.

But the strategic platform and policy cannot be a prototype in toto, just as public service is too important to be a prototype. There is a danger in describing projects overall as prototypes, in that it suggests they are in some way “not real”, that they can be turned off, decommissioned. Strategic projects such as Low2No must be beyond mere prototyping, or “showcases of sustainable living”. It must be a real block, with real inhabitants living and working in it, as it is the foundations upon which the subsequent or associated strategies sit. Remove the foundations, and the whole strategic edifice might crumble. More broadly, public administration was invented to provide security, stability and certainty, after all.

Jocelyne Bourgon, who has 40 years experience of Canadian public service, effortlessly sums up this dilemma:

> “How do we ensure that public institutions designed for stability, predictability and compliance can also improve the capacity to anticipate, innovate and introduce proactive interventions in a timely way when the collective interest demands it?” (Jocelyne Bourgon, 2011)

Thinking about what elements of a platform can be prototyped can be informed by understanding layers — of a policy, of a governance structure, of a prototype artefact — and the differing pace of change at each. This idea of adaptive layers is drawn from Stewart Brand’s book How Buildings Learn (1994). Ironically, this book has made little difference to architecture, where its anti-modernist invective was aimed, albeit with highly variable accuracy, but has been highly influential in internet-based platform thinking, interaction design and software development.

Brand sees structures comprising different layers that shear against each other at different paces, and sees an adaptive structure as one that enables this “slippage” between differently paced systems, such that a structure “learns” and improves over time.

![[00006.jpeg]]

Otherwise slow systems block the flow of the quick ones, and the quick ones tear up the slow ones with their constant change.” (Brand, 1994)

This provides an insight into how to design platforms, with core services moving slowly while faster layers enable experimentation and learning through prototyping. How to apply this to governance and cultures of decision-making? Brand moved his layers diagram beyond buildings to culture, seeing governance as a layer within a global system of shearing layers. “Shearing and slipping” in this context describe a form of information exchange.

![[00007.jpeg]]

Similarly, Steven Johnson has written about the generative platform’s reliance on the idea of stacked layers, or “platform stacks”, in which cultural and scientific development, as well as the internet, rely on a form of strata of informational exchanges (Johnson, 2010).

But what if this entire system of fast and slow layers was overlaid on to government? In Fast Strategy, Mikko Kosonen and Yves Doz describe their notion of strategic agility in terms of possessing “an ongoing capability for real-time strategic sensitivity, quick collective commitments, and fast and strong resource redeployment”.

Agility is a good word in this context, as opposed to say “speed”. Government is often characterised as being too slow, but speed should not be a driver in itself. It could be that we need a form of slow government, predicated on a similar idea of slowness that underpins the slow-food movement: valuing craft, provenance, attention to detail, shared responsibility, while creating a platform for dialogue and community through human-centredness. A fast, “push-button democracy” might well be the last thing we need.

Equally, there are areas of public service where the language and practice of prototyping and “fast layers” has to be developed with care. When the sector is healthcare, or some other area of public service where lives are at risk, it’s clear that the threshold for experimentation has to be tighter, and the slow pace of change of some layers can be an advantage. Although it happens, it should not be the case that peoples’ lives can be put at risk through an approach that preferences iteration — “it will get better” — over safeguards.

This idea of fast and slow layers can then be used to frame the discussion of risk within a system, with some layers slower and careful, and others more agile, more exploratory. Seeing the layers as linked — from policy to delivery, from system to product or service — albeit slipping fluidly against each other — also suggests a platform approach that intrinsically enables learning, and thus closes the policy gap described earlier. User-centredness, another core value in contemporary design, can be layered across this system too, with exterior layers of the platform more participative than slower, more strategic “internal” layers. The faster layers can pivot with greater flexibility, over time altering the slower layers conceptually beneath, their intended plasticity dictating how much and how quickly their “shape memory” can be rewritten. Again, this is zooming from matter to meta and back again.

All this would usefully reorient “problems” with risk, uncertainty and complexity through iterative development and wider systems thinking. It requires a comfort with complexity and “out-of-control systems” that is not exactly a natural fit with public-sector culture at this point.

However, it is increasingly common in business. Arup’s Tristram Carfrae has suggested the value of wallowing in complexity, of being entirely absorbed within a problem space, feeling your way around through exploration and projection, rather than trying to stand back and objectively survey or predict a route through. This has an inadvertent echo of Potter’s “advice for beginners” in his What is a Designer:

> “If you climb on top of a job, trying to master it, the work will suffocate. Let it take you, play with it, search for its own life.” (Norman Potter, 1969)

This exploration is also evocative of current thinking at the edge of business practice. Writing in the business magazine Forbes, Haydn Shaughnessy describes General Electric’s $100 million investment in cancer care through a social-innovation approach, based on Michael Porter’s notion of “shared value”. The language is peppered with “building ecosystems”, “shared platforms”, and systems deliberately exploring a space that is ill-defined through “a business process (that) appears vague when compared to traditional $100 million investments”.

> “What GE seem to be saying though is that you can’t really control the ecosystem approach to business. As challenges become more complex the appropriate strategy is one that mixes new ingredients into the soup and then waits to see what kind of flavours come out.”

Similarly, Steven Johnson relates how the potential of the “generative platform” is enabled through creating “a space where hunches and serendipitous collisions … and recycling can thrive. It is possible to create such a space in a walled garden. But you are far better off situating your platform in a commons.” (Johnson, 2010)

At first glance, looking at such “risky” language, one might think that getting the public sector to this point would be quite a challenge. But wait, the GE project concerns cancer care; a core public good. The challenge may be more in terms of leadership and political capital than in practice. A platform approach intrinsically entails this slightly out-of-control aspect, although the activity is within a platform is fundamentally shaped by the foundations and affordances it is designed with, and an understanding of which layers can be fast and which must be slow.

However, political capital is predicated on stated guarantees, not “waiting to see what kind of flavours come out”. As Philip Colligan of Nesta has pointed out, President Obama was elected for “Yes we can”, not “Yes we’ll try”. It would be more accurate to say “Yes we’ll try”, or even “You know what? We’ll give it our best shot, try out a few things, see what sticks, we’ll get a few things wrong but we’ll try really hard and, the House of Representatives willing, we’ll get better over time.”

Yet could genuine statements of intention, or long-term investments, be disconnected from electoral campaigns and short-term political cycles? This is a design challenge too. All electoral systems are designs, after all. Each is constantly being recalibrated.

For all the value they could create, too often designers appear naive in the face of genuinely understanding cultures of decision-making, of how an inability to generate political capital can undermine their ability to deliver change. Yet if design can truly create new cultures of decision-making that recognise the value in prototyping and platforms, it would in turn indicate a core value of strategic design to policy and practice in public service. Shared language is key to this process of assimilation; could policy usefully absorb the language of design and vice versa?

These words and concepts may offer some value: the MacGuffin provides motivation that drives strategic outcomes; the Trojan Horse contains the seeds of multiple strategic outcomes; the Platform elements enable those strategic outcomes to be diffused elsewhere, with prototyping of different layers ensuring its ongoing development.

This vocabulary is not new — it’s been borrowed and appropriated from elsewhere. But being able to ask the question “What’s the MacGuffin?” or “How will this work as a Platform?” or “Where are the pivot points?”, for example, introduces into projects and practice a strategic element, a magnetic pull on the concepts of strategic replicability and systems thinking.

   

What is The Dark Matter?

DARK MATTER

As the Low2No fire-code story illustrates, the answer to unlocking a new experience, product or service is sometimes buried deep within the organisational culture or the policy environment.

The difference between traditional design practice and strategic design is that strategic design recognises that this “dark matter” is part of the design challenge. This is after the urban planner and theorist Wouter Vanstiphout’s memorable phrase:

> “If you really want to change the city, or want a real struggle, a real fight, then it would require re-engaging with things like public planning for example, or re-engaging with government, or re-engaging with a large-scale institutionalised developers. I think that’s where the real struggles lie, that we re-engage with these structures and these institutions, this horribly complex ‘dark matter’. That’s where it becomes really interesting.” (Wouter Vanstiphout, interview with Rory Hyde, 2010)

This notion of dark matter suggests organisations, culture, and the structural relationships that bind them together as a form of material, almost. It gives a name to something otherwise amorphous, nebulous yet fundamental.

Dark matter is a choice phrase. The concept is drawn from theoretical physics, wherein dark matter is believed to constitute approximately 83% of the matter in the universe, yet it is virtually undetectable. It neither emits nor scatters light, or other electromagnetic radiation. It is believed to be fundamentally important in the cosmos — we simply cannot be without it — and yet there is essentially no direct evidence of its existence, and little understanding of its nature.

83%.

![[00008.jpeg]]

The only way that dark matter can be perceived is by implication, through its effect on other things (essentially, its gravitational effects on more easily detectable matter).

With a product, service or artefact, the user is rarely aware of the organisational context that produced it, yet the outcome is directly affected by it. Dark matter is the substrate that produces. A particular BMW car is an outcome of the company’s corporate culture, the legislative frameworks it works within, the business models it creates, the wider cultural habits it senses and shapes, the trade relationships, logistics and supply networks that resource it, the particular design philosophies that underpin its performance and possibilities, the path dependencies in the history of northern Europe, and so on.

This is all dark matter; the car is the matter it produces.

Thus, the relationship between dark matter and more easily detectable matter is a useful metaphor for the relationship between organisations and culture and the systems they produce.

Strategic design often involves doing what the physicist Fritz Zwicky started doing in 1934 — looking for the “missing mass”, the material that must be inescapably there, that must be causing a particular outcome. This missing mass is the key to unlocking a better solution, a solution that sticks at the initial contact point, and then ripples out to produce systemic change.

The dark matter of strategic designers is organisational culture, policy environments, market mechanisms, legislation, finance models and other incentives, governance structures, tradition and habits, local culture and national identity, the habitats, situations and events that decisions are produced within. This may well be the core mass of the architecture of society, and if we want to shift the way society functions, a facility with dark matter must be part of the strategic designer’s toolkit.[^9]

This focus on organisational context, amongst other things, does not mean that the strategic designer becomes embroiled in the practice of large-scale “change management”, at least as it’s traditionally understood within corporations or public sector organisations. Change management is drawn from the toolkit and vocabulary of “human resources” and management consulting rather than design. The latter’s attention is on a deep understanding of people, habitat, culture, networks and systems, whilst constructing different ways of creating deep focus onto co-created productive outcomes, as well as addressing fundamental questions — it involves making things; it involves spatialising outcomes, or crafting products, or shaping and delivering services. This sets it well apart from classic change management rhetoric, which often comes down to consultation without participation, advocacy without responsibility, restructuring the solution without reformulating the question, and producing intangible strategy without tangible outcome.

Dark matter surrounds the various more easily perceptible outcomes that we might produce — the observable physical matter of a neighbourhood block, a street food cart, a mobile phone. It is what enables these things to become systemic, to become normative. It is the material that absorbs or rejects wider change.

THE PROBLEM OF INSTALLATIONS

Dark matter is what makes it difficult for installations to scale. The design world is full of prototypes, installations, one-offs. The idea is the easy bit. There are so many ideas produced every day, everywhere, that installations and prototypes are almost a necessary pressure valve, a way of getting things out of one’s mind.

Yet such temporary interventions are often accompanied by claims as to wider significance; that an installation, say, can suggest a new way of doing, of living. Indeed it can, but it doesn’t actually make it happen. If it’s too easy to get an idea accepted, you’re probably doing it wrong. You’re probably not disturbing the dark matter enough.

A genuine and concerted engagement with dark matter is what would enable an intervention to become systemic, permanent, influential. It is not enough to produce the prototype of an entirely new paradigm for the motor car, say, without redesigning the organisation that might design and produce them, the supply chains that might enable their construction and maintenance, the various traffic and planning regulations that must absorb a new vehicle, the refuelling infrastructure, and so on.

Equally, attempts to reach into that dark matter and produce change will not be as effective without an artefact that can demonstrate the benefit of such change; that can motivate, in effect.

The strategic designer has to work in both modes, recognising that both are connected by an umbilical cord. This is also akin to John Thackara’s idea of the macroscope — as opposed to a microscope — a notional device or strategy that enables one to see an entire system, its composite dark matter perhaps, from the perspective of the artefact, the particular instance of matter.

Thus, the strategic designer has to understand the characteristics of dark matter just as designers might understand wood, steel, glass, pixels and grids. For the strategic designer, the relationship between the observable physical matter and the imperceptible dark matter is indeed as symbiotic and essential as it may be to the cosmos. Manipulating one both enables and affects the other.

We need to understand more about dark matter’s particular qualities, affordances, pinch points, pliability, how it performs under stress, its elasticity, its history of use, its possibilities.

Recognising that dark matter is entirely dependent on context — a particular place, time and culture — makes this more complex than trying to understand steel, say, but no less important to the future of cities and societies.

CASE #2: RENEW NEWCASTLE — DARK MATTER TO UNLOCK PHYSICAL MATTER

Earlier we heard about how matter can unlock meta; in other words, how the different ways in which a building or other physical artefact (matter) can be deployed strategically in order to generate wider systemic change (meta). The zooming back and forth between matter and meta is a fundamental mode for the strategic designer, who must balance both conditions simultaneously.

So matter can unlock meta.

It is also the case that meta can unlock matter.

By 2008, the core of Newcastle, New South Wales, had essentially emptied out — a familiar dispersal to the suburbs common to virtually all Australian cities. Dozens of buildings — more than 150 — lay empty in the often elegant yet fading city centre. Two years later, many of those exact same buildings were full of businesses and other organisations, with at least 60 new projects and ventures starting in at least 30 previously empty spaces. Those same spaces had undergone basic renovation and witnessed hundreds of events. In Newcastle, entirely new communities are now engaged in transforming how the city centre feels and functions.

This had all happened with no change in physical infrastructure — the matter — or essentially any funding whatsoever.

So what happened?

A Novocastrian-in-exile in Melbourne, Marcus Westbury, and a group of friends and colleagues, unlocked the entire place through understanding and manipulating the dark matter; through the legislative infrastructure invisibly overlaid on to the city centre’s leaseholds, which had been locking down the use of the spaces. What became known as the “Renew Newcastle” team visited the buildings’ landlords in the centre, and pitched the notion that there were individuals and organisations interested in moving in. But being creative businesses, small firms, individual entrepreneurs, artists and community groups, they just weren’t the kind of individuals that could take out a costly long-term commercial lease on a space.

> “We created new rules, new contracts, and convinced owners to make spaces available for what was effectively barter — we would find people to clean them, use them, and activate them and they could have them back if and when they needed them. We stepped outside the default legal framework in which most property in Australia is managed and created a new one. We used licenses not leases, we asked for access not tenancy and exploited the loopholes those kinds of arrangements enabled.” (Marcus Westbury, 2010)

Drawing from the language of risk management, Westbury and crew had convinced the landlords that Renew Newcastle could act as a broker of potential tenants, managing the risk of taking on small tenants by altering the duration of agreements. Every aspect was entirely legal; it was a smart, simple reinterpretation of leasing that turned the negative perception of short-term, transitional engagements into a positive one. It meant the re-booted city could act like a platform again.

Organisations started moving in, rolling up rusty shutters, painting the old interiors, transforming old department stores into small studios populated with second-hand furniture. Free wi-fi for the area was provided by a local internet service provider, happy to sponsor the initiative. Landlords started collecting rent. People began to visit the centre of Newcastle again. Given the new local economy, other adjacent spaces began to re-open, on a variety of more permanent leases.

Newcastle had started to transform itself. By late-2010, Newcastle featured in Lonely Planet’s Top 10 Cities to Visit in the world, an extraordinary turnaround, with Renew Newcastle recommended as a particular feature of the city. Not only had the city started to change the stories it told about itself, but the stories that others told too.

This had all been achieved by the notional stroke of a pen through some leasing arrangements. A tweak to the soft infrastructure, the dark matter, surrounding the physical reality of Newcastle had unlocked the latent possibilities in the city centre.

So matter can be unlocked by meta, by dark matter.

Better still, the “code” that underpins Renew Newcastle is now being copy-and-pasted to other cities, and ultimately to a Renew Australia project. It works as “a form of shareware”, in Westbury’s words, akin to Creative Commons licensing for intellectual property. “Renew” is now a platform for replicating this particular dark matter.

Pragmatically, the approach to manipulating this dark matter was to hack it, essentially, rather than attempting to attain the higher-order political power required to change policies, redirect funding or alter laws. So dark matter can be addressed in a number of different ways.

Westbury isn’t a designer, but his ability to perceive the “architecture of the problem” in Newcastle is a perspective shared with strategic design. His focus is on the city as software, and this is drawn from some background in understanding the architecture of software and operating systems — this in turn means that systems thinking is an almost instinctive act. Given that Westbury and his cohorts understand the subtlety inherent in contemporary software, this turns out to be a productive view of both systems and cities, and the form of software that binds them together.

> “It is the software of the city — which is often intangible, bewildering and complex — that defines their possibilities … Yet as hard as the software of the city is to conceptualise the consequences of changing it are very real. It is only the results that give it away. They are as evident and visible as the process that led to them is invisible.” (Marcus Westbury, 2010)

Westbury’s characterisation of the city’s software sounds an awful lot like dark matter; only perceptible by its effects yet fundamental. Westbury’s story further reinforces that dealing in the dark matter is not exclusive to the strategic designer.

With strategic design in mind, however, systems thinking is a core skillset, a core requirement, given the propensity for systemic change. Those designers most familiar with systems — architects, urban designers, landscape designers, interaction designers, industrial designers, service designers etc — are perhaps best equipped to think strategically and systemically.

Indeed, there are some techniques for understanding systems holistically, and “feeling” their boundaries and characteristics. Norman Potter described how designers can think in terms of understanding the boundaries of systems, and how they can then “perform” the system. Potter recalled how his cello teacher suggested how to “get the measure of a job, to get close to it, (you) project its life to absurdity (in all directions: scale, function, material, etc) and then pull back to some sense of boundary in what you propose to do”. (Norman Potter, 1969)

Whether Westbury and colleagues projected Newcastle to “absurdity” is a moot point, though they clearly looked at the depressed, empty streets and imagined a thriving city centre once again, when no one else could. Their ability to perceive, and then manipulate, the system is what enabled the transformative project, the systemic change.

So dark matter unlocked the physical matter, transforming exactly the same spaces and buildings through a leasing arrangement; a stroke of pen on paperwork, notionally at least. For Westbury, seeing the city as layers of hardware and software, his dark matter was the operating system of regulations and commercial arrangements:

> “In many respects, the software of the city is subtle. It is, at least, partially the cultural context, its history and its economic circumstances. Yet in most respects, the software of the city is codified and hard-coded — height and noise restrictions, planning processes, rules that enable certain possibilities and disable others. They can be embedded in commonlaw rights and privileges.” (Westbury, 2010)

Renew Newcastle immersed itself in this world, in order to understand the affordances — the handles, the sockets, the switches — with which it could manipulate the city. In this particular project, as with many of the most interesting projects, there was effectively no client, no organisation. There was no “inside”. So Renew Newcastle had to become its own client, create its own context, in order to understand a way in to the problem.

This ability to attain in-depth understanding, as an insider, is also the reason that the strategic positioning of design is crucial, and is part of the inherent value in strategic design expertise being embedded within organisations. While certain techniques can be used to immerse oneself in a client’s context, “method designing” for example, genuine immersion will always achieve richer results in terms of understanding dark matter.

DESIGNING THE CONTEXT OF THE WORK

> “Always design a thing by considering it in its next larger context — a chair in a room, a room in a house, a house in an environment, an environment in a city plan.” (Eliel Saarinen)

![[00009.jpeg]]

With strategic design, that next context is often a team, an organisation or a culture, and so refers to a complex net of relationships. It follows that it is necessary to design the context, this net of relationships, by considering the thing it is intended to produce. Again, it’s this symbiotic relationship between artefact and system, between instance and strategy.

The design planner and teacher Hugh Dubberly has suggested that “seeing patterns, making connections, and understanding relationships” are in fact the essence of design. Yet few designers would see that their design challenge is to understand, and often reorient, those relationships.[^10]

The dialogue about design, and design research, is still dominated by products, and their manufacturing and distribution processes. Read Dubberly’s fellow Apple alumnus Don Norman’s otherwise interesting and provocative critique of design research, including ethnography, and you’ll find it is really about the relationship between technological innovation and products (aeroplanes, mobile phones, computers, radio etc). There is little there about relationships, about soft infrastructure, about non-technical systems, about the design of “conditions” within communities and cultures.

This again explains why design so often fails to live up to its promise. Designers, like clients, are themselves attracted to the shiny end of projects, rather than delving into the dark matter and settling in for the lengthy engagement with an organisation. Yet organisation, context, bureaucracy, regulation and policy are absolutely crucial to the success of a project. If reoriented in such a way as to enable the intended outcomes, the intervention becomes a norm, the installation becomes a genuine product or service. Without that reorientation, we have failure, either of limited, restricted outcomes, or occasionally as catastrophe.

> “It’s only after the explosion that everyone realized the shuttle’s complex technology should have been drawn with the Nasa bureaucracy inside of it in which they too would have to fly.” (Latour, 1996)

As Bruno Latour suggests, products have their attendant bureaucracy embedded within them. It is this that enables them to plummet or soar.

CASE #3: BBC IPLAYER — STRATEGIC REDESIGN OF ORGANISATIONAL DNA

With a more down-to-earth example, design work carried out on the BBC iPlayer on-demand media system from 2003 to 2005 further articulates this hybrid connection between the product and the context that produces it. The iPlayer does represent a form of systemic change, albeit driven by a different purpose to most of the subject matter of this essay in that it is a public service media player rather than something that addresses so-called “wicked problems”.

Yet iPlayer was a radical shift for the BBC, upsetting just about every apple cart and destabilising most of the existing certainties upon which the organisation had thrived for 80 years. Now, given its huge success — by January 2011, 165 million programmes a month were being downloaded via iPlayer in the UK; an average of six per household — it is necessary to recall the internal resistance to many different facets of the project. This resistance was various and complex, sometimes intransigence, sometimes inertia, sometimes active: from the impact on production workflows to the challenge to the license-fee funding model; from the perceived threat to live broadcast, the centrality of channels, and authorship to a new understanding of resilient distribution; from the way in which the internet trampled over the geographical boundaries that had enabled intellectual property rights deals to the challenge of introducing the different craft practices necessary to produce a then-contemporary “web 2.0” service.

It was clear that the DNA of the organisation itself would have to be modified. Just as Google, say, might be optimised towards producing code, the BBC was optimised towards producing radio and television broadcasts. Getting the BBC optimised for delivering code was akin to significantly altering the course of an ocean liner halfway across an Atlantic crossing. With much of the crew close to open mutiny. In a storm.

To continue the analogy, one could attempt to shunt and pull the ship with a flotilla of tug boats until it stops resisting and is knocked off course, but it’s far better to be in the ship’s bridge with your hand on the tiller.

I was the design lead for a while, running large technical teams of designers and coders that had delivered iPlayer’s predecessor, and it was necessary to understand the architecture of the problem, to perceive the system around the eventual product, and to see that this system was cultural, organisational, strategic and regulatory, just as it was technical.

Key design moves included regarding client-side developers as being on the same level as designers and software engineers, to help engender the mutual respect that underpins successful multidisciplinary project teams. This included negotiating with unions and spending many, many hours working with human resources departments on job descriptions, as well as re-drawing “org charts” and talking with team-members. Yet this relatively subtle shift — nudging one internal discipline upwards two points on a pay scale — was probably as important a “design move” as any bit of interaction design or information architecture.

Similarly, creating a small research and development function internally, and designing it to have half the resources it actually needed to deliver prototypes — and so making it reliant on short-term partnerships with others — meant that the organisation had a way of spotting rapidly emerging opportunities, such as podcasting, while ensuring that this particular kind of intelligence was slowly transferred throughout the rest of the organisation. This built on earlier culture change at the design and editorial level, driving what was then called “user-centred design” practice into the heart of new media production.

Involvement in contemporaneous high-level strategic processes, Creative Futures and BBC 2.0, ensured that the intelligence gathered from delivering the project could inform the strategic context, and vice versa. Envisaging the BBC in 2015 from 2005 could only be done with authority by having a foot on the frontline. Ensuring the project could anticipate subsequent strategic requirements (overseas users, paid-content) could only be done with authority by having a foot in the strategic camp. Again, this constant zoom from product to strategy and back, via all points in-between (meta to matter). Here, this particular instance of the iPlayer was a MacGuffin for deeper shifts within the BBC.

Numerous other activities surrounded what would traditionally be described as the core design work: liaison with production teams responsible for content about data and metadata; working with presenters to advise them on the way to discuss on-demand media and timeshifting on-air; working with broadcast engineers to ensure that streaming servers could replicate the resilience expected of BBC services; working with existing approaches to BBC archives; integration with teams responsible for BBC production equipment; liaison with external rights bodies such as the Performing Rights Society and the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry as part of official BBC delegations (it was highly unusual for a designer to be in these conversations, almost a tacit indication that design could have a strategic agenda, or at least a role at a boardroom table); various other strategy processes at different levels; numerous instances and formats of internal “stakeholder” consultation …

And so on, for around three to four years.

This was a form of design work conducted from deep inside an organisation; sometimes instinctive, sometimes tactical, sometimes strategic.

Again, this was actively constructing “the architecture of the problem”, given that contemporary media works as a system, ensuring that it included the organisational and cultural context. This was beyond editorial concerns, which was also radical (and a threat) for many at the BBC, which was, and is, an editorially oriented organisation. But it was the design of media systems and organisations themselves that became the strategic act that would alter the greater system.

You can’t design a transformative service without redesigning the organisation, and this could only realistically be done from within an organisation. If you asked the organisation to somehow produce a map of the architecture of the problem, as above, it simply couldn’t. You can only feel that from within it, by observing its effects on things, as dark matter.

It’s not impossible to win over an organisation to a challenging idea from outside. Many do this all the time, of course. The architect Elizabeth Diller, interviewed in Domus, describes vividly the exhaustive and exhausting act of winning over all the stakeholders to one of their design projects:

> “The experience of Lincoln Center, with all its complexity, made me realize that I was already speaking in many tongues. The message is always the same but the emphasis is a bit different depending on who the audience is. Its true that I did a lecture that basically showed the same fifteen to twenty slides of Lincoln Center six times in repetition and each time I inflected the delivery of the description in a slightly different way. The same content but different nuance — it’s kind of a Rashomon lecture.” (Elizabeth Diller, Domus)

Good designers may well be particularly good at this. But the same role from within is different. Imagine if, as suggested earlier, organisations such as Lincoln Center possessed some architectural capacity in-house, either actively shaping MacGuffins and Trojan Horses, at all scales, or more convincingly coordinating external design interventions. It would help bind a change in dark matter to this building project; which otherwise is largely just that — a building project.

To use a football analogy, this internal role is akin to being the No 10, trequartista, or playmaker.[^11] As the play is whirling around them, the No 10 has to be aware of all the various movements and possibilities within a constantly shifting system. He has to have a strategic intent, to carve out a vision of a play several moves in advance. He is a midfielder, and so at the centre of things, and yet an attacking midfielder, and so concerned with progression, construction, with shaping the game’s events.

The analogy might stretch to the quarterback, for American readers. And lest football feels a stretch in the first place, writer Jonathan Wilson has suggested football “is about shape and about space, about the intelligent deployment of players, and their movement within that deployment.”

> “Think quickly, look for spaces. That’s what I do: look for spaces. All day. I’m always looking. All day, all day. Here? No. There? No. People who haven’t played don’t always realise how hard that is. Space, space, space. It’s like being on the PlayStation. I think ‘shit, the defender’s here, play it there’. I see the space and pass. That’s what I do.” (Xavi Hernández, Barcelona)

![[00010.jpeg]]

It’s almost instinctive, this sense of reaching into the very matter of an organisation and rearranging it on the fly. It is sometimes reactive, in response to a phone-call from the boss; it is sometimes anticipatory (his team mate Dani Alves has said that Xavi “plays in the future”). Either way, it requires an understanding of the architecture of two systems — the problem, and the organisation — and a sense of direction.

MALLEABILITY

Drawing from Hitchcock was no accident. It positions design as a cultural act, rather than, say, engineering or management consultancy. As stated earlier, design’s core value is in synthesising disparate views and articulating alternative ways of being.

For “articulating alternative ways of being”, read design’s ability to describe how the world is inherently mutable or malleable — how everything is a decision, or the result of a decision — and to suggest and describe alternatives.

Design suggests design, in this sense, as it implies that design has led to this particular state, almost no matter what the scenario, and that therefore another state can exist; we can redesign things, if we see the world in this mutable way.

Jonathan Ive, the senior vice president of industrial design at Apple, in Gary Hustwit’s documentary Objectified, has an almost pained expression on his face when he tries to understand how, in some instances, the world has come to be in material form.

> “Why, why, why is it like that, and not like this?” (Jonathan Ive, Objectified, 2009)

Imagine looking at the world through Ive’s hurting eyes. The essential mutability of the world may be a somewhat naive, or — more charitably — optimistic, viewpoint. It could also be seen as solipsistic, in that it privileges the viewpoint of the designer, suggesting that the designer has perhaps the fundamental position in reorienting the world, that all things are design challenges. In other words, a hammer sees only nails.

Yet Ive’s querulous grimace is found not only among industrial designers, architects and service designers, casting glances around a world of objects they’re partly responsible for, but also increasingly in the world of policy, strategy and culture, a world that is the focus of strategic design. From a position outside the professional design world, Philip Colligan of Nesta also sees policy issues in terms of design challenges.

> “It seems a bit obvious but the way that public services are organised inevitably influences the outcomes they achieve. Policymakers and managers are taking design decisions all the time, too often without realising it.” (Philip Colligan, 2011)

We can even think of the ideologies in play at any one time as being a result of, or a manifestation of, design decisions. The dominant market-oriented neoliberal hegemony across much of western society, for instance, had to be actively inculcated. People had to breathe life into it, with purpose. It is not a naturally occurring state. It is thought of as a system, with certain characteristics, attributes and affordances; something that can be calibrated, modelled, modified.

This was clear when one of its architects, Alan Greenspan, under some pressure because his global financial system had become a global financial crisis, described the market-oriented ideology in terms akin to an inexplicably misfiring engine, or some inconvenient errors in a block of code.

> “Yes, I’ve found a flaw. I don’t know how significant or permanent it is. But I’ve been very distressed by that fact.” (Alan Greenspan, New York Times, 23 October 2008)

The hegemonic characteristics of such systems mean that we tend to ignore, or conveniently forget, that they have been designed; they have been imagined, articulated, stewarded into position.

> “Failure wasn’t so much the absence of attention to individual details as it was an entire culture to do with the primacy of business, of money, of deregulation, of putting the interests of the financial sector first. This brought us to a point in which a belief in the free market became a kind of secular religion. The tenets of that religion are familiar … all debatable, contestable positions — but in the Anglo-Saxon world we forgot to contest them.” (John Lanchester, 2010)

The same can be said of democracy, nation states, regional authorities, many systems of living, for example — all are designed, all are design challenges, all are “debatable, contestable positions”.

> “Many of the troubling situations in our world are the result of design decisions. Too many of them were bad design decisions, it is true-but we are not the victims of blind chance ... We may not have meant to do so, and we may regret the way things have turned out, but we designed our way into the situations that face us today.” (John Thackara, 2005)

One can make a strong critique of this idea that everything can be redesigned because it has been designed. It concerns the understanding that human existence is actually beyond rational understanding — beyond a single unified idea of consciousness, effectively (Semir Zeki, 2003). Thus it is not actually designed, at least in any sense that can be consciously redesigned. So design cannot pursue some prescribed rational course of action towards a solution.

Additionally, some have argued that certain core systems are achieving a level of complexity that is increasingly beyond our comprehension. On the one hand, this is due to the characteristics of self-organising systems such as the global economy, which David Korowicz argues is beyond our ability to understand, design and manage:

> “Our global system emerges as a result of each person, company and institution, with their common and distinctive histories, playing their own part in their own niche, and interacting together through biological, cultural and structural channels. The self-organisation reminds us that governments do not control their own economies. Nor does civil society. The corporate or financial sectors do not control the economies within which they operate. That they can destroy the economy should not be taken as evidence that they can control it.“ (David Korowicz, 2011)

Yet another way in which complexity is placing systems beyond our comprehension, our agency, is through code. Kevin Slavin has positioned the algorithms that underpin financial systems in particular as a form of stealth technology, that can “move invisibly through the earth”. These “black box” algorithms are so complex that they are effectively beyond the comprehension of even the programmers who coded the frameworks that produce them. Some 70% of all activity on Wall Street is involved in automated high-frequency trading, algorithm-driven trades that are either trying to hide (disperse) or locate (aggregate) larger movements of trade. According to Slavin, the algorithms that drive, say, a Roomba vacuum cleaner robot are essentially not of humanity.

> “These are things that humans write, but can no longer read.” (Kevin Slavin, 2011)

One response is, of course: really, what are we supposed to do? Helplessness is not a happy place.

Another response to the critique is that design, at least as discussed here, is more exploratory than “prescribed trajectories”. It might instead use prototyping and feedback loops to flush out the right questions in the first place, before embarking on tentative processes that are iterative and adaptive in nature. This subtly undercuts the critique about “prescribed courses of action”. (The optimism inherent within design also allows us to build on Thackara’s statement that “out of control” is an ideology, not a fact — that these things are the outcome of policy, one way or another, and so can be reshaped by different policy.)

This is not an instrumental or engineering-led idea of design, in which altering the infrastructure, or plumbing, underpinning the current reality will at some point produce a different one. Instead, this is an idea of design as directly involved in the creation of culture (culture as a way of being, a pattern of living, after Raymond Williams, rather than simply cultural production and consumption).

This moves design well beyond simple problem solving, and means that design does not always “know”. But with this more investigative view of design, there are no claims to having a clearly prescribed course of action with a straight line to the ideal solution. Yet we can still see the world as malleable, fungible — and look for affordances to work with — without the sense that design necessarily knows all.

It also means that by making small moves within a system, we may be able to shift the pattern at the macro-level, just as a single bird within a flock does. This is Kwinter’s description of “a delicate servo-mechanism guiding a much larger machine”. The “much larger machine” may not be malleable directly, or even capable of being understood. Yet it can still be affected.

   

What is The Problem with Design Thinking?

AN ASIDE

By now, the difference between this strategic design and design thinking should be clear, but it is worth picking over the bones of the latter a little, in order to shed further light on the former.

Unfortunately, design thinking has been little more than a distraction, if not a dead end. Even self-proclaimed boosters such as BusinessWeek’s Bruce Nussbaum have retracted their early, somewhat hubristic claims about the value of design thinking.

In a piece on Frog Design’s blog — along with IDEO, Frog were one of the agencies best-placed to capitalise on the hype around design thinking — Frog’s vice president of creative Robert Fabricant hammers the final nails into the coffin of design thinking:

> “It is time to move on. Business never really got the message. What businesses continue to care about is innovation. While designers may think that innovation requires Design Thinking, that was an idea that never really stuck in the executive suite.”

In October 2011, Rotman, one of the leading business management and strategy publications, published an article by Liedtka and Ogilvie describing how to absorb “design thinking” into your organisation, your management practice. This article is a good example of its type, and from a publication with authority in this field. The article starts by noting how Tim Brennan of Apple’s Creative Services group describes his design process, which he illustrates as a spaghetti-like tangle separating starting point from finish.

![[00011.jpeg]]

After chiding Brennan for apparently “mock(ing) the idea that a formal process could possibly exist” for designing, they move straight into the design-thinking mantra: we can all be designers, if you just follow this simple 10-step process.

> “The approach we describe here is more akin to Dorothy’s ruby slippers than to a magic wand; you’ve already got the power; you just need to figure out how to use it.”

Eliding the work of Apple’s Creative Services group with “figuring out how to use your power” is a little ambitious at best, and woefully disingenuous at worst. Few would have the capacity to sustain work at that pitch. The more fundamental problem is a lack of belief in anything that wouldn’t have a “formal process” the authors might recognise. If it can’t be reduced to a 10-step process, how could it possibly have value?

These 10-step processes, just like other artefacts of the design thinking rhetoric, do not and cannot go into detail about exactly how to practice approaches like divergent thinking or sketching. CEOs don’t have time for such detail, of course; they rarely have time to even think about where their firm should be going.

“Practice” is not idly named. “Thinking like a designer” — leaving aside the question of whether there’s even a point to everyone thinking like a designer — is something that takes years of, well, practice. Of experience stretched taut across numerous contexts and clients; of constant, near-obsessive engagement with the world about you that would almost be exhausting where it not so enriching. It is also bound up in “the designer’s stance” (after Paul Dourish), which is more a fundamental matter of perspective and positioning than simply a set of habitual tropes to be tried on.

Design thinking, as described here, not only misrepresents the value of professional design but misleads on the promise of everyday design.

While a form of design is practised by everyone, everyday, to some degree — whether vernacular design of products, services, spaces, or the everyday design of immediate social, cultural or physical conditions — the practice of professional design is something else.

Just as most people can cook, we still go to restaurants to enjoy the work of a professional chef. There is more to the practice of chef than being more liberal with the salt and butter than one would at home. Equally, there is more to the experience of the restaurant — the art of hosting, perhaps, as well as other experiential possibilities — than simply creating a place to consume food and drink.[^12]

For “professional”, do not necessarily read high-class restaurants like Noma or El Bulli. This could equally apply to a small mama-papa café in a dusty old town in Liguria, with rough-hewn bread dipped in freshly made pesto served on rough dishes in the shade of a lemon tree. The point is that the quality of experience is enabled by years of practice in either case.

In line with the significant increase in quality and variety of cooking at home for enjoyment, there has been a significant increase in the range, diversity and quality of food experiences available via restaurant, café, street food and other professional hospitality environments. There is a symbiotic relationship here, with the entire food system benefiting from increased engagement in both aspects.

So perhaps there is an analogue between cook and chef, and everyday design and professional design. Being aware of the value of design, through an everyday engagement with it, will benefit professional design and vice versa. The increased awareness does not then undermine the role for professional design, but could reinforce it.

The message behind design thinking, however, doesn’t really state this linked opportunity. Allied to the consultant model, that would look too craven — i.e. if you open your eyes to design thinking, you may also open your wallet to more fees for us professional designers.

A tough sell.

Design thinking needn’t solely reside in the consultant model of course, and there are benefits to more people being aware. But this does not mean that an everyday cook working at home can achieve the same results as a professional chef working in a professional kitchen, hosted by a professional maître d’ in a professionally designed space. Just as a pub football team on a Sunday league pitch will struggle to attain the heights of Barcelona’s highly technical tiki-taka style of football.

Strategic design, then, is the application of professionally practiced design expertise to strategy, policy, governance and culture. An outcome of its work may be heightened awareness of some easily shareable attributes of design practice but the professional expertise of the designer is a core ingredient in the mix.

Proponents of design thinking rarely suggest that design practice might involve, say, sitting and drawing a shape or object hundreds upon hundreds of times.

Three members of Sitra’s SDU, architects all, have often mentioned the hours and hours spent at the Harvard Graduate School of Design in drawing classes. This is not the glamorous end of design practice; clients often only see what Chilean architect Alejandro Aravena called the “magic moment”, when the designer quickly produces a sketch in front of the awed client. Aravena points out that this is really the tip of the iceberg, in terms of work; that the client is not seeing the sheer graft spent leading up to that moment. It, in part, is reinforced by design media that shows glossy pictures of outcomes — the building, the product, the screenshot, one set of plans.

The architect Renzo Piano, quoted in Richard Sennett’s The Craftsman, gives a sense of this graft:

> “You start by sketching, then you do a drawing, then you make a model, and then you go to reality — you go to the site — and then you go back to drawing. You build up a kind of circularity between drawing and making and then back again … This is very typical of the craftsman’s approach. You think and do at the same time. You draw and you make. Drawing … is revisited. You do it, you redo it, and you redo it again.” (Renzo Piano, 2008)

So the design-thinking set is being somewhat selective in hiding the rest of the iceberg when suggesting their “Top five design skills you can pick up”.

To be selective is not a problem; any transferable set of skills still needs translating from one context to another, and some approaches won’t survive the journey. However, in sloughing off the apparently tough or repetitive aspects of design practice, the proponents of design thinking are in danger of suggesting that there is no relationship between these elements and the other aspects.

They are in fact tightly bound. The ability to draw 100 variants rapidly, accurately and imaginatively seems directly connected to these “higher-order” outcomes of synthesis, visualisation, holistic thinking and so on.

An example: West London. Mid-1990s. A recording studio. The musician Bryan Ferry is giving me some feedback on my proposed designs for his website.

“More colour, more girls,” he said, with just the hint of a smile.

While this had the benefit of being a succinct — and, it turns out, memorable — summary of the client’s requirements, it leaves the designer with quite a lot to do, in terms of translating that into the minutiae of information architecture, interaction design and so on. But as a designer, one quickly gets used to rapidly translating one short, oblique input into a series of possible outputs.

The proponents of design thinking would recognise the value of this, and suggest that it might be a core tenet, and one to be adopted by non-designers everywhere.

Yet I suspect the ability to take “More colour, more girls” and translate it into business strategy and interactive experience is connected directly to the hard graft of late nights filling a sketchbook, poring over reference material, producing variant after variant in Photoshop et al, constantly “eating the world with your eyes”, as the fictional design tutor in Chip Kidd’s novel The Cheese Monkeys (2002) memorably put it. In short, the mental agility to generate ideas — to see design as cultural invention — is directly linked to the craft skills of design practice.

“More colour, more girls” is a glib example. But the hard work in these lower order design processes — the trainee architect drawing the same shape for hours until the essence of a line emerges — demonstrate how craft skills inform the higher order design processes. Our particular challenge is to apply them outside of the traditional commercial context of products and services, and this is somewhere that design thinking also falls curiously short.

IDEO’s Tim Brown wrote one of the key initial books on design thinking — Change By Design. He suggests the value in design being applied strategically and in a rich variety of contexts; yet in a chapter called “A new social contract”, IDEO’s frame tends towards examples from business. This is when the writing comes alive, when the case studies resonate. There tends to be little indication of how to actually engage with, in particular, the “dark matter” of public service and governance, which is essentially what social contracts are embedded within.

When he does address public agencies — the Transportation Security Administration, the US Department of Energy — there is no real analysis of the architecture of the problem, of the position of those organisations in public and civic life, of the conditions of public-service culture.

There is no sense of whether, say, security and energy are being well-addressed by the existence of those two organisations, and whether the problem might be better framed in some other way. The clients exist, and as they are clients, their position remains unchallenged, despite their positioning, remit, stance, framing, governance, and political relationships being a potentially fundamental component of the architecture of the problem. This is where design thinking falls short of anything remotely radical. It’s where it is actually stuck in process improvement within a predetermined problem space, unable to manouevre into more interesting and useful areas.

So despite being a well-balanced book, essentially a good book, it is too easily led into the arena of commercial management consultancy practice rather than the conditions of social contracts.

There is nothing wrong with that in itself of course, except perhaps that it promises a discussion of a new social contract and doesn’t necessarily deliver one, but it does leave a large space for a different kind of strategic design addressing governance, public life, the civic sector.

As it doesn’t address this dark matter, the architecture of the problem, design thinking cannot genuinely get traction in any fundamental sense. Design-thinking proponents might suggest that getting “a designer in the boardroom” might be a good idea yet they don’t indicate how one might do that, or really what they might do when they get there.

![[00012.jpeg]]

Victor Papanek’s diagram juxtaposes the share that the design typically has of a problem space, at around 5%, with what he calls “the real problem” consisting of the remaining 95% (Victor Papanek, 1984). Nearly four decades on, design thinking does not present any particularly new insights for the 5% problem.

Design performs best at the start of things, even before the need for a “start of things” has been clarified, but unfortunately, as Noah Raford pointed out, “the everyday realpolitik of most organisations will actively work against this from occurring”.

Again, this calls for organisations to be redesigned to address this. The brilliant designer simply ends up wallowing luxuriantly in that 5%, limiting their effect. The incompetent or unlucky designer ends up battered back into the 5%. In either case it’s an ineffective position to work from, which cannot exert the strategic value inherent in design.

You cannot ask the right question from the 5% corner in Papanek’s diagram. The design function need not be expanded, but strategic design is predicated on a different position within the organisation’s decision-making apparatus.

Strategic design must be embedded within the heart of the organisation, in order to be able to perceive how the entire organisation operates (this is a system) and move freely across the intersection of its elements, and to have the agency to suggest and enact a reorientation of the organisation.

At this point it is worth reflecting on the positioning of Sitra’s Studio Model.

Sitra’s unique position — self-funded and independent, though under the auspices of parliament, and so both at arm’s length from government and embedded at the same time — means that initiatives it creates could begin to get traction right away. This is in stark contrast to most workshop-led consultancy, which often pitches ideas in from outside (despite, typically, the presence of “inside” in the workshop too). These subsequently bounce off the host organisation’s shields of indifference or institutional inertia as, beyond a certain scale, an organisation’s first instinct is often to protect itself against transformative ideas.

![[00013.jpeg]]

In particular, much strategic work for government clients in particular suffers from a major flaw — the lack of a “hinge” connecting the work to a clear pathway to projects. If the workshop is free, as it often is in new problem areas where there is no clear understanding of value, it’s particularly difficult, Here, the client is barely a client at all in one of the more meaningful senses ie they haven’t paid for it, they don’t have “skin in the game”.

Equally, studios can usefully bring together multiple stakeholders. Yet with complex interdependent problems requiring holistic thinking and action, this can lead to no one body taking responsibility, and so potential solutions fall through the cracks between organisations or within one organisation’s architecture. Again, education is no longer the sole responsibility of the Department of Education.

![[00014.jpeg]]

Finally, workshops or studios themselves tend to a particular kind of focus, based on conversation and collaboration — yet they rarely provide the depth of analysis to tightly define an issue such that it can be developed into action. This often requires subsequent work, by which time the potential client has left the building and achieved escape velocity, easily sidestepping momentum generated in the workshop. The workshop model, which is often the foot-in-the-door for consultancies in this field, is intrinsically flawed.

The HDL Studio Model is designed to address many of these problems. Sitra has, to some extent, the capacity to reach into and manipulate the very fabric of governance. It is just inside and just outside government.

![[00015.jpeg]]

This embedded nature of strategic design is a key differentiator from the consultant’s model of design thinking, which is often unable to produce the same effects often simply due to the consultancy model; the consultant has no “skin in the game” either, in the long run. This is not to say that a consultant model cannot produce work of value; just that it cannot produce much work of value in this context. It is left once again struggling to grasp the lipstick, rather than anything more meaningful, as Bruce Nussbaum later admitted:

> “In a few companies, CEOs and managers accepted that mess along with the process, and real innovation took place. In most others, it did not. As practitioners of design thinking in consultancies now acknowledge, the success rate for the process was low, very low.” (Bruce Nussbaum, 2011)

Leaving aside the paucity of much consultancy work — which is often because of the action or inaction of the client, to be fair — and in particular the hopeless world of much change management consultancy, the core problem is in this positioning. It cannot genuinely reach into the organisation with any power to genuinely re-shape, and has no capacity for the long term.

It seems far more fruitful to look at the possibility of the strategically embedded designer. Throughout 2012, Sitra SDU is running a programme of placing strategic designers in various positions in Finland’s government — in municipal and national government — as a direct test of the embedded approach.

Another good example is Copenhagen-based Mindlab, a design agency set up within the Danish government. Mindlab is formally more service design than strategic design, and so is concerned more with improving the performance of services and operations within the three ministries that fund it (Ministry of Business and Growth, Ministry of Taxation, and Ministry of Employment). Hence it has, up until now, been working in a more solution-oriented mode rather than a strategic one as such ie its annual report in 2009/10 talks of a mission to “develop and implement higher-quality, higher-impact solutions that have fewer costs”. It is interested in moving into strategic territory however, and are clearly high-performing, so this is another interesting experiment to watch in terms of embedding design capacity within government. As design becomes to be seen as strategic capacity, the value in outsourcing it diminishes. What this means for both government procurement and the external consultancy market remains to be seen.

Changing the positioning of the designer is one avenue to explore. The potency of design is related directly to these structural/organisational matters, after all, particularly in respect of strategic design. The consultancy model simply does not have the necessary freedom to radically change the brief, to work the context, to search for strategic solutions outside of its engagement.

Cedric Price told a story of prospective clients, a husband and wife, coming round to dinner to discuss the new home they wanted him to design. Price sat through the dinner, listening to the to-and-fro between the couple with some discomfort, before pronouncing: “My dears, the last thing you need is a house; you need a divorce.”

Whether Price got paid for this advice, beyond his dinner, is another unknown. But his ability to suggest a solution other than a building is, unfortunately, still radical for an architect. Most designers, most consultants, simply cannot act like this.

Looking at architecture’s perennial inability to find more flexible and productive business models is another story. But one simple way to take the business model problem off the table is to be embedded within an organisation. There is a strong tradition here, as well as numerous examples of this in practice.

In industrial, interaction and service design, this is well understood, with designers often embedded in organisations at the highest levels. Perhaps this is most obvious in industrial design — Jonathan Ive at Apple is the current high-profile example, but see also his compatriots at car companies, consumer electronics and mobile telecoms companies — but media organisations (old and new) and other businesses where a user focus has been core to the success of the business proposition, have also found it easy to make the case for high-level, permanent design expertise in-house.

We might as well continue to look at Apple, given its popular perception as the current high watermark of design-led innovation. There, design is not a stage that happens before engineering and manufacturing (the analogy in policy-making would be the linear stages of vision, crafting and delivery) as Steven Johnson has illustrated when describing Apple’s approach of “concurrent or parallel production”:

> “All the groups — design, manufacturing, engineering, sales — meet continuously throughout the product development cycle, brainstorming, trading ideas and solutions, strategizing over the most pressing issues and generally keeping the conversation open to a diverse group of participants. The process is noisy and involves far more open-ended and continuous meetings than traditional production cycles — and far more dialogue between people versed in different disciplines, with all the translation difficulties that creates. But the results speak for themselves.” (Steven Johnson, 2010)

Indeed. The ability to position design strategically will come more naturally to these environments, given the long-term engagement with the proposition inherently alien to the consultant model; the consultant model simply cannot allow that kind of time. It need not be alien to public administration and policy-making, however; it too has a long-term engagement that could enable a richer and more vibrant form of “production cycle”, just applied to policy and delivery.

Strategic design is predicated on exactly this positioning: inside not outside, long-term not short, the pig not the lipstick.

Within this space, design brings its own culture of understanding (such that “inside” does not become blinkered), of projects (such that “long-term” does not become stolid or oblivious to opportunity), of stewardship and execution (such that “strategy” does not become detached from delivery).

Design is unlikely to be outsourced to consultants when it is so key to the success of the company’s products and services. Equally, a reliance on an organisation’s staff picking up “design thinking” is not good enough, compared with professional strategic design expertise embedded within the organisation.

If we recall Roger Martin’s words about integrating strategy and execution, it is clear that a strategy must be acted on quickly, and with quality, in order to fully deliver. Having design expertise embedded at a strategic level within the organisation would seem to be key here. For example, Nokia had a similar touchscreen technology to Apple at the same time that Apple was developing its iPhone[^13], yet Apple lines up its design capacity alongside all others, at the strategic end of projects; it moved more quickly, and delivered with greater quality.

Indeed in June 2011 Nokia won a settlement against Apple in a patent ruling related to this technology.

It is not enough to just have the idea. Strategy must be connected to delivery, and it is design that enables stewardship.

There is some tradition of this within architecture too, in addition to industrial and media design. Embedded design intelligence at the heart of the mid-century London County Council architecture department, for instance, not only led the development of much of modern London, such as the South Bank, but also proved a rich training ground for influential firms such as Archigram and the Smithsons. It was the world’s largest architect’s office by 1952-3, with more than 1,500 architects, as well as model-makers, furniture designers, quantity surveyors, artists — and even a sociologist.

Span Developments is a modern-day example; a property developer set up by two architects — Eric Lyons and Geoffrey Townsend. Legally, Townsend had to stop being an architect in order to become the developer because of RIBA rules — rather telling that — whereas Lyons remained the in-house architectural lead.

Having design at the core of the business enabled it to produce housing that has retained its value in numerous ways. Span built more than 2,000 homes in and around London during the 1960s, and Span houses are now sought-after examples of a gentle English modernism. The houses both reinvent and work within the suburban model; the estates are largely car-free, and feature large communal gardens (a landscape designer, Ivor Cunningham, was the third head of the business). They have retained market value and design value for over half a century — it is perhaps no accident that design was embedded within the business, rather than pitched in from outside.

Only from within can genuine contextual change occur. This is perhaps the deepest flaw in the “design thinking” consultancy model, and not something you hear the likes of McKinsey, KPMG, and PriceWaterhouseCoopers talking about much either.

Part of the issue for “the outsiders” is that strategic design solutions may not be “traceable” enough to validate the sales pitch of external consultancy.

Hugh Dubberly collected a “compendium of models” describing numerous approaches to design practice (Dubberly, 2004). The variety in that collection, as you might imagine, rather outstrips Rotman’s guide, and the compendium will have expanded since, as design itself has expanded in remit.

> “Design is no longer concerned only with things. Increasingly, design is concerned with systems — and now systems of systems or ecologies. In a sense, these systems are alive. They grow and co-evolve. Designers and product managers cannot always control them. Instead, they must create conditions in which they can emerge and flourish. All this requires new thinking and new knowledge. It requires design practice to learn.” (Dubberly, 2011)

Seeing like a system, and acting upon a system, means that traceability — clarifying one’s impact upon the system in detail — is complex, if not virtually impossible, given the systems in question. As we’ve seen, the architecture of projects in these spaces is more “small pieces, loosely joined”, in the words of David Weinberger, rather than tightly bounded projects with clear duration and accountability.[^14]

But equally, architecture in particular seems to get hung up on traceability, perhaps reflecting its increasing insecurity, backed into a corner of diminished power amidst numerous other trades and with little actual power in business terms. The trade’s concern with authorship has a long history, perhaps predicated on the elevated idea of the architect as “master builder” in the first place. Yet as buildings and spaces have become more complex, so the architect is one part of an increasingly diverse multidisciplinary team, almost a system in itself. Some architects are comfortable with the idea that their work is part of a wider system that leads to the realisation of a project (ultimately including the eventual users.) We needn’t solely look to a new generation for evidence of this — the great English architect Charles Holden (1875–1960) refused a knighthood twice, in 1943 and 1951, on the grounds that architecture was a collaborative effort. Many have not been as gracious, humble or wise, however. Yet lack of traceability is essentially only a challenge to the security of either the consultancy model or a discipline, rather than anything more meaningful. It doesn’t really matter in itself if architecture, say, becomes less relevant — if the greater goals of architecture are being addressed. Disciplines do not exist for the sake of it; they exist to serve some higher function. If the system in question improves, then traceability is only important as a learning criterion i.e. how did it improve, and can we replicate those manoeuvres elsewhere?

This is challenging for any number of traditional approaches or disciplines, whether they’re worried about proof of agency, “delivering results”, or concerned about authorship. Common to most of those starting to feel a little queasy given the wooly idea of creating conditions for out-of-control systems, whether MBAs or architects, is a position on the “outside” of outsourced consultancy.

With the worked example described earlier, within the BBC iPlayer design process, it is difficult to connect the regrading of client-side developers, for instance, to a particular outcome in the final product or service. Overall, system performance would have improved, but it’s difficult to pursue a linear bounded framework to understand just how, particularly over the course of four to five years. Consultancy fees would not — and should not, given that this is public money — stretch that far; equally, there is a limit to what the outsider can see. Recall that work was described more in terms of the non-linear, potentially aleatoric, real-time system of playing central midfield in a football team than the lean processes of the Toyota Production System.

This is more a butterfly flapping its wings than simple cause and effect. More like Brennan’s ball of wool than Six Sigma. It does not mean they do not produce value; simply that through the lens of external consultancy it might be difficult to tell. This is really only a problem for external consultancy.

This is not to say that an external perspective isn’t an important part of any strategic process — it is. It’s just that the usual artefacts of consultancy — the research, the workshops, the reports — do not change the actors inside the organisation. After the consultant leaves, the organisation is left with the same people being asked to deliver the recommendations in a report that was written by people without a long-term interest in the organisation.

This is something that the design-thinking crowd will rarely admit. Design thinking is usually predicated on an outside influence (design thinking) being absorbed into an organisation via the mechanism of a consultancy agreement (almost by necessity, short-term and restricted in brief). It will talk more about mindset change in existing staff than actively engaging with re-positioning and inserting strategic design capacity into the organisation.

This last apparent oversight may be because building capacity within an organisation reduces that organisation’s reliance on external consultancy. Design thinking consultants would be talking themselves out of a job if they recommended the best answer: to possess a strategic design capacity within the organisation.

Traditionally, the management consultant delves into dark matter.

Traditionally, the design consultant delivers observable matter.

The strategic designer moves between both, deploying observable matter to ensure that dark matter is addressed, and addressing dark matter to better deploy observable matter.

With this perspective, management consultancy and design consultancy may be fundamentally flawed. Their focus tends to be limited to one or the other, but has no real toolkit for addressing the symbiotic relationship between both. In part, this explains the poor performance of both sectors when judged against any remotely sophisticated value set.

Those assessing civil service and public service in particular have noted that a world of decentralised and outsourced services and complex policy problems leaves current policy-making models rather short. They are rarely equipped to assess quality in delivery, or to even perceive the edges of the systems they work within.

Design, an integrative discipline, is well suited to hovering between things, understanding intersections and edges, assembling through synthesis rather than funneling through analysis. The HDL Studio experience suggests that sketches derived from synthesis can deliver policy-makers with forms of insight better suited to these complex systems. It short-circuits traditional analysis.

Yet to genuinely perceive the various systems at play within decision-making — the architecture of the problem — design must be embedded within, and positioned strategically ie with a remit to reconceive and reframe strategic intent.

Equally, design must be placed just so in order to truly engage with stewardship, with ensuring that the strategic intent — the design — is carried through into delivery, into execution.

Design thinking, predicated on the consultancy model imbuing the organisation with “designerly” characteristics before moving on, simply cannot do either of these elements professionally. Understanding the architecture of the problem, and then ensuring the ongoing delivery of the solution, cannot be done with the necessary rigour and agency unless from within the organisation. After all, these two functions are essentially what organisations are — strategy and execution. How could they be outsourced?

Brown is right to see IDEO’s case studies as “powerful argument(s) for the design thinker’s gambit of handing off the tools of design to the people who will ultimately be responsible for implementing them”. Understanding the potential value of observation, divergent and then convergent thinking, prototyping and experimentation will likely be of immense value within most organisations.

It’s just that this will not be enough.

First of all, design is a practice, not a set of tools. Those people are not suddenly designers, for all the value in them seeing their working environment differently; just as someone receiving a set of steak knives is not suddenly Elizabeth David.

Secondly, it may be a distraction to have everyone “thinking like a designer”. Design is not so important that everyone has to do it, after all.

Thirdly, it does not allow room for professional design expertise to add insight. Note that this is “add” insight. One of the clearest points in Brown’s book, and the entire design-thinking oeuvre, is that insight, value, ideas can come from anywhere within an organisation, community, context, environment. Yet this is hardly a radical proposition after two decades of the internet, building on several decades of postmodernity, have destabilised long-held notions of authority and knowledge construction, and identity.

So design thinking is of limited value in terms of enabling genuine systemic or strategic change. It is simply not enough, as its original boosters are perhaps now realising.

   

What is The Point?

THE NEW DESIGN CHALLENGE

A different project from recent history: a pitch for a national plan for Kazakhstan, run from Australia. After around six months of high-level discussion, apparently very close to the key decision-makers responsible for the project and often through a form of loosely joined “Chinese whispers” (Kazakh whispers?) in and out of Astana’s corridors of power, the job was lost. To no one’s particular surprise, the brief went to local planners, rather closer to the aforementioned corridors.

However, the opportunity to conduct a form of design work at the scale of a nation was intriguing and beguiling. One can’t design culture, but it should be possible to shape the conditions in which society and culture unfolds to some extent. Indeed, that is the role of policy. Recalling Colligan’s remark that policy makes design decisions all the time, without realising it, the notion of raising awareness of strategic design within national policy debates is increasingly interesting.

Design has to earn the right to a seat at the table, though. During the Postopolis! LA event in 2009, just as the initial scale of the global financial crisis was understood, several sets of architects suggested their potential value to the White House administration in terms of getting the USA “back on track”. The most interesting, radical and progressive idea on that theme at the conference was Benjamin Bratton’s “resist the recovery”, which engaged in political and cultural systems; yet few of the other tentative proposals by architects seemed particularly thought-through. There was little idea of exactly what they might offer, other than a vague “designerly” way of being — surely that would be of some use? The lasting impression was of a desperate lunge at the half-chance of meaningful, profitable work, given the rapidly diminishing opportunities for architect-friendly construction projects.

A somewhat unfair characterisation — in most cases, the intentions were no doubt honourable — but it demonstrated the paucity of thinking and ambition of the design-thinking movement.

It also demonstrates how much of an outsider the design community is, or has become. The general lack of vocabulary and unfamiliarity with the landscape of that world was telling, just as we see polite yet vaguely mystified looks on the faces of policymakers when it’s suggested that design may have something to offer.

Designers stumble around like strangers in a strange land when entering this terrain. We are not trained to address the world of policy and governance. Our universe starts with pixels, plastic, hemlines and loggia rather than white papers, sub-committees, argument maps and political capital.

Yet there may be great value in strategic designers addressing society at this level, rather than through the typical channels of products and services. The challenge here is to understand and wrangle with this dark matter in order to outline a more constructive set of trajectories for society.

THE NEXT NORDIC MODEL

So what might a strategic design challenge look like at this scale?

“In Studio” describes three examples of strategic design challenges in detail, approaching ageing population, sustainability and the built environment, and education. Each of these was located in the context of Finland, each supported by a briefing and a set of discussions that unpacked their local context.

Finland itself is variously located in the context of a slippery concept known as the Nordic Model. As with other Nordic countries, this notional model (see The Nordic Model, Mary Hilson 2008) pervades much of the way that Finland’s culture unfolds, how business is conducted, and the content of the social contract, the relationship between citizens and government. The Nordic Model has also been hugely influential outside the region, despite its origins in a “small, scarcely-populated region on the margins of Europe”, in Hilson’s words.

> “Many of the academics who have studied the Nordic region have done so from an explicit position of approval or admiration for societies that seem to differ in important ways from other parts of the world … (It was) a model that would bear emulation by other societies.” (Mary Hilson)

The particular influence is slippery, however. If the image of the Nordic region can be focused on anything — other than a curious mix of socialist utopia and designer goods powerhouse, of high standards of living and high numbers of suicides, of sexual permissiveness and artistic freedom and over-regulated collective conformity — then it is the idea of the progressive welfare state.

The Nordic Model has been seen as “a model (or a warning)”, according to Hilson, with the warning perhaps coming from those who recognised the cultural difference to the increasingly dominant Anglo-American model developed from the early 1980s.

Early on in her book, Hilson presents what she says is an over-simplification of the origins of a shared sensibility across the Nordic region. Yet that over-simplification posits a useful insight nonetheless, suggesting that the Nordic Model is based on the “successful reconciliation of the apparently oppositional Enlightenment traditions of equality and liberty. National Romanticism had a relatively limited impact on the Nordic countries, allowing the liberal respect for individual liberty to flourish alongside peasant traditions of collectivism and community.”

In other words, the Nordic Model found a third way, roughly equidistant from capitalism and communism. Within the Nordic countries, this was highly variable, with Finland quite different to Sweden, which was in turn quite different to Denmark, Norway and Iceland.

Yet despite the over-simplification and the local variation, this balancing of social equity with significant commercial success is shared across the region and certainly visible within Finland.

FINLAND IS FLAT

Finland is flat. There are few mountains to speak of, and a large part of the country is lake and forest. The patterns of Finnish speech are relatively flat, particularly compared with the sing-song patterns of some of their Nordic neighbours. The Baltic Sea is often calm to the extent that it too is, well, flat. The skylines of its cities are essentially an even six to 10-storey canopy, almost uniformly stretching to its boundaries, punctuated only by the odd church spire.

And the society itself is flat, in that levels of income inequality are extremely low, and there are few barriers to social mobility within what is already a relatively non-stratified culture. Perhaps even sauna culture has a flattening effect — it is difficult to retain hierarchy when everyone is naked.

The role of government here is significant. Finland’s education system is world-renowned, usually first or second in measures of maths, science and reading, and essentially public and free. Pre-school children in Helsinki benefit from the päiväkoti (daycare) system, which includes daily hot meals. Similar conditions apply to its free public healthcare systems. Likewise, the supportive social services. Likewise, the quality and availability of public transport in its cities, in which you get free travel if you’re carrying a pram (with child, ideally). Although it has been growing in recent years, income inequality in the Nordic nations is still the lowest in the OECD. The gap between male and female employment rates in Finland is less than three percentage points, among the smallest in the world, and it boasts one of the highest rates of women returning to work after childbirth.

Urban development is aided by the fact that, in Helsinki, the city owns around 70% of the land. Here, Helsinki can pull levers that other cities have simply sold off. Some 90% of Helsinki apartments benefit from district heating, meaning everyone has the same heat and energy sources. The cities are largely bereft of architectural jewels, save a few Alvar Aalto and Eliel Saarinen classics, but there is a consistently high quality across the board, almost a nondescript everyday architectural standard in which nothing is bad but nothing is particularly great. People enjoy unfettered access to the country via rights that enshrine the right to walk, ski, cycle, camp, swim, sail, fish, pick berries and so on. There is a clear and shared public, or civic, responsibility to many aspects of life, articulated in extremely simple agreements about who is responsible for clearing snow from the streets in winter, say.

These key components of the Nordic Model, then, indicate a strong state and an effective government, with significant levels of public ownership and decision-making as compared with other western models. Yet levels of public debt are relatively low, indicating an effective and efficient public sector. Note, however, that this comparative public sector effectiveness is balanced by strong performance from the private sector. “Household name” brands originating from the Nordic region comprise success stories such as Saab, Volvo, Ericsson, Nokia, Kone, Bang + Olufsen, Iitalla, Marimekko, Fiskars, H+M, Fritz Hansen, Ikea, Lego, Electrolux, Tandberg, Linux, Opera, Spotify, Rovio …

Generally, then, the Nordic Model produces extraordinary results, balancing commercial innovation with public-sector effectiveness, a welfare state with low public debt, modernity with equality.

As this simple diagram suggests, the “spirit level” society (after Wilkinson and Pickett’s influential 2009 book) produces a high and even standard across the population. This abstract form might describe educational standards, income equality, architectural quality, gender equality and so on, suggesting average-to-good results for all.

![[00016.jpeg]]

It also suggests that this egalitarian flatness is achieved at the expense of ranges of experience and possibility. The band is high, but narrow, and doesn’t vary much.

For instance, it is a lazy critique but the Finnish education system topping the world rankings has been put down to its relative homogeneity. Put at its bluntest, the critique suggests that it’s easy to make the same system work for everyone when everyone is the same.

As noted above, the urban realm is of consistently good quality but also can be generally said to be lacking inspiration. Food and drink culture can be equally bland and uninspiring, despite some significant improvements in recent years. Accusations can be, and are, levelled in terms of the “conformity” of the culture. Similarly, there is the perception of an overly technocratic or engineering culture reaching outside of its traditional areas of concern. Perhaps the same mentality that keeps Helsinki-Vantaa airport open and operational 24/7, year after year, even when under metres of snow at -25C, is not necessarily the same mentality one wants running street food licensing or urban planning?

Yet does it really matter if there is a limited range of experience, when the average is so good? The instincts behind the Finnish education system are right, of course. If one was responsible for a nation’s education system, surely the ethical thing to do is to ensure as high a standard as possible for everyone equally.

This is true, but the limited range of experience produces several issues.

One is perhaps less important, at least at face value. It concerns the changing expectations of quality of life in Finland as a globally connected country. With a strategy oriented towards service industries and knowledge economies, and situated within increasingly densely connected global flows of people, trade and culture, Finland will require a broader range of experience than it currently has in order to draw workers in those sectors. This need not be couched in terms of some kind of Richard Florida-friendly footloose global elite, moving from city to city as they dip or soar up and down the Monocle quality of life rankings, but more in terms of anyone who can make a choice about their work can also now choose, to some extent, where to live. In competition with the likes of Copenhagen, Stockholm, Berlin, Warsaw, St Petersburg and others, Helsinki in particular has to offer a more diverse set of private and public services, experiences and spaces than it does currently.

This is delicate territory: some would say that conformity and homogeneity are simply the other side of the coin marked social cohesion and community. Indeed, the platform enabled by the Nordic idea of the collective good can currently be said to be delivering better outcomes than the notion of individuals motivated by self-interest, despite the hegemony of the last few decades.

DIVERSITY FOR RESILIENCE

So quality and diversity of experience and amenity is certainly important. But the other qualifier on the “spirit level” is more important, and it is to do with the way that Finland is changing. The country, for so long a relatively homogenous culture, is becoming more diverse:

> “Finland’s foreign-born citizens make up just 5% of its population, compared to about 11.5% in the UK. But, over the last 15 years, Finland has diversified at a faster rate than any other European country. By 2020, a fifth of Helsinki’s pupils are expected to have been born elsewhere.” (The Guardian, 21 November 2011)

There ought to be little doubt that such an increase in diversity is a good thing — economically and culturally — and yet it does serve to make education, healthcare and patterns of habitation, for example, more complex, partly because of a more diverse set of needs and drivers to take into account in such systems, and partly due to the resistance that immigration often stirs up.

Either way, the ability to make long-term investments on the basis of anticipating these changes is being directly challenged as a result. It is simply harder to build consensus around investments when the population is more diverse. And given the nature of the problems at hand, long-term investments are what is required.

Increasing diversity is important because it can produce resilience. If we see the Finnish incarnation of the Nordic Model as a steady state system for some years, as per the diagram above, it also seems clear that a more diverse version of this system could produce “wobbles” in this straightened experience. Our thought is to ensure that these challenges are absorbed by a system that becomes more resilient as a result.

The ecologist CS Holling wrote that “placing a system in a straitjacket of constancy can cause fragility to evolve”. Conversely, one of the more influential systems thinkers and educators, Donella H Meadows, described resilience as “a measure of a system’s ability to survive and persist within a variable environment”.

We are interested in finding a way for an augmented Nordic Model to not only survive and persist, but also to thrive, in the increasingly variable environment it now finds itself in.

We can look at an equivalent system that almost over-produces diversity. Let’s call it the Anglo model, drawn as it is from a broad brush depiction of the UK, USA and Australia. These English-speaking countries tend to produce a wide diversity of outcomes, across almost all the systems described above. This is essentially due to a market-driven approach, deep in the culture of all three countries.

So the diagram for the Anglo Model looks like this, with a series of spikes of innovation, but also “troughs” of drop-out. In education, this means you get the odd Harvard and MIT, but much of the education system is of a much lower standard than in the Nordic Model. Income levels are similarly variable, with income inequality in the UK and the US particularly extreme compared with other OECD nations. Sharp, tall spikes for CEOs and bankers; massive drop-outs below.

![[../_resources/books//Dark Matter and Trojan Horses_ A Strategic - Dan Hill/00017.gif]]

With these system abstraction diagrams, the overall median is lower than in the Nordic Model, but the variation is considerable. It is, perhaps, an exercise in unfettered “diversity” not tending towards resilience. As the OECD notes, the income inequality leads to decreased social mobility in the US and the UK, rather than a fluid system.

The deteriorating social contract mentioned earlier means little holds this system together. Innovation is produced as a result, though the innovation is often without direction, and the overall system now tends to fragmentation and conflict.

Thus the challenge is to draw these useful “spikes” of innovation into the Nordic Model while retaining the high baseline of the system, such that it can explore diversity “above” that line. So can Finland draw from the benefits of diversity without forgoing the high baseline that the Nordic Model has delivered?

![[../_resources/books//Dark Matter and Trojan Horses_ A Strategic - Dan Hill/00018.gif]]

The HDL Studio on Education explored this tension in particular. They found that education in Finland was intrinsically linked to the understanding of fairness embedded within Finnish culture, which had created a system predicated on equal access to education. The Studio suggested that this notion of equal access might need to develop into an “equal opportunity to develop individual talents and aspirations”. Over and above Sir Ken Robinson et al’s suggestions around divergent thinking, this is also concerned with “how well [the system] handles diversity” to be successful.

WHY SYSTEMS MUST LEARN BY ABSORBING DIVERSITY

As we have seen, global unrest can be read as a sign of the essential fabric of nation states beginning to unravel, with the traditional sets of ties — nationality, ethnicity, religion, corporation, family — all in often radically different modes to that of two generations ago. Many would, rightly, see this increasing social and cultural diversity as A Good Thing. However, it presents a challenge to systems, such as governance and public service, built in another age. It places the static system in tension; a suddenly rigid system becomes brittle.

For warning lights on the dashboard, we might look to the 2011 elections in Finland. There, the True Finns party capitalised on these emerging fissures in national identity. Described by the BBC as anti-immigration and xenophobic (a charge that has been vehemently denied by the party) and by the Financial Times as “Europe’s Tea Party”, the True Finns took 19.1% of the vote, ultimately becoming the largest opposition party in parliament. Whether one buys that portrayal or not, there can be no doubt that the True Finns are productively making hay from immigration issues, and from Finland’s involvement in the EU and eurozone debt crisis.

For more extreme indicators again, we look to Athens, Wall Street, Madrid, London, each indicating a loss of faith in governance at the scale of nation state, each linked to an inability to make decisions at the institutional level.

But most extreme of all, and in the Nordic context, the mass murder committed by Anders Breivik against the government, the civilian population and a summer camp in Norway on 22 July 2011 was rather more than a warning sign. Although clearly the work of a psychopath, who would perhaps have carried out a similarly appalling act no matter the wider political climate, several at the time connected Breivik’s atrocity to a wider culture that has dangerously “allowed” such extreme voices to flourish. Recall the October report from Demos, concerning the spread of “hardline nationalist sentiment” among young men in Europe, and how their “generalised fear about the future is focused on cultural identity”.

The historian Tony Judt, in his memoir The Memory Chalet (2010) sees a extremely negative scenario emerging:

> “We are entering, I suspect, upon a time of troubles. It is not just the terrorists, the bankers, and the climate that are going to wreak havoc with our sense of security and stability. Globalization itself ... will be a source of fear and uncertainty to billions of people who will turn to their leaders for protection. ‘Identities’ will grow mean and tight, as the indigent and the uprooted beat upon the ever-rising walls of gated communities from Delhi to Dallas ... Being ‘Danish’ or ‘Italian’, ‘American’ or ‘European’ won’t just be an identity; it will be a rebuff and a reproof to those whom it excludes. The state, far from disappearing, may be about to come into its own: the privileges of citizenship, the protections of card-holding residency rights, will be wielded as political trumps. Intolerant demagogues in established democracies will demand ‘tests’ — of knowledge, of language, of attitude — to determine whether desperate newcomers are deserving of British or Dutch or French ‘identity’. They are already doing so. In this brave new century we shall miss the tolerant, the marginals: the edge people.” (Tony Judt, The Memory Chalet, 2010)

We must anticipate increasing diversity — and its potential corollary in the mean withdrawal that Judt writes about — and orient its power constructively for nations such as Finland, in order to help avoid such catastrophes in the worst case, and to ensure that the success of the country continues, if not advances, in the best case.

Again, creating a culture of decision-making that could help achieve such a result would provide a model for the 21st century, much as some have seen the Nordic nations as providing a successful model for the late-20th century nation state.

CASE #4: FROM THE PÄIVÄKOTI TO THE CAMIONETTE — PROTOTYPING A DIVERSE FOOD ECOSYSTEM

What might addressing this system mean in practice? Though it might seem initially odd, our more recent explorations have been through food systems. Food can be a useful proxy through which to assess the extent and diversity of numerous interlocking systems, but also to understand the dynamics of these systems.

Looking at the diversity of street food available within a city, for instance, might help unlock systemic elements around use of public space, the street as a platform for innovation, entrepreneurship and experimentation in dining, different perspectives on food preparation and hygiene, strategies for handling waste, ways of intervening in a culture of late-night drinking, preventative health, safety, logistics, local and seasonal produce, a richer understanding of the value of immigration, a form of demand-led provision of street food driven by “smart city” mobile services, and so on.

In this particular case study, we are interested in how food might exemplify aspects of the system discussion above, and the role that strategic design might play in driving food systems forward in that light; absorbing diversity to expand experience, develop resilience and retain a high baseline.

Street food, in this case, is the MacGuffin; it is driving the discussions and projects that we are using to explore the idea of an augmented Nordic Model.

Street food in Helsinki has recently been given a shock of diversity into its system. Dominated by the model of kiosks at street-corners, the city essentially offers very basic fare: metal boxes called grilli that serve fatty sausages to late-night drinkers; traditional kiosks selling coffee and pastries to tourists; and ice-cream stands. The City of Helsinki tightly administers leases for these, and controls quality through comparatively high food-hygiene standards (higher than EU regulations) and only a handful of public spaces are deemed appropriate for street food. It’s a classic example of the narrow, moderately performing yet equitable system.

Yet early in 2011, something new appeared on this scene, in the form of a retrofitted old Citröen van selling crépes 24/7 at Kamppi, the central public space and shopping centre in Helsinki. Started by a young entrepreneur, the Camionette had driven extremely slowly through two years of negotiation with the city council, securing numerous permits across at least four departments. The city had said no at first, before the entrepreneur used Facebook and a local newspaper to drum up interest in his cause. The city quickly had to back down. This part of Helsinki now has an alternative to the metal grilli a few metres away, extending the range of possibility in the centre while challenging the city’s perception of what street food can be.

This particular “spike of innovation” occurred at roughly the same time as an event called Ravinotolapäiva, or Restaurant Day. This near-guerilla activity involves people setting up any kind of “pop-up restaurant” on one day, anywhere in the city. From the Ravinotolapäiva website:

> “Restaurant Day is a day when anyone and everyone is encouraged to open a pop-up restaurant, café or bar. Just for the day ... No permission, no rules, just plain fun ... every city needs more no-strings fun.”

As the project cheekily hints, this “no-strings fun” is not strictly legal, but there’s little the city council can do about it. Ravintolapäiva is an incredibly light-touch organisation — Facebook, essentially — and there are no requirements; it’s essentially an idea. As a result, it has spread like wildfire. An organisation with no organisation has no chance of developing inertia, after all.

According to the Helsinki’s Food Culture Strategy project manager, Ville Relander, both of these “spikes” have enriched the city’s food culture no end. Yet Ravintolapäiva is limited in time (it exists for one day only) and the Camionette is limited in space (it exists in one place only). So the change is not systemic yet.

So what happens the day after Restaurant Day? Nothing.

At the other end of the system, sits the city’s small, distributed kindergartens and day-care centres (päiväkoti). These are generally administered by the city in most cases, who also provide subsidies if they are private. Hot school meals are served in all päiväkoti every day. As a result, the city council runs the biggest kitchen in the city, albeit in distributed form, serving 100,000s of meals each day.

The päiväkoti is the kind of governmental “lever” that exemplifies the Nordic Model. For example, it enables the City’s Food Culture Strategy to say that half of all the meals served in the päiväkoti will be organic by 2015. This simply could not happen as clearly, as cleanly, as in the Anglo Model described above. There is no lever there. Switching the food served in Australian kindergartens, say, would be difficult, as there is essentially no food served in Australian kindergartens. Parents make packed lunches for their children; how would this system become organic by 2015, say? The state writes to parents and asks them to kindly make sandwiches with organic ingredients?

They’d probably get sued.

Of course, the wealthier parents might well use organic ingredients in their children’s lunchboxes, but the pattern of distribution might well emulate the Anglo system diagram again — organic food for a few; unknown or poor quality food for many.

So the päiväkoti is a powerful system providing a solid mainstream experience for everyone. Yet the system has now been joined by a couple of different isolated examples of diversity, the Camionette and Ravintolapäivä.

What has not happened yet in Finland, however, is linking both sides of this diagram, finding a way to connect the diversity and innovation at the entrepreneurial end with the capacity for systemic change at the governmental end (in this immediate case, to connect the fast-moving layers of street food with the necessarily slower-moving layers of kindergartens and licensing).

In short, one possibility of the augmented Nordic Model is to enable innovation from the entrepreneur to be absorbed into the system; to bind the range of possibilities inherent in small-scale innovation to the sheer transformative power of Nordic government — without destabilising the potency and valency of either.

Within Low2No, Sitra is exploring the idea of creating such spikes in local street food culture. The challenge is to select the right MacGuffin, the right Trojan Horse, the right platform to understand, articulate and exert the connection between street food and more mainstream networks, such as school food and supermarket food retail. This could involve designing, prototyping and operating new street food offers themselves, while embedded in the dark matter of food-safety regulations, urban planning, public-works procedures, and the way that city governance operates.

We have to hover above the problem at this level of governance to engage with the city council’s regulations, organisation and positioning regarding street food. In early conversations with the city, it is clear to see how the Camionette situation emerged, and yet it is also possible to perceive some potential rewirings that might derive greater strategic benefit for food and the city, and beyond. But understanding the cultures of decision-making takes time and sensitivity. It also takes something different to separate the figure from the ground, to jolt the system’s culture to describe itself.

We also have to locate ourselves at street level, in a particular project involving physical matter. This ensures that dark matter is flushed out, articulated, tested. Although design is more commonly thought of at this smaller scale, and certainly easier to produce, strategic design involves ensuring the intervention is not an installation, but enables replicability and legibility, and so lasting system change.

Systems at this scale sometimes appear beyond perception. By analogy with the modern-day city, if we can even sense the evidence of such a system, it feels “splendid and terrifying”, as the urbanist Kevin Lynch put it. Yet he also promises that constructing insights into such systems, creating legibility through intervention, is a way of at least shifting our perception from shock and awe to something we might master, or at least comprehend more optimistically.

> “Were it legible, truly visible, then fear and confusion might be replaced with delight in the richness and power of the scene.” (Kevin Lynch, 1960)

But tying prototypes to the idea of an augmented Nordic Model is still daunting. A portfolio of prototypes ensures that risk is spread across the different layers, moving at different paces, in constantly learning system. Moreover, each prototype locks into a wider context — say, a street-food prototype draws from a smart-systems platform, which in turn draws from a local currency system underpinning a carbon-financing model, which sits within the context of a local participation and decision-making platform for the community. The overall architecture of the problem is fleshed out. The design focus zooms from matter to meta and back again constantly. A diversity of projects is created, and so the overall system learns to thrive from diversity.

The project context must zoom from Low2No and the local business ecosystems to the city council’s Food Culture Strategy and the wider context of city council organisation. And so it seeks to connect the Camionette and the päiväkoti; or rather it begins to describe both in the same connected system.

This is not about replacing hot dogs with falafels, but about building resilience into a system through diversity. It might suggest how education, healthcare and social services could also be enriched without losing their scale and capacity. It might enable the new approaches to sustainability described here to be extended elsewhere. It might even suggest how local firms develop ongoing resilience. It ought to suggest how governance, policy-making and public service can be reimagined for the 21st century without throwing the baby out with the bathwater.

If the Nordic Model can be augmented with spikes of innovation, without dropping its baseline, and make legible the seams of this next Nordic Model, it might not only be looked at with admiration (or disdain) from afar, but provide a guide for other cultures of decision-making elsewhere. It might prove to be a model worth following.

It might even help in solving the conundrum facing all Nordic countries, virtually all European nations, and many other developed nations elsewhere: how to continue to pay for the welfare state?

Over the last decade, many public administrations have looked to efficiency gains and reform through ICT. However, speaking at Cisco’s Public Services Summit in Oslo, December 2011, Manuel Castells described how most ICT-led interventions into healthcare or e-government had not produced the gains promised, because such programmes had not embarked on genuine reform (generally looking instead to enable efficiency gains, they had instead reduced quality of service, irresponsibly undermining the entire enterprise). He didn’t use these words, but such programmes had not considered the “dark matter” (he referred instead to Michel Foucault’s notion of “micro-powers”).

A combination play of ICT culture, service design and strategic design, moving back and forth from matter to meta, and earning a mandate for reform and redesign, would perhaps be more fruitful.

The idea of taking on the Nordic Model, or indeed attempting to engender systemic change within Finland is open to accusations of hubris, even arrogance, never mind doubts as to the efficacy of such a venture. And yet systemic change is what policy is often trying to enable after all, at the national level as well as the local.

This is not the redesign of a nation state as such, although it’s worth reflecting that nation states are a creation, an artefact. The nation has always been a design project, articulated through boundaries, maps, flags and insignia. Instead, this is understanding the cultures of decision-making at play in Finland, and assessing how to constructively move them forwards.

And so the larger project has a direction. This is a strategic design challenge.

   

What is The Difference?

STRATEGIC DESIGN IN SUMMARY

As opposed to engineering, with its focus on problem solving, strategic design is oriented towards questioning the question, reframing if necessary.

As opposed to policy-making expertise, with its focus on the creation of models, strategic design is predisposed to sketching and iterative prototyping as a learning mechanism, while engaging in stewardship to ensure that user-centredness and design intent is realised in delivery.

As opposed to particular content expertise, focused within a bounded discipline, strategic design’s discipline is in integrative systems thinking rather than a form of path dependency, and is able to move freely across disciplines rather than within them, revelling in the complexity of a more holistic understanding of the system.

As opposed to management consultancy, strategic design’s embedded positioning enables the long-term view, a richer production process, and provides the authority to enact organisational or contextual change, while also using its production skills to create tangible prototypes and outcomes as a strategic act, generating learning and momentum through doing.

As opposed to creating the intervention or one-off, strategic design’s interests are in the replicable and systemic, and thus require engaging with the dark matter of organisations, policy, culture and other forms of context.

As opposed to traditional design practice, strategic design attempts to move beyond products, services and spaces into relationships, contexts, and strategies, yet without losing sight of the symbiotic relationship between meta and matter, and genuinely engaging with the public and civic as much as with the commercial.

As we have seen, in terms of design practice, strategic design at systemic scale is about this zoom from matter to meta, or rather, the importance of designing both the matter (the objects, spaces, services) at the same time as the meta (the context, the organisation, the culture). Strategy is enacted through a focus on the quality of execution, rather than an abstract model.

Replicability of solutions, derived from delivering projects, enables systemic changes that are allied to the public good.

Strategic design tries to ally pragmatism with imagination, deliver research through prototyping, enable learning from execution, pursue communication through tangible projects, and balance strategic intent and political capital with iterative action, systems thinking and user-centredness.

This is all underscored by an optimistic belief in progressive change, that the current conditions are changeable for the better, that the present can be transformed into multiple positive futures. Path dependency can be a useful force, such that strategies can be built on culture, history and the other inherent qualities of a context, yet it does not weigh solutions down unnecessarily.

Finally, strategic design is embedded within organisations, and particularly within public bodies that are reoriented towards leadership and directed innovation once again. This also means that innovative capacity has a direction, an end as well as a means.

AND TO WHAT END?

Government and public service is too important for it to fail through lack of care; through the simple inability of yesterday’s funding model or accumulated political capital to simply continue into the future. While this is a challenge on an immense scale — an unknown-unknown in terms of problems — it does not mean that we should not take it on.

The Nordic Model in particular also cannot be allowed to wither, given the shining example it has set for so many and the extraordinary results it has produced. A population that is ageing and diversifying should not, in itself, be enough of a “problem” that it simply causes the entire house of cards to collapse. Either facet could be reconceived as an asset.

Today, these relations between the state, the market and civil society are the design challenge. In particular, in the light of events over the last two decades, the social contract needs to be reformulated.

Those last two decades have seen western nations undergoing economic boom and bust, the only constant the diminishing status of government (sometimes in inverse relationship to its public debt). Emerging economies have seen boom and boom, economically, with only the occasional dab on the brakes, yet serious challenges have arisen for governments nonetheless, such as the awkward relationship with democracy sometimes seen in East Asia and the Middle East. In either case, as we have seen, the scale and complexity of the challenges now faced by governments are without precedent.

Judging by the now-persistent turmoil — in markets, in parliament, on the street — the contract that defines how most developed nations and economies should work has long since expired, and people know it. Indeed, it seems that yesterday’s set of social contracts is visibly crumbling.

The significant stress fractures of social unrest that have emerged on the streets of Athens, Cairo, London, Madrid, Toronto and New York are partly indications of poor social-contract design. It is not often talked about in that respect; indeed, it’s all too possible to find people in positions of influence who don’t even know what the social contract means.

We need to understand more about the various cultures of decision-making in play across the globe. We also need to believe that they can be improved through the strategic application of design.

This may be important for design itself, in that it provides a genuinely meaningful point to the entire enterprise.

But, more importantly, we need to believe that reorienting our various cultures of decision-making may be the only civilised way forward.

A Note About Our Typography

The typeface on the front cover is called Lazurski, and it was designed at the Soviet type design bureau, Polygraphmash, by Vladimir Yefimov in 1984. It’s a homage to a 1960s font designed by Vadim Lazurski that was inspired by Italian typefaces of the early 16th century.

## Before and After

Weizman, Eyal

9785906264190

61 pages

A nuclear facility in Iran before and after an explosion, a village in Pakistan before and after a drone attack, a Cambodian river valley before and after a flood. The before-and-after image has become the tool of choice for analysing events. Satellite photography allows us to scrutinise the impact of war or climate change, from the safe distance of orbit. But one thing is rarely captured: the event itself. All we can read is its effect on a space, and that's where the architectural expert is required, to fill the gap with a narrative. In this groundbreaking essay, Eyal and Ines Weizman explore the history of the before-and-after image, from its origins in 19th-century Paris to today's satellite surveillance. State militaries monitor us and humanitarian organisations monitor them. But who can see in higher resolution? Who controls the size of the pixels? Interpreting these _resources/books//Dark Matter and Trojan Horses_ A Strategic - Dan Hill is never straightforward.

## The dot-com city. Silicon valley urbanism

Lange, Alexandra

41 pages

On their bland campuses, the likes of Apple, Google and Facebook dominate the world, removed from the mess and the prying eyes of the real city. But while their products are discussed endlessly, their urbanism has rarely been. So what does it look like? To date, the Silicon Valley campus has served as a backdrop to many a sun-kissed founder photoshoot, but there is little understanding of the distinctive urban personality that separates the village of Facebook from the town of Google, or the truly urban Twitter (which recently decided to move to San Francisco's notoriously un-gentrifiable Tenderloin). This investigation of the private towns of Silicon Valley examines the tech campus as a typology and attempts to discover what urban design says about companies we think we know.

## Make it real. Architecture as enactment

Jacob, Sam

9785990336483

38 pages

With each successive style or movement, redundant forms and technologies are replaced and then re-enacted in the name of progress. Ideologies and fictions become forms. And then there is the stranger world still of actual replicas, such as Henry Ford's Greenfield Village, where history is brought to life for didactic purposes. It can't help it, architecture's deepest instinct is to repeat, whether its columns, ceiling tiles or twin towers. Ours is a landscape of cover versions, copy and paste, rinse and repeat. In this polemical but also quizzical essay, Sam Jacob probes the architectural condition and wonders whether it's all just an attempt to make what's not real look real.

## Less is Enough

Aureli, Pier Vittorio

9785906264138

60 pages

"Less is more" goes the modernist dictum. But is it? In an age when we are endlessly urged to do "more with less", can we still romanticise the pretensions of minimalism? For Pier Vittorio Aureli, the return of "austerity chic" is a perversion of what ought to be a meaningful way of life. Charting the rise of asceticism in early Christianity and its institutionalisation with the medieval monasteries, Aureli examines how the basic unit of the reclusive life - the monk's cell - becomes the foundation of private property. And from there, he argues, it all starts to go wrong. By late capitalism, asceticism has been utterly aestheticised. It manifests itself as monasteries inspired by Calvin Klein stores, in the monkish lifestyle of Steve Jobs and Apple's aura of restraint. Amid all the hypocrisy, it must still be possible to reprise the idea of "less" as a radical alternative, as the first step to living the life examined.

## Across the plaza. The public voids of the post-soviet city

Hatherley, Owen

9785990336445

100 pages

The vast, proverbially windswept plazas built under "really existing socialism" from the 1920s to the 1980s are widely considered to be useless spaces, designed to intimidate or at least impress. Yet if they are only of use to those in power, why is it they have been used so successfully in protest? From Petrograd in 1917 to Independence Square in Kiev during the Orange Revolution, these spaces have become focuses for mass protest. Beginning in Berlin's Alexanderplatz, and taking in Warsaw, Ljubljana, Kharkov and Moscow, Owen Hatherley heads in search of revolt, architectural glory and horror. Along the way he encounters the more civic squares that replaced their authoritarian predecessors and finds that, paradoxically, the old centres of power are more conducive to dissent than these new, ostensibly democratic plazas.
