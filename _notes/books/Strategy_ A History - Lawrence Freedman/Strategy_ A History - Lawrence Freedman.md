_Everyone has a plan ’till they get punched in the mouth._

—Mike Tyson

Everyone needs a strategy. Leaders of armies, major corporations, and

political parties have long been expected to have strategies, but now no

serious organization could imagine being without one. Despite the problems

of fi nding ways through the uncertainty and confusion of human affairs, a

strategic approach is still considered to be preferable to one that is merely tactical, let alone random. Having a strategy suggests an ability to look up

from the short term and the trivial to view the long term and the essential, to address causes rather than symptoms, to see woods rather than trees. Without

a strategy, facing up to any problem or striving for any objective would be

considered negligent. Certainly no military campaign, company investment,

or government initiative is likely to receiving backing unless there is a strategy to evaluate. If a decision can be described as strategically signifi cant, then it is obviously more important than decisions of a more routine nature. By

extension, people making such decisions are more important than those who

only offer advice or are tasked with implementation.

Strategies are now offered not only for the life-or-death, make-or-break

decisions of great states and large corporations but also for more mundane

matters. There is a call for a strategy every time the path to a given destination is not straightforward or whenever judgments are required on resources

needed, their effective application, and their appropriate sequence. In business, chief executives may take responsibility for overall strategy, but there are separate strategies for procurement, marketing, human resources, and

so on. Doctors have clinical strategies, lawyers have prosecution strategies, and social workers have counseling strategies. Individuals have their own

strategies—for developing a career, coping with bereavement, fi lling in tax

returns, or even potty-training an infant or buying a car. In fact, there is

now no human activity so lowly, banal, or intimate that it can reasonably be

deprived of a strategy.

For those who want more effective strategies, there are plenty of books

offering advice. The multiplicity of audiences shows in the variations of style.

Some books rely on a jokey presentation, others on large print or inspira-

tional stories from the successful and victorious. There are learned tomes

with graphs and charts detailing many complicated factors to be taken into

account. Somewhere between are checklists of activities that, if followed carefully, will at least increase the chances of achieving the right result. There are extended pep talks, encouraging bold thinking and decisive moves and

a commitment to victory. These may be no more than collections of clichés,

not always consistent, with hints on how to struggle with opponents and

bring along prospective allies. Elsewhere there are more philosophical refl ections on the paradoxes of confl ict and the pitfalls of losing fl exibility in the single-minded pursuit of a distant goal. There are even tips on how to be a

fantasy strategist while staring at a screen, refi ghting ancient wars or dominating aliens in imagined universes with complicated rules and extraordinary

weapons.

Can the same word apply to battle plans, political campaigning, and

business deals—not to mention means of coping with the stresses of every-

day life—without becoming meaningless? Columnist Matthew Parris

has lamented the ubiquity of the word _strategy_ and the ease with which it becomes attached to any desirable end. He commented on demands for a

“growth strategy” in the face of a stagnant and indebted economy but won-

dered who would claim a “rain strategy” as an answer to drought. “Every

sinner needs a virtue strategy. Every starveling needs a food strategy.” “There exist few modern circumstances,” he observed, “where the removal of the

word ‘strategy’ from any passage containing it fails to clarify matters, usu-

ally demonstrating the argument’s circularity.” [^1] Yet _strategy_ remains the best word we have for expressing attempts to think about actions in advance, in

the light of our goals and our capacities. It captures a process for which there are no obvious alternative words, although the meaning has become diluted

through promiscuous and often inappropriate use. In this respect _strategy_ is x

p r e f a c e

not much different from other related words, such as _power_ and _politics_ . While their exact meanings are explored, rarely to a conclusion, in scholarly texts, their adoption in everyday speech tends to be imprecise, loose, and lazy.

There is no agreed-upon defi nition of _strategy_ that describes the fi eld and limits its boundaries. One common contemporary defi nition describes it as

being about maintaining a balance between ends, ways, and means; about

identifying objectives; and about the resources and methods available for

meeting such objectives. 2 This balance requires not only fi]] nding out how to achieve desired ends but also adjusting ends so that realistic ways can be found to meet them by available means. This process can describe the simplest tasks, but when the ends are easily reached, when inanimate objects

rather than other people are involved, and when very little is at stake, this barely counts as strategy. By and large, strategy comes into play where there is actual or potential confl ict, when interests collide and forms of resolution are required. This is why a strategy is much more than a plan. A plan supposes a sequence of events that allows one to move with confi dence from

one state of affairs to another. Strategy is required when others might frus-

trate one’s plans because they have different and possibly opposing interests and concerns. The confl icts can be quite mild, for example, between those

within the same organization notionally pursuing the same goals but with

distinctive responsibilities. As the quote from boxer Mike Tyson illustrates, a well-aimed blow can thwart the cleverest plan. The inherent unpredictability of human affairs, due to chance events as well as the efforts of opponents and the missteps of friends, provides strategy with its challenge and drama.

Strategy is often expected to start with a description of a desired end state, but in practice there is rarely an orderly movement to goals set in advance.

Instead, the process evolves through a series of states, each one not quite what was anticipated or hoped for, requiring a reappraisal and modifi cation of the original strategy, including ultimate objectives. The picture of strategy that should emerge from this book is one that is fl uid and fl exible, governed by the starting point and not the end point.

Strategy is also frequently presented as a duel, a clash of two opposing

wills. This refl ects the term’s military origins and regular comparisons to a wrestling match. It can also be the result of the simple modeling of confl icts encouraged by game theory with the standard two-by-two matrix. Few situations involving strategy are so simple. A boxer in a ring with Mike Tyson

might have few options, but his prospects would improve greatly if it was

possible to break the rules and bring in a fellow fi ghter from outside the ring.

As we shall see, combining with others often constitutes the most astute strategic move; for the same reason, preventing opponents from doing the same

p r e f a c e

xi

can be as valuable. A duel is also a bad metaphor because it suggests a fi ght to the fi nish with only one winner. Yet confl icts can be resolved through building on shared interests or forging a winning coalition with the next available partner. As both types of moves can require complex negotiations, it may be

a challenge to convince natural supporters that the necessary concessions have been worthwhile or prudent. So the realm of strategy is one of bargaining and persuasion as well as threats and pressure, psychological as well as physical effects, and words as well as deeds. This is why strategy is the central political art. It is about getting more out of a situation than the starting balance of power would suggest. It is the art of creating power.

For those who start as powerful, strategy should not be too diffi cult. The

sensible application of superior resources tends to be successful. A famous

biblical passage observes “that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle

to the strong.” [^3] The American writer Damon Runyon added, “But that’s the way to bet.” Fighting against superior force may score high on nobility

and heroism but normally low on discretion and effectiveness. This is why

underdog strategies, in situations where the starting balance of power would

predict defeat, provide the real tests of creativity. Such strategies often look to the possibility of success through the application of a superior intelligence, which takes advantage of the boring, ponderous, muscle-bound approach

adopted by those who take their superior resources for granted. The exem-

plars of such an approach are Odysseus but not Achilles, Sun Tzu and Liddell

Hart but not Clausewitz and Jomini. They would seek victory at a reasonable

cost by means of deceits, ruses, feints, maneuvers, speed, and a quicker wit.

There is an undoubted satisfaction by winning through wit rather than brute

force. The problems come when opponents turn out to be not only better

resourced but also as alert, brave, and clever.

_Strategy_ ’s etymology goes back to classical Greek. Through the Middle Ages and into the modern era, however, the relevant reference tended to be

to the “art of war.” The sort of issues that later came fi rmly under the heading of strategy—the value of alliances, the role of battle, the respective merits of force and guile—were fi rmly in view. The word _strategy_ only began to be used in Britain, France, and Germany in the late eighteenth century, refl ecting an Enlightenment optimism that war—like all other spheres of human affairs—

could benefi t from the application of reason. It also refl ected the demands of contemporary warfare, with mass armies and long logistics chains. The

employment of force now required careful preparation and theoretical guid-

ance. Before, ends and means might be combined in the mind of the warrior

leader, who would be responsible for both the formulation and execution

of a strategy. Increasingly, these functions were separated. Governments

xii

p r e f a c e

set objectives they expected the generals to achieve. The generals acquired specialist staffs to devise campaign plans that others would implement.

Given the ease with which military metaphors are taken up in other

spheres of activity, including the language of command, it is not surprising

that political and business leaders adopted the idea of strategy. References

to business strategy were rare before 1960. They started to take off during

the 1970s and by 2000 became more frequent than references to military

strategy. [^4] It is through the literature on management and business that the use of the word has spread. As organizations’ plans and policies, at least their most important and far-reaching ones, came to be described as “strategic,”

it was not too large a jump for individuals to use the term when considering

how best to make professional choices. The social and philosophical move-

ments of the 1960s encouraged the “personal” to become more “political,”

potentially introducing strategy into more basic relationships.

Corporations acquired planning staffs which set targets for others to fol-

low. Politicians hired consultants who advised on how to win elections. And

then those with experience in these tasks wrote and lectured on the prin-

ciples of strategy, offering prescriptions that might bring success in poten-

tially diverse settings. The rise of strategy has therefore gone hand in hand with bureaucratization of organizations, professionalization of functions, and growth of the social sciences. It refl ected the hope that the specialist study of economics, sociology, politics, and psychology would make possible a more

comprehensible and therefore more predictable world, so that all moves could

be better informed and judged, tailored more effectively to the circumstances of the moment.

One response to the advance of the strategists was to challenge their pre-

sumptions of control and the centralized power structures they encouraged.

Strategy has been presented as a conceit and an illusion, a pretense that the affairs of the multitudes can be manipulated from above by an elite. Instead

of the deliberate decisions of a few, critics pointed to the countless moves of innumerable individuals, unable to see the big picture yet coping as well as

they can in the circumstances, leading to outcomes that nobody had intended

or even desired. This critique has encouraged demands for decentralized

decision-making and empowered individuals. In turn, this encouraged strat-

egy as a more personal response to the vicissitudes of everyday life.

This book describes the development of these different approaches, from

rigorous centralized planning processes at one extreme to the sum of numer-

ous individual decisions at the other. It shows how in these distinct mili-

tary, political, and business spheres, there has been a degree of convergence around the idea that the best strategic practice may now consist in forming

p r e f a c e

xiii

compelling accounts of how to turn a developing situation into a desirable outcome. The practice of thinking of strategy as a special sort of narrative

came into vogue as the 1960s turned into the 1970s, and disillusion set in

with the idea that large enterprises and even wars could be controlled by

means of a central plan. Developments in cognitive psychology and contem-

porary philosophy came together to stress the importance of the constructs

through which events are interpreted.

As a history, this book aims to provide an account of the development

of the most prominent themes in strategic theory—as they affect war, poli-

tics, and business—without losing sight of the critics and dissidents. Readers might be surprised by some of the characters that appear, and by chapters

that barely seem to mention strategy at all. This is because of the importance of the theories that set the terms for strategy. These establish the problems the strategists must address and the circumstances in which they operate, as

well as their forms of political and social action. The result is that this book is not so much about planning for confl ict or the application of practical

intelligence to forms of uncertainty but rather about relationships between

theory and practice, and indeed theories as a form of practice. Strategy pro-

vides a way into a whole range of discourses: abstract formulations of what

it means to act rationally and postmodern musings on domination and resis-

tance; propositions on causation and insights into the working of the human

brain; and practical advice on how best to catch enemies in battle, undermine rivals in elections, and launch a new product into the market. Strategists have addressed the effi ciency of various forms of coercion as well as inducements, human nature under stress, the organization of large groups of people on the

move, negotiating techniques, visions of a good society, and standards of

ethical conduct.

The approach I have adopted here does not follow any particular school

of social science. In fact, I have sought to show how the ascent of certain

schools can be explained by academic strategies. Toward the end I develop

the idea of strategic scripts as a way of thinking about strategy as a story told in the future tense. I believe this follows from the lines of analysis developed during the course of the book, but I hope readers enjoy the history even if

they do not accept the analysis. What fascinates me about strategy is that

it is about choice and because these choices can be important the reasoning

behind them is worthy of careful examination. It is about decisions that mat-

ter to those making them, dealing with personal advancement and group

survival, but also views and values that are deeply held, businesses that affect the livelihoods of many, the opportunity to shape a nation’s future course. To study strategy in this way is potentially subversive of those forms of social xiv

p r e f a c e

science which must control for the random and the disorderly, the anomalous and paradoxical, the exceptional and eccentric as awkward outliers. With

strategy, these cases must be given special attention precisely because the

actors have challenged expectations by either falling short or beating the

odds. This might not make for great deductive theory, but it can allow the

student to appreciate the thrill and drama of some of the most challenging

forms of decision-making without worrying about mathematical proofs.

To keep the topic manageable I have focused largely on Western thinking

about strategy, and for recent times, I have particularly examined American

approaches. Because I wanted to link the main themes in the book with

developments in broader political and social theory, greater geographical

comprehensiveness would have been impossible. I fully understand that

different cultures would yield different insights, but the United States has

been not only the most powerful but also the most intellectually innova-

tive country in recent times. In classical times Athens set the pace; in the

late nineteenth century it was Germany. The advantage of staying within

the bounds of Western culture is that it is possible to draw out the infl u-

ences and the shared themes over time and across apparently different areas of activity. Selectivity has also been essential. I touch on the classic texts—the writers to whom regular reference is made—and those now forgotten (often

deservedly so) who made an impact in their time. I have also sought to put

trends and tendencies in strategic thinking in context. To keep the discus-

sion grounded I have kept in mind Raymond Aron’s observation about how

strategic thought “draws its inspiration from each century, or rather at each moment of history, from the problems which events themselves pose.” [^5] To make sense of the key theorists, and to provide a critical edge, it is important to consider the events to which these thinkers were responding. One does

not, however, need to go as far as George Orwell who, reviewing a book

on strategy, observed that “there is something unsatisfactory in tracing an

historical change to an individual theorist, because a theory does not gain

ground unless material conditions favor it.” 6]] The history of ideas is fascinating in part because ideas developed in one context live on and take on new

meanings in another.

As a theme of this book is the growing importance of stories as a means

of thinking about and communicating strategies, I have tried to show where

the most important strategic stories came from, the intent behind their con-

struction, and how their meanings were changed over time. In keeping with

this narrative theme I have also used a number of examples from literature—

including the Bible, Homer, Milton, and Tolstoy—to illuminate core issues

and the treatment of strategic behavior.

p r e f a c e

The book begins by treating the “prehistory” of strategy, addressing the two major sources of the Western cultural tradition—the Hebrew Bible and

the great texts of the classical Greeks—and authors who have been most

enduring in their infl uence—Thucydides, Sun Tzu, and Machiavelli. The

fi rst main section of the book looks at military strategy. The second section is concerned with political strategy, particularly efforts on behalf of underdogs.

The third section considers the development of strategies for managers of

large organizations, especially businesses. This section is the shortest, but only because it covers half a century of literature rather than two centuries.

The last section considers the contemporary contribution of the social sci-

ences and seeks to draw the main themes together.

Research for this book has taken me into unfamiliar territory. It has

proved to be an opportunity to explore issues dimly remembered from under-

graduate days and many that had previously passed me by. I was taught in

political theory to read the original texts and not just the commentaries, and I have tried to do so, but it would be misleading to suggest that I have not

relied extensively on the interpretations of others. I have drawn—I hope with full attribution—from the insights and ideas of a wide range of specialists.

Part of the enjoyment of writing this book has come from my exposure to

some wonderful scholarship, in social science and fi elds supposedly distant

from my own. Despite the best efforts of colleagues I have undoubtedly over-

reached in a number of areas. Nonetheless, the exercise has reinforced my

conviction that academics worry too much about making a good impression

within their own disciplinary boundaries while not paying enough attention

to what is going on beyond them. While the stance is often critical, I hope it is not disrespectful. These are issues worth arguing about and I look forward to those who feel that I have missed signifi cant points arguing back.

My own expertise and the origins of the subject mean that much of the

book is concerned with war, but I have also sought to do justice to revolu-

tionary, electoral, and business strategies and explore how they have infl u-

enced each other. I have no practical experience of war, although I have met

many warriors. I was very politically active as a student and engaged in many energetic debates about reform, revolution, and violence. In later years, while at King’s College London, I have had a variety of managerial roles for some

three decades (even ending up with “strategy” in my title). In this respect,

I have in my time tried to think strategically as well as think about strategy.

Origins 1: Evolution

_Man is descended from a hairy, tailed quadruped, probably arboreal in_

_its habits._

—Charles Darwin

In this chapter I argue that there are elemental features of human strat-

egy that are common across time and space. These include deception and

coalition formation, and the instrumental use of violence. These features are so elemental that traces of them can be found among chimpanzees. Chimps

are self-aware, understand others well enough to deceive them, and show

gratitude or retribution according to whether they have been given or denied

support. They have forms of communication, think through diffi cult prob-

lems, and plan ahead.

Years of careful observation of chimpanzees, fi rst in the wild and then

in special colonies at zoos, challenged the previous view that their social

bonds were limited. It became apparent that individual chimps in the same

area came together regularly and developed complex relations. They not only

worked together but also had fi ghts. Of particular interest for students of

strategy, chimpanzees were political in their behavior. They built up coali-

tions, offering grooming, sex, and food to potential supporters—all in order

to prevail in confl icts. But they also appreciated the importance of limiting their confl icts so that they could live cooperatively thereafter. They kissed

and made up after a violent quarrel. By showing their vulnerability they invited trust. [^1]

During the 1970s, Frans de Waal observed the chimpanzee colony at

Arnhem Zoo, making copious notes as a remarkable series of dramas began to

unfold. In his 1982 book, _Chimpanzee Politics_ , he drew some startling conclusions about the complexity of chimpanzee society. In his view, the evidence

of coalition formation and power struggles among the chimps deserved the

label “political.” 2

Raw strength could only take chimps so far. When dominant males

asserted power, their hair stood on end to make them appear larger and more

ferocious than they actually were. They charged at groups of subordinate

apes—who immediately scattered—and then received due respect through

some submissive greeting or by being groomed in an elaborate fashion. De

Waal realized, however, that as the hierarchy changed, those gaining power

were not necessarily the strongest. Social maneuvers were of even greater

importance as other chimpanzees joined in on one side or the other and shifted their allegiances. Changes in the hierarchy were not abrupt, but orderly.

The fi rst change charted by de Waal began with the established domi-

nant male, Yeroen, initially enjoying the support of most of the females but

appearing unsure of how to respond to a conspicuous challenge to his author-

ity by another male, Luit. In a defi nite affront, Luit mated with a female right in front of Yeroen. Then Luit got another male, Nikkie, to join him to tilt

the balance of power in his favor. During the course of the power struggles,

the tactics deployed involved not only displays of strength and determination but also measures designed to encourage females to defect, such as grooming them and playing with their children. Yeroen’s angry tantrums, which

might once have made subordinates wary of defecting, gradually lost their

impact as they became more frequent. He eventually gave up. This struggle

led to another. With Luit now dominant, Yeroen was prepared to work with

Nikkie to regain some of his past prestige, even though he would not become

dominant again.

Actual fi ghting played only a small part in this process. Biting, the

most dangerous act of aggression, was rarely used. De Waal concluded

that rather than changing the social relationships, the fi ghts tended to

refl ect the changes that had already taken place. The apes appeared to

know that they should limit violence among themselves, for they might

have to unite against external rivals. They also seemed to understand the

need for mediation and reconciliation. Once a goal had been achieved, the

patterns of behavior changed—for example, both the winners and losers

became less aggressive.

4

o r i g i n s

According to de Waal, the core elements of this strategic activity were the ability to recognize each other individually and to perceive social relationships, including how others might combine to form coalitions and how

these coalitions might then be broken up. To make choices, the chimpan-

zees needed to grasp the potential consequences of their actions and be able, to some extent, to plan a route to their goal. As chimpanzees exhibited all

these attributes, de Waal concluded that “the roots of politics are older than humanity.” His later work built upon these original insights, pointing to

evidence that primates can show tolerance, altruism, and restraint, meaning

they have a capacity for empathy. Empathy involves at least emotional sensi-

tivity to others and at most an ability to understand another’s point of view.

This, de Waal argued, is “essential for the regulation of social interactions, coordinated activity, and cooperation toward shared goals.” 3]]

Deception also turned out to be a vital strategic quality. It involved delib-

erately sending untrue signals with a view to changing another’s behavior.

Apes tricked other members of their group out of food or sneaked off for some furtive courtship when alpha males were not paying attention. Again, this

required a degree of empathy with other apes. It was necessary to understand

the normal behavior of others if only to appreciate how they might be misled.

What we might call “strategic intelligence,” for both chimps and humans,

evolved through interactions in a complex social environment as much as

from the demands of survival in a harsh physical environment. Consider the

human brain. The brain consumes 20 percent of the body’s energy, far more

than any other organ, while making up only 2 percent of an adult’s body

weight. Something so costly to maintain must have developed to meet a vital

need. Richard Byrne and Nadia Corp studied eighteen species from all the

major branches of primates and correlated the size of the neocortex to the

amount of deception the species practiced. They established a link between

the size of the brains and general social intelligence, including the ability to work together and manage confl ict, as well as trickery. 4]] In evolutionary terms, the value of these skills was not hard to imagine in the face of challenges from other species that might be stronger but also more stupid. If

neocortex size set the limits on the mental world of a particular animal, then it would also set limits on those with whom relationships could be formed,

and therefore the number of allies available at times of confl ict. So, the larger the brain the greater the ability to maintain substantial social networks. The concept of “Machiavellian intelligence,” as promoted by Byrne, established

a link between strategy and evolution. The sort of basic survival techniques

identifi ed by Niccolo Machiavelli for sixteenth-century Italy turned out to be

similar to those necessary for survival in the most primitive of social groups. 5

e v o l u t i o n

The concept developed as part of a conjunction of research on the physical development of the brain, close observations of both primates and humans,

and considerations of the infl uence of ecological and social factors. The early intellectual challenges facing our ancestors would have involved thinking

through how to get up high trees without falling down and constructing

safe places to sleep once there, or the sequence of manual actions necessary to acquire and eat particularly nutritious but hard-to-get-at foods with spines or thick skins. Physical tasks required a sequence of activities, and so it became necessary to plan ahead. Whatever the ecological imperatives and physical

demands that increased brain size, at some point the key driver became the

need to maintain sizable and coherent social groups. Working effectively in

groups required understanding the particular characters of other members of

the groups, how they were ranked in the hierarchy and with whom they had

attachments, and what all this might mean in specifi c situations.

_Strategies of Violence_

One important complexity was the need to take on other groups with whom

there were no social bonds, what Charles Darwin called “the struggle for

existence.” A sense of the potential for cooperation and the limits to confl ict might shape social relations within the “in” group, but different imperatives come into play once there is a confrontation with an “out” group. Individual

aggression is common in animals, but warfare—groups fi ghting each other—

is less so. Ants are among the most warlike of creatures. Their foreign policy has been described as “restless aggression, territorial conquest, and genocidal annihilation of neighboring colonies whenever possible. If ants had nuclear

weapons, they would probably end the world in a week.” 6]] As ant warfare is conducted by specialized warriors with no capacity for reproduction, the

population of the colony is not threatened by their loss in battle. Warfare

among ants has a clear purpose: a struggle for food and territory. When one

colony defeats another, stored grain is taken to the victors’ nests and the other colony is killed off or driven away. Ant warfare is in no sense strategic. It relies on relentless and ruthless attrition through brute force. The ants stick together; build up a superior mass; and wear down the enemy defenses by

constant, vicious, and no-holds-barred attacks. There is no scope for bargaining and negotiation.

By contrast, studies of chimpanzees demonstrated a strategic intelligence

at work. Males of other species might fi ght each other one-on-one for the

opportunity to mate with females. What was noteworthy about the chimps

6

o r i g i n s

was that on occasion one group would take on a neighboring group, and some chimps would die in the confl ict. This was not a routine feature of chimpanzee life. It became more likely under certain conditions, again suggesting

strategic behavior rather than mere aggressive instinct.

Some of the most notable observations of chimpanzees at war come from

Jane Goodall, the pioneering student of the social lives of chimpanzees. She

began watching them in 1960 in Tanzania’s Gombe Stream National Park,

and found a number of occasions when individual apes had been murdered by

males from neighboring colonies. A particularly dramatic confl ict occurred

at Gombe after a community split as the result of a falling out between two

alpha males. Hostility continued between the two communities, known as

the Kasekala and the Kahama. It led to a protracted confl ict between 1973

and 1974 which concluded with the extinction of the Kahama. The males

of the Kasekala took over both the Kahama’s territory and their females. [^7]

Goodall observed that, when acting defensively, the chimpanzees would

call each other to a fi ght and move rapidly toward where they were needed.

Border patrols would also be mounted to explore potentially contentious ter-

ritory. Because of the risk of being caught by a superior group, these patrols were conducted with great caution, avoiding unnecessary noise and checking

regularly for signs of the other, hostile community. Normal boisterous behav-

ior was saved for when they returned to familiar territory. What was most

striking about these patrols was that on occasion they turned into something

more predatory as the chimps moved away from the borders and quite far into

neighboring territory. There would be long and silent waits until there was

an opportunity to attack a vulnerable victim. After catching their victims

by surprise, the attacking chimps would leave their enemies dead or dying.

It has been argued that it would be unwise to generalize from this study

because of the artifi cial conditions created by the reduced habitat and Goodall’s infl uence over the food supply. She used feeding stations to draw the apes out of the forest, which encouraged competition among concentrated groups.

By contrast, de Waal was able to observe chimpanzees by manipulating the

distribution of food to reduce confl ict levels. Goodall acknowledged—and

regretted—that her intervention prompted more aggressive behavior but

pointed out that it did not invalidate the fi nding that in certain conditions chimpanzees acted in particular ways. Moreover, her fi ndings are not unique.

Close observation of communities elsewhere also showed a capacity for war-

fare, albeit occasional.

Why did they fi ght? Richard Wrangham identifi ed the sources of con-

fl ict as “improved access to resources such as food, females, or safety.” Power relationships between neighboring communities mattered because of the

e v o l u t i o n

7

chimps’ need for ripe fruit, which was in turn a consequence of their digestive systems. When fruit was scarce, individual chimpanzees traveled alone

or in small groups to fi nd more; because of the uneven distribution of fruit supplies, the territory of one community could be well endowed while

another was bereft. This was a recipe for confl ict, and an explanation for

why a stronger community would seek to take advantage of a weaker one.

Wrangham argued that adult male chimpanzees “assess the costs and benefi ts

of violence” and attack when the “probable net benefi t is suffi ciently high.”

A consequence of a kill was that the relative position of one community was

signifi cantly enhanced (as these communities were often not large, the loss

of one member made a real difference.). He called this the “imbalance-of-

power hypothesis, which stated that coalitionary kills occurred because of

two factors: inter-group hostility, and large power asymmetries between rival parties.” [^8] This explained why killing took place but not the origins of the underlying confl ict—the struggle for a scarce and vital resource.

More striking than the incidence of extreme violence was the calculating

attitude to confl ict. Goodall observed that “a small patrol will turn and fl ee if it meets a larger party, or one with more males, even _within_ its own range; whereas if a large party, travelling out of its range, meets a smaller party of neighbors, it is likely to chase or attack.” When there was greater symmetry

among the numbers of adult males, the typical result was “visual and audi-

tory display exchanges without confl ict.” 9]] The important point, therefore, was that the apes were astute when it came to working out power balances.

They tried to avoid a fi ght if they were weaker, readily retreating in the

face of superior force, but moved in when they were stronger. Thus it is no

surprise that no instances of one of the attacking pack getting killed were

recorded. What made the difference was not strength in battle but “the rela-

tive size and composition of parties when they encounter each other.” 10]] This pragmatic attitude to violence underlined its instrumentality.

The evolutionist, therefore, saw strategy as a natural consequence of scarce

vital resources and the struggle for survival. But it was not just a question of the survival of the fi ttest, in terms of raw strength and instinctive aggression. The survivors would also need to have outthought their opponents,

to have shown a better grasp of social relationships and how to manipulate

them. From the start of time, success could come as much from being smart

as being strong, and it was especially smart to get others to help overpower

opponents.

Similar patterns have been discerned in so-called primitive warfare

among humans, although what passed for strategy appears to have been “cus-

tomary and unspoken” and can now be inferred only “from the conduct and

8

o r i g i n s

effects of warfare.” 11]] The strategies appear to have been largely attritional, with the enemy being worn down by regular battles and raids, normally

with low casualties but also surprise massacres on occasion. Victory would

be total: wealth and food plundered, houses and fi elds destroyed, women

and children killed or captured. As logistic support was minimal, it was

not possible to engage in prolonged combat or extended maneuvers because

either food or ammunition would soon be exhausted. Raids had a number of

advantages. They were hard to guard against, as security was normally poor

and small groups moving at night were hard to detect, and it was possible to

withdraw if the odds looked unfavorable. There was, according to Azar Gat,

every incentive to avoid open warfare. Before attempting a killing it was

best if the victims were “caught helpless, relatively defenseless, and, above all, little capable of effectively harming the attackers.” These factors led to a

“remarkably uniform” pattern of warfare, manifested within “any society of

hunter-gatherers and primitive agriculturalists studied.” [^12]

From the study of these societies and those of chimps we can identify

some of the elemental features of strategic behavior. 13]] These features emerge out of social structures that invite confl ict. They require some recognition of the distinctive attributes of individuals who are potential opponents or allies, and suffi cient empathy with these individuals’ situations to make it possible to infl uence their behavior, including by impressing or misleading them. The most effective strategies do not depend solely on violence—though this can

play an instrumental role, by demonstrating superiority as much as express-

ing aggression—but benefi t instead from the ability to forge coalitions.

Little in the rest of this book will suggest that this list should be expanded.

The elements of strategic behavior have not changed, only the complexity of

the situations in which they must be applied.

Origins 2: The Bible

_For by now I could have stretched out my hand and struck you and your_

_people with a plague that would have wiped you off the earth. But I have_

_raised you up for this very purpose, that I might show you my power and_

_that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth._

—Exodus 9:14–16

An alternative account of the origins of strategy—indeed, of the ori-

gins of everything—comes from the Hebrew Bible. There is no sugges-

tion in the Bible that strategy is in any sense unnatural. Many of the stories revolve around confl icts (sometimes internecine and often with the enemies

of Israel) in which trickery and deception are regularly employed. Some sto-

ries (David and Goliath being the most obvious example) still infl uence the

way we think and talk about strategy. The best strategic advice in the Bible, however, is to always trust God and obey his laws. God might allow others

to shape the game, but he was always the biggest player. When he withheld

support the result was often disaster. When he came in on the side of his

people the result was never in doubt.

The questions of the literalness of the Bible and the issues it raises about

free will and causation have long been at the heart of theological debate. If everything can be put down to God’s intent, what role is there for distinctive human desires? Is human intent a product of God’s intent, or can it develop

independently? For the student of strategy, the Bible makes for frustrating reading. Its stories display evident human frailties, with a pronounced tendency for deception as a vital strategic practice. When an individual was in a tough spot and there was a crafty way out, it tended to be taken. For example, Jacob, with his mother’s connivance, tricked his blind father into giving him the blessing intended for his elder brother, Esau. Jacob was tricked in

turn by his prospective father-in-law, so he ended up with two wives rather

than one. And fi nally, Jacob was deceived by his sons into believing that his favorite son, Joseph, had been killed rather than sold into slavery. The Bible acknowledges the moral ambiguity involved in trickery, and the outrage of

the deceived, yet also accepts its value in the face of superior but unwor-

thy power. In a world of fl awed human beings, deception comes naturally

and often.

There are two possible explanations for the latitude allowed by God in

human behavior. The fi rst is that there is nothing in the end to be learned

from all of this because all actions are subject to a higher manipulation. The second is that humans are able to make their own calculations, but in the

end only one strategic judgment matters: whether or not to obey God. After

recasting biblical stories using game theory, Steven Brams concluded that

God was a “superlative strategist.” 1]] Given his starting advantages, anything less than superlative would appear something of a disappointment. But Brams

noted that God enjoyed omniscience but not omnipotence. He was not a mere

puppetmaster but rather was affected by the choices of the other players. To

help explain God’s purpose and his later strategy, Brams drew on the phi-

losopher Leszek Kolakowski. God created the world for “His own glory,” but

this would be pointless unless it could be appreciated. “He needed a setting

in which to be great.” This was only possible after the creation of the world,

“for now He had someone who could admire Him and to whom to com-

pare Himself—and how favorably.” 2]] On this reading, God created strategy by allowing choice, because he wanted people to choose obedience through an act

of will rather than because they were programed to do so. Even if individuals were part of a divine plan that had been set out at the moment of creation,

they were allowed the sensation of choice and the ability to calculate and plan.

The Bible tells of human choices regularly being manipulated by God to cre-

ate the situations in which his greatness would become apparent.

The issue came up as soon as man and woman were formed to take control

of the new world that God had created. After placing Adam and Eve in Eden,

God immediately set a test. In his fi rst words he explained that they could

“eat from any fruit in the garden.” One critical exception was fruit from

the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. “If you eat its fruit,” God warned

t h e b i b l e

11

Adam, “you will be doomed to die.” We must assume that Eden was created with these tests in mind. If God really did not want Adam and Eve to lapse,

it would have been simple not to put the fruit there in the fi rst place. The test was soon failed. Eve tasted the forbidden fruit and then persuaded Adam

to do the same. In the face of God’s anger, Adam blamed his own ignorance

but also Eve—the “woman whom you gave me”—and so pushed the blame

back to God.

The source of the Fall was the serpent who persuaded Eve to disobey. The

translations of the serpent’s strategy vary from “subtle” to “crafty” and “cunning.” He convinced Eve that there was no risk and much to gain. The reason

the fruit was forbidden was not because of death but because of power. “God

doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods.” The serpent was accusing God of deception. Perhaps he

had a point. Once the fruit was eaten, God did consider Adam and Eve to

have become “like one of us” because they could now differentiate good from

evil. If they had also taken from the Tree of Life, they would have avoided

death. It was precisely for this reason that God expelled them from Eden;

had they managed to eat of this tree, God’s threat would have been neutral-

ized and they could have anticipated everlasting life. 3]] Instead, Adam and Eve became mortal and were now doomed to die (though Adam managed to

struggle on until he was 930 years old). Banishment from Eden consigned

man to extracting a living from the soil and woman to suffering in childbirth.

The serpent was condemned to slither around on his belly and eat dust. 4

_The Ten Plagues as Strategic Coercion_

The point at which God asserted his greatness to his chosen people was when

he arranged the escape of the Jews from Egypt, where they were kept as slaves.

One reading of the story of Exodus is that it was not so much about freeing

the Israelites from slavery as about asserting God’s greatness by establishing a people beholden to him and ensuring that they—and others—were in awe

of his power. Under this interpretation, the Exodus story becomes a gigantic

manipulation. The Israelites were encouraged to leave a country they were in

no hurry to leave. Not surprisingly, they moaned thereafter when they were

stuck in the desert, while God used the plagues to drive home the message of

his power and superiority over Egyptian gods.

Diana Lipton has suggested that the Exodus refl ected less a concern

that the Israelites were being oppressed and more one that they were being

seduced by Egyptian life and were in the process of being assimilated. 5]] The 12

o r i g i n s

Israelites had entered Egypt because of Jacob’s son Joseph, who had risen to high rank in Egyptian society. They were led out by Moses, an Israelite who

had grown up among the Egyptians but was persuaded by God to assert the

distinctive identity of the Israelites. Moses acted largely as God’s agent in all his dealings with Pharaoh.

The favored strategy was coercive, using threats to persuade the target—

in this case Pharaoh—to yield. The challenge was to infl uence the target’s

calculations, so that the potential cost of not complying exceeded the poten-

tial cost of losing what was currently held. The Israelite slaves were valuable to Egypt, so the threat had to be substantial. Coercive threats must be credible to be effective, yet those issued by Moses depended on a god not wor-

shiped by Egyptians. There was no immediate reason to take him seriously.

The fi rst challenge was therefore how to change this perception. That was not diffi cult. The greater challenge was to get Pharaoh to respond. The strategy, a standard form of coercion involving a progressive “turning of the screw” in an attempt to fi nd the target’s threshold of pain, led to regular promises of compliance upon which Pharaoh equally regularly reneged.

Moses initially demanded that Pharaoh “let my people go” in relatively

modest terms. He asked that the Hebrew slaves be allowed to go into the

wilderness for a three days’ journey to pray and sacrifi ce. If not, Pharaoh

was told, then “the Lord our God [might] fall upon us with pestilence, or

with the sword.” The fi rst people to be coerced in this story, therefore, were the Jews themselves. Moses presented them as caught between the power of

Pharaoh and an even more powerful God. Pharaoh’s response was to deny any

knowledge or respect for this god and to make the Hebrews’ lives even more

miserable by telling them to fi nd their own straw for their bricks. This extra suffering immediately undermined Moses’s confi dence and credibility.

Pharaoh was not punished at fi rst. Instead, to persuade him to take God

more seriously, he was treated to a demonstration of God’s power. Moses’s

brother Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and it became a serpent.

Surprisingly, Pharaoh’s magicians performed the same trick, but then Aaron’s

rod swallowed up all the other rods. This had no impact on Pharaoh. Tricks

involving rigidifi ed snakes were quite common in Egypt. So Moses tried but

failed to make his point in a non-punitive manner. Pharaoh remained uncon-

vinced of God’s power.

There then followed the ten plagues. First the river turned to blood. This

made little impression either. Pharaoh’s magicians claimed they could also

transform water into blood. Then out of the river came an abundance of frogs.

Pharaoh hesitated and said that the Hebrews could go, but changed his mind

when the frogs were removed. After a plague of gnats, the court magicians

t h e b i b l e

13

were stumped. At last a trick that they could not reproduce. They acknowledged the “fi nger of God,” but Pharaoh was still unmoved. With swarms of

fl ies Pharaoh weakened but again reneged when the plague was lifted. Next

was the killing of Egypt’s cattle, followed by everyone being covered in boils.

Moses was told by God to go to Pharaoh and say on his behalf:

Let my people go that they may serve me. For I will at this time send

all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy

people; that thou may knowest that there is none like me in all the

earth. For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and

thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.

And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to shew in

thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the

earth. As yet thou exaltest thou myself against my people, that thou

wilt not let them go? 6

Then came a threat of hail and advice that Pharaoh tell everyone to get them-

selves and their beasts home before the hail lest they die. This started to make the Egyptians uneasy. Some took the advice and sought shelter; others did

not. Only the former survived the subsequent hailstorm.

Pharaoh, now anxious, agreed he was wicked and that the Hebrews could

go, once the thunder and lightning stopped. Again he reneged, raising the

stakes: by breaking a promise, Pharaoh had become a sinner on his own

terms. After a plague of locusts, with the deadline for compliance the next

day, Pharaoh’s servants had a go at him: “How long shall this man be a snare

unto us? Let the men go, that they may serve the Lord their God: knowest

thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?” Pharaoh relented and called in Moses

and Aaron. He started to bargain. Who would go? Moses said everyone, with

their fl ocks and herds. Pharaoh was only prepared to let the men and children go. He knew the women were irrelevant to acts of worship, and the only reason to take fl ocks and herds was if there was no intention to return. Moses’s demands were now getting complex. The modest initial demand, an opportunity for the Hebrew men to leave for a while to pray, was being transformed into something much more complete.

After the eighth plague, locusts devouring all the fruits and herbs that

had survived the hail, negotiations soon resumed. Pharaoh was contrite, but

only until the locusts were blown away. The ninth plague, three days of com-

plete darkness, was most alarming for a kingdom that worshiped the sun

and dreaded a persistent eclipse. Like the third and the sixth, this plague

was quite unannounced. It was a warning that the time for negotiation was

over. Once the darkness lifted, Pharaoh agreed that everyone could go—other

14

o r i g i n s

than the fl ocks and herds. Moses said it had to be everyone and everything.

It was now evident that this would be no excursion for prayer and sacrifi ce

but a permanent departure from Egypt. Furious, Pharaoh broke off negotia-

tions: “Take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die.” Moses agreed he would not return.

God said there would be one more plague and this would be successful.

The Hebrews, spared all the previous plagues, were told to prepare. By daub-

ing their houses with blood from sheep or goats God would know to pass

over them when he smote the fi rstborn of the Egyptians. At midnight on the

fourteenth day of the month there was not a house in Egypt “where there was

not one dead.” This caused great misery and consternation. Moses and Aaron

were summoned and told to leave. So eager were the Eyptians to be rid of

them that all the Israelites and their livestock were allowed to depart, with jewelry and raiments and what else they required.

The loss of the slaves was a serious blow to Pharaoh. He changed his mind

one last time and decided to chase after them with chariots, horsemen, and

his army. Once again, his memory was remarkably short. A regular victim of

God’s power, he only seemed to believe in it while the pressure was actually

upon him and his people. Initially it appeared that the Hebrews had been

caught. They cowered on the edge of the Red Sea, fearing that they were to

die in the wilderness, with the Egyptians about to come upon them. There

was no time for threats to coerce Pharaoh. This time God’s intervention was

more direct. The Red Sea divided and the Hebrews escaped as the waves were

held back in suspended animation. The Egyptians followed the same route

but the “host of Pharaoh” was drowned as the walls of water engulfed them.

The actual methods employed in this case were quite unique, but the stra-

tegic logic refl ected a turning of the screw. Commentators have even noticed the pattern of graduated escalation—the fi rst four plagues were mere nuisances, the second four caused real pain, and the last two took the Egyptians into the realm of absolute dread. Others have noted that the escalation progressed in pairs—the fi rst pair connected with the Nile, the second involving insects, the third attacking life, the fourth destroying crops in a two-stage assault, and the last two conveying the full extent of God’s power. Still others have stressed the signifi cance of every third plague arriving without warning.

We may note the importance of subtle variations in the way the pressure was

applied, playing on the psychology of Pharaoh and his court.

The most striking feature of this story, however, lies in the diffi culty of

persuading Pharaoh to respond positively to threats of such palpable cred-

ibility and potency. Why did he take so long to let the Israelites go? Threats might fail because they are not believed or are suspected to be bluff. Initially t h e b i b l e

15

Pharaoh may have assumed he was witnessing just an unusually accomplished version of the sort of magic produced in his own court. A critical turning

point came when his magicians realized this magic was beyond theirs. But

this point was reached quite early on in the escalatory process. Moses could

always demonstrate that he was not bluffi ng.

Another problem might have been that Moses increased his demands

with the pressure. At the start, he asked only for a chance to pray, but this turned into a chance to escape. Once the Egyptians were desperate to see the

backs of the Israelites, the demand was for suffi cient animals and other goods to ease the privations of the coming journey. A threat that might have been

suffi cient to obtain compliance with modest demands became inadequate as

the stakes were raised.

A superfi cial reading—and certainly the telling of the Passover tale—

suggests that Pharaoh’s obstinacy had a simpler explanation: he was a most

unpleasant man, whose continuing deceit and double-dealing contrasted

with the courtesy and dignity exhibited by Moses at all times. He was so sure of his own power that he was prepared to engage in this disastrous trial of

strength. There is, however, a more intriguing explanation: Pharaoh was set

up. Before the plagues started, God told Moses:

I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders

in the land of Egypt. But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that

I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and

my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great

judgments. [^7]

Sure enough, every time Pharaoh hesitated in the face of the onslaught of

plagues, the Bible reports that the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart. God

explained this to Moses, after the hail, when Pharaoh acknowledged God’s

power for the fi rst time but still reneged on a promise.

I have hardened his heart, and the hearts of his servants, that I might

shew these my signs before him: and that thou mayest tell in the ears

of thy son, and of thy son’s son, what things I have wrought in Egypt,

and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how

that I am the Lord. 8

God needed an obstinate Pharaoh because the only way he could demonstrate

the full range of his power, and its superiority over all other powers on earth, was to put on the most awesome display. If Pharaoh had crumbled at the fi rst plague there would have been no wondrous reports to pass down to future

generations. Others would not appreciate the extent of his formidable power.

16

o r i g i n s

This was problematic for Talmudic scholars and later for Christian theologians, for it raises fundamental questions of free will. If punishment comes because we have made the wrong moral choices, then what are we to do about

an agent who continues to be immoral despite recognizing the folly of his ways?

It was not that God wanted an excuse to destroy the Egyptians—witness his

rebuke to the Jews when they rejoiced at the destruction of the Egyptian army.

As noted, relations between ordinary Egyptians and the Hebrews do not appear

to have been bad, yet the loss of innocent life in the fi nal plague—even the sons of maidservants were struck down—only seems to make moral sense if the stubbornness of Pharaoh could be blamed for the suffering of his people. Strategy as well as morality depended on choice, and if the players in this drama were merely acting out a preordained script from which no deviation was permitted, then the only strategist at work here was God.

_A Coercive Reputation_

One act of successful coercion facilitates future acts. God’s threats now had credibility. The reputation of his extraordinary power made it far easier to

coerce the inhabitants of the land of Israel, which had been promised to the

Jews. Just before entering this land, Moses died and Joshua became the leader of the Israelites. The fi rst obstacle to occupying the new land was the old

walled city of Jericho, at the center of fertile land and in control of the water source. [^9] Joshua sent two spies to discover the lay of the land. They lodged with Rahab, who is normally described as a prostitute but who may have

been more of an innkeeper (an inn was always a good place to pick up gossip).

When the king of Jericho demanded that the spies be handed over, Rahab

hid them instead. Having heard what had happened to the Egyptians, she

explained, “All the inhabitants of the land are quaking before you.” They

had all lost heart, and “no man had any spirit left because of you.” She made a deal. In return for her family being spared whatever was going to befall the rest of the city, she agreed not to disclose the spies’ mission. This deal was not based on the moral worthiness of the Hebrew God—just his superior power.

When it came to actually taking Jericho, there was no need for a prolonged

siege. Around the walls the Israelites marched for six days, until it became

such a routine that the guardians of the city took little notice, and then they struck as God brought the walls (weakened through a recent earthquake)

tumbling down.

As the invasion progressed, those on its line of advance had every reason

to be afraid. There was no mercy shown to those occupying the land God

t h e b i b l e

17

had promised to the Israelites, although mercy could be shown to people who lived far away. Aware of this, the Gibeonites pretended to Joshua that

they were not from the next city but rather a distant people. They engaged

in a careful deception, appearing disheveled and claiming to have traveled

from a faraway place, drawn by the fame of God. When Joshua doubted this

claim, they drew attention to their “dry and crumbly” bread, their cracked

wineskins, and their worn-out clothes and sandals. Joshua was suffi ciently

taken in that he promised not to harm the Gibeonites in return for their ser-

vitude. Soon the Israelites realized they had been duped. Joshua was furious.

He could not break an oath made in God’s name even if obtained by deceit.

Instead he cursed the Gibeonites, telling them that they would be slaves

forever. “Why did you deceive me?” he asked. The answer was honest. Once

they knew of God’s promise “to give you the whole land and to wipe out

all the inhabitants of the country on your account,” they were in great fear.

Joshua had only himself to blame if he had been deceived. Convinced by the

Gibeonites’ appearance, he “did not inquire of the Lord.” What is the point

of having access to omniscience if it is not used to check out a potentially

dubious story? 10

The book of Judges relates a regular pattern of Israelites turning away

from God, who then used a hostile tribe, the Midianites, to punish them. The

liberating fi gure of Gideon appeared after the Midianites had been allowed

to enter the country and impoverish the people. The Israelites were suffer-

ing for their idolatry and begged for deliverance. God chose Gideon for the

mission. When he gathered a large army of some thirty thousand men, God

deemed this too many. If they thought victory came by superior numbers,

God judged, they might “vaunt themselves against me, saying, ‘Mine own

hand hath saved me.’ ” The numbers had to be reduced. First, those who were

“fearful and afraid” were asked to depart. This cut the numbers by about

two-thirds. Then a curious test was set, involving seeing how the men drank

at a lake. Those who went on their knees were sent home; those who put

their hands to their mouths were kept, perhaps because this showed that

they were staying alert. The numbers were now only 1 percent of the original

army—just three hundred men. Against them were ranged their enemies,

lying “along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels

were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.” Gideon

divided his three hundred men into three companies and put a trumpet in

every man’s hand. They were then told to watch him and do as he did when

they got to the outside of the enemy camp. “When I blow with a trumpet,

I and all that are with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, ‘The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.’ ” This they did.

18

o r i g i n s

And the enemy “ran, and cried, and fl ed.” 11]] This reinforced the basic lesson in all these stories. The best—indeed the only—strategy was to obey God and

then do as he told you.

_David and Goliath_

One of the most iconic of all the Bible’s stories is that of David and Goliath.

It is invariably invoked by an underdog, yet the underdog status was illu-

sory because David had God on his side. The basics of the story are well

known. On opposite sides of a valley were the armies of the Philistines and

the Israelites. Out of the Philistine camp emerged a giant of a man, Goliath

of Gath, dressed in heavy brass armor, protected by a shield, and wielding a

large spear with a large iron head. He dared the Israelites to send out a champion to fi ght him. If he was killed in the fi ght then the Philistines would serve the Israelites. If he prevailed it would be the Israelites who served.

The challenge, repeated daily for forty days without a response, appeared to

paralyze the Israelites, including their king, Saul. They “were dismayed and

greatly afraid.” The only one not afraid was a young shepherd, David, who

had been sent to the camp by his father with some bread and cheese for the

army. He heard Goliath’s challenge, saw the fear around him, and noted a

promise of great riches should anyone actually manage to kill Goliath. David

presented himself to the dubious king. David was still young, yet Goliath

had been “a man of war from his youth.” David offered as his credentials a

tale of how he had killed both a lion and a bear who were after his lambs.

Saul relented and gave David his armor and sword, dressing him for a glad-

iatorial fi ght with Goliath. But David discarded these accoutrements, saying he could not take them as he had not “tested them.” Instead he took his staff, fi ve smooth stones from the brook, and his sling. Not surprisingly, Goliath

found the challenger that the Israelites had eventually produced unimpres-

sive, even insulting. “Am I a dog that thou comest to me with staves?” Their

encounter was brief. Goliath promised to feed David’s “fl esh unto the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the fi eld.” The young man replied that he came in God’s name and then ran toward the Philistine. As soon as he was in position, he took a stone out of his bag “and slung it and smote the Philistine in his

forehead, so that the stone sunk into his forehead. And he fell upon his face to the earth.” David then took the giant’s sword to kill him and cut off his head.

When the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fl ed. 12]]

David’s success depended on surprise and accuracy. He knew he could not

defeat Goliath on the giant’s terms, which is why he rejected Saul’s armor

t h e b i b l e

19

and with it the conventions of this form of combat. Unencumbered, he had speed and so could unleash his secret weapon before Goliath had a chance to

respond. He had one chance with his sling. If he had missed, or if the stone

had pinged off Goliath’s armor or not stunned him so effectively, there would have been no second shot. As vital as the fi rst shot was quick action to prevent any recovery. Not only did David bring Goliath down but by killing

him he prevented him getting up again. He also depended on the Philistines

accepting the result, and not trying to recover honor in the face of such a

sneaky attack by turning the individual contest into a full battle. If they had done so, David’s prowess with the sling would have been of no value. Indeed,

this was a trick he could never use again. David had no plan B. If his plan

A had failed, he would have been left defenseless.

The story is rarely given any context. This was one of a complex set of

encounters between the Israelites and the Philistines. The Philistines con-

trolled the territory west of the Jordan River. In earlier clashes, the Israelites fared very badly and lost four thousand men. Having apparently learned their

lesson and returned to the laws of God, they regained God’s protection, so

that at one point a loud noise was suffi cient to send the Philistines running away in panic. They were chased and subdued. The Israelites recaptured lost

land. All this took place while the prophet Samuel was still leading the country as a Judge.

Saul was the fi rst king of the Israelites, anointed by Samuel. This consti-

tutional innovation was intended to meet the Israelites’ desire to be led in

the same way as other nations. Their king was chosen on the grounds that he

looked the part—handsome and tall—was humble, and had shown military

prowess. He was not, however, always obedient to God. Hostilities resumed

with the Philistines after a provocative raid by Saul’s son Jonathan in which a Philistine offi cer was killed. The Philistines mobilized and the Israelites were once again overwhelmed. Saul turned out to be a poor general (for example,

forbidding his men food on the eve of a major battle) and cautious (reluctant to go out and face Goliath himself). Given that God was supposed to be the

best defense, this lack of confi dence—and therefore faith—was itself an act of disobedience. Though David’s sling gained the headlines, Goliath’s fate was

sealed by David’s faith.

Through the Bible we are allowed to see the factors at work that deter-

mined the history of the Israelites, but to the subjects of these stories it would have been challenging to work out what was going on. God’s objectives were

clear enough, but his methods were invariably deceptive, leading his victims

into traps under the erroneous impression that they were masters of their

destinies. As a result, deception became a strong biblical theme. Cunning

20

o r i g i n s

was accepted as a natural method for an underdog who must use wits to succeed. The trickster appeared defi ant, employing “wit, wile, and deception

and assum[ing] that no victories are fi nal and neat.” Yet to the extent that they did this without God’s help, the tricks often rebounded and any success

was “unstable.” 13 David’]]s success resulted from combining an unreliable trick with a much more reliable faith.

The stories of the Exodus and David have both been used to give hope

to underdogs. Indeed, reference to David is almost de rigueur whenever

an underdog strategy is discussed. Seldom noted, however, is that success

did not solely depend on the initial blow but also on the second blow, by

which David ensured that Goliath had no chance to recover, as well as the

Philistines’ readiness to accept the result. In both stories, the key to suc-

cess lay in the opponent’s response. Both the Pharaoh and Goliath failed to

appreciate the traps they were entering. Only Pharaoh had the opportunity

to consider what he was up against and adjust his strategy accordingly. But

as God was hardening his heart, any momentary understanding that he was

leading his country into further hardship soon disappeared. Moses was fol-

lowing God’s orders and so was Pharaoh. In the end, the drama—and there-

fore the evidence of true strategy—was artifi cial.

The core message of the Bible was evident to those who read it for guid-

ance and inspiration over the centuries. God’s subjects asserted their faith and their obedience as part of their standard preparations for war, even when they were fi ghting each other. They might have been sure that this was a necessary condition for victory. Few found it suffi cient.

Origins 3: The Greeks

_Do not trust the Horse, Trojans/ Whatever it is, I fear the Greeks even_ _bearing gifts._

—Laocoön in Virgil’s _Aeneid_

Our third source for the origins of strategy is ancient Greece. In

terms of its subsequent infl uence, this was the most important. At

fi rst the stories told about power and war shared with the Bible the compli-

cation of divine intervention, which implied that the best strategic advice

was to stay on the right side of the gods, but by the fi fth century BCE a

Greek enlightenment, a combination of intellectual open-mindedness and

rigorous political debate, had taken place. This resulted in an extraordi-

narily rich philosophical and historical literature that has had an enduring

infl uence. Homer’s heroes were masters of both words and actions, although

the differences between Achilles and Odysseus showed the potential tension

between the two. The man of action could either be admired for his cour-

age or dismissed as a fool for his sole reliance on strength, while the man

of words could be celebrated for his intelligence or treated warily because

words could deceive.

One of the curiosities of this literature is that some of its most interest-

ing refl ections on what it might mean to think as well as act strategically—

not only in a military sense—were later played down and lost their impact.

We can attribute this to the intervention of Plato. He was determined that

philosophy should break decisively with the tendencies he lumped together as sophistry, which he saw as a diversion from a disinterested search for truth into a mercenary means of persuasion. There is some irony in that Plato’s

method for disposing of sophistry, using exaggeration and caricature, was

intensely strategic. Given the care with which he was studied by later gen-

erations, the importance of Plato’s success in this enterprise should not be

underestimated.

From Homer came the contrasting qualities, represented respectively

by Achilles and Odysseus, of bi ē and m ē tis (strength and cunning), which

over time—for example, in Machiavelli—came to be represented as force

and guile. This polarity continued to fi nd expression in strategic literature.

Outsmarting the opponent risked less pain than open confl ict, although win-

ning by cunning and subterfuge was often deplored for a lack of honor and

nobility. There was also the more practical problem that reliance on decep-

tion was apt to suffer diminishing returns as opponents came to appreciate

what they were facing. As the previous two chapters demonstrate, there was

nothing unnatural or surprising in efforts to get the better of stronger opponents by catching them by surprise or tricking them in some way. Other

ways of coping with superior strength, however, were combining with others

or disrupting an opponent’s coalition.

A preference for force or guile might refl ect a temperamental disposition,

but it could not be a strategy in itself. That must depend on how best to turn a complex and developing set of affairs to advantage, which in turn must

depend on an ability to persuade those who must implement the strategy

that it is wise. The master of casting a strategy in its most compelling form, at least according to Thucydides, was the Athenian statesman Pericles. The

ability to persuade not only one’s people but also allies and enemies was a

vital attribute of the successful strategist. In this way, strategy required a combination of words and deeds, and the ability to manipulate them both.

_Odysseus_

M ē tis described a particular notion of a strategic intelligence for which

there is no obvious English equivalent. In Greek it was related to _m ē tia ō_ : “to consider, meditate, plan,” together with _metióomai_, “to contrive,” conveyed a sense of a capacity to think ahead, attend to detail, grasp how others

think and behave, and possess a general resourcefulness. But it could also

convey deception and trickery, capturing the moral ambivalence around

a quality so essential to the strategist’s art. According to the mythology,

t h e g r e e k s

23

the goddess M ē tis was chosen by Zeus as his fi rst wife. Fearful that a son combining his strength with his mother’s intelligence would become too

powerful, Zeus employed her own methods of deceit and surprise to avoid

that risk and so ate her. He intended to control the source of all m ē tis forever when he swallowed M ē tis. What he did not know was that M ē tis was

already pregnant, with a daughter Athena, who was born—fully formed—

through Zeus’s head. Athena, the goddess of both wisdom and war, came

to be associated with m ē tis more than the other divinities. She developed

a close association with the mortal who most embodied m ē tis, Odysseus,

the hero of Homer’s _Odyssey_ . Athena described him as “far the best of all mortals in thought and word, and I’m renowned among all the gods for my

wisdom and my cunning ways.” 1

Odysseus exhibited an agile and expedient intelligence. He could evaluate

situations quickly, think ahead, and stay sharply focused on the ultimate goal even when caught in ambiguous and uncertain situations. More concerned

with success than glory, he was indirect and psychological in his methods,

seeking to confuse, disorient, and outwit opponents. But Odysseus also suf-

fered from the challenge of the known deceiver. After a time, he became a

victim of the liar’s paradox: it became hard to get anyone to believe him, even when he was telling the truth. His greatest triumph was the wooden horse

left outside the gates of Troy, which ended a decade of siege and opened up

the city for utter destruction and mass slaughter. Virgil, the Roman who took a less generous view of Odysseus than did Homer, described how the Greeks

made a show of giving up on their struggle to seize Troy. A large horselike

construction, fi lled with up to fi fty soldiers, was hauled to a position just outside the city walls. It carried the inscription: “For their return home, the

Achaeans dedicate this thank-offering to Athena.” 2

The Trojans, hoping that the decade-long siege had been lifted, came out

to inspect this strange horse. King Priam and the elders debated what to do.

The choice was simple. They could treat it as a threat and either burn it or

break it up to see what was inside, or haul it inside and use it as an opportunity to honor Athena. But Athena was known to have favored the Greeks and

be prone to trickery. After all that had happened, was it really wise to trust either her or the Greeks? Odysseus always knew that the Trojans would need

some persuasion. This was accomplished by Sinon, an expert liar. He claimed

to the Trojans that he was a defector. His story was that he had escaped the

Greeks after falling out with Odysseus. He was about to be offered up as

a sacrifi ce to persuade the gods to provide favorable winds for the Greek

ships to get home. The Trojans were half persuaded. Priam asked whether

the “huge monster of a horse” was for religious purposes or “some engine of

24

o r i g i n s

war.” Sinon explained that it was indeed designed to placate Athena, whom the Greeks had offended. It was not meant for the Trojans, he added. In fact

it had been built so large because the Greeks were worried that if the Trojans got the horse into the city they would never again be vulnerable to invasion.

Sinon had arrived on the scene as the priest Laocoön was warning that this

apparent offering was a fraud, a “trick of war.” When Laocoön threw a spear

at the horse, the frightened soldiers inside had moaned. This might have

been something of a giveaway, were it not for the intervention of Athena,

who sent sea serpents to strangle Laocoön and his two sons. This suggested he was being punished for sacrilege—a good reason not to follow his advice. The

other warning came from Cassandra, Priam’s daughter, who told the people

they were fools and faced an “evil fate.” Alas, Cassandra had been granted the gift of prophecy by the god Apollo but was then cursed for not returning his

love. Unlike Sinon, who could lie and be believed, Cassandra would make

accurate predictions and never be believed. And so the decision was made.

The Trojans decided to take the horse through the gate. During the night,

the hidden Greek soldiers got out. On a signal from Sinon, the Greek army

advanced and the gates of Troy were opened for them. The city was sacked

and the people massacred.

Homer mentioned the wooden horse only in passing in _The Odyssey_ , as a special example of the sort of craftiness that distinguished Odysseus from

his more pedestrian peers. He had a talent for getting out of predicaments

that might have led others to succumb to fatalism or lash out with hopeless

bravado. Homer’s indulgent view of Odysseus’s escapades was not shared by

Virgil. He thought such behavior deplorable and unfortunately typical of

untrustworthy Greeks. In later centuries, Sinon was placed with Odysseus in

Dante’s Eighth Circle of Hell, a place for those guilty of fraudulent rhetoric and falsifi cation. Proper heroes would be guided by virtue and truth rather

than opportunism and trickery.

In his epics, Homer contrasted m ē tis with bi ē , or brute force. Bi ē was

personifi ed by Achilles, famed for his exceptional physical strength, brav-

ery, agility, and mastery of the spear, but also his great rages. While _The_ _Odyssey_ was about m ē tis, _The Iliad_ was largely an exploration of bi ē . Achilles demonstrated not only the limits to what force could achieve but also how

it could become associated with a certain wildness, a bloodlust that led to

terrible deaths and slaughter. Yet it was hard to do without force. When

Achilles gave up on the war against the Trojans after being slighted by King

Agamemnon, it was Odysseus who led the delegation sent to plead with

him. Achilles’s response was to denounce Odysseus and his methods: “I hate

like the gates of Hades, the man who says one thing and hides another inside

t h e g r e e k s

25

him.” Just as pointedly, Achilles drew attention to the failure of m ē tis to stop the Greeks being pushed back to the sea by the rampaging “man-killing”

Hector, the equivalent Trojan superhero.

Hector was also described as a man of m ē tis, the only Trojan with Zeus-

like qualities and therefore the man in whom the Trojans invested their

greatest hopes. On crucial occasions, the strategic good sense associated with m ē tis deserted him. This was attributed to the malign infl uence of Athena, who the poor Trojans believed was still protecting the city at a time she

was doing anything but. At the council of the Trojans, an opportunity for

a negotiated peace was missed when Hector was guided more by hatred for

the Greeks and enthusiasm for battle than a shrewd understanding of what

the future might hold. He advocated an offensive course. When the offensive

began, he went on the rampage, driving the Greeks back. One casualty was

Patroclus, a close friend of Achilles. His death led Achilles to turn his considerable rage away from Agamemnon and against Hector. Having reentered

the fi ght, Achilles cut down many Trojans, while all the time searching for

Hector. Eventually, tricked again by Athena, Hector found himself facing

Achilles, something he had understandably hoped to avoid. 3]] He was soon killed with a single blow to the neck. Achilles then tied Hector’s body to his chariot and dragged it round the battlefi eld.

As this is close to the end of _The Iliad_ , we are led to think that Achilles’s victory sealed the fate of Troy. Yet the Greeks could not press home their

advantage. Achilles was soon killed by Paris, the man who had caused the

war in the fi rst place by taking Helen from King Menelaus of Sparta. Paris

struck Achilles with an arrow from a distance. According to one account—

though not Homer’s—the arrow had to hit him in his heel. In this legend,

his mother had dipped the newly born Achilles in the river Styx. He gained

invulnerability where the waters touched him but not on his heel, where his

mother’s hand had gripped him. Achilles’s heel served as a reminder that

even the strongest have their points of weakness which, if found, can be used to bring them down. Hector killing Patroclus and Achilles killing Hector

could also be taken as salutary warnings of the dangers of overreaching, of

using force without intelligent restraint. Brute force is not enough. “In the fi nal analysis,” notes Jenny Strauss Clay, “the humane heroism of Odysseus,

based as it is on intelligence and endurance, is set above the quicksilver glory of Achilles.” [^4]

After the war had been decided by the ruse of the wooden horse, the

Greeks began their journey home. It was as challenging as the original

siege. Terrible storms caused their ships to sink or crash against rocks.

Odysseus was blown off course and took another ten years to get home.

26

o r i g i n s

His adventures along the way provided ample opportunity to apply m ē tis. A striking test came when Polyphemus, a giant one-eyed Cyclops,

devoured a number of his men. Odysseus and his surviving men were

trapped by a boulder that only Polyphemus could move. The fi rst stage of

Odysseus’s plan was to get Polyphemus to drink more than was good for

him. Then Odysseus told the drunk Cyclops that his name in Greek was

Outis, made up of _ou tis_ , meaning “not anyone.” 5]] This allowed Odysseus to conceal his identity and set up Polyphemus for a later piece of deception. Next, Odysseus blinded the giant by drilling a stake into his eye.

As Polyphemus cried out in agony, his fellow Cyclopei asked, “Is any man

stealing your fl ocks and driving them off? Is any man trying to kill you

through cunning or superior strength?” When he replied, “Noman ( _Outis_ ) is trying to kill me through his cunning,” they took this literally and so

thought no more about it. [^6] Polyphemus removed the boulder to let out his sheep. He tried to feel to see if Odysseus and his men were escaping on

top of the animals, but they had tied themselves underneath the animals.

Unwisely, Odysseus then decided to boast. No longer Outis, he identifi ed

himself as one “known for his cunning.” Polyphemus’s father, the sea god

Poseidon, then determined to make Odysseus’s life miserable on his long

journey home.

_The Method in M ē tis_

For Odysseus, the ends justifi ed the means. The trickster was always prepared to be judged by results. The moral unease that this approach generated was

evident in Sophocles’s play, _Philoctetes_ . This was the name of a Greek warrior en route to the Trojan War. His advantage was a bow given to him by the

god Heracles; his disadvantage, a painful and smelly wound resulting from

a snake bite. Odysseus found the smell and Philoctetes’s cries of pain intol-

erable and left the poor man angry and in agony—but with his bow—on

an island. A decade later, Odysseus realized that the bow was essential in

the fi ght against Troy and set off with Neoptolemus, the son of Achilles,

to acquire it. Given his past treatment of Philoctetes, Odysseus knew nei-

ther brute force nor persuasion would get the bow, so Odysseus encouraged

Neoptolemus to trick Philoctetes. The young man, however, had his father’s

“natural antipathy/ to get [his] ends by tricks and stratagems.” He would

prefer to “fail with honor” than to win by cheating. Did not Odysseus fi nd

the lying “vile”? No, came the reply, putting scruples above the common

good placed the whole war effort at risk.

t h e g r e e k s

27

In the play, the matter was resolved by the favored device of the deus ex machina. The god Heracles told Philoctetes to join the battle. The

response was immediate: “Voice for which I have long yearned, Form, long

visioned, now discerned! Thee I cannot disobey.” [^7] So craven obedience to a god quickly solved the dispute in a way that cunning could not. All ended

happily. Odysseus succeeded in his mission, Neoptolemus maintained his

honor, and Philoctetes gained glory and healing of his wound. The play

underlined the diffi culty of relying on deception and then expecting to be

trusted. Those who knew Odysseus’s reputation rarely trusted him even

when he was being straight. 8]] The impact of the best story was diminished when the teller lacked credibility.

Odysseus has been described as exemplifying “a particular idea of practi-

cal intelligence.” According to Barnouw, he was able to consider “intended

actions in the light of anticipated consequences.” He kept his main pur-

pose in mind and thought “back from that fi nal goal through a complex

network of means (and obstacles) to achieve it.” The contrast therefore was

not just with brute force but the recklessness of those who were not so well

tuned to the signs of danger and who failed to think through the potential

consequences of their actions. When Odysseus decided not to succumb to

some short-term impulse for revenge, it was because he remembered how

much more he wanted to achieve his long-term goals of returning safely

to his wife Penelope and his kingdom in Ithaca. Rather than seeing reason

and passion in opposition to one another, practical intelligence was about

fi nding the appropriate relations between competing ends, each with an

associated bundle of passions and reasons. Odysseus’s understanding of how

others viewed the world allowed him to manipulate their thought processes

by giving out signs that he knew they would read in a particular way. He

was not playing pranks on others just because he enjoyed their discomfort.

Rather, his craftiness and capacity for deception were geared to his ultimate objectives. M ē tis was therefore forward-looking, with elements of anticipation and planning, as well as guile and trickery. Barnouw described this

intelligence as being as much “visceral as intellectual,” less an “impassive

weighing of alternatives,” and more a prioritizing of aims or impulses that

are most desired. It refl ected more “the strength and depth of passion as the

work of reason.” 9

Marcel Detienne and Jean-Pierre Vernant similarly argued that m ē tis

as exemplifi ed by Odysseus was a distinctive form of practical intelligence.

More than being shrewd and crafty, it was also forward-looking, locating cur-

rent actions as part of a longer-term plan, grasping the potential of situations so as to be able to manipulate others into error. This suggested a cast of mind 28

o r i g i n s

as much as a plan of action, a way by which the underdog could triumph over the notionally stronger. Despite the association between m ē tis and the

“disloyal trick, the perfi dious lie, treachery,” it could also be “the absolute weapon, the only one that has the power to ensure victory and domination

over others, whatever the circumstances, whatever the conditions of the con-

fl ict.” Whereas strength could be defeated by superior strength, m ē tis could defeat all strength.

M ē tis was of most value when matters were fl uid, fast moving, unfamiliar,

and uncertain, combining “contrary features and forces that are opposed to

each other.” It was suited to situations when there could be no formulaic or

predictable behavior, benefi ting from a “greater grip” of the present, “more awareness” of the future, “richer experience accumulated from the past,” an

ability to adapt constantly to changing events, and suffi cient pliability to accommodate the unexpected. This practical intelligence operated in circumstances of confl ict and was refl ected in such qualities as forethought,

perspicacity, quickness and acuteness of understanding, as well as a capac-

ity for trickery and deceit. Such a person was elusive, slipping through an

“adversary’s fi ngers like running water,” relying on ambiguity, inversion, and

reversal. 10]] All this described a strategic intelligence, able to discern a way through complicated and ambiguous situations and then come out on top.

But it was also largely intuitive, or at least implicit, and at moments of sudden danger and crisis, this might be all that could be relied upon. There was no reason, however, why the same qualities could not come into play when

there was time to be more deliberative and calculating.

_Thucydides_

At ē , the daughter of Eris, the goddess of strife, spent her time encouraging stupidity in both mortals and immortals. She was banished from Mount

Olympus to earth. Barbara Tuchman described her as the goddess of infatu-

ation, mischief, delusion, and folly. At ē was said to blind her victims to

considerations of morality or expedience and render them “incapable of

rational choice.” Such gods, lamented Tuchman, provided humans with an

excuse for their folly. Homer has Zeus, the king of the gods, insisting that

if mortals had suffered “beyond that which is ordained” it was not because

of the gods but because of the “blindness of their own hearts.” It was not

fate that led to disaster, but bad strategy. 11 Y]]et appeals to the gods continued to be made regularly in Athenian affairs. Omens were sought and

oracles consulted.

t h e g r e e k s

29

Then, during the Athenian enlightenment of the fi fth century BCE, an alternative approach developed that rejected explanations for events based on the

immortals and instead looked to human behavior and decisions. In addition,

warfare became too complicated to be left to the heroic deeds of individual warriors; more coordination and planning was needed. The Athenian War Council

consisted of ten _strategoi_ who were expected to be able to lead from the front, fi ght with the best, and show total commitment. In this respect the origins of strategy lie with generalship, that is, the qualities that made for effective leadership. 12 Thucydides, who lived from around 460 to 395 BCE, was a]] _strategos_ .

After he failed to prevent a Spartan occupation of Amphipolis, he was exiled

for twenty years, which provided opportunities to get to know Spartans as well as Athenians. “I had leisure,” he recalled, “to observe affairs somewhat particularly.” 13 This leisure was used to write what he considered to be the defi]] nitive history of the war between Athens and Sparta, known as the Peloponnesian War.

This was fought from 431 to 404 BCE between the Peloponnesian League, led

by Sparta, and the Athenian empire, known as the Delian League. Sparta was

the clear victor. Before the war Athens had been the strongest of the Greek city states. By the war’s conclusion, Athens was much diminished.

As a historian, Thucydides exemplifi ed the enlightenment spirit, describ-

ing confl ict in unsentimental and calculating terms, posing hard questions

of power and purpose, and observing how choices had consequences. He

dismissed explanations for human affairs that depended on capricious fate

and mischievous gods and concentrated instead on political leaders and their

strategies. He insisted on a dogged empiricism, seeking an accurate account

of events backed up where necessary and possible by diligent research. His

narrative illuminated some of the central themes of all strategy: the limits

imposed by the circumstances of the time, the importance of coalitions as a

source of strength but also instability, the challenge of coping with internal opponents and external pressures simultaneously, the diffi culties of strategies that are defensive and patient in the face of demands for quick and decisive

offensives, the impact of the unexpected, and—perhaps most importantly—

the role of language as a strategic instrument. The headlines from Thucydides were often taken to be the descriptions of the irresistibility of power and the imperviousness of the strong to the complaints of the weak or considerations

of morality. On this basis he has been cast as one of the founders of realism, a temperament to which strategic theorists have been presumed to be susceptible because of their relentless focus on power and their presumption

that self-interest best explains behavior. According to the more doctrinaire

realism, the lack of a supreme authority governing all international affairs

has always rendered states inherently insecure. If they dared not trust in the 30

o r i g i n s

good intentions of others, they must make provisions for their own defense—

though these provisions in turn made others insecure. [^14] The signifi cance of Thucydides from this perspective was that he demonstrated its timelessness.

In a non-doctrinaire sense, Thucydides was indeed a realist, describing

human affairs as he found them rather than how he might wish them to be.

But he did not suggest that men were bound to act on the basis of a narrow

self-interest or that they actually served their broader interests if they did.

The picture he presented was much more complex and fl uid, one in which

momentary strength could hide an underlying weakness, and political lead-

ers were addressing a range of actors—some internal and others external—

realizing that new combinations could create new forms of advantage and

disadvantage.

He put into the mouths of key actors, however, statements which sug-

gested that they were following the unavoidable imperatives of power, from

which there could be no reprieve. The Athenians, for example, explained

at one point that they were not holding on to their empire “contrary to the

common practice of mankind” but “under the pressure of three of the stron-

gest motives, fear, honor, and interest.” They did not set the example: “It

has always been the law that the weaker should be subject to the stronger.” 15]]

The same point was put most memorably in the Melian dialogue when the

Athenians point out that “the strong do what they can while the weak must

suffer what they must.” 16]] They had no choice but to suppress the Melians, not only to extend their rule but because not doing so when they had the

chance would show them to be feeble and damage their reputation. Law and

morality were fragile restraints, as the powerful could make laws and defi ne morality to suit their purposes. Yet because Thucydides quoted arguments

in favor of crude exercises of power did not mean that he endorsed them. He

also reported alternative, even idealistic, views as well as the unfortunate

consequences of always worrying about appearing weak, for this led later to

disastrous gambles when caution would have been prudent.

The most important direct assertion of a realist philosophy comes in

his most famous observation, considering the origins of the Peloponnesian

War: “What made the war inevitable was the growth of Athenian power

and the fear which this caused in Sparta.” He acknowledged other expla-

nations, based on the “causes of complaint,” but seemed to be displacing

them by a more systemic analysis. 17 One challenge to this interpretation of]]

Thucydides’s views lies in questions of translation. A more subtle translation suggests that while Thucydides undoubtedly saw the shifting power balance

between the two powers as being of great—and previously understated—

importance, the origins of the war lie in its combination with the disputes

t h e g r e e k s

31

of the moment. 18]] That still leaves a question of whether the systemic factor deserved the prominence given it. Thucydides may have stressed it for the

sake of the reputation of his hero Pericles, the ruler of Athens for some thirty years from 460 BCE.

The power and prestige of Athens had grown as a result of its leadership

of the successful Greek resistance to Persia, although it was not particularly growing prior to the war. It had turned the loose collection of mutually supportive city states that worked with Athens into a more controlled alliance.

This, however, created its own vulnerability as Athenian hegemony became

increasingly unpopular. Pericles, who consolidated his authority as Athens’s

statesmen in 461 BCE, had concluded that it was a suffi cient challenge to manage the existing empire without seeking to expand the League further. Sparta

had acknowledged this restraint. After a war that lasted from 460 to 445 BCE, the two had agreed to the Thirty Years’ Peace. Since that treaty, Pericles had avoided provoking Sparta, a fact noted and accepted by Sparta. It had neither taken an aggressive stance nor made exceptional preparations for war.

The reason why the question of the relationship between the two had

come back into play was because of the complications of alliance. A coalition was an obvious benefi t for a weaker power wishing to get stronger, but an

alliance for a power that was already strong could be a mixed blessing because it could raise expectations and generate obligations while adding little in

return. The members of the coalition might agree on a common enemy but

little else. Furthermore, the measures taken by Athens to make sure that it

did benefi t from the Delian League, including contributions to the Athenian

treasury and navy, generated resentment. As the Persian threat declined, the

resentment increased and Athens became tougher, demanding that their

allies become more Athenian, including more democratic. The Spartans, by

contrast, showed little interest in the internal affairs of their allies. The position Pericles was trying to sustain was therefore precarious. The empire was

of great value to Athens, but the city states were restless.

For different reasons, the Peloponnesian League was also restless. Sparta

was being pressed by one of its most substantial allies, Corinth, to take a

harder line with Athens. Corinth had its supporters, including Megara,

which had its own grievance as a result of the “Megarian Decree” that denied

its produce access to Athenian markets. The reason Megara was demanding

a push against Athens was because it was in dispute with Corcyra, which

had become an obstacle to its own expansion. Corcyra had sought to pro-

tect its position by seeking naval support through alliance with Athens. If

Athens had resisted, war might have been avoided, but instead an awkward

compromise emerged. An alliance would be formed but it would only be

32

defensive. Donald Kagan notes the curiosity in Thucydides’s presentation of the issue to his fellow Athenians. He was probably present at these debates,

yet he abandoned his normal practice of providing full reports of speeches presenting alternative points of view. [^19] Kagan concludes that he did so because further elaboration would have made it clear that the decisions on war were

not so much inevitable but the result of Pericles’s persuasive powers. 20]] Those who took controversial decisions on war tended to portray their decisions as

acts of necessity and play down the exercise of discretion.

It was decided to send emissaries to Sparta to explain Athenian policy,

although Thucydides suggested that the presence of authoritative Athenians in Sparta at the time of the key deliberations was almost accidental. He therefore did not explain who was sent or the nature of their instructions. In a fuller account of the Spartan debate, Thucydides had Corinth, thwarted by Athens,

demanding Spartan support. The demand carried a threat. If Sparta exhibited

supine passivity, their allies would be put at risk and would then be driven “in

despair to some other alliance.” 21 This raised the stakes. Sparta would not want

to acquire a reputation for weakness or be weakened in practice by the loss of substantial allies. This was what created the crisis for Sparta. To be sure, Corinth portrayed Athens as grasping with limitless hegemonic ambitions. But to the

extent Sparta took note of Corinth, it was not because such fears were shared but because of concern about the defection of a key ally. Indeed the “war party”

in Sparta was somewhat dismissive of Athenian power. King Archidamus was

much warier, and more anxious to keep the peace, but his advice was ignored

and in August 432 BCE, the Spartan assembly voted for war.

Yet even after voting for war, Sparta still sent diplomatic missions to

Athens, and these almost resulted in a compromise. In the end it came down

to the Megarian Decree. Notably, the emissaries did not push the cause of

Corinth but identifi ed the Decree as an unambiguous violation of the Thirty

Years’ Peace. Thucydides records that many speakers came forward with dif-

ferent views, some favoring war and others revoking the Decree for the sake

of peace. [^22] This time he reported Pericles’s decisive intervention in detail, which focused on Sparta’s rejection of arbitration. He accused it of relying

on coercion rather than discussion. Such demands demonstrated a refusal to

treat Athens as equal. He used an argument still often heard when warning

of a larger ambition behind an opponent’s apparently modest and reason-

able demand. This was not a “trifl e,” Pericles insisted: “If you yield to them you will immediately be required to make another concession which will be

greater, since you will have made the fi rst concession out of fear.” 23]] Even then, there was restraint in his strategy. It put the onus on Sparta to strike the fi rst blow and refuse arbitration.

t h e g r e e k s

33

In the most extreme version, Thucydides’s proposition about the inevitability of war does not stand up. There were a number of points where

alternative views might have prevailed and made possible an alternative

history. As Richard Ned Lebow has argued, far from being inevitable,

war was “the result of an improbable series of remarkably bad judgments

made by the leaders of the several powers involved.”

]]

[^24]:  These started

with the lesser powers whose rivalries and entanglements drew in Sparta

and Athens. The Athenians might have rejected Corcyra’s bid for alli-

ance; Sparta might have rejected Corinth’s urgings to take a strong stand;

Athens might have abandoned the Megarian Decree; Sparta might have

agreed to arbitration.

Yet there were structural factors at play here. The relationship between

the two alliances was unstable. There was suffi cient residual distrust to create space for those lesser powers who wanted to pursue their own interests.

Athens and Sparta had managed to make the Thirty Years’ Peace work because

there were leaders on both sides who were prepared to moderate any urges to

action and aggrandizement in order to keep the peace, but each side also had

hawkish factions that disliked moderation and made the case for war. Just as

the Corinthians told the Spartans that Athens was inherently aggressive, so

the Corcyreans told Athens that they should be welcomed as allies because

of the strength of their combined navies. This would be needed when war

came, for Sparta and its allies were “eager for war out of fear of you, and . . . the Corinthians have great infl uence with them and are your enemies.” 25]] Thus decision-making was unsettled by the developing fl uidity in allegiances.

Athens saw a choice between alliance with Corcyra or seeing its navy being

taken by the Peloponnesians; Sparta saw a choice between backing Corinth’s

ambitions or risking its defection.

The leadership in both camps, however, was the same that had preserved

the peace in the past. Now their ability to follow conciliatory, restrained

strategies was circumscribed. Instead they tried to mitigate the effects of

the harder line by presenting it in its most restrained version. Thus Pericles accepted an alliance with Corcyra but insisted it should be defensive, which

was a novel concept intended to fi nd the least provocative way forward short of rebuttal. When ships were dispatched to affi rm this new alliance, it was

only a small squadron, insuffi cient to embolden Corcyra to go on the offen-

sive but also unfortunately insuffi cient to deter Corinth, so in the end Athens ended up with a more forward commitment than intended. When Sparta

wanted to fi nd a diplomatic alternative to the war it had already decided

upon in principle, it did not push hard on behalf of Corinth but concentrated 34

o r i g i n s

on what might have seemed to be a minor issue, the Megarian Decree. By then the room for maneuver on both sides was narrowing. Pericles saw danger in backing down in the face of any direct Spartan demand, but he prom-

ised to accept the verdict of arbitration.

The strategy Pericles then followed for the war also contained elements of

restraint. It made sense if it was supposed that there was still a peace party in Sparta whose hand would be strengthened once it could be shown that the

war party had embarked on a futile course. It also refl ected another asym-

metry between the two leagues. The Peloponnesian League was largely con-

tinental, while Athens—although itself on the mainland—presided over a

largely maritime empire. Aware of the strength of the Spartan army, Pericles

sought to avoid a land battle and rely instead on Athens’s superior naval

strength. Pericles did not see the possibility of infl icting a decisive blow against Sparta, so instead he sought a stalemate. His calculation was that

Athens had the reserves to outlast Sparta even if the war dragged on for a

number of years. In the language of later centuries, he sought victory through enemy exhaustion rather than annihilation.

Politically this strategy was brave in its restraint, but it represented an

enormous gamble, and probably only someone with the prestige of Pericles

could have carried the day with this proposition. The gamble did not come

off. There were annual Spartan attacks on Attica—a source of produce near

Athens—to which no response was made other than to send raiding par-

ties around the Peloponnesus. The regular loss of crops from Attica drained

the treasury’s ability to import essential produce from elsewhere. It also

left Athens looking helpless in the face of Spartan aggression. Then came a

calamity. A plague in 430 BCE, aggravated by the overcrowding in Athens

caused by displaced Atticans, resulted in immense distress. For once Pericles lacked good arguments. Eventually he was removed from offi ce and peace

was offered to Sparta. Sparta insisted on draconian terms, effectively ask-

ing Athens to abandon its empire, which completely undermined the peace

party. Pericles returned as leader, but in 429 BCE he was struck by the plague (which almost killed Thucydides) and died. His efforts to fi nd a course

between excessive aggression and appeasement had led him to seek a combi-

nation of fi rmness and restraint. In the end, this increased rather than eased the risks to Athens. The strategy had a limited coercive effect on Sparta, was excessively costly to Athens, and encouraged the colonies to become rebellious. After Pericles died, Athens adopted a more aggressive strategy. This

reaped some rewards, and even peace terms from Sparta, but it was then the

Athenians’ turn to overextend themselves.

_Language and Trickery_

Thucydides admired Pericles because of his ability to manage the Athenian

political system by using his authority and eloquence to appeal to reason and persuade the crowd to adopt sensible policies rather than pandering to the

demagoguery and mass irrationality that was an ever-present possibility in a

democracy—and to which Athens succumbed after he died. 26

Athenian democracy required that all the city’s key decisions follow

intense public deliberations. Strategy could not stay implicit but had to be

articulated. It was essential not only to have the foresight to see how events might unfold if the right action was taken but also the ability to convince

others that this was so. Assembly and courtroom debates involved opposing

speeches—antilogies—that put a premium on the ability to develop strong

arguments. There was an interest in the development and application of the

persuasive arts. [^27] Gorgias, who arrived in Athens during the early stages of the Peloponnesian War (427 BCE) and lived to a great age, offered displays

of rhetorical virtuosity. He showed how it was possible to make a weak argu-

ment stronger through careful construction, and taught his art to willing

pupils. He saw words as equivalent to physical force. They could cause pain

and joy: “Some strike fear, some stir the audience to boldness, some benumb

and bewitch the soul with evil persuasion.” One of his surviving discourses

demonstrated why Helen could be excused for triggering the Trojan War by

running off with Paris. Protagoras, another infl uential fi gure, was notable for his explorations into the proper use of language. He somewhat uniquely

described himself as a sophist (from _sophistes_ , meaning “wise man”), a term that became signifi cant retrospectively when Plato used it to defi ne a whole group of thinkers. There was a market for a specialist education in public

discourse. Litigants could learn how to plead effectively; candidates for offi ce

could broaden their appeal; active politicians could be more persuasive. 28

Pericles enjoyed the company of the intellectuals, including Protagoras.

He dismissed the idea that there was distinction to be made between men

of action and those of words: “We are lovers of wisdom without sacrifi cing

manly courage.” Persuasion required compelling words: those with knowl-

edge but not the “power clearly to express it” might as well have had no ideas at all. He presented himself to the people of Athens as “one who has at least as much ability as anyone else to see what ought to be done and explain what

he sees.” The importance of the persuasive arts explains why speeches and

dialogues were so important in Thucydides’s account. This is how Pericles

presented strategic arguments, probably described by Thucydides with more

coherence than they had in reality.

36

o r i g i n s

Pericles’s success lay in his authority and ability to convince the people to follow strategies developed with care and foresight. He sought to control

events through the application and expression of intellect. As Parry put

it, the creativity of his speeches lay in his ability to describe a future that could be achieved if his advice was followed. This concept of the future was

drawn from existing reality but moved beyond it. Its plausibility derived

from its practicability but also its “discernment of the strongest and most

lasting forces in the outside world.” Pericles then needed to ensure that

events conformed to this vision. He therefore had to be much more than a

persuasive orator. His speeches were strategic scripts, offering a satisfactory way forward that refl ected his grasp of what might be possible in the light

of the forces at work in the world. More than most, he could make reality

correspond with his vision by setting out ways of acting that the Athenians

could follow successfully. But it always also depended on how foes acted

as well as factors of chance. In the end, the integrity of the script could be undermined by events. The deeper meaning of Thucydides’s account was

tragic, because it revealed the limits of strategic reasoning in the face of a contrary world:

But actuality in the end proves unmanageable. It breaks in upon

men’s conceptions, changes them, and fi nally destroys them. Even

where men’s conceptions are sound and reasonable, where by their own

creative power and their discernment of actuality they _correspond_ to things, actuality in its capacity as Luck, will behave in an _unreasonable_ way, as Pericles says, and overturn conceptions of the greatest nobility

and intelligence.

For Pericles it was the plague in its terrible suddenness, symbolizing “the

destructive and incalculable power of actuality,” that undermined his vision

and denied the control he sought over the historical process. Once he could not convince the Athenian people, he was undone. The tragedy for Thucydides,

in offering Pericles as his hero, was that he could not accept an alternative approach. Words as action, analyzing reality and showing how it could be

Sun Tzu and Machiavelli

_All warfare is based on deception._

—Sun Tzu

The most powerful dichotomy in all strategic thought was the one

fi rst introduced by Homer as the distinction between bi ē and m ē tis,

one seeking victory in the physical domain and the other in the mental, one

relying on being strong and the other on being smart, one depending on

courage and the other imagination, one facing the enemy directly and the

other approaching indirectly, one prepared to fall with honor and the other

seeking to survive with deception. Under the Romans the pendulum swung

away from m ē tis and toward bi ē . Homer’s Odysseus morphed into Virgil’s

Ulysses and became part of a story of deceitful and treacherous Greeks. Even

the Athenians, as they found themselves on the losing side in their war with

Sparta, began to have some sympathy for the Trojans and saw Odysseus’s cruel

trick in a new light. Heroes were sought who were more plain-speaking, hon-

orable as well as brave in battle, less reliant on cunning and cleverness.

Thus the Roman historian Livy wrote of the more traditionally minded

Senators’ distaste for a tendency toward “an excessively cunning wisdom.”

This was akin to “Punic tricks and Greek craftiness, among whom it was

more glorious to deceive an enemy than to conquer by force.” Romans would

not wage war “through ambushes and nocturnal battles, nor through feigned

fl ight and unforeseen returns upon a careless enemy.” On occasion there

might be “more profi t in trick than courage.” The spirit of an enemy, however, could only be truly suppressed by “open hand-to-hand combat in a just

and righteous war,” rather than by “craft or accident.” [^1]

Despite this stance, the attraction of trickery remained strong. Valerius

Maximus, writing not long after at the time of Tiberius, described strata-

gems positively and offered the fi rst formal defi nition. “Truly that aspect of cunning is illustrious and far removed from all reproach, whose deeds

are called by the Greek expression _strategemata_ , because they can scarcely be suitably expressed by a (single Latin) term.” The examples he gave were a

_salubre mendacium_ (“a healthy mentality”) to lift morale (effectively persuading one part of your force to attack on the grounds—not necessarily true—

that another part was advancing effectively); a false refugee (such as Sinon) who corrupts the enemy from within; a psychological ploy of the besieged

to demoralize their besiegers; deceiving one enemy army of your presence,

while striking another of their armies with double strength; maneuvers to

confuse the enemy, followed by a surprise attack; and besieging the foe’s city when he makes an attempt against yours. All this captured the basic psychological aspect of deception: unsettling the enemy or at least reassuring your own side. A stratagem would permit more to be accomplished than by arms

alone. [^2]

In _Strategemata_

, composed by the Roman Senator Frontinus between

84 and 88, the traditions of Roman warfare were passed on. The book was

widely disseminated and retained a long infl uence, including Machiavelli for example. Frontinus made a distinction, possibly of his own invention, in the

introduction. “If there prove to be any persons who take an interest in these books,” he asked, “let them remember to discriminate between ‘strategy’

and ‘stratagems,’ which are by nature extremely similar.” Strategy or strate-

gika referred to “everything achieved by a commander, be it characterized by

foresight, advantage, enterprise, or resolution.” Stratagems, or strategemata, the subject of the book, rested “on skill and cleverness.” They were “effective

quite as much when the enemy is to be evaded as when he is to be crushed.” 3

Frontinus’s stratagems certainly included elements of trickery and decep-

tion, but they also included more practical matters and efforts to sustain the morale of troops. So stratagems were a subset of strategy. Frontinus did write a general treatise on military matters, but this unfortunately was lost.

In other cultures, stratagems and cunning were considered much more

appealing—especially to get out of a tight spot—and commended as essen-

tial features of an effective strategy. Lisa Raphals, picking up on Detienne

and Vernant’s discussion of m ē tis, made the comparison with the Chinese

term _zhi_ . This had a wide variety of meanings from wisdom, knowledge, and s u n t z u a n d m a c h i a v e l l i

43

intelligence to skill, craft, cleverness, or cunning. The individual who demonstrated _zhi_ appeared as a sage general, whose mastery of the art of deception allowed him to prevail over an opponent of stronger physical force, just like those with m ē tis. [^4] Winning against a weak opponent required nothing special. Real skill was shown by getting into positions that did not allow for defeat and would ensure victory over enemies. Deception was crucial: conveying confusion when there was order, cowardice instead of courage, weak-

ness instead of strength. It also required the ability to determine when the

enemy was attempting to deceive. Spies, for example, could help understand

enemy dispositions and then judge when to be crafty or straightforward,

when to maneuver and when to attack directly, when to commit and when

to stay fl exible.

_Sun Tzu_

The enduring model of the sage warrior was Sun Tzu, as represented by the

short book on strategy known as _The Art of War_ . Little is known about the author, or even if there was a single author. According to tradition, he was

a general who served the king of Wu in Eastern China around 500 BCE,

toward the end of China’s Spring and Autumn period, although no contem-

porary references to him have been found. _The Art of War_ seems to have been written or at least compiled over the subsequent century during the Warring

States period. The context was a competition for infl uence among a set of

individually weak kingdoms at a time when central authority in China had

collapsed. Over time the text acquired important commentaries which added

to its signifi cance. There are other Chinese military classics from this period, but Sun Tzu remains the best known.

Sun Tzu’s infl uence lies in the underlying approach to strategy. Infl uenced by Taoist philosophy, _The Art of War_ covers statecraft as well as war. As with any ancient text, the language could seem quaint and the references

obscure but the underlying theme was clear enough. Supreme excellence

in war was not found in winning “one hundred victories in one hundred

battles.” Rather, it was better “to subdue the enemy without fi ghting.” The

great strategist had to be a master of deception, using force where it was

most effective: “Avoid what is strong to strike what is weak.” [^5] Defeating the enemy’s strategy (or “balk the enemy’s plans”) was the “highest form of

generalship.” Next came preventing “the junction of the enemy’s forces,”

followed by attacking “the enemy’s army in the fi eld,” and—worst of all—

besieging walled cities.

44

o r i g i n s

In Sun Tzu’s formulaic aphorisms, the key to deception was simply a matter of doing the opposite of what was expected—look incapacitated

when capable, passive when active, near when far, far when near. This

required good order and discipline. Simulating cowardice, for example,

required courage. It also required an understanding of the opponent. If the

enemy general was “choleric,” then he could be easily upset; if “obstinate

and prone to anger,” insults could enrage him and cause him to be impetu-

ous; if arrogant, he could be lulled into a false sense of superiority and a

lowered guard. A dangerous commander, according to Sun Tzu, would be

reckless, cowardly, quick-tempered, too concerned with reputation, and too

compassionate.

What really made the difference was “foreknowledge.” This could not be

“elicited from spirits, nor from gods, nor by analogy with past events, nor

from calculations. It must be obtained from men who know the enemy situ-

ation” and could acquire information about dispositions, the character of the troops, and the identity of the generals. The enemy’s political relationships could also be a target. “Sometimes drive a wedge between a sovereign and his

ministers; on other occasions separate his allies from him. Make them mutu-

ally suspicious so that they drift apart. Then you can plot against them.”

For East Asian generals, Sun Tzu became a standard text. He was an evi-

dent infl uence in the writings of the Chinese communist leader Mao Zedong.

Napoleon was said to have studied a French Jesuit’s translation of _The Art of_ _War_ . Though not available in English until the early twentieth century, it came to be taken increasingly seriously as a source of military and—during

the 1980s—even business wisdom. The book’s approach was most relevant

for those facing complex struggles, in which encounters were expected to be

indecisive and alliances and enmities were shifting.

_The Art of War_ did not provide a single route to victory and recognized that while battles were best avoided they sometimes had to be fought. Sun

Tzu described relatively simple confl icts, in which bold moves left an enemy helpless or dissolving into disorder. A possible weakness, in a “strong tendency to point out what one should strive for, rather than explain how one

should achieve one’s aim,” was also a source of strength. Any such explana-

tions would now seem arcane and overtaken by massive changes in military

methodology; if Sun Tzu had offered detailed advice on tactics, the book

would now tend to be passed over. Instead, students of Sun Tzu are “merely

given specifi c pointers as to what to ponder, but the solution, or the way one chooses to tread, must be one’s own.” [^6]

His approach worked best when followed by only one side: if both com-

manders were reading Sun Tzu, the maneuvers and deceptions could lead

s u n t z u a n d m a c h i a v e l l i

45

to no decision at all or else an unexpected collision that caught them both unaware. A reputation for deception would lead to a lot of double-guessing,

just as one for avoiding battle could turn into a presumption of weakness.

In the face of a strong and coherent adversary, clever mind games could take

you only so far. If both sides were doing everything possible to avoid a frontal confrontation, then the victor would be the one who could avoid commitment the longest, eventually reaching a point where the enemy had nowhere

else to go and so had to fi ght at a disadvantage or surrender. There was, at any rate, only a limited amount of mystery and subtlety that a leader could

cultivate without confusing those being led as much as the opponent. In the

end, the point about Sun Tzu was not that he offered a winning formula for

all situations but that he offered an ideal type of a particular sort of strategy, based on outsmarting the opponent rather than overwhelming him with

brute force.

François Jullien developed an intriguing line of thought by demonstrat-

ing the similarities between the Chinese approach to war, as exemplifi ed by

Sun Tzu, and the Chinese use of language. He argued that the disinclination

to engage in high-risk, potentially destructive direct confrontations in war

was also followed in rhetorical confl icts, which were similarly indirect and implicit. Circuitous, subtle forms of expression, both allusive and elusive,

could be the equivalents of armies dodging and harrying. By refusing to

be pinned down or make an argument with suffi cient clarity to be refuted,

the initiative could be kept—although this could make for potentially infi -

nite “games of manipulation.” [^7] Following an indirect approach to discourse would raise the same problems as with battle: when both sides were using

identical ploys the contest could be indefi nite and it would be hard to reach any sort of closure.

Jullien offered a contrast with the Athenians. They saw the advantages in

decisive action that brought both war and argument to a quick close, thereby

avoiding the expense and frustrations of prolonged confrontation. Warfare

was direct and battle based, with troops organized into phalanxes to ensure

maximum impact against the enemy, and victory coming to those with the

requisite strength and courage. The generals were capable of deception and

understood the advantages of surprise, but they did not want to waste time

in games of dodging and harassment. In the same way, the Athenians were

straightforward in argument. Whether in the theater, the tribunal, or the

assembly, orators would make their cases directly and transparently, with

points open to refutation, within a limited time period. There could there-

fore be decisive arguments as there were decisive battles. In these battles

of persuasion in which—as Thucydides put it—arguments were “hurled

46

o r i g i n s

forcefully against each other,” the decision would come from a third party such as a jury or the electorate.

This was an appealing contrast, and it may be that the approach to battles

of persuasion refl ected broad and enduring cultural preferences that affected attitudes to any confrontation. The suggestion, however, of a strong Greek

preference for “decisive” battle came from Victor David Hanson’s contro-

versial argument that the terms for a continuing Western way of war were

set in classical times. 8 Critics have challenged this theory on the basis of the

analysis of Greek warfare and the subsequent history. 9]] Beatrice Heuser has demonstrated emphatically that at least one strong strand in Western military thought up to the Napoleonic wars was to avoid pitched battles: “Few

believed either in the inevitability or the unconditional desirability of bat-

tle.” 10]] Quintus Fabius Maximus, who gave his name to the “Fabian strategy,”

was initially derided as the “delayer” because of what seemed to be a cowardly strategy in the face of the pillaging advance of Hannibal’s Carthaginian army.

But after the Roman defeat at Cannae in 17 BCE, the wisdom of the approach

was acknowledged. For some thirteen years thereafter, the Romans avoided

pitched battles, while harassing Hannibal’s supply lines, until he fi nally gave up and left Italy.

The Roman treatise on warfare best known through the Middle Ages,

when the vital lessons were all still believed to be contained in classical texts, was the _De Re Militari_ of Vegetus. Because similar constraints of resources, transport, and geography were faced during the Middle Ages, the key issues

were logistical and an offensive army unable to forage and pillage would get

into trouble. The relevant line from the _De Re Militari_ stated that battle was the “last extremity” and should only be followed when all other plans had

been considered and expedients tried. Where the odds were too great, bat-

tle should be declined. Better to employ “stratagem and fi nesse” to destroy

the enemy as much as possible in detail and then intimidate them. Vegetus

expressed, in terms similar to Sun Tzu, a preference for starving enemies

into submission rather than fi ghting them (“famine is more terrible than the sword”), and spoke of how it “is better to beat the enemy through want, surprises, and care for diffi cult places (i.e., through maneuver) than by a battle in the open fi eld.” 11 There has been a debate on whether medieval warfare was]]

really so battle averse. Clifford Rogers argued that commanders were more

prepared to seek battle—at least when on the offensive—but he was far from

insisting that the decisive battle was the dominant mode of warfare. [^12]

The Byzantine emperor Maurice’s _Strategikon_ had a similar take at the start of the seventh century: “[I] t is well to hurt the enemy by deceit, by raids or by hunger, and never be enticed to a pitched battle, which is a demonstration s u n t z u a n d m a c h i a v e l l i

47

more of luck than of bravery.” To indicate that there was another view, Heuser quoted Henri, duke of Rohan, writing during the Thirty Years’ War that “of

all actions of war the most glorious and the most important is to give battle,”

and regretting that wars were then “made more in the fashion of the fox than

of the lion, and . . . based more on sieges than on combat.” But Heuser then

noted that he saw no combat and that those who had experience of war were

much more cautious. Maurice de Saxe, who led the French forces in the early

eighteenth century, saw pitched battles as best avoided:

Nothing so reduces the enemy to absurdity as this method: nothing

advances affairs better. Frequent small engagements will dissipate the

enemy until he is forced to hide from you. 13

Using armies for occasional raiding, assaulting the economic life of the

enemy, and threatening and demoralizing the enemy’s population provided

an alternative form of coercion to battle. Most importantly, when account-

ing for success—for example, with regard to the Hundred Years’ War—

“political elements were always more signifi cant than military ones,” even

with talented strategists in command and after victory in pitched battle. 14

The English made the most of their local allies in France just as the French

sought to encourage the Scots to distract the English at home.

As the retrospective label “Hundred Years’ War” indicates, confl icts might

move through distinctive stages but lack decisiveness because the underlying

disputes were never fully resolved. In this respect, the role of battle was quite different at this time from how it later became understood. Commenting on

the strategic considerations behind one of the most famous battles of this

war, when the English under Henry V beat the French at Agincourt in 1415,

Jan Willem Honig urged that battle be viewed in terms of the complex con-

ventions of the time, in which sieges, hostages, political demands, and even

massacres all had their allotted place. Both sides moved warily toward battle, appearing to both seek and fear it at the same time, and worked their way

through an elaborate script, before the two armies confronted each other for

the vital encounter. Behind all of this, argued Honig, was the “metaphysical

mystique” surrounding battle, for it refl ected a view of war as litigation with God as the judge and battle as decisive as a divine judgment. It came when all other forms of dispute settlement had been exhausted.

The result was a competition in risk which was tempered by the mutu-

ally shared fear of appealing to God, the ultimate judge. This fear, and

the doubt that any good medieval Christian had regarding the justice

of his cause and the strength of his faith, produced an incentive to

48

o r i g i n s

develop and adhere to a set of conventions which kept the armed interaction between opponents within certain bounds.

This meant that warfare could follow relatively predictable paths, and face-

saving ways of avoiding battle were available. There was still uncertainty

over whether the opponent would follow the rules or offer a self-serving

interpretation, but shared norms nonetheless infl uenced confl ict and strat-

egy. 15 Despite its dangers, battle had a special role as an occasional means of]]

resolving disputes by reference to chance. It was a form of contract, a way of agreeing on who had won and what victory meant. It required accepting that

since a peaceful settlement was unavailable, this was how a dispute was best

resolved. Battle was a “chance of arms,” a form of consensual violence out of which would emerge a victor. The battles were limited in time and space,

fought on a defi ned fi eld within a single day (tension at dawn, exhaustion by dusk). Within those confi nes they would be bloody and vicious, but at least

they might produce a conclusion without spilling over into the rest of the

country. The minimum required to declare victory was to hold the fi eld of

battle at the end of the day, as the enemy fl ed. A battle could only be decisive if both sides agreed who had won and the practical value of victory. This was not the self-restraint derived from either aristocratic codes of chivalry or a concept of limited strategy but a function of law. Battle was considered an

enforceable wager. It was precisely because so much could be at stake and fortune could play such a large part that it was approached with such caution. 16]]

_Machiavelli_

I’ll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;

I’ll slay more gazers than the basilisk;

I’ll play the orator as well as Nestor,

Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,

And, like a Sinon, take another Troy.

I can add colors to the chameleon,

Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,

And set the murderous Machiavel to school. 17

Whether rules for acceptable behavior were always followed strictly, they

certainly shaped the discourse of the time. This helps explain the dramatic

impact of Niccolo Machiavelli’s sharp explanations for political behavior based s u n t z u a n d m a c h i a v e l l i

49

on the self-interest of rulers. He went beyond tolerance for ruses and subterfuge in war to the heart of the conduct of all the affairs of state. He came to be placed on the line of cunning and thus untrustworthy operators that began

with Odysseus. It was not long before “Machiavellian” came to describe any-

one with a talent for manipulation and an inclination to deceit in the pursuit of personal gain, fascinated with power for its own sake rather than with the virtuous and noble things power allows one to do. Machiavelli’s amorality

was denounced by the Church, so that the “Machiavel,” the embodiment of

this theory, could be presented as almost an instrument of the devil (Niccolo fi tting neatly the pre-existing Satanic moniker of “old Nick”). In the Duke

of Gloucester (later Richard III), whose words are quoted above, Shakespeare

identifi ed a man who epitomized the worst defects of such a character.

Niccolo Machiavelli himself was a Florentine bureaucrat, diplomat, polit-

ical adviser, and practical philosopher. His most famous book, _The Prince_ , was written as a handbook for rulers and asserted Machiavelli’s own qualifi cations to serve as an adviser at a time of great turbulence and danger in Italian affairs. There was urgency in his prose that refl ected the desperation of his times and a fear of the political consequences of weakness for Florence in particular and Italy in general in the face of French and Spanish strength.

For the same reason, Machiavelli also wrote intelligently and persuasively

on military affairs. He sought a more enduring form of military capability,

based on conscription, that could provide a more reliable base from which to

defend the state and extend its power. Unfortunately, the Florentine militia

he helped establish was defeated in battle with the Spanish at Prato in 1512.

As with Thucydides, Machiavelli’s exclusion from actual power gave him the

time to write about how power might be exercised by others.

It also gave him a detached perspective, adding to his sense of the dif-

ference between the ideal world, in which the truly noble would always be

rewarded for their virtue, and the less uplifting reality. Machiavelli’s method was empirical, which is why he is considered the father of political science.

He did not consider himself to be offering a new morality but rather a refl ection on contemporary practical morality. Political survival depended on

an unsentimental realism rather than the pursuit of an illusory ideal. This

meant paying attention to confl icts of interests and their potential resolu-

tion by either force or trickery. But guile and cunning could not create their own political legacy: the foundation of states still lay in good laws and good armies.

Machiavelli’s interest in political methodology refl ected the same chal-

lenge that stimulated most strategists, including Sun Tzu: how to cope with

the potentially greater strength of others. Machiavelli did not exaggerate the 50

o r i g i n s

scope of strategy. There would always be risks. It was therefore not always possible to identify a safe course. Anticipating the “minimax” outcome in

twentieth-century game theory, he observed that: “In the nature of things

you can never try to escape one danger without encountering another; but

prudence consists in knowing how to recognize the nature of the differ-

ent dangers and in accepting the least bad as good.” 18]] What could be done depended on circumstances. “[F] ortune governs one half of our actions, but

even so she leaves the half more or less in our power to control.” Even in this area of apparent control, it would be necessary to adapt to circumstances. Free will suggested the possibility of fi tting events to an established character; Machiavelli suggested that the character would be shaped by events.

Machiavelli’s _Art of War_ was the only book published during his lifetime. This might have been the inspiration for the title given to Sun Tzu’s

work. Indeed, almost all disquisition on the subject—from that of Raimondo

Montecuccoli in the seventeenth century to Maurice de Saxe in the eigh-

teenth to Baron de Jomini in the nineteenth—was called _The Art of War_ . This was a generic title, often covering largely technical matters. Machiavelli’s

contribution to the genre was extremely successful and was translated into

many languages. He addressed the potential value of a standing army and

how one could be properly formed to serve the true interests of the state. He struggled with the practical issues of the day, from fortresses to the advent of gunpowder. Because the book took the form of a conversation between

individuals debating the key issues, and it cannot be assumed that one always represented Machiavelli’s thoughts, exactly where he stood on some issues

remained ambiguous. But the broad thrust of his concerns was evident,

particularly the importance of a competent and loyal army in providing for

security and creating diplomatic freedom to maneuver. He understood the

relationship of war to politics and the importance of making sure an enemy

was clearly defeated even after it left the fi eld of battle, so there was no chance to regroup. He understood that battle might be a place where Fortuna had

a large hand and for that reason was wary of leaving her too much of a role.

Hence the need to engage all forces in battle rather than make a limited com-

mitment. Not surprisingly, he also showed regard for deception, trickery, and espionage, the advantages that could come through being better informed

than the enemy, and an occasionally stated preference for winning without

battle if possible.

The most interesting aspects of his work, however, were less about deal-

ing with an external enemy and more about sustaining loyalty and com-

mitment internally. This concern was refl ected in his preference for a local militia rather than professional soldiers motivated only by money. He was

s u n t z u a n d m a c h i a v e l l i

51

unsure about appeals to patriotism and more confi dent in tough discipline, including practical measures to make sure that deserters could not take their possessions with them. “To persuade or dissuade a few of a thing is very easy.

For if words are not enough, you can use authority or force.” Convincing the

multitude was more diffi cult: they had to be persuaded en masse. Because

of this, “excellent captains need to be orators.” Speaking to the army “takes away fear, infl ames spirits, increases obstinacy, uncovers deceptions, promises rewards, shows dangers and the way to fl ee them, fi lls with hope, praises,

vituperates, and does all those things by which the human passion are extin-

guished or infl amed.” 19]] The sort of orations that might make men want to fi ght would encourage indignation and contempt toward enemies and make

the soldiers ashamed of their sloth and cowardice.

In _The Prince_ , Machiavelli offered notoriously cynical advice on how to gain and hold on to power, by being ready to indulge in all manner of private dealings while appearing publicly beyond reproach. The underlying message

was that if you sought to be virtuous in both word and deed you would suffer

badly. Survival must be the highest objective; otherwise nothing could be

achieved. This required the prince to vary his conduct according to changing

circumstance, including a readiness to act immorally whenever necessary. In

one of his most famous passages, Machiavelli posed the question

whether it be better to be loved than feared, or the reverse? The answer

is that one would like to be both the one and the other: but because

it is diffi cult to combine, it is far better to be feared than loved if you

cannot be both. One can make this generalization about men: they are

ungrateful, fi ckle, liars and deceivers, they shun danger and are greedy

for profi t; while you treat them well, they are yours. They would shed

their blood for you, risk their property, their lives, their children, so

long, as I said above, as danger is remote; but when you are in danger

they turn against you. 20

This negative view of human nature was central to Machiavelli’s approach. At

one point he contrasted the lessons to be learned from the lion and the fox,

the fi rst representing strength and the second cunning. One needed to be a

fox “in order to recognize traps, and a lion to frighten off wolves.” As “men are wretched creatures who could not keep their word to you, you need not

keep your word to them.” It was, however, no good to be caught in displays

of bad faith. That was why it was useful to be a fox: “One must know how to

color one’s actions and to be a great liar and deceiver. Men are so simple, and so much creatures of circumstance, that the deceiver will always fi nd somebody ready to be deceived.” As much as possible it was best for the prince to 52

o r i g i n s

appear to be “compassionate, faithful to his word, guileless, and devout,” and even to act that way so long as it was prudent to do so. It could be helpful to be seen to be harsh, for that helped maintain order, but not to be considered entirely without virtue. “Everyone sees what you appear to be, few experience what you really are . . . The common people are always impressed by

appearances and results.” 21]] A capacity to mislead—and on a large scale—was an essential attribute. At some point the appearance of virtue could not be

wholly detached from practice. Machiavelli understood that to hold on to

power it was necessary to reduce the reliance on harsh, cruel methods and to

behave in more moderate, graceful ways.

Princes, he warned, should avoid being hated and despised. He was not

against the use of cruelty but thought it should only be employed when essen-

tial and then “once and for all” so that it was possible to turn to “the good of one’s subjects.” He advised strongly against the sort of cruelty “which,

although infrequent to start with, as time goes on, rather than disappearing, becomes more evident.” This was based on his assessment of human psychology. If the prince got his harsh behavior over right at the start, and then

refrained from repetition, “he will be able to set men’s minds at rest and win them over to him when he confers benefi ts.” Otherwise, the prince “is always forced to have the knife ready in his hand and he can never depend on his

subjects because they, suffering fresh and continuous violence, can never feel secure with regard to him.” Though violence should be infl icted once and for all, for “people will then forget what it tastes like and so be less resentful,”

benefi ts by contrast should be conferred gradually because “they will taste

better.” [^22] Machiavelli understood that even if power was obtained by force and guile and consolidated with cruelty, it required consent to be secured.

The best power was that which had to be exercised least.

Although _Machiavellian_ has become synonymous with strategies based on deceit and manipulation, Machiavelli’s approach was actually far more

balanced. He understood that the more the prince was perceived to rely on

devious methods, the less likely it would be that they succeeded. The wise

strategist would seek to develop a foundation for the exercise of power that

went beyond false impressions and harsh punishments, but on real accom-

plishments and general respect.

Satan’s Strategy

_The will is a beast of burden. If God mounts it, it wishes and goes as_

_God wills; if Satan mounts it, it wishes and goes as Satan wills. Nor_

_can it choose its rider . . . the riders contend for its possession._

—Martin Luther

Machiavelli’s influence on subsequent political thought was pro-

found. His candid appreciation of the realities of power provided new

ways to talk about politics, whether offered as guidance to those prepared

to be fl exible and adaptable—as he advocated—or taken to the extremes

personifi ed in the sinister and amoral stage villain Machiavel. One striking illustration of his infl uence on discussions of political conduct is found in the writings of John Milton. In his epic poem _Paradise Lost_ , published in 1667, Milton’s Satan is the embodiment of Machiavellianism. Evaluating Satan’s

strategy allows us to consider the limits and possibilities of the attributes associated with Machiavelli, as well as the continuing constraints imposed on strategic freedom by the presence of God.

Milton’s core project was to address the most perplexing of theological

issues about free will as fi rst introduced by the story of Adam and Eve. If

everything was preordained, Adam and Eve had no choice in the matter.

Their original sin was not their fault. If it was their fault, God still needed to have some reason to allow it to happen. If the choice was between good

and evil, then God must have created evil. If human beings could be tempted in this way, then they must have been created imperfect. Yet if this was a

consequence of the original design, did they deserve to be punished? If there was no fl aw, then how were they able to sin, and from where did they fi nd a concept of sin? How could there be two falls, as Eve was the only one actually tempted by the serpent before she went on to persuade Adam. What was the

serpent’s motive?

In _Paradise Lost_ , John Milton tried to make sense of all of this. At one level, his story was about a rebellion within a kingdom, the defeat of the

rebels, and the consequences of the rebels’ attempts to reverse their defeat.

At another level, it was—as Milton put it in his introduction—about how

to “justify the ways of God to man,” particularly how to reconcile God’s

omnipotence with man’s free will. And at yet another level, it was about

earthly relationships between kings and men. Milton wrote during the resto-

ration of the monarchy following a civil war in which he had been a devoted

republican. It was a time of suppression of dissenters; at one point, Milton

himself was close to being executed for treason.

The concept of free will raises questions about God’s role in human affairs.

If God does not intervene, then what is the purpose of prayer and repen-

tance? If he does intervene, then why do bad things happen to good people?

Contemporary theologians may have come up with formulations to answer

these questions, but in seventeenth-century Europe when Milton was writ-

ing, they were hot topics—politically as well as religiously.

The century began under the infl uence of a rigorous Calvinism preaching

a God of such power that little could be done to thwart his will. Divine grace had been allocated in advance. Everything was set in motion by the original

grand design. “God orders and ordains all things,” observed Augustine of

Hippo. He worked in the “hearts of men to incline their wills withersoever

He wills.” He “freely and unchangeably ordained whatsoever comes to pass,”

echoed the Calvinists. Nothing could happen that refl ected any will other

than his. Humankind was just playing out a drama according to a script set

down by God at the moment of creation, with no later need for improvisa-

tion. It was beyond the comprehension of mere men. This view went even

beyond omnipotence, which merely presumed that God could intervene in

human society if and when he wished to do so, and assumed that history was

set on an unalterable course. If all events were predetermined, and choice

was merely an illusion, then the only response was fatalism. Any attempt to

change the course of history was pointless.

Against the Calvinists, the followers of Jacobus Arminius argued that

humans are able to make their own histories through the exercise of free will s a t a n ’ s s t r a t e g y

55

and that God’s strength was manifest in acts of love in response to humans’

obedience and repentance for their sins. The God of the Calvinists was arbi-

trary and beyond explanation. The God of the Arminians would allow no

arbitrary exclusion from his grace and insisted on the human ability to dis-

tinguish good from evil, in order to demonstrate their obedience to God.

By the time of _Paradise Lost_ , and after an early Calvinism, Milton was with the Arminians. His view was that “God made no absolute decrees about

anything which he left in the power of men, for men have freedom of action.”

To hold the opposite position would be absurd and unfair. If God turned

“man to moral good or evil just as he likes, and then rewards the good and

punishes the wicked, it will cause an outcry against divine justice from all

sides.” [^1] The best answer to the conundrum posed by Genesis was that without evil there would be no way to test the faith of humans and allow them

to realize their potential for goodness. Milton has God explain that he made

man, “just and right/ Suffi cient to have stood, though free to fall.” 2]]

One way to think about evil was as a function of human weakness, a con-

stant readiness to be tempted and knowingly disobey God’s word. Another

way, common by Milton’s time, was to consider evil as a living, active force, deliberately trying to subvert God and tempt man. Evil acquired the personality of Satan, and the serpent in Genesis was therefore really Satan in dis-

guise, although there was no basis in Genesis for this notion. In a number of ancient civilizations, serpents have signifi ed evil, but also fertility. Satan did not appear until late in the Bible and then not in opposition to God but as a loyal angel. Satan had an adversarial role and took a harsh line in disputations before God in heaven, but he was always loyal in the end. The best-known

example of this is in the book of Job, when he is introduced as returning

“from going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.” 3

His role was one of challenging men in their sinfulness. It was Satan who

urged God to test Job, and when God agreed, Satan was sent to make Job’s

life miserable. Nonetheless, Satan did this not as a rebel but as a member of the heavenly court.

Eventually Satan, acting not merely as a harsh angel but also as one who

had fallen, came to be blamed for all forms of division and misery. The early Church had attempted to challenge the infl uence of Manichaeism (another

eastern religion which explained matters in terms of the contrast between the forces of good and evil), but its insistence that evil was not constituted as a live being failed to convince. The idea of a demonic force constantly seeking to lure humankind away from obeying God took hold. The main difference

for Manicheans was that in the end this had to be an unequal struggle. Hell

could be no sanctuary where Satan reigned supreme. God was always superior.

56

o r i g i n s

Evil could therefore imperil the world but also be suffi ciently containable and vulnerable to defeat. [^4] The Bible closes with the book of Revelation, in which Satan represents the forces of evil. An extraordinary scene is described, a war in heaven between Michael and “the dragon,” each with their own cohort of

angels. “And the great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is

called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world—he was thrown

down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.” 5]] Biblical scholars consider this to refer to a vision of a tremendous upheaval at the end of time. Milton was not alone, however, in taking this to refer to the start of time. It was Satan’s rebellion against God that led to his exile to earth where he became a troublemaker, gaining his fi rst victory as the serpent persuading Eve to eat of the Tree of Knowledge.

_Heavenly Battles_

Milton’s narrative gained force not only because of his mastery of language

and sense of drama but also because of his intense commitment to the notion

of free will. To square the circle of faith, he sought to demonstrate that the true exercise of free will leads to a decision to obey God completely and

without reservation. So while God allows free will, he knows how individuals

will decide. Milton also distinguished between a challenge to the authority

of a secular king—a good thing—and a challenge to the heavenly king—

a bad thing. Indeed, the secular king’s authority needed to be challenged

because it was tantamount to a challenge to God’s authority. The arguments

that might be used to justify disobedience in one context should not work

at all in another. Yet rhetorically this did not quite work, as the arguments against both types of kings sounded very similar. As many commentators

have observed, when Satan makes the case against blind obedience to God,

Milton gives him the best lines. William Blake observed that Milton was “of

the Devil’s party without knowing it.” 6 Milton’]]s portrayal of Satan as a leader matched a Machiavellian prince. Satan had the appropriate character—a

blend of the courageous and cunning—was able to adapt to changing cir-

cumstances, had the confi dence to take risks, and was aware of the respective merits of force and guile (“Our better part remains/ To work in close design, by fraud or guile/ What force effected not”). [^7]

The narrative structure humanizes the main characters, with the effect

of diminishing God and elevating Satan. Milton undermined God’s aura

and left him appearing defensive and pedantic. As we have seen in Exodus,

God could be deceptive and manipulative as part of his mysterious ways, but

s a t a n ’ s s t r a t e g y

57

his approach in _Paradise Lost_ was less subtle. Satan comes across as a much more rounded character, altogether more interesting. [^8] Though at times he appeared regretful of his fallen status, he still followed his chosen path. His ambivalent character and claims meant that he was not always so easy to

resist. For Milton, Satan was Machiavel, using fraudulent rhetoric and force

to manipulate the fallen angels while also attempting to attribute exactly

these corrosive tendencies to God. 9]] Satan adopted the republican claims of free choice, merit, and consent in describing his rule, while asserting that

God depends on coercion and fraud.

There are many themes and ideas developed in _Paradise Lost_ , of which the most important is the link between the events at the start of time and

the eventual crucifi xion and resurrection of Jesus. My focus is solely on the confl ict between God and Satan and what this might tell us about their

respective strategic calculations. There are two key episodes in this story. In _Paradise Lost_ , they do not appear in chronological order, but here they do. The fi rst is the story of the great battle in heaven, which is told by Rafael, one of God’s loyal angels, to Adam to warn him about the nature of Satan and his

potential for evil. Unfortunately, by the time this story has been told, Eve has already been tempted. The second episode, the opening scene of the book,

depicts the deliberations among Satan’s followers as they work out how to

respond to their defeat in the fi rst battle.

In the beginning, according to Milton, Satan—then known as Lucifer—

was one of the great angels among the heavenly host. The crisis came when

God proclaimed his Son to be his equal. Satan was greatly affronted. He had

been given no warning of this development and now felt that his position in

the hierarchy was undermined. Satan urged the other angels to join him in

rebellion: “Will ye submit your necks and choose to bend/ The supple knee?”

He then provided a powerful case for political rights:

Who can in reason then or right assume/ Monarchie over such as live

by right/ His equals, if in power and splendor less/ In freedome equal?

or can introduce/ Law and Edict on us, who without law/ Erre not,

much less for this to be our Lord,/And look for adoration to th’ abuse/

Of those Imperial Titles which assert/ Our being ordain’d to govern,

not to serve? 10

A third of the angels rallied to Satan’s side, and heaven was attacked. But

heaven was ready. Curiously, rather than a place dedicated to peace, beauty,

and tranquility, heaven was already geared up for battle and organized on

martial lines. Milton had been an admirer of Oliver Cromwell’s New Model

Army, with its organization and discipline. This seems to have given him the

58

o r i g i n s

idea for a New Model Heaven. 11]] This struggle was more than hand-to-hand combat. The rebels were pushed back on the fi rst day, but they countered

on the second day with cannon, only to be countered in turn by having hills

and mountains hurled at them. The rebels’ resort to gunpowder, a material

linked to treason in the Catholic plot of 1605, is not without signifi cance. At the time, it was often described as the devil’s invention, calculated to remove honor and glory from war.

God watched this chaos and at last intervened on the third day. Why

did he let it continue? The reasoning was consistent with that used to

interpret the basic message of the Hebrew Bible. He was creating the

conditions in which his glory and wonder would be appreciated. In this

case, it was the Son whose decisive role had to be noticed. He explained

to the Son that this was in order “that the Glory may be thine/ Of ending

this great war, since none but Thou/ Can end it.” He commanded him to

lead out all the heavenly forces and drive the rebel angels down to hell.

The Son accepted the command willingly, again demonstrating a clear

contrast between his obedience and Satan’s rebellion. For the Son, “to obey

is happiness entire.” Satan’s forces also regrouped, “hope conceiving from

despair.” They made themselves ready for a battle they knew must be fi nal.

The Son told his forces to stand aside for this was his battle: “Against me

is all their rage.” 12

Leaving aside the odd ideas of a civil war in heaven, the use of artillery

(somehow mountains as projectiles are more fi tting), or even the earthly tendency to stop fi ghting for the night, there was an added twist that resulted from the immortality of the angels on both sides. No wound was ever fatal,

although they did cause pain. Despite his admiration for martial virtues,

Milton was also demonstrating that some matters could never be truly solved

by battle. Perhaps he was also refl ecting on his experience of victory for the parliamentary side in the civil war followed by the return of the monarchy.

Even in this particular contest, it was the special strength of the Son rather than weight of numbers that made all the difference.

_Pandemonium_

When the enemy is able to recover from initial blows, it is diffi cult to infl ict a decisive defeat. Immortal combatants gave an added twist to this classic

dilemma. As _Paradise Lost_ opened, the fallen angels were meeting to regroup and consider their next steps in their new home. Despite being expelled from

heaven, Satan was undaunted. He remained a dedicated opponent of “the

s a t a n ’ s s t r a t e g y

59

tyranny of Heav’n.” “Here at last,” he proclaimed from hell, “We shall be free. [ . . . ] Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven!”

A strategic debate then took place in hell among the leaders of the fallen

angels—Moloch, Belial, Mammon, Beelzebub, and Satan himself. The set-

ting was a special place called Pandemonium (literally a house of devils),

where the rebels gather to consider their next steps. God presumably had the

option of preventing them ever causing trouble again, but he still allowed

them to decide their own course of action. Satan was determined to raise

his comrades out of their miserable sense of weakness and work to oppose

everything that God was trying to do. “To do aught good never will be our

task, But ever to do ill our sole delight.” He used a parade, with accompany-

ing brass band, to raise the spirits of his followers and demonstrate that they were still a force of great strength, greater “than the forces on both sides in the Trojan War, greater than any forces King Arthur or Charlemagne could

command.” While this may have raised the morale of his followers against

God, it could not serve as the basis of a credible strategy. 13]]

A set of options was described that might have been put to any group

trying to respond to a major setback. Anthony Jay noted that “in every

important respect the situation is that of a corporation trying to formulate a new policy after taking a terrifi c beating from its chief competitor and being

driven out of the market it had previously depended on.” 14]] Satan, who knew what he wanted, nonetheless followed good practice and opened proceedings

by asking for proposals.

Moloch was the fi rst to step forward, recommending “open war.” His

appeal was based on emotion and drive, aggression and fatalism, while con-

temptuous of attempts to use wiles: “Let us rather choose/ arm’d with hell

fl ames and fury, all at once/ O’er Heaven’s high towers to force resistless way.”

He could not, he admitted, promise victory, but at least a form of revenge.

Compared with Moloch’s unsubtle aggression, Belial offered more real-

ism, but the effect was defeatist: “ignoble ease and peaceful sloth.” He

doubted they could achieve even revenge. “The tow’rs of heaven are fi lled/

With armed watch, that renders all access/ Impregnable.” He made a fun-

damental point about the impossibility of both “force and guile” that his

fellow devils seemed ready to ignore. God saw “all things at one view” and

so saw and derided the devil’s council even while it was in progress. Belial’s alternative was therefore to wait until God relented. “This is now/ Our doom, which if we can sustain and bear,/ Our supreme foe in time may much remit/

His anger.”

Mammon ridiculed both of the previous options. He had little taste for

war or expectations of God’s forgiveness: “With what eyes could we/ Stand

60

o r i g i n s

in his presence humble, and receive/ Strict laws imposed, to celebrate his throne/ With warbled hymns, and to his Godhead sing/ Force hallelujahs,

while he lordly sits/ Our envied Sov’reign.” His idea was to develop the pos-

sibilities of hell: “This desert soil/ Wants not her hidden lustre, gems and

gold: Nor want we skill or art, from whence to raise/ Magnifi cence: and what can heav’n show more?” So he urged the fallen angels “to found this nether

empire, which might rise/ By policy and long process of time/ In emulation

opposite to heav’n.” As he had helped construct Pandemonium, Mammon’s

ideas had some credibility. For the fi rst time the audience saw something

they liked. Mammon “scarce had fi nished when such murmur fi lled/ The

assembly, as when hollow rocks retain/ The sound of blustering winds.”

But like any clever chairman, Satan had worked out his preferred out-

come before the debate had begun. Everything had been structured to pro-

duce the desired conclusion. His second-in-command, Beelzebub, “Pleaded

his devilish counsel, fi rst devised/ By Satan and in part prospered.” First, he undermined Mammon by warning that God would not allow hell to become

equivalent to heaven. Beelzebub proposed taking an initiative but not the

direct strategy of Moloch. Satan spoke of a “place/ (If ancient and prophetic fame in heaven/ err not) another world, the happy seat/ Of some new race

called Man.” This new race was supposedly equal to angels, perhaps cre-

ated to fi ll the gap left by the exiled rebels. This was a way of getting at God without the futility of a direct assault. Perhaps men might be tricked

into joining the rebellion. As a strategist Satan had identifi ed one possible explanation for the defeat in heaven. It was simply a lack of numbers. There

were twice as many loyal angels as rebels. Instead of trying to reverse the

outcome of battle through a direct assault, which would be futile, why not

trick men into joining the rebellion? After Satan praised Beelzebub’s plan, it was adopted. Having come up with the strategy, Satan set off to implement

it. First he needed good intelligence. “Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn/ What creatures there inhabit. Of what mould/ Or substance, how

endued, and what their power,/ And where their weakness, how attempted

best,/ By force or subtlety.” 15]]

He journeyed seven times around the earth to avoid the vigilance of the

angels guarding Paradise. He tricked his way into Eden, appearing to the

guard as a cherub. His aim was to conquer Eden and then colonize it with

his fallen angels. But, coming upon Eve in Eden, he was enraptured by her

beauty and for a while was “stupidly good, of enmity disarmed,/ Of guile,

of hate, of envy, of revenge,” until he pulled himself together and reminded

himself that he was about “hate, not love.” He considered Adam and Eve now

more cynically as he recalls his aim of malign coalition: “League with you

s a t a n ’ s s t r a t e g y

61

I seek,/ and mutual amitie so streight, so close,/ That I with you must dwell, or you with me,/ Henceforth.”

In the form of a serpent, which Milton compared to the Trojan Horse,

Satan tempted Eve to eat fruit from the Tree of Knowledge. Satan argued that

he, a beast, received the gift of speech after eating it and God had not killed him. Eve later explains to Adam that she doubted he would have “discern’d/

Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake.” Even if she had been aware of the possible deceptiveness of appearances, why should she have been suspicious?

“No grounds of enmity between us known,/ Why he should mean me ill or

seek to harm.” 16

After eating the fruit, Eve persuaded Adam to eat some as well. This set

up a potential contest for the allegiance of men. Should they give themselves over to Satan, the balance of power might tilt in his direction. For Adam

and Eve, this was the moment of decision. No longer innocent, they must

choose. Satan’s cause was defeated when Adam and Eve made their choice;

they repented and aligned themselves with God. Michael’s prophecy was “so

shall the World goe on,/ To good malignant, to bad men benigne,/ Under

her own waight groaning” until Christ’s second coming. The lesson, as Adam

came to understand, was that even the few must oppose the unjust and the

wicked, for “suffering for truth’s sake/ Is fortitude to highest victorie.” God’s accomplishments would not always be the obvious route. They came “by

things deem’d weak/ Subverting wordly strong.” 17

By that time, a less-confi dent Satan, away from his home ground and sup-

porters, had his own “troubl’d thoughts,” acknowledging the omnipotence

of God and the error of his revolt, as well as the evil within him. His pride would not allow him to contemplate submission. The problem was not with

the strategy Milton attributed to Satan. With all involved enjoying immor-

tality, brute force was never going to be decisive. Satan’s best hope was to

turn humans so that they joined the ranks of the fallen. In this effort deception was essential, and initially Satan was successful in removing Adam and

Eve as allies of the angels. What he failed to do was win them over to his

cause, for here God had the ultimate weapon in his Son.

Although Milton put sentiments about freedom—in words he might have

used against his own king—into the Satanic speeches, he was not necessarily

of the devil’s party. Milton’s heaven, while odd in its apparent militarism, was never described in tyrannical terms. The angels obeyed God as a result of his inherent authority rather than fear of punishment, and individual angels were given latitude when acting on God’s behalf. They came together naturally

and joyously to defend heaven against the rebels. Moreover, there was every

difference between using such republican rhetoric to denounce an earthly

62

o r i g i n s

king, who had usurped the power of God and claimed to be his agent, and the denunciation of God himself. In 1609, James I spoke to Parliament about

how “kings are justly called Gods, for they exercise in a manner or resem-

blance of Divine power upon earth . . . Kings are not only God’s Lieutenants

upon earth, and sit upon God’s throne, but even by God himself they are

called Gods.” Milton’s political project from the start was to challenge this presumption and the associated claim that disobedience to a king was tantamount to disobedience to God. Such a presumption was idolatrous. Milton’s

hell was a developing monarchy “with royalist politics, perverted language,

perverse rhetoric, political manipulation, and demagoguery.” 18]] Despite the language Satan employed as a rebel leader, he acted as a supreme king once he got to hell. He appeared as a great sultan and addressed Pandemonium “high

on a throne of Royal State.” He took his command for granted. He did not

offer the rebels republican self-government but rather servitude to himself,

a usurping king. His feigned commitment to political rights was no more

to be believed than the vivid description of a serpent’s life he gave Eve while tempting her—or his other imaginative deceptions, for that matter.

The real puzzle is why Satan ever believed he could succeed. The problem

was not predestination but God’s omnipotence and omniscience. Not only

did God have superior power, but he could not be tricked either. Whatever

was being planned, God saw it coming. As a former archangel, Satan should

also have seen it coming. This is why, despite appearing to be modeled on

Machiavelli’s ideal prince, Milton’s Satan fell short in key respects. In confrontation with God he made elementary mistakes and lacked the prudence

Machiavelli advised when dealing with a stronger power. Machiavelli’s prince

was “above all a pragmatist.” Machiavelli did not admire “those who oppose

insurmountable odds or persist in lost causes.” In _Paradise Lost_ , Satan acknowledged that while in heaven he underestimated God’s strength, and once in hell he made no effort to reconsider the logic of his initial rebellion. He stuck with a strategy that had already brought him failure, in part by claiming that it was almost successful. He learned nothing that could truly make God vulnerable.

His boasting that he could do so was, to quote Riebling, “a mockery of stra-

tegic wisdom.” He was ready to use force or guile, but not to gain true advantage—only to wage “eternal Warr.” Against an omnipotent foe, this hardly

betrayed pragmatism. “Satan may seem to be a free agent, boldly innovating

his future,” but “he is instead a slave to his own nature.” [^19]

In Milton’s fi ction, Satan’s task was to allow God to make a point.

Satan was “cast in a poem with an axiomatically omniscient and omnipo-

tent God.” This meant, according to John Carey, “that every hostile move

he makes must be self-defeating. Yet his fi ctional function is precisely to

s a t a n ’ s s t r a t e g y

63

make hostile moves: he is the fi end, the enemy.” 20]] If, having seen the possibility of redemption, Satan had taken it, then the plot would no longer

work. But that still left the fl aw. Milton provided God with a truly evil opponent who was suffi ciently clever to develop a challenge substantial enough

to demonstrate God’s glory but not so clever that he could conclude that he

should surrender to God’s mercy. By exploring the relative merits of force,

guile, conciliation, and fatalism, _Paradise Lost_ illuminated strategic debates, but as with all debates in which God was involved, in the end the deliberations were all futile. The players in these dramas could act to serve their own purposes only to the extent that these conformed to God’s overarching plan.

_The Limits Of Guile_

Although the regular references to deception in the Bible are by no means

always disapproving, the serpent’s cunning, which gets humankind off to

such a poor start, did not set an encouraging precedent. Milton further con-

fi rmed the link between cunning and wickedness by identifying the serpent

as Satan in disguise. When Milton referred to “guile,” he connoted fraud,

cunning, and trickery. From a strategic perspective, these still could seem

preferable to violence—and certainly to defeat—but such methods were

underhanded, certainly lacking in nobility and bravery. Those who won by

such guile would forever have a stain on their character. Even now, it is com-plimentary to describe a person as being “without guile.” What such a person

says can be taken at face value; there is no need to search for hidden mean-

ings. Or else we speak of a victim “beguiled” by a seductive personality or

idea as one detached from normal composure and rationality. A comparable

word is _wiles_ , which the philosopher Hobbes employed as an alternative “to

master the persons of all men he can.” 21 The Oxford Dictionary defi]] nition conveys the distasteful fl avor of wiles: “a crafty, cunning, or deceitful trick; a sly, insidious, or underhand artifi ce; a stratagem, ruse. Formerly sometimes in somewhat wider sense: A piece of deception, a deceit, a delusion.”

Stratagems, as described by Frontinus, involved deceit, surprise, con-

trivance, obfuscation, and general trickery. A stratagem is still defi ned as an “artifi ce or trick designed to outwit or surprise the enemy.” There were

examples in Shakespeare in which resorting to stratagem appeared as less

than wholesome, a way of gaining an unfair advantage by surprising the

enemy. The mad Lear’s suggestion of a “delicate stratagem” to “shoe a troop

of horse with felt” was not to be taken seriously. The preference for acting

without trickery was made most clear in _Henry V_ , in which the king boasted 64

o r i g i n s

of a victory achieved “without stratagem” but rather “in plain shock and even play of battle.” [^22]

The word _plot_ also acquired negative connotations during the seventeenth century. Its association with dangerous mischief or malevolent scheming

was sealed once the failed attempt by Catholic conspirators (including Guy

Fawkes) to blow up the House of Commons while King James visited on

November 5, 1605, became known as the Gunpowder Plot. _Plot_ has thereafter implied treachery and conspiracy—a perverted plan, hatched by a few,

dependent on secrecy, geared to overthrowing the established order. Yet, the

etymology of _plot_ resembles that of _plan_ . Both originally referred to a fl at area of ground, then to a drawing of an area of land or a building, then to

a drawing to guide the construction of a building, and eventually to a set

of measures adopted to accomplish something. A plan became a detailed

proposal setting out how a goal would be attained. The military had their

“plan of attack” or “plan of campaign,” and these moved from their literal

meanings to become metaphors for going on the offensive or embarking on

a challenging mission in any context. When matters progress smoothly, they

were going “according to plan.” Eventually, a plan implied much more than

a sensible way of thinking through how to complete some diffi cult or com-

plicated task. _Plot_ morphed into something similar but less wholesome. The fi ne distinction between the two was found in Dr. Johnson’s 1755 dictionary.

A plan was a “scheme,” while a plot was also a “scheme” but a “conspiracy,

stratagem, contrivance” as well. 23

There was always a double standard when it came to cunning, trickery,

deception, and stratagem. Against your own people—with whom deception

should be much easier because you understood them and they were more

likely to trust you—it was generally reprehensible, but against enemies, it

could be acceptable and even admirable if the trick was a good one. The

closer the social bond, the more distasteful were attempts to exploit the

bond through deception; the weaker the bond, the more diffi cult it was to

deceive successfully. Either way, reliance on cunning was subject to a law of diminishing returns. Once the reputation was acquired, then others would

be watching out for tricks. Such tricks were therefore vulnerable to prob-

lems in execution or exposure when an opponent had good intelligence. For

all these reasons, the infl uence of cunning and trickery tended to be most

evident when small scale and personal. It was possible to trick governments

and armies, but this was always a gamble and might not gain more than a

temporary and limited advantage. Once warfare moved to mass armies with

complex organizations, there would be limits to what could be achieved by

means of guile. The emphasis would be on force.

The New Science of Strategy

_When I have learnt what progress has been made in modern gunnery,_

_When I know more of tactics than a novice in a nunnery—_

_In short, when I’ve a smattering of elemental strategy_

_You’ll say a better Major-General has never sat a-gee._

_For my military knowledge, though I’m plucky and adventury,_

_Has only been brought down to the beginning of the century._

—Gilbert and Sullivan, _The Pirates of Penzance_

In the famous patter song from their light opera of 1879, Gilbert and

Sullivan have their “modern major general” parading his knowledge of all

things historical, classical, artistic, and scientifi c. Only at the end does he admit that the gaps in his knowledge are those exactly relevant to his trade.

When he admits that his military knowledge has yet to reach the start of the

nineteenth century, he is saying that it is pre-Napoleonic, therefore belong-

ing to a quite different age and unfi t for contemporary purposes.

Martin van Creveld has asked whether strategy existed before 1800. 1

From the perspective of this book, of course, it existed from the moment

primates formed social groupings. Van Creveld accepted that there were

always some informed notions of the conduct of war and how to achieve

victory. Commanders had to work out their approach to battle and organize

their forces accordingly. What van Creveld had in mind was a step change that occurred around this time. Before 1800, intelligence-gathering and

communication systems were slow and unreliable. For that reason, generals

had to be on the front line—or at least not too far behind—in order to adjust quickly to the changing fortunes of battle. They dared not develop plans of

any complexity. Adopting measures such as splitting forces in order to attack the enemy from different directions or holding back reserves to reinforce

success was likely to lead to command and logistical nightmares. Roads were

poor and movement was bound to be slow. Although it was no longer neces-

sary to live off the land, logistical support required that magazines be moved along supply lines. This entailed a serious vulnerability if the enemy managed to cut the lines. Modest maneuvers or nighttime marches were the best

options for catching an enemy by surprise. Armies that lacked passion and

commitment, whose soldiers were easily tempted to desert if food was in

short supply or conditions too harsh, did not encourage confi dence in sustainable campaigns. Prudence suggested concentrating on pushing enemies into

positions where they would feel vulnerable or struggle to stay supplied. All

this limited the impact of wars on the apparently stable European balance of

power. Then, as transport systems were improving and lands were becoming

properly mapped, along came Napoleon Bonaparte, self-proclaimed emperor

of France. Napoleon embodied a new way of fi ghting wars: a combination of

individual genius and mass organization, and objectives far more ambitious

than those of his predecessors.

The French Revolution of 1789 was a source of great energy, innovation,

and destruction. It unleashed political and social forces that could not be

contained in their time and whose repercussions continued to be felt in the

succeeding centuries. In military affairs, the Revolution led to large, popular armies whose impact was enhanced by the developing means of transport-ing them over long distances. There was a move away from limited wars of

position, bound up with quarrels between individual rulers and shaped by

logistical constraints and unreliable armies, to total wars engaging whole

nations. [^2] With Napoleon, wars became means by which one state could challenge the very existence of another. No longer were they an elaborate form of bargaining. The high stakes removed incentives to compromise and encouraged a fi ght to a bloody conclusion. Military maneuvers were no longer ritu-

alistic—their impact reinforced by the occasional battle—but preludes to

great confrontations that could see whole armies effectively eliminated and

states subjugated.

This section opens with the introduction of the modern concept of strat-

egy and then describes the views of its two key exponents, Baron Henri de

70

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

Jomini and Carl von Clausewitz. They developed their ideas at a time of great political turbulence, a time when individual battles redrew the maps of Europe and new challenges were thrown up by the need to mobilize, motivate, move, and direct mass armies. The focus was on battle and the possibil-

ity of infl icting such a defeat that the enemy would be left in a politically hopeless position. This was when the idea of the battle of annihilation was

fi rmly implanted in military minds. Lost in this process was a view of battle as the “chance of arms” which until then had been accepted by the belligerents as an appropriate form of dispute resolution.

This view survived well into the nineteenth century, and arguably only

collapsed in that century’s second half. It was, however, always tenuous and its days were numbered. It was the product of a monarchical system in which the

causes and outcomes of war were bound up with matters of most interest to

rulers, such as dynastic succession or sovereignty over particular pieces of territory, and so it was vulnerable to the rise of nationalism and republicanism. It was part of a normative framework that was always subject to interpretation at its edges. In the most restrained version, victory was the agreed outcome of a day’s fi ghting, which would leave one army triumphant on the fi eld of battle, looking for booty and stripping enemy corpses. It still depended on the enemy accepting the result. Certain victories appeared to have more legitimacy than others, for example, those achieved without recourse to gross deceptions. But the notionally defeated sovereign could challenge his predicament by observing that while retreat might have been necessary, the other side took more

casualties; or the retreat was in suffi ciently good order so another battle could be fought. The victor had to calculate whether suffi cient damage had been

done to convince the enemy to now negotiate sensibly. This depended in part

on what was at stake, as well as on whether the enemy had any capacity to

fi ght back or else might be coerced through sieges and rampages through the

countryside, which he was helpless to prevent.

Even a badly bruised opponent might fi nd a way to continue resistance,

regroup, or acquire an external ally. Given the uncertainties and explosive

tendencies connected with war, was it wise to assume that this was no more

than a form of violent diplomacy? If it was bound to end with a compromise,

why not settle the matter with diplomacy before blood was shed, or look for

alternative—possibly economic—forms of coercion? Forming alliances and

undermining those of the enemy—evidently a matter of statecraft—could be

of as much or even greater importance to a war’s outcome than a display of

brilliant generalship.

The starting point for nineteenth-century strategic discourse, however,

was the expectation of a decisive battle, from which exceptions might be

t h e n e w s c i e n c e

71

found, rather than the demands of statecraft, for which battle might be the exception. Military circles encouraged the characterization of the international system as extensions of the battlefi eld, as constant struggles for survival and domination.

_Strategy as Profession and Product_

If we consider strategy to be a particular sort of practical problem-solving, it has existed since the start of time. Even if the word was not always in use, we can now look back and observe how personalities engaged in activities that

would later be called strategy. Did the arrival of a word to capture this activity make an important difference to the actual practice? Even after its introduction, _strategy_ was not universally employed as a descriptor even by those who might now be considered accomplished strategists. What was different was

the idea of strategy as a general body of knowledge from which leaders could

draw. The strategist came to be a distinctive professional offering special-

ist advice to elites, and strategy became a distinctive product refl ecting the complexity of situations in which states and organizations found themselves.

We noted earlier the role of the _strate¯gos_ in 5th-century Athens. According to Edward Luttwak, the ancient Greek and Byzantine equivalent to our _strategy_ would have been _strate¯gike episteme_ (generals’ knowledge) or _strate¯go¯n sophia_ (generals’ wisdom). 3 This knowledge took the form of compilations of strata-]]

gems, as in the _Strategematon_ , the Greek title of the Latin work by Frontinus.

The Greeks would have described what was known about the conduct of war

as _taktike techne_ , which included what we call tactics as well as rhetoric and diplomacy.

The word _strategy_ only came into general use at the start of the nineteenth century. Its origins predated Napoleon and refl ected the Enlightenment’s

growing confi dence in empirical science and the application of reason. Even

war, the most unruly of human activities, might be studied and conducted

in the same spirit. This fi eld of study at fi rst was known as _tactics_ , a word that had for some time referred to the orderly organization and maneuver of

troops. _Tactics_ defi ned as “the science of military movements” could, according to Beatrice Heuser, be traced back to the fourth century BCE. There

was no corresponding defi nition of _strategy_ until an anonymous sixth-century work linked it explicitly with the general’s art. “Strategy is the means by

which a commander may defend his own lands and defeat his enemies.” In

900, the Byzantine emperor Leo VI wrote of _strategía_ to provide an overall term for the business of the _strategos._ A few centuries later there was some 72

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

knowledge of Leo’s work, but when in 1554 a Cambridge professor translated the text into Latin, which lacks a word for strategy, he used “the art of the general” or “the art of command.” [^4]

In 1770, Jacques Antoine Hippolyte, Comte de Guibert, published his

_Essai général de tactique_ . Then only 27, Guibert was a precocious and extravagant French intellectual who had already acquired extensive military experi-

ence. He produced a systematic treatise on military science that captured the spirit of the Enlightenment and gained enormous infl uence. At issue was

whether it was possible to overcome the indecisiveness of contemporary war.

Guibert’s view was that achieving a decisive result with a mass army required an ability to maneuver. He distinguished “elementary tactics,” which became

“tactics,” from “grand tactics,” which became “strategy.” Guibert wanted a

unifi ed theory, raising tactics to “the science of all times, all places and all arms.” His key distinction was between raising and training armies, and then

using them in war. 5]] By 1779, he was writing of “la stratégique.” 6]]

The sudden introduction of the word is attributed by Heuser to Paul

Gédéon Joly de Maizeroy’s translation of Leo’s book into French in 1771.

Joly de Maizeroy identifi ed Leo’s “science of the general” as being separate from the subordinate spheres of tactics. In a footnote, he observed: “ _La stratégique_ is thus properly said to be the art of the commander, to wield and employ appropriately and with adroitness all the means of the general in

his hand, to move all the parts that are subordinate to him, and to apply

them successfully.” By 1777, a German translation of the work used the term

_Strategie_ . Joly de Maizeroy described strategy as “sublime” (a word also used by Guibert) and involving reason more than rules. There was much to consider: “In order to formulate plans, strategy studies the relationships between time, positions, means and different interests, and takes every factor into

account . . . which is the province of dialectics, that is to say, of reasoning,

which is the highest faculty of the mind.” 7]] The term now began to achieve a wide currency, offering a way of inserting deliberate, calculating thought

into an arena previously remarkable for its absence.

In Britain from the start of the nineteenth century, a plethora of words

emerged: _strategematic, strategematical, strategematist, strategemical_. All sought to convey the idea of being versed in strategies and stratagems. Thus, a strat-egemitor would devise stratagems, while a stratarchy referred to the system

of rule in an army, starting with the top commander. This word was once

used by British prime minister William Gladstone to refer to how armies

would go beyond hierarchy to require absolute obedience to superior offi -

cers. Then there was stratarithmetry, which was a way of estimating how

many men you had by drawing up an army or body of men into a given

t h e n e w s c i e n c e

73

geometrical fi gure. An alternative word for strategist was strategian, which goes neatly with tactician—though this did not catch on.

The distinction between strategy and tactics was of acknowledged impor-

tance as a means of distinguishing between different levels of command and

contact with the enemy. Thus strategy was the art of the commander-in-chief

“projecting and directing the larger military movements and operations of

a campaign,” while tactics was “the art of handling forces in battle or in the immediate presence of the enemy.” 8 Soon the word migrated away from its]]

military context and into such diverse areas as trade, politics, and theology.

The speed with which the word _strategy_ gained currency meant that it came to be used without a generally agreed upon defi nition. There was a

consensus that strategy had something to do with the supreme commander

and that it was about linking military means to the objects of war. It involved making connections between all that was going on in the military sphere

beyond the more intimate and small-scale maneuvers and encounters handled

at the lower levels of command. But the activities that came under the head-

ing of strategy were also understood to be intensely practical, a consequence of the sheer size of the armies of the new age, the extraordinary demands

posed by their movement and provisioning, and the factors that would gov-

ern how enemies should be approached. Much of this might be subject to

forms of practical knowledge and principles that could be described in a

systematic and instructive way, with checklists of considerations to be taken into account by the more forward-looking commanders. It is not surprising

therefore that strategy became closely associated with planning. Questions

of supply and transport limited what could be achieved, and calculations of

fi repower and fortifi cation infl uenced decisions on the deployment of troops.

Put this way, strategy covered all those aspects of a military campaign that

might properly be determined in advance.

Improved maps made an enormous difference to planning of this sort.

Developments in cartography meant that it was possible to consider how

a campaign might develop by plotting its likely course on sheets of paper,

representing base camps and lines of supply, enemy positions, and oppor-

tunities for maneuvers. A start had been made on the reconceptualization

of war in spatial terms by a Henry Lloyd, who had left Britain because of

his participation in the Jacobite rebellion of 1745 and then fought with a

variety of European armies. Having observed that those who embraced the

profession of arms took “little or no pains to study it,” he claimed to have

identifi ed fi xed principles of war that could vary only in their application. 9]]

Lloyd is credited with inventing the term _line of operations_ , which remains in use to this day and describes an army’s path from its starting point to its 74

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

fi nal destination. Lloyd infl uenced subsequent military theorists, including the Prussian Heinrich Dietrich von Bulow, who went to France in 1790 to

experience the Revolution fi rst hand. Having studied Napoleon’s methods,

he wrote on military affairs, including a _Practical Guide to Strategy_ in 1805.

He got somewhat carried away by the possibilities of geometric representa-

tions of armies preparing for battle. His reliance on mathematical principles led to him to offer proofs on how armies might constitute themselves and

move forward, according to distances from their starting base and enemy

objective. The approach can be discerned from his defi nition of strategy as

“all enemy movements out of the enemy’s cannon range or range of vision,”

so that tactics covered what happened within that range. 10]] His observations on tactics were considered to have merit, but much to his chagrin his description of the “new war system” was ignored by Prussian generals.

Whatever the scientifi c method might bring to the battlefi eld, when it

came to deciding on the moment, form, and conduct of battle, much would

depend on the general’s own judgment—perhaps more a matter of character,

insight, and intuition than careful calculation and planning. When battle

was joined, the theory could say little because of the many variables in play.

At that point, war became an art form. Strategy could be considered a matter

of science, in the sense of being systematic, empirically based, and logically developed, covering all those things that could be planned in advance and

were subject to calculation. As art, strategy covered actions taken by bold

generals who could achieve extraordinary results in unpromising situations.

_Napoleon’s Strategy_

Napoleon preferred to keep the critical ingredients behind his approach

beyond explanation. The art of war, he insisted, was simple and commonsen-

sical. It was “all in execution . . . nothing about it is theoretical.” The essence of the art was simple: “With a numerically inferior army” it was necessary

to have “larger forces than the enemy at the point which is to be attacked or defended.” How best to achieve that was an art that could “be learned neither from books nor from practice.” This was matter for the military genius and

therefore for intuition. Napoleon’s contribution to strategy was not so much

in his theory but in his practice. Nobody could think of better ways of using great armies to win great wars.

Napoleon was not creating new forms of warfare completely from scratch.

He was building on the achievements of Frederick the Great, the most admired

commander of his time. Frederick was king of Prussia from 1740 to 1786 and

t h e n e w s c i e n c e

75

a refl ective and prolifi c writer on war. His success was the result of turning his army into a responsive instrument, well trained and held together by tough

discipline. Initially he preferred his wars to be “short and lively,” which required accepting battle. Long wars exhausted a state’s resources as well as its soldiers, and Frederick’s country was relatively poor. His seizure of Silesia early in his reign, during the War of Austrian Succession, made his reputation as a tactical genius. Whitman uses this campaign as a prime example of how a “law of victory” could ensure restraint, so long as both sides accepted battle as a form of wager. Frederick observed that battles “decide the fortune of states” and could

“put an end to a dispute that otherwise might never be settled.” As kings were subject to “no superior tribunal,” combat could “decide their rights” and “judge

the validity of their reasons.” 11

Over time, however, Frederick became more wary of battle due to its

dependence upon chance. Success might need to come through the accumula-

tion of small gains rather than a single decisive encounter. Unlike Napoleon, Frederick preferred to avoid fi ghting too far from his own borders, did not

expect to destroy the opposing army in battle, and avoided frontal attacks.

His signature tactic was the “oblique order,” an often complex maneuver

requiring a disciplined force. It involved concentrating forces against the

enemy’s strongest fl ank while avoiding engagement on his own weak fl ank.

If the enemy did not succumb, an orderly retreat would still be possible; if

the enemy fl ank was overrun, the next step was to wheel round and roll up

his line. What Frederick shared with Napoleon—and what later theorists

celebrated in both—was the ability to create strength on the battlefi eld, even without an overall numerical advantage, and direct it against an enemy’s

vulnerabilities.

As a young offi cer, Napoleon also read Guibert and took from him some

basic ideas which he made his own. In particular, he noted the need to launch attacks at the key points where superiority had been achieved, and to reach

these points by moving quickly. Although Guibert had observed that “hege-

mony over Europe will fall to that nation which . . . becomes possessed of

manly virtues and creates a national army,” he had not seen conscription as

the means to this end. He assumed the duties of a citizen and a soldier to be opposed. At most, a militia might be raised as a defensive force. The actual

creation of the mass army can be credited to Lazar Carnot, a key fi gure in

the French Revolution, who had an uneasy relationship with Napoleon but

served him until 1815. It was Carnot who as minister of war used conscrip-

tion to create the _levée en masse_ and turned it into a formidable, trained, and disciplined organization. Carnot also showed how a mass army could be used

as an offensive instrument by separating it into independent units that could 76

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

move faster than the enemy, enabling attacks against the fl anks and creating opportunities to cut off communications. Most of Napoleon’s generals

learned their trade under Carnot.

Napoleon’s contribution was to grasp how the potential of the mass army

could be realized. He imbibed the military wisdom of the Enlightenment

and took advantage of the system created by Carnot in such a way as to upset

not only traditional thinking about war but also the whole European bal-

ance of power. His genius lay not in the originality or novelty of his ideas

on strategy but in their interpretation in context and the boldness of his

execution. His focus was always on the decisive battle. He was prepared to

embrace the inherent brutality of war and sought to generate suffi cient con-

centrated violence to shatter the opposing army. This was the route to the

political goal. An enemy with a broken army would be unwilling to resist

political demands. As this required a comprehensive defeat, Napoleon had

little interest in indirect strategies. When a point of weakness was found,

extra forces would be poured in to break through. They could then move

against the enemy from the rear or to the fl anks. This required taking risks, for example, accepting vulnerabilities to his own rear and fl anks as he concentrated strength. But Napoleon was not reckless. He would wait until the

right moment to make his move. Since he put a priority on ensuring that he

had the maximum strength, his great battles were often fought in obscure

places where he saw an opportunity to strike with guaranteed superiority

and utter ruthlessness. By combining political and military authority in one

person, Napoleon was also in a position to act boldly without extensive con-

sultations. His optimism, self-confi dence, and extraordinary run of victories earned him the loyalty of his troops and kept his enemies apprehensive. This

created a sense of irresistibility which he was always keen to exploit.

Napoleon never provided a complete account of his approach to war. He

did not write of strategy, although he did refer to the “higher parts of war.”

His views were recorded in a number of maxims. They were often practi-

cal refl ections on the standard military problems of his day and lack the

universal quality of Sun Tzu’s writings. Yet they capture the essence of his

approach: bringing superior strength to bear at crucial moments (“God is on

the side of the heaviest battalions”); defeating the enemy by destroying his

army; viewing strategy as “the art of making use of time and space”; using

time to gain strength when weaker; and compensating for physical inferior-

ity with greater resolve, fortitude, and perseverance (“The moral is to the

physical as three to one”). Many of his maxims revolved around the need to

understand the enemy: by fi ghting too often with one enemy, “you will teach

him all your art of war”; never do what the enemy wishes “for this reason

t h e n e w s c i e n c e

77

alone, that he desires it”; never interrupt an enemy making a mistake; always show confi dence, for you can see your own troubles but you cannot see those

facing your enemy. [^12]

_Borodino_

We now turn to a battle which was neither an exemplary success nor a nota-

ble defeat but acquired importance because it raised doubts about Napoleon’s

method. The battle of Borodino, some eighty miles from Moscow, was fate-

ful in its consequences. Fought between the French and Russian armies on

September 7, 1812, it involved some quarter of a million men. Of these,

about seventy-fi ve thousand were killed, wounded, or captured. Although

the French came out on top, the Russians did not consider themselves beaten.

Moscow was occupied following Borodino, but the Russians refused to agree

to peace terms and Napoleon found that he lacked the capacity to sustain his

army for any length of time. After fi ve weeks, he began the famous and harsh retreat from Moscow.

It was not that Napoleon lacked a strategy when he began the campaign

in the summer of 1812. He expected to follow his past practice of keeping

the enemy guessing, fi nding a point to concentrate overwhelming superior-

ity, and then attacking. Once Russian forces were destroyed, he could dic-

tate peace terms to Tsar Alexander. To keep the war short and avoid being

sucked into the Russian heartland, he wanted to fi ght his battle in the frontier regions. He was confi dent against Russian armies, since he boasted such stunning victories as Austerlitz in 1805. Russian leadership had generally

been abysmal, and Napoleon assumed that the spineless aristocracy would

oblige the Tsar to concede once French superiority had been made clear.

Tsar Alexander had a far better, although politically controversial, strategy.

It drew on Russia’s excellent intelligence network in France. Alexander knew

from 1810 that a war was almost inevitable. This gave him time to think

about a response and to make preparations, taking a candid view of Russia’s

weakness, including a lack of reliable allies. One option was to fi ght at the fi rst opportunity before the French could advance far on sacred Russian soil, relying on the superior spirit of Russian troops and what might be achieved

by catching the French by surprise. But Alexander knew the numbers were

against him and saw the danger in pitting his main armies, without reserves,

against a well-supplied and fully formed French army. A defeat would leave

the country unprotected. This led him into a defensive strategy, although

this meant giving up on an alliance. Austria and Prussia were reluctant to

78

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

join an anti-French coalition involving a Russia that planned to retreat, but Alexander doubted that he could rely on them even if he embarked on an

offensive strategy. Most importantly, he understood that Napoleon wanted

battle. If that was what he wanted, that was exactly what he should not have.

The Russian plan therefore was to fall back, to the chagrin of many senior

offi cers whose instincts were offensive. By trading space for time, they would gain strength. As the French advanced away from their supply lines, the

Russians would get closer to theirs. Since Napoleon’s system depended on big

battles and rapid victories, the Russians would retreat, raid enemy commu-

nications with their much superior light cavalry, and wear down Napoleon’s

forces. “We must avoid big battles until we have fallen right back to our

supply lines.” [^13]

The Russians knew what they needed to do, but they had no actual plan

of retreat. That depended on when and how Napoleon made his fi rst move.

When it came, the retreat had a degree of improvisation, but it was managed

better than Napoleon’s advance. The emperor was prepared for an early battle

but not for a long advance into unforgiving terrain in the face of inclement

weather. As Napoleon chased the Russians in search of a battle, he exhausted

his men and particularly his horses. Only as he got close to Moscow could

he be confi dent that he would at last get his battle. Despite his tired and

depleted force, Napoleon stuck with his original plan on the assumption that

the Russians would not give up Moscow without a fi ght.

Facing him in charge of the Russian forces was General Mikhail Kutuzov,

a shrewd offi cer with a good understanding of the attitudes of ordinary sol-

diers and the Russian people, as well as considerable experience in war. But

Kutuzov was now 65, physically and mentally slower than before, and sur-

rounded by fl atterers. When the battle came, his deployments and command

arrangements were haphazard: he delegated his powers of command to sub-

ordinate generals to act as they saw fi t in the circumstances. His passivity left the impression that he had no idea what was going on or what to do next.

Yet the revelation at Borodino was how much Napoleon was off form and

off maxim. The advance into Russia had been unexpectedly challenging and

costly in men and materiel. By the time of the battle, the Grand Armée had

already lost a third of its original 450,000 men—without a proper fi ght.

Although much is made of the terrible impact of the Russian winter on the

retreat from Moscow, the initial and critical damage was done by the Russian

summer. The Russians enjoyed a notional numerical advantage at the time of

the battle, although this evaporated when some 31,000 Russian militiamen

without much by way of weapons or training were subtracted, leaving around

130,000 French facing 125,000 Russians. 14 The emperor himself had put

t h e n e w s c i e n c e

79

on fat, having enjoyed the good life to excess, and had lost the energy of his earlier years. On the day of the battle he was also unwell, suffering from fever and a painful inability to urinate. He barely seemed in charge.

Napoleon’s subordinate generals conducted the battle almost indepen-

dently of each other and without the cohesion he would once have imposed.

Instead of his forces being committed against one particular line of attack,

there were a series of uncoordinated probes against the Russian positions.

Although his superior fi repower blasted holes in the Russian defenses, the

enemy fought doggedly and did not surrender—much to Napoleon’s con-

sternation. When breakthroughs were possible he dithered, bothered by

practicalities when bold maneuvers were proposed to him. With little left of

his army to spare at a critical moment, he held back the Imperial Guard out

of concern that he would have little left for his next battle.

In past battles he had been an evident presence, riding around to make

his own assessments of the situation at the front and to enthuse his troops.

On this day, he was absent. A French offi cer observing the emperor’s indeci-

sion in the face of contradictory reports about Russian strength, described

Napoleon’s “suffering and dejected face, his features sunk, and a dull look;

giving his orders languishingly, in the midst of these dreadful warlike noises, to which he seemed completely a stranger.” Mikaberidze adds that Napoleon

was “unrecognizable and his lethargy may have been the most decisive factor

in the battle, as he rejected proposals that could have delivered victory.” 15]]

The emperor took comfort in the fact that at the end of the day he occu-

pied the battlefi eld and had infl icted greater harm on the enemy than his own forces had suffered. But the Russian army was not annihilated, and those that were not killed or wounded largely escaped. Napoleon had expected to take

many prisoners, but the actual haul was small. He now lacked the capacity to

fi nish the Russians off in another battle. A large country with a large population could absorb the losses.

Kutuzov managed to withdraw his forces in an orderly fashion. His one

important, absolutely critical, decision was to encourage Napoleon to enter

Moscow instead of chasing his army in order to infl ict what might have been

a decisive defeat. This had not been his original intent. Prior to Borodino, he had resisted the idea that Moscow was just another town that might have to

be sacrifi ced for the greater good of saving the Russian empire. Now Kutuzov acknowledged that he could not save both Moscow and the army and that if

the army was lost, then Moscow would go anyway. “Napoleon,” he observed,

“is like a torrent which we are still too weak to stem. Moscow is the sponge

which will suck him in.” Napoleon allowed himself to be sucked in. As the

city was being occupied, fi res began and ultimately destroyed two-thirds of it.

80

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

Napoleon expected the Tsar to sue for peace. Soon he realized that with the Russians unwilling to either fi ght another battle or negotiate a settlement, he was stranded, unable to sustain his forces through hunger and cold. He

had no choice but to return to France. The journey home was bitter and crip-

pling. When the Russians eventually advanced, the Tsar was able to realize

the ultimate goal of his own strategy, which was to revive the anti-Napoleon

coalition in Europe.

After this debacle and a fi rst exile, Napoleon made one further attempt

at glory, which came to grief at Waterloo in 1815. This master of war had

been defeated and those writing the textbooks were left to ponder not only

the sources of his original success but the causes of his ultimate failure. For present during the Russian campaign, though playing minor roles, were the

two greatest nineteenth-century theorists of war: Carl von Clausewitz and

Baron Antoine Henri de Jomini.

Clausewitz

_[W] ar is not an exercise of the will directed at inanimate matter, as_

_is the case with the mechanical arts, or at matter which is animate but_

_passive and yielding, as is the case with the human mind and emotions in_

_the fi ne arts. In war, the will is directed at an animate object that reacts._

—Clausewitz, _On War_

Carl von Clausewitz, born 1780, learned his military craft in the

Prussian army as it failed to resist Napoleon’s mass army. Dismayed at

Prussia’s craven subordination to victorious France, Clausewitz joined the

Russian army (hence his appearance at Borodino) before returning to the

Prussian army for the campaign that culminated at Waterloo and the fi nal

defeat of Bonaparte. Along with the bulk of the European offi cer class, he had been mesmerized by Napoleon. In 1812, he saw at close quarters the great

man’s fallibility: his loss of the killer instinct at the critical moment, the limits to his genius. Clausewitz wrote a full account of the campaign, though his own role—and his account—was hampered by his lack of Russian. He did

help organize the Convention of Tauroggen, whereby the Prussian contingent

that had been obliged to march with Napoleon came to the Russian side.

Clausewitz did not think Borodino a classic of strategy. In the whole bat-

tle he found “not a single trace of an art or superior intelligence,” the result coming “less from a carefully considered decision than from indecision and

circumstance.” His initial, and not unreasonable, conclusion was that the

“vastness” of Russia made it impossible “to cover and occupy strategically.”

A “large country of European civilization” could not “be conquered without

the help of internal discord.” [^1] Later he was harsher on Napoleon for not chasing the Russian army and described Borodino as a battle that was “never

completely fought out.” 2]] Both judgments had important implications: the fi rst that the degree of popular support for the state made a difference when dealing with external threats; the second that a victory that did not leave the enemy fatally wounded was of limited value.

Clausewitz’s military reputation in Prussia was modest, and when he was

sent to direct the war school it was in an administrative capacity. He did not teach, but he did have the time to collect his thoughts about this remarkable and transformational period of warfare and pull them together for a master-work, _On War_ .

War’s tendency toward the absolute both thrilled and appalled the

younger Clausewitz. The more mature Clausewitz appreciated the reasons

why wars in practice still fell short of the absolute and that, post-Napoleon just as pre-Napoleon, they might be fought for more modest ends than the

survival of states. It was this that led to his determination to engage in a

major revision of his whole text, a project that was only partly completed

when he died. According to one interpretation, this moment of truth came

upon Clausewitz gradually; by another view, 1827 was more of a crisis as he

realized that his theory of war failed to account suffi ciently for the various forms in which it had actually occurred. [^3] He was still in the process of revising _On War_ when he was struck down by cholera in 1832. His widow did the best she could with the book’s posthumous publication, but the fi nal version inevitably left commentators guessing about what might have been found

had he lived to complete the work to his satisfaction.

_Jomini_

While Clausewitz was seeking to advise the Russians in 1812, Jomini was

on the French side. In the retreat from Moscow, he lost his papers at a river crossing as the remnants of the French army were harassed by Russian partisans. Although Clausewitz is now considered to be the greater of the two

and Jomini is rarely read, it was Jomini who for most of the nineteenth cen-

tury was taken to be the foremost interpreter of the Napoleonic method.

Napoleon was said to have remarked that Jomini betrayed the innermost

secrets of his strategy. Jomini certainly claimed, based on his observations of c l a u s e w i t z

83

the master, to have discerned basic principles of warfare. This earned him the

“dubious title of founder of modern strategy.” [^4]

Jomini was born in Switzerland in 1779. Though he started work as a

banker in Paris, he joined the French army in 1797 and came under the

patronage of then General and eventually Marshal Michel Ney. Jomini wrote

a treatise on the campaigns of Frederick the Great in 1803. This work con-

tained those core beliefs which sustained him until his death in 1869 at the

age of 90. He held staff positions for both Napoleon and Ney, but was a diffi -

cult egotist and a serial resigner. By 1813 he had risen to become Ney’s chief of staff, but after he was denied promotion to _general de division_ he offered his services to Russia, where he became a full general. His core ideas were

published in his _Art of War_ (always a popular title), which was fi rst published

in 1830 and then in a revised form in 1838. 5]] His book has been described as “the greatest military textbook of the nineteenth century.” [^6] By elucidat-ing the enduring principles of strategy, Jomini sought to “make instruction

easier, operational judgment sounder, and mistakes less frequent.” _The Art of_ _War_ was published widely. This meant that opposing armies might well have been following the same precepts, and so the advice would become self-neutralizing, unless one side dared to seek advantage by breaking Jomini’s rules.

To Jomini, strategy was the sphere of activity between the political,

where decisions were made about who to fi ght, and the tactical, which was

the sphere of actual combat. By saying that strategy was the art of making

war upon the map, he was interested in how the theater of operations as a

whole was conceived by the commander and the moves against the enemy

formulated, while taking advantage of the spatial awareness made possible

by modern cartography. “Strategy decides where to act; logistics brings the

troops to this point; grand tactics decides the manner of execution and the

employment of the troops.” 7

Politics and tactics were governed by different principles, and Jomini had

surprisingly little to say about either. According to John Shy, the only aspect of war that “truly interested him concerned the supreme commander, the

Frederick or Napoleon who played the great bloody game, who by sheer

intellect and will dominated the men who served him and used them to

defeat his enemies.” Jomini’s armies appeared as “faceless masses, armed and

fed in mysterious ways.” Their commanders would show their greatness by

massing force against weaker enemy forces at some decisive point. [^8] Both Frederick the Great and Napoleon had demonstrated the importance of following this core principle, though it was by no means straightforward in

application. Focusing on one point to the exclusion of others, and leaving

your own fl anks vulnerable, required a degree of boldness and an ability to

84

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

weigh risks. Ways had to be found to mass the army for the attack and to identify the main point against which to direct the attack.

Jomini failed to test the historical cases which did not conform to his pre-

cepts. He also assumed that military units of equivalent size were essentially equal in how they were armed, trained, disciplined, supplied, and motivated.

Strategy was therefore important because only the quality of the commanders

and their decisions really made a difference. This was why he could conceive

of it as following timeless principles, which required him to assert during his long life that major material shifts, such as the use of railways, were matters of detail. If the principles really were timeless, why was Napoleon such a revelation? Jomini’s answer was that the growing maturity in military thought

meant that the principles were properly appreciated. 9 He was not the last to

use this argument.

Before Jomini went out of fashion during the twentieth century he was

the fi rst port of call for any aspiring strategist and a model of lucidity and intelligibility. Jomini might not always have been a scintillating read, but he was much easier to follow than Clausewitz.

The relationship between the two was complex. The younger Clausewitz

clearly borrowed from Jomini, and the second edition of the _Art of War_ took into account Clausewitz’s criticisms. 10]] The two men never met and did not speak warmly of each other. On many operational issues, the differences

were not great. Jomini claimed to be aware of the dangers of theoretical

pedantry, while Clausewitz grasped the importance of operational tech-

niques. Jomini’s prime purpose was instruction and he found Clausewitz’s

theorizing overblown. As Clausewitz developed his ideas, he differentiated

himself from von Bulow’s mathematical approach, but his criticisms might

also be taken to apply to Jomini. He observed that efforts to “equip the

conduct of war with principles, rules, or even systems” failed because they

could not “take an adequate account of the endless complexities involved.”

“Pity the soldier,” wrote Clausewitz, “who is supposed to crawl among

these scraps of rules, not good enough for genius, which genius can ignore,

or laugh at. No; what genius does is the best rule, and theory can do no bet-

ter than show how and why this should be the case.” 11]] Clausewitz came to be celebrated as a greater theorist of war, but Jomini had enduring appeal

to military planners. Because he developed his theories while Napoleon

was at his peak, Jomini’s writing showed an optimism that is lacking in

Clausewitz. Hew Strachan notes how Jomini’s confi dence in his principles,

his “rational and managerial,” “prospective and purposeful” theory of war

and self-contained view of battle appealed to generations of American

generals and admirals. [^12]

c l a u s e w i t z

85

_Clausewitz’s Strategy_

In _On War_ , Clausewitz was attempting something very ambitious. More than a textbook for an aspiring general, this was a whole theory of war. His

achievement was to develop a conceptual framework that captured war’s

essence suffi ciently for subsequent generations to return to it when seeking to make sense of the confl icts of their own time. The ambiguities and tensions

in _On War_ allowed Marxists, Nazis, and liberals to claim it as authoritative

support for their own theories and strategies. 13]] Even those who considered _On_ _War_ wrongheaded and out of date entered into direct competition, as if their

own credibility depended on undermining Clausewitz. 14]] Contributing to the advanced scholarship on Clausewitz now requires discussing the adequacy

of the available translations, the interaction of biography and intellectual

development, what might be read into occasional phrases that are suggestive

of larger thoughts, and the dual meanings carried by key concepts and their

application in particular cases. 15

With this in mind, we can explore the theory of strategy that emerged

from Clausewitz’s theory of war. Clausewitz’s most famous dictum, that war

is a continuation of policy by other means, is a charter for strategists. The choice of the word _policy_ in the translation by Michael Howard and Peter Paret refl ected their view that the reference needed to be something above

everyday “politics,” a word which they saw as having negative connotations

in Britain and the United States. Bassford has argued that policy sounds too

settled, unilateral, and rational, while politics has the virtue of conveying interactivity, binding rivals together in their confl ict. 16]] Both meanings can be made to work. The key point is that insisting on political purpose takes

war away from mindless violence. This dictum does not propose that war is

always a sensible expression of policy, or that the movement from politics to war is from one defi ned state to another. The difference lies in the violence and the sharpness of the confrontation between two opposed wills. This in

turn exacerbates the infl uence of those factors of emotion and chance that are evident in the political sphere but become so much more signifi cant in the

military, and constantly complicate war’s conduct. So while Clausewitz by no

means rules out an effective strategy, for this would render _On War_ a pointless exercise, his stress was on the limits to strategy, the constraints that make it unwise to try to be too clever.

The challenge for politics, and therefore strategy, was to impose a sem-

blance of rationality, in terms of the dogged pursuit of state objectives.

Although his dictum came to be regularly cited as an authority for civil-

ian primacy over the military, Antulio Echevarria cautions that many of

86

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

Clausewitz’s thoughts on politics and international confl ict, especially in the unrevised sections, were circular and deterministic. The key to Clausewitz’s

greatness as theorist of war lay instead in the observation that was at the heart of his mature thought, that war was shaped by a

remarkable trinity—composed of primordial violence, hatred, and

enmity, which are to be regarded as a blind natural force; of the play of

chance and probability within which the creative spirit is free to roam;

and of its element of subordination, as an instrument of policy, which

makes [war] subject to reason alone. [^17]

His theory depended on the dynamic interplay of these three factors. The

trinity superseded the dictum, for it suggested that politics was not in com-

mand but one factor among three. With respect to the survival of the state in a challenging international system—which was how Clausewitz understood

the concept—politics must always set the terms for war, but politics could

not challenge the “grammar of war” lest it reduce the chances of success

and so the achievement of the ultimate objective. This could in turn lead

to military actions with great political consequences. Despite the apparent

subordination of the military to politics, the dynamic quality of the trinity

helped explained why the relationship was not so simple. 18

As a clash of opposing wills, a duel on a grand scale, war in the ideal

sense tended to absolute violence. Having posed this possibility, Clausewitz

pointed to the other two parts of the trinity to explain why it was unlikely to be realized. Politics was one source of restraint, but friction was another. This was one of Clausewitz’s most signifi cant contributions to military thought.

Friction helped explain the difference between war as it might be—that is,

absolute and unrestrained—and actual war. He explained the phenomenon in

one of his most celebrated passages:

Everything in war is simple, but the simplest thing is diffi cult. The

diffi culties accumulate and end by producing a kind of friction that

is inconceivable unless one has experienced war . . . Countless minor

incidents—the kind you can never really foresee—combine to lower

the general level of performance, so that one always falls short of the

intended goal.

The result was “effects that cannot be measured, just because they are largely due to chance.” Friction thus caused delay and confusion. Action in war

became like walking in water, and vision was regularly obscured. “All actions take place in something virtually akin to dusk, which in addition, like fog

or moonlight, gives objects an exaggerated size and a grotesque view.” 19]]

c l a u s e w i t z

87

Generals in charge of military organizations were doomed to disappointment. Everything would take longer than it should, and it would be hard to

generate the fl exibility needed to keep up with events.

Within the paradoxical trinity, violence and chance could still be sub-

ordinated to politics and the application of reason. If the strategist did not apply reason, war would become progressively chaotic and unpredictable.

The challenge for the intelligent strategist was to anticipate both the enemy and all those elements of friction and chance that got in the way. The correct approach was not to give up and assume that chaos and unpredictability

would mock all plans and overwhelm best efforts but rather to prepare for

such eventualities in advance. The test of a great general was making a plan

that he could see through. Clausewitz wrote about the need for the com-

mander to be a military genius, but he did not necessarily mean an excep-

tional, once-in-a-generation individual such as Napoleon. Genius required a

grasp of the demands of war, the nature of the enemy, and the need to stay

cool at all times. Indeed, Clausewitz was wary of the general who tried to be too smart. He preferred those who kept their imaginations in check and a

fi rm grip on the harsh realities of battle.

So while his description of war suggested that the wise course would be to

retain maximum fl exibility and prepare to seize opportunities as they arose, he came to the opposite conclusion, arguing for a clear plan of conduct based on a series of connected, sequential steps. He preferred a stress on careful

planning without distractions. The strategist must “draft the plan of the war, and the aim will determine the series of actions intended to achieve it.” [^20]

A war should not be started without a plan for its conduct fi rmly in mind.

Once implementation had begun, it should only be amended at times of

unavoidable necessity. [^21] Clausewitz’s defi nition of strategy as “the use of the engagement to achieve the objectives of the war” translated political goals

into a military aim. The strategist would “shape the individual campaigns

and, within these, decide on the individual engagements.” 22]] Preferring to enter war with a plan for victory was understandable. But why the confi dence that any plan could be implemented?

Clausewitz offered three reasons. First, despite all the talk of unpredict-

ability, not everything was a mystery. Certain actions had known effects.

An enemy attacked from behind or caught in an ambush would exhibit

lower morale and less bravery. Most importantly, it was possible to make

relatively objective assessments of the opposing sides, taking into account

their experience and their “spirit and temper.” While the enemy’s own plans

and responses to situations could not be known exactly, the laws of prob-

ability could be applied. Confronting an excitable visionary would require a

88

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

different plan than that for an enemy known to be hard and calculating. The bold would be granted more respect than the cautious, the active more than

the passive, and the clever more than the stupid.

A second factor was the unreliability of intelligence. Without a robust

starting plan, occasional reports might cause an undue deviation: “Many

intelligence reports in war are contradictory; even more are false, and most

are uncertain.” Furthermore, intelligence tended to have a pessimistic bias.

The exaggeration of bad news led to gloomy and despondent commanders

who conjured up landscapes of imagined perils: “War has a way of mask-

ing the stage with scenery crudely daubed with fearsome apparitions.” These

vivid impressions overwhelmed systematic thought, and so “even the man

who planned the operation and now sees it being carried out may well lose

confi dence in his earlier judgment.” He must therefore exorcise false appearances by trusting instead in “the laws of probability” and in his own judg-

ment gained from “knowledge of men and affairs and from common sense.” [^23]

With improved information gathering, Clausewitz’s advice to ignore timely

intelligence now appears as more of a recipe for disaster than a means of

avoiding unnecessary panic.

Third, both sides were subject to friction, so it was a poor excuse for

defeat. The question was who could cope with it better. The essence of good

generalship was to triumph over friction, to the extent possible, through both careful planning and maintaining a presence of mind when the unexpected

happened. 24 “The good general must know friction in order to overcome it

whenever possible, and in order not to expect a standard of achievement in

his operations which this very friction makes impossible.” [^25] This important qualifi cation warned against excessive strategic ambition.

So size mattered. Armies were “so much alike” that there was “little dif-

ference between the best and the worst of them.” The most reliable means

to success, in both tactics and strategy, was therefore superiority in num-

bers: “The skill of the greatest commanders may be counterbalanced by a

two-to-one ratio in the fi ghting forces.” Clausewitz could see the attraction of cunning, indirect strategies, which could confuse the enemy and lower

morale. He noted that it might be thought that “strategy” took its name

from “trickery,” but he saw little historical evidence that tricks (stratagems) could be effective and considered it dangerous to make a false impression by

deploying large forces, which might be left in the wrong position when they

were really needed. At the tactical level, surprise was important and attain-

able, but at the strategic level the mobilization and movement of forces were likely to give the game away. Friction was also a major factor, holding up the sort of movements necessary to catch the enemy unawares. So when it came to

c l a u s e w i t z

89

the choice of force or guile, Clausewitz opted for the former. The “strategist’s chessmen do not have the kind of mobility that is essential for stratagem

and cunning . . . accurate and penetrating understanding is a more useful and essential asset for the commander than any gift for cunning.” His advice was

to keep the plan simple, especially against a capable opponent. A simple plan would require the excellent execution of each engagement; for this reason,

tactical success was vital. In this respect, the strategic plan survived so long as successive engagements were being won.

This put a premium on knowing when to stop. An enemy willing and

able to redouble his efforts put a fi nal victory out of reach. Another important Clausewitzian concept was the “culminating point of victory,” the point at

which further attack could lead to a reversal of fortunes. It was “important to

calculate this point correctly when planning the campaign.” 26]] This was about the developing balance of advantage as a campaign progressed. After being

wounded, would the enemy collapse with exhaustion or be enraged? What

were the distractions to be avoided, the opportunistic but diverting targets

away from the main line of advance? There would be temptations to capture

“certain geographical points” or seize “undefended provinces,” as if they had value in themselves as “windfall profi ts,” but that could put the main aim at risk. A consistent, focused approach should discourage disruption. Here were

the reasons for Napoleon’s failure in 1812.

The Russian campaign and lack of confi dence in strategies based on sur-

prise and complex maneuvers led Clausewitz to the view that the advantage

lay with the defense. The forward movement necessary to occupy enemy ter-

ritory taxed the attacker’s energies and resources, while the defender was able to use this time to prepare to receive the attacker. “Time which is allowed

to pass unused accumulates to the credit of the defender.” Surprise could

work as much in favor of the defense as the offense. It was about catching

the enemy unawares with regard to “plans and dispositions, especially those

concerning the distribution of forces.” The attacker was “free to strike at any point along the whole line of defense, and in full force,” but could still be surprised if the defender was stronger than expected at the spot chosen. The

defender operated on familiar ground, could choose his position carefully, and enjoyed short supply lines and a friendly local population, which could be a

source of intelligence and even reserves. Even if the offensive succeeded, the occupying force might be ground down through insurrectionary or partisan

warfare, as Napoleon discovered in Spain. Moreover, so long as the defending

state could avoid surrender, other states might join in on its side. According to prevailing notions of the “balance of power,” other states were likely to

intervene against a determined aggressor in order to prevent it becoming too

90

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

powerful. Even the strongest individual state could be defeated by an organized coalition ranged against it and determined to restore equilibrium to

the international system. This too Napoleon discovered to his cost. But while Clausewitz described defense as the stronger form of fi ghting, he also noted that its purpose was negative. It was limited, passive, concerned only with

preservation. Only attack could secure the objectives of war. Defense was

unavoidably preferred by the weak, but once there was a favorable balance

of strength, the incentives were to move to the attack. “A sudden powerful

transition to the offensive—the fl ashing sword of vengeance—is the greatest

moment for the defense.” 27

When it came to the offense, another important Clausewitzian concept

was the “center of gravity” ( _Schwerpunkt_ ). Along with a number of his other concepts, including friction, this was taken from the physics of the day.

A center of gravity represented the point where the forces of gravity could

be said to converge within an object, the spot at which the object’s weight

was balanced in all directions. Striking at or otherwise upsetting the center of gravity could cause objects to lose balance and fall to the ground. For

a simple, symmetrical shape, fi nding the center of gravity was straightfor-

ward. Once an object had moving parts or changes in composition, the center

would be constantly shifting. Clausewitz never quite got to grips with the

metaphor. “A center of gravity,” he explained, “is always found where the

mass is concentrated the most densely. It presents the most effective tar-

get for a blow; furthermore, the heaviest blow is that struck by the center

of gravity.” The _Schwerpunkt_ was “the central feature of the enemy’s power”

and therefore “the point against which all our energies should be directed.”

This required tracing back the “ultimate substance” of enemy strength to its

source and then directing the attack against this source. The target might not be a concentration of physical strength but possibly the point where enemy

forces connected and were given direction. Any disruption would maximize

effects beyond the immediate point to the larger whole.

Though he did not fully follow this through, Clausewitz recognized that

the critical point might be a capital city or the coherence of an alliance.

With respect to alliances, which had been central to the ebb and fl ow of the Napoleonic Wars, Clausewitz understood that individual members would

always have their own interests at the fore and that joining an alliance could carry risks (for example, by attracting force away from a partner or by having to aid a much weaker partner). If the alliance was to prosper, it needed a unity of political purpose or at least “the interests and forces of most of the allies”

must be “subordinate to those of the leader.” This offered a center of gravity that an opponent could challenge, disrupting the alliance by encouraging

c l a u s e w i t z

91

disunity. [^28] Not all peacetime alliances even turned into a joint enterprise against a common foe, as the matter became akin to a “business deal” and

actions were “clogged with diplomatic reservations.” [^29]

From this it can be seen that the identity of a center of gravity was not

obvious. The concept only made any sense if it was assumed that the enemy

could be viewed holistically, as a unity, so that an attack on the point where it came together could throw it off balance or cause collapse. But there might be no obvious single focal point, if the enemy did not present itself in that way. On this basis, a loose coalition might be harder to disrupt than a tight alliance, although it might fi ght less effectively for the same reason. 30]] If the enemy was not totally committed—for example, in a limited war—there

might be even less reason to expect that a blow against its army would have

an impact much beyond the area in which it was committed. Yet it was this

concept, as much as any other of Clausewitz’s, that came to be embedded in

Western military thought, although often as a source of confusion rather than clarity.

_The Sources of Victory_

As Clausewitz described the nature of war, strategy became a sustained act of will, required in order to master its terrible uncertainties and resulting from human frailties and the capricious impact of chance. Since the enemy faced

the same problems, it was still possible to prevail by bringing superior force to bear against the enemy’s center of gravity. Clausewitz was of the view,

almost taken for granted in his time, that once the enemy army was defeated

in battle, the route to victory was clear. Without an army a state was help-

less. It could either be eliminated, gobbled up in its entirety, or forced to accept whatever terms the victor might impose. Because of this, states would

do everything possible to avoid defeat and carry on the fi ght in some way. In the new post-1789 era, this was as much a matter of popular enthusiasm as

governmental judgment.

Clausewitz understood how policy linked the statesman and the gen-

eral: policy gave the general his objectives and the resources available to

meet them. As for these objectives, Strachan refers to a creed of 1815, “For

me the chief rules of politics [or policy] are: never be helpless; expect nothing from the generosity of another; do not give up an objective before it

becomes impossible; hold sacred the honor of the state.” 31]] In giving direction to strategy, therefore, policy was essentially an expression of national interests in relations with other states. Clausewitz acknowledged, but did not

The False Science

_Tell me how the Germans have trained you to fi ght Bonaparte by this_

_new science you call ‘strategy.’_

—Tolstoy, _War and Peace_

The miseries and privations associated with the Napoleonic Wars

led to the development of an international peace movement. Over the

course of the nineteenth century, this movement encouraged the formation

of “peace societies” and the convening of humanitarian conferences. War was

denounced as not only uncivilized, wasteful, and destructive, but also funda-

mentally irrational. In particular, it was an offense against economics. This was put most succinctly by John Stuart Mill in 1848: “It is commerce which

is rapidly rendering war obsolete, by strengthening and multiplying the per-

sonal interests which act in natural opposition to it.” The eager proponents

of free trade saw how this could create forms of international intercourse that would render resort to war self-evidently foolish as well as awful, producing

a formidable combination of morality and utilitarianism. 1

The British proponents of free trade might have thought this a far more

effi cient way of managing international affairs than one based on nationalism and war, with peace dependent on a tenuous balance of power. From the perspective of those less well placed, this appeared as a self-serving claim. The Prussian economist Friedrich List observed, in an argument that many still

fi nd compelling, that free trade would result in “a universal subjection of the less advanced nations to the supremacy of the predominant manufacturing,

commercial, and naval power.” [^2] A far greater problem was to ignore the factor that had so stunned Clausewitz during his early military career, a force that

“beggared all imagination.” The French Revolution had brought the people,

with all their passion and fervor, to the fore. Napoleon had turned this into a source of his power, using it to develop his own personality cult and draw

on popular enthusiasm to create an army with high morale and commitment,

convinced of an inextricable, patriotic link between their own well-being

and the success of the state. Clausewitz’s grasp of the signifi cance of this new factor, which led him to make it part of his trinity, helped make his theory

so durable. He understood the impact of popular passion on how wars were

fought, by undermining attempts at restraint, and he recognized nationalism

as a source of war. As France became seen as a threat, people elsewhere rallied behind their own fl ags. The people identifi ed not with each other but with

the nation. “Between two peoples,” Clausewitz observed, “there can be such

tensions, such a mass of infl ammable material.” 3]]

This went against notions of progressive civility in international affairs

and added a cautionary note to demands for greater democracy. It under-

mined the claims of liberal reformers that war was an elite conspiracy. The

speed and ease with which a belligerent nationalism could be tapped could

therefore come as a rude shock to the radical, anti-war free-marketeers. The

Crimean War that began just after the century’s midway point demonstrated

the strength of popular enthusiasm (even in Britain) for war-making. Not for

the last time would liberal reformers fi nd themselves caught between dispas-

sionate utilitarianism and passionate democracy. This chapter discusses how

this issue of war and politics was considered by two very distinctive person-

alities, neither of whom were liberals: the Russian writer Count Leo Tolstoy, who disputed that mass armies were ever truly controlled by their generals,

and the German Field Marshal Helmuth von Moltke, who explored to the

full the possibilities and limitations of command.

_Tolstoy and History_

The experience of Crimea had a very personal impact on Leo Tolstoy, a young,

aristocratic Russian offi cer posted to Sebastapol during the war. Tolstoy was attracted to the good life but preoccupied with religion. He began to acquire fame as a writer by sending commentaries back from the front. They were

fi lled with his sharp observations of how individuals were caught up in the

t h e f a l s e s c i e n c e

97

arbitrariness of confl ict. Tolstoy witnessed Russian soldiers cut down by enemy fi re and their bodies left behind as the army retreated. He became

increasingly annoyed at the insensitivity and incompetence of Russia’s elite

and explored how literature could express the experiences of the peasantry

as well as the nobility. In 1863, he began six years of work that would lead

to his masterpiece, _War and Peace_ . Though a diligent researcher who studied documents, interviewed survivors, and walked around the battlegrounds of

1812, his approach was antipathetic to that of professional historians, just as it broke with conventions of fi ction in its approach to plot. The book was,

he explained, “what the author wanted and was able to express, in the form

in which it is expressed.” Part of the mixture, introduced during the book’s

later revisions, included short essays challenging conventional views of his-

tory and, by extension, a Clausewitzian view of strategy.

Clausewitz represented much of what Tolstoy opposed. He even made

a minor appearance in _War and Peace_ . Prince Andrei Bolkonsky (assumed to be representing Tolstoy’s views) overheard a conversation between two

Germans, Adjutant General Wolzogen and Clausewitz. One said, “The war

must be extended widely,” and the other agreed that “the only aim is to

weaken the enemy, so of course one cannot take into account the loss of pri-

vate individuals.” This left Andrei cross. The extension would be in an area

where his father, son, and sister were staying. His judgment was scornful.

Prussia had “yielded up all Europe to him [Napoleon], and have now come to

teach us. Fine teachers!” 4 Their theories were “not worth an empty eggshell.”

Tolstoy was hostile to the conceits of political leaders who mistakenly

considered themselves to be in control of events, as well as historians who

believed that they understood them. As even sympathetic readers found it

hard to get to grips with his views—which were never likely to fi nd much

favor with political, military, or intellectual elites—it is not surprising that his ideas had no infl uence on the actual practice of strategy in his time. But Tolstoy’s wider political infl uence spread during the rest of the century and affected attempts to develop nonviolent strategies. His general critique had

its echoes over the next century.

Making sense of Tolstoy’s philosophy of history is no easy task. Indeed the

erudition deployed by Isaiah Berlin in his attempt to do so was considered a

small masterpiece in itself. 5 T]]olstoy deplored the “great man theory of history,” the idea that events were best explained by references to the wishes and decisions of individuals who through their position and special qualities were able to push events in one direction rather than another. His objection went

beyond the normal complaint about such theories, that they underplayed

the importance of broader economic, social, and political trends. Tolstoy

98

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

appeared to distrust all theories that attempted to put the study of human affairs on a quasi-scientifi c basis by imposing abstract categories and assuming an inner rationality. General Pfühl would have attributed success to his

theory of “oblique movement deduced by him from the history of Frederick

the Great’s wars” but blamed failure on imperfect implementation.

Tolstoy stressed the “sum of men’s individual wills” rather than just those

of the senior but ultimately deluded fi gures who believed that their deci-

sions had signifi cant effects. He saw a dualism in man, in whom could be

found both an individual life—free in its own way—and a “swarm-life” by

which he “inevitably obeys laws laid down for him,” living consciously for

himself but also as an “unconscious instrument in the attainment of the his-

torical, universal, aims of humanity.” Here Tolstoy joined those who sought

to reconcile the ability of individuals to choose and act independently with a conviction that humanity as a whole was following a distinct path, whether

set down by a divine hand, historical forces, collective emotions, or the logic of the marketplace. At some point in this reconciliation, Tolstoy supposed,

individual possibilities would become submerged by the whole. The chal-

lenge in this philosophy was not to those low in the social structure but to

those at the top, the elites who believed that they were making history.

One clear diffi culty with this thesis, even when Tolstoy was telling the

story, was that the leading actors on the political stage did make a differ-

ence, and their decisions had consequences. It would be odd to assert that

European history would have been exactly the same had Napoleon not been

born. Accepting that history could not be a pseudo-science did not require

denying the possibility of systematic thought and conceptualization. It was

also odd to use Napoleon’s performance at Borodino to debunk the great man

theory of history. This was, as Gallie notes, “one of the strangest, least typical, of campaigns known to history,” yet Tolstoy uses it to make points of uni-

versal validity to be applied to matters far less strange and atypical. 6]] Tolstoy showed the emperor pretending to be master of events over which in practice

he had no control. He was all bustle and activity, beguiled by an “artifi cial phantasm of life,” issuing orders of great precision too far from the battlefi eld to make a real difference: “none of his orders were executed and during the

battle he did not know what was going on.” Instead, he played out a role as

“representative of authority.” According to Tolstoy, he did this rather well.

“He did nothing harmful to the progress of the battle, as he inclined to the

most reasonable opinions, made no confusion, did not contradict himself, did

not get frightened or run away from the fi eld of battle, but with great tact and military experience carried out his role of appearing to command calmly

and with dignity.” The orders he sent out rarely made sense to those receiving t h e f a l s e s c i e n c e

99

them, and what he heard in return was often overtaken by events by the time it reached him. This was not, however, Napoleon’s problem that day: he

was unwell and, unusually for him, uncertain about where to put his main

effort. Then, when he had his opportunity to scatter the enemy, he lacked the reserve strength to take it. Tolstoy hardly chose this particular great man at the height of his power. When describing Napoleon at Austerlitz, Tolstoy

recognized those qualities which made his contemporaries treat the emperor

with awe and admiration, however grudging.

By contrast, Tolstoy was kind to Kutuzov, who was portrayed as having an

inner wisdom despite his apparent stupidity, because he grasped the logic of

the situation. When it came to knowledge of the supposed military sciences,

Napoleon had the advantage over Kutuzov, but the Russian understood

something deeper and more profound, and could see how the situation was

bound to develop. Kutuzov told Prince Andrei that “time and patience are

the strongest warriors.” The young man concluded that the old man could

grasp “the inevitable march of events” and had the wisdom to avoid med-

dling. In this way, Kutuzov’s passivity during the battle refl ected wisdom

more than inertia, a reliance on the army’s spirit rather than a commander’s

orders. The only time he issued an order was at the point of defeat. It was to prepare for a counterattack, impossible in the circumstances. The aim was

to give heart to his men rather than convey a real intention. In Tolstoy’s

account, the French offensive fl oundered because they lacked the moral force to press on, while the Russians had the moral force to resist.

Tolstoy’s contempt for the “new science” of strategy was a warning against

the “erroneous idea that the command which precedes the event causes the

event.” Though thousands of commands would be issued, historians focused

only on the few executed that were consistent with events while forgetting

“the others that were not executed because they could not be.” 7]] This was a challenge to a strategic approach that generated plans and issued orders for

actions that could affect few of the many factors in play and was based on

ignorance about the actual state of affairs. Tolstoy described chaotic delib-

erations in July 1812, when Russian commanders wondered how to cope

with the advancing Napoleon. At issue was whether to abandon the camp at

Drissa. For one general, the problem was that the camp had a river behind

it; for another, that was what constituted its value. Prince Andrei listened to the cacophony of voices and opinions and all these “surmises, plans, refuta-tions, and shouts” and concluded that “there is not and cannot be any science of war, and that therefore there can be no such thing as a military genius.”

In these matters, the conditions and circumstances were unknown and could

not be defi ned. Not enough was understood about the strength of Russian

100

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

or French forces. All depended “on innumerable conditions, the signifi cance of which is determined at a particular moment which arrives no one knows

when.” The attribution of genius to military men refl ected no more than the

pomp and power with which they were invested, and the sycophants who

fl attered them. Not only were there no special qualities that made for a good commander, but a commander seemed to function most effectively without

“the highest and best human attributes—love, poetry, tenderness, and philo-

sophic inquiring doubt.” The success of military action depended not on such

people but rather “on the man in the ranks who shouts, ‘We are lost!’ or who

shouts, ‘Hurrah!’ ” 8]]

Battle was inherently confusing, and there was unlikely to be a clear link

between orders as cause and actions as effect. But part of strategy was to

understand what battle could and could not achieve. In this regard, Russia’s

fate was determined by strategy as much as any elemental forces beyond

human comprehension. As Lieven notes, Tolstoy failed to credit the clarity of the Tsar’s strategy and the extent to which events unfolded according to plan, as the Tsar anticipated. Nonetheless, more than “all the history books ever

written,” _War and Peace_ shaped popular perceptions of Napoleon’s defeat. “By denying any rational direction of events in 1812 by human actors and implying that military professionalism was a German disease Tolstoy feeds rather

easily into Western interpretations of 1812 which blame snow or chance for

French defeat.” 9 It was one thing to acknowledge that military or]]ganizations would not always be responsive to the demands of the center. Orders would

be misinterpreted; intelligence would be faulty; original campaign plans

would need to be modifi ed and at times supplanted. It was entirely different to insist that commands could never be effectual and change the course of a

battle or to deny the potential of leadership; the relevance of intelligence, advice, and orders; and the infl uence of professional experience, training, and competence. Perhaps for Tolstoy, developing his anarchist philosophy, less

important than whether some were able to shape events more than others was

whether they should ever be able to do so. In objecting to the very idea of the exercise of power, the arrogance of those who claimed to control the lives of others, he sought to minimize its impact.

The issue for Tolstoy was not that events lacked causes but that there were

so many. Historians picked the most obvious and thus missed out on so many

more. As Berlin put it, “No theories can possibly fi t the immense variety of possible human behavior, the vast multiplicity of minute, undiscoverable

causes and effects which form that interplay of men and nature which history

purports to record _._ ” 10 One sympathetic interpreter has sought to show how]]

Tolstoy effectively punctured the pretensions of not only the philosophers of t h e f a l s e s c i e n c e

101

his time but also subsequent social scientists who took advantage of hindsight by seeking only evidence or a singular factor that supported their theories and ignoring anything contradictory. Historians also focused on decisive moments, but such moments were rare because outcomes were the produce

of many separate moments, each containing its own contingent possibili-

ties. Their explanations missed signifi cant aspects that remained hidden from view while giving undue prominence to others. This is why historical interpretations were regularly challenged and revised. On this basis, Gary Morson

identifi ed with Tolstoy’s belief that true understanding only existed in the present and events were decided “on the instant.” This is why Kutuzov’s best

advice before the battle was to get a good night’s sleep: immediate attentiveness to unfolding possibilities was going to be more valuable than forward

planning. [^11]

Salutary warnings about the limits to central control or grand theory were

one thing; suggestions that everything came down to small, immediate deci-

sions—as if some were no more important than others and past decisions had

no consequences whatsoever for those which came later—were quite another.

Historians might struggle to capture the totality of the processes they sought to explain, but there was always a possibility of reinterpretations. Historians looked to the past, while strategists addressed the future. The challenge was how to respond in unpredictable situations in which only certain factors were subject to infl uence but something still had to be done, such that inaction

was also a portentous decision. With the benefi t of hindsight, the historian might see how it all might have been different. But choices had to be made

at the time in the face of unknowns. Most seriously, there was a fundamental

contradiction in this line of argument. Under the charge of irrelevance, the

generals and their theories were left off the hook, perhaps looking foolish

but no longer dangerous. If they were relevant they should be answerable for

their follies.

_Von Moltke_

The year after _War and Peace_ was published there was a fateful demonstration of the strategist’s art that showed how consequential it could be, as well as its limitations. The occasion was the 1870 Franco-Prussian War, and the

commanding fi gure was Field Marshal Helmuth Karl Bernhard Graf von

Moltke. Von Moltke was a self-proclaimed follower of Clausewitz and one

of his most effective promoters. He was even a student at the Prussian War

College when the master was in charge. Although the two do not appear to

102

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

have met, Clausewitz marked von Moltke’s report “exemplary.” Von Moltke read _On War_ after it appeared in limited circulation in 1832. [^12] He was born in the nineteenth century’s fi rst year and lived until its ninety-fi rst. He was chief of staff of the Prussian army for thirty years and can claim to be one of the century’s greatest and most successful military strategists.

Although born into the nobility, his family was poor. His army career

began at the age of 11 when he was sent to cadet school in Denmark. Cultured

and well read, he would have been classed as a liberal humanist until the

revolutions of 1848 caused him to move abruptly to the right and become a

tough patriot and uncompromising anti-socialist. He became chief of staff in

1857 and created the system that set the standards for military professional-

ism for the next hundred years. He addressed all aspects of military organization, armament, training, and logistics. The fi rst war in which he made his

mark was one against the Danes in 1864, but it was the campaigns that led

to German unifi cation under Prussia and the supplanting of France as the

strongest power in Europe that made his name.

Von Moltke wrote little about strategy. Gunther Rothenberg describes

him as a “grammarian” who “engaged in very little abstract speculation.” 13

His most important contributions, which were written before and after his

most spectacular success in the 1870 Franco-Prussian War, betray the infl u-

ence of Clausewitz. Yet in two critical respects he moved beyond Clausewitz

and the Napoleonic model. By the 1860s far more could be done with armies

than had been possible at the start of the century, as a result of the arrival of the railways as well as improved road networks. Von Moltke was unusually alert to the logistical potential of these developments, appreciating what could be achieved once it was possible to move mass armies with relative ease.

He also recognized the potential for deadlock if both sides mobilized large

human reserves and a war carried on without either side quite being able to

bring it to a conclusion.

The second factor infl uencing von Moltke’s approach was that he inter-

nalized Clausewitz’s dictum about war being a continuation of politics. He

happily served his monarch and less happily shared infl uence with Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. He acquired as a result a sense of the uncertain fi t between political ends and military means, but also of the possibilities of limited war and the value of allies. While, à la Clausewitz, he believed the object of

war was to “implement the government’s policy by force,” he grumbled that

politicians (read Bismarck) might demand more from war than it could real-

istically deliver. Once objectives were set, it was up to the military to realize them. “Political considerations can be taken into account only as long as

they do not make demands that are militarily improper or impossible.” Yet

t h e f a l s e s c i e n c e

103

if some ends could not be met, a dialogue between the military and political spheres was unavoidable: they could not work in splendid isolation from

each other, one setting the ends and the other the means. This was evident in von Moltke’s defi nition of victory: “the highest goal attainable with available means.” His attitude toward battle was close to that of Clausewitz, but fi rmer in his conviction that victory was the best means to decide a war.

The victory in the decision by arms is the most important moment in

war. Only victory breaks the enemy will and compels him to submit

to our own. Neither the occupation of territory nor the capturing of

fortifi ed places, but only the destruction of the enemy fi ghting-power

will, as a rule, decide. This is thus the primary objective of operations.

This did not really help with wars fought for limited objectives when the effort required to destroy the enemy fi ghting power would not be commensurate.

More innovative in von Moltke’s approach to strategy was his refusal

to be locked into any system or plan. He was responsible for the famous

observation that “no plan survived contact with the enemy.” He told his

commanders that war could not be “conducted on a green table” and was

prepared to delegate authority so that they could respond to situations as

they found them rather than how the high command expected them to be.

He distrusted generalities and fi xed precepts. The important thing was to

keep the objective in view while accepting the need for “practical adapta-

tion.” He was wary of abstractions and attempts to establish general princi-

ples. For von Moltke, strategy was instead a “free, practical, artistic activity”

and a “system of expediencies.” [^14] The choice of strategy might be based on common sense: the test of character was to fi nd this in situations of extreme stress. Because of Prussia’s challenging strategic position, there was always a risk of others joining in once a war had begun. Victory therefore had to be swift and conclusive, and that meant there was no option but to get on the

offensive as soon as possible. At the same time, von Moltke was conscious

of developing battlefi eld conditions, in particular the impact of increasingly deadly fi repower, so he was also anxious to avoid frontal assaults. Although he saw strategy as playing on the unpredictable aspects of confl icts and

the unexpected opportunities this could create, at this point the task was

handed over to tactics as strategy became “silent.” In this he took a different view from Clausewitz, who saw the completion of battle as a task for strategy. Von Moltke saw the tactical task as conceptually simple—destroying

as much of the enemy force as possible—but practically challenging, which

was why his preparations for battle were meticulous. Once battle was done

strategy came back into play. 15]]

104

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

His approach, described as “strategic envelopment,” was based on concentrating superior forces faster than the enemy and came to be a feature of

German strategy thereafter. As with Napoleon and Clausewitz before him,

von Moltke was in no doubt about the importance of numbers. Prior to war,

size could be bolstered through coalition, and one of the consequences of the war of 1866 with Austria was to acquire allies among the smaller German

states. During war, superior force could be brought to bear at a particular

point, irrespective of the broader balance of power. To achieve this it was necessary to mobilize quickly, and this was the area where careful planning could make a difference. Under von Moltke, the general staff, which had long had a

role in Prussian military preparations, was expanded and elevated. It became

not only the source but also the custodian of military plans, responsible for design and then execution.

Von Moltke’s most radical innovation as a commander, which went against

the textbooks of the time, was to divide his army so that both parts could

be kept supplied until they would combine for the battle (“march divided;

strike united”). The risks were that they might be caught separately and be

overwhelmed, or brought together too quickly, thus putting a strain on sup-

plies. In the 1866 war with Austria he used the railways to get his troops into position fi rst, even though Austria had been the fi rst to mobilize. Observers were staggered when he allowed his two armies to be separated by some one

hundred miles. If the Austrian commanders had been more alert, this could

have proved disastrous for von Moltke. In the end, the Austrians were caught

by two armies arriving from different directions.

This victory set up a war with France for which von Moltke prepared

carefully. This time he divided his army into three, giving him maximum

fl exibility so he could react quickly as the French plan became apparent. He kept his options open until it was time to strike.

It is even better if the forces can be moved on the day of the battle

from separate points against the battlefi eld itself. In other words, if

the operations can be directed in such a manner that the last brief

march from different directions leads to the front and into the fl ank

of the enemy, then the strategy has achieved the best that it is able to

achieve, and great results must follow.

This could not, however, be guaranteed. Factors of space and time might be

calculated, but not the variables where decision-making would also depend

upon “the outcome of previous minor battles, on the weather, on false news;

in brief, on all that is called chance and luck in human affairs.” 16]] Concentrate too early or too late and it might be impossible to recover.

t h e f a l s e s c i e n c e

105

In the critical war with France in 1870, von Moltke’s victory was complete, at least in terms of the conventional phase of the war. He caught out the French army fi rst in Metz on August 18 and then two weeks later at Sedan.

Not all of his commanders followed the plan, but their lapses were more than

compensated for by the numerous mistakes and outdated methods of the

French side. Although the French army was defeated after seven weeks, the

war was not over. Irregular and regular forces came together in France to form a government of national defense. This was a vivid demonstration of how

political victory did not always follow automatically from battlefi eld victory.

As the Germans moved toward Paris, von Moltke was aware of the potential

vulnerability of extended lines of communication and the continuing ability

of the French navy to keep the country supplied. There was an argument with

Chancellor Otto von Bismarck over whether to bombard Paris. Von Moltke

was worried this would only stiffen French resistance and preferred a siege.

Bismarck worried that a slow conclusion to the campaign might prompt

Britain and Austria to enter the war on France’s side. The Kaiser agreed with his chancellor and the bombardment began in January 1871. The French

government lacked the stomach for a fi ght and began to negotiate. It was

still not over, for then there was a popular revolt, in the form of the Paris Commune. An improvised, irregular army animated by popular passions but

lacking in discipline appalled von Moltke. 17]] Nor was he much pleased with losing the debate over strategy. Bismarck had confessed, to his “shame,” that he had never read Clausewitz, but he had a clear view on the continuing role

of politics once war had begun. “To fi x and limit the objects to be attained by the war, and to advise the monarch in respect of them, is and remains during

the war just as before it a political function, and the manner in which these questions are solved cannot be without infl uence on the conduct of the war.” 18]]

Von Moltke accepted that the aims of war were determined by policy.

Once fi ghting began, however, the military must be given a free hand: “strategy” must be “fully independent of policy.” This belief went back to the for-

mation of the Prussian general staff after the defeat at Jena in 1806, in order to guard against princely incompetence. Von Moltke judged this role to be

as essential as ever. Surround a commander in the fi eld with “independent

and negative counselors” and nothing would ever get done. “They will pres-

ent every diffi culty, they will have foreseen all eventualities; they will always be right; they will defeat every positive idea because they have none of their own. These counselors are the spoilers; they negate the Army leader.” 19]] There was an unavoidable tension at the heart of von Moltke’s position. It was illuminated by his reported conversation with crown prince Frederick William

at the height of the crisis. Von Moltke explained that after Paris was taken

106

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

the army would “push forward into the south of France in order to fi nally break the enemy’s power.” When asked about the risks of Prussian strength

being exhausted so that battles could no longer be won, he denied the pos-

sibility. “We must always win battles. We must throw France completely to

the ground.” Then “we can dictate the kind of peace we want.” “What if,”

wondered the crown prince, “we ourselves bleed to death in the process?”

Von Moltke replied : “We shall not bleed to death and, if we do, we shall have got peace in return.” He was then asked whether he was informed about the

current political situation, as this “might perhaps make such a course seem

unwise.” “No,” the fi eld marshal replied, “I have only to concern myself with

military matters.” 20

Out of these highly charged debates emerged a concept of crucial impor-

tance for subsequent military thought. Stressing his delegated powers from

the Kaiser to issue operational commands, von Moltke identifi ed the opera-

tional level of war as the one within which the commander must expect no

political interference. The episode over Paris might have just demonstrated

the fantasy of this political exclusion, but for commanders in the fi eld this became an article of faith, essential to the proper and successful implementation of strategy.

Annihilation or Exhaustion

_Git thar fustest with the mostest._

—General Nathan B. Forrest, _quoted (probably incorrectly) on strategy_

At the start of the twentieth century, the military historian Hans

Delbrück argued that all military strategy could be divided into two

basic forms. The fi rst, conforming to the majority view of the day was

_Niederwerfungsstrategie_ , the strategy of annihilation, which demanded a decisive battle to eliminate the enemy’s army. The second drew on Clausewitz’s

note of 1827 which recognized the possibility for another type of war when the

available military means could not deliver a decisive battle. 1]] This Delbrück described as _Ermattungsstrategie_ , the strategy of exhaustion, sometimes translated as attrition. Whereas with a strategy of annihilation there was just one pole, the battle, with exhaustion there was another pole, involving a variety of ways to achieve the political ends of war, including occupying territory,

destroying crops, and blockading. In the past, these alternative approaches,

for want of better options, had often been used and could be effective. What

was important was to be fl exible when deciding upon a strategy, to attend to the political realities of the time, and to not rely on a military strategy that might be beyond practical capacity.

Delbrück did not intend to imply that the strongest was bound to be

attracted by annihilation whereas the weak were fated to do what they could

through exhaustion. Exhaustion was not about a single decisive battle but

about an extended campaign that would wear the enemy out. He mocked the idea of a “pure maneuver strategy that allows war to be conducted without

bloodshed.” There was always a possibility of battle. His view of a strategy

of exhaustion was more operational than an anticipation of the later concept

of attritional war. This placed more emphasis on how underlying economic,

industrial, and demographic factors would sustain warfare.

Delbrück’s analysis led him into furious arguments with the historians of

the German general staff, especially when Delbrück argued that Frederick

the Great had practiced limited war rather than decisive battle. The history

was on his side, in that Frederick had become wary of battle and careful in his ambition, but there was still a problem with the dichotomous presentation

of complex options. 2 The problem was to suggest that a fundamental choice

had to be made in advance about how to comport an army for a coming war,

a tendency that remained evident in strategic debate over the coming cen-

tury. The challenge for Delbrück at this time, however, was to get German

generals to contemplate anything other than a swift offensive leading to the

annihilation of the enemy army in a decisive battle.

_The American Civil War_

The complex relationship between theory and practice in strategy was

revealed by the American Civil War (1861–1865). At one level, the out-

come of the war was the result of the North enjoying twice the population

and far greater industrial strength than the South. For much of the war the

Confederacy could claim more imaginative generals. As the weaker side it

might have been tempted to rely on defensive tactics, but instead often took

the military initiative, perhaps in the hope that the North would respect

the outcome of a truly decisive battle. President Lincoln saw clearly that the Union’s strategy required an offensive, but to his exasperation his generals

seemed to be unable to mount one successfully until quite late in the war.

Clausewitz had no discernible infl uence on these events. That was not so

with Jomini. The leading teacher at West Point, Dennis Mahan, had spent

time in France studying the Napoleonic Wars and was an avowed Jominian,

while his star pupil, Henry “Old Brains” Halleck, who became President

Lincoln’s general-in-chief, had gone so far as to translate Jomini’s _Life of_ _Napoleon_ into English. Mahan celebrated Napoleon’s military art,

by which an enemy is broken and utterly dispersed by one and the

same blow. No futilities of preparation; no uncertain feeling about in

a n n i h i l a t i o n o r e x h a u s t i o n

109

search of the key point; no hesitancy upon the decisive moment; the whole fi eld of view taken in by one eagle glance; what could not be

seen divined by an unerring instinct; clouds of light troops thrown

forward to bewilder his foe; a crashing fi re of cannon in mass opened

upon him; the rush of the impetuous column into the gaps made by

the artillery; the overwhelming charge of the resistless cuirassier; fol-

lowed by the lancer and the hussar to sweep up the broken dispersed

bands; such were the tactical lessons taught in almost every battle of

this great military period. 3

Halleck was a senior general at the start of the war and soon became gen-

eral in chief. His specialty as an engineer, however, was fortifi cation, and that gave him a regard for defenses that was never wholly in keeping with

Mahan’s call for “vigor on the fi eld and rapidity of pursuit.” A combination of expertise in defensive methods, including digging trenches and deadly rifl ed muskets, was bound to inhibit frontal assaults. This caution was also evident in the Union’s fi rst general-in-chief, George McLellan.

Jomini’s infl uence among the generals is evident in their focus on lines

of communication and their opposition to Lincoln’s proposals to mount a

series of concurrent attacks against the South, including coastal operations.

This they judged to be an affront to the principles of war as it would require divided forces. It was just the sort of proposal to be expected from an untutored civilian. [^4] Lincoln, who never doubted that this would be a long, wearing battle, was reluctant to press his own views but was ready to replace his generals in the hope of fi nding someone who would take the fi ght to the enemy.

The generals were wary of the defense’s potential and were so enamored with

the idea of a decisive battle that they were reluctant to risk their forces in anything else. As General McClellan put it: “I do not wish to waste life in

useless battles, but prefer to strike at the heart.” Lincoln became increasingly frustrated by a preference for maneuvers over assaults. This he described disparagingly as “strategy.” “That’s the word—strategy!” he exclaimed in 1862,

“General McClellan thinks he is going to whip the rebels by strategy.” [^5] It described a form of warfare that did everything with an army but fi ght. Feints, maneuvers, and other clever moves might win the occasional battle, but it was brute force, relentlessly applied, that made the difference. When the South

was eventually penetrated, exposing the limits of the Confederacy’s defenses, Lincoln was prepared to accept the benefi ts: “Now, gentleman, that was true

strategy because the enemy was diverted from his purpose.” 6

Robert E. Lee of the Confederacy had made his own studies of Napoleon

and was totally convinced of the need to go on the offensive to annihilate

110

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

enemy forces. He knew that he could not mount a successful passive defense and so had to take the initiative, using maneuvers to get into the best position but then accepting battle. But this involved high casualties, and the

Union side did at least understand defenses. Lee had set a goal for victory that he could not realize, and he suffered the consequences. The rival armies were

“too big, too resilient, too thoroughly sustained by the will of democratic

governments” to be destroyed “in a single Napoleonic battle.” Ulysses Grant

saw the logic clearly and brutally. The terrible loss of life in both armies

had achieved little, observed Grant, but he understood that the North could

survive the losses better than the South and so he decided to embark on “as

desperate fi ghting as the world has ever witnessed,” locking Lee’s forces in

constant combat until he barely had an army left. 7]] Meanwhile, Grant sent General Sherman to make life miserable for the people of the South, bring

home the costs of the war, and make it harder to sustain an army in the fi eld.

Lincoln’s own contribution was to press ahead in January 1863 with the

Emancipation Proclamation that freed slaves in the areas under rebellion, a

move described as a “necessary war measure for suppressing said rebellion.”

This not only further unsettled the South but reinforced the Union army. By

1865, former slaves counted for 10 percent of its army. In the end this was a war of exhaustion. The leader of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis, observed

how the war’s “magnitude” had exceeded his expectations. “The enemy

have displayed more power and energy and resources than I had attributed

to them. Their fi nances have held out far better than I imagined would be

the case . . . It is not possible that a war of the dimensions that this one has assumed, of proportions so gigantic, can be very long protracted. The com-

batants must soon be exhausted.” 8

_The Cult of the Offensive_

Industrialization was expanding the numbers of men who could be orga-

nized for war, while steam and electricity were making it easier to mobilize

and transport them. Firepower was also steadily improving in its range and

lethality. All this challenged commanders. The geographical scope of opera-

tions and the numbers involved were expanding, while the limitations of

weather were easing. The implications for logistics and the actual conduct of battle were uncertain. The politics of war was also changing. Because it drew on whole societies and national sentiments it was much harder to separate the military from the civilian spheres.

a n n i h i l a t i o n o r e x h a u s t i o n

111

The fact that individual battles in the American Civil War were not decisive and that the French continued to resist even after the apparently decisive battle of Sedan in 1870 warned of the limits to the established view of how

to achieve victory in war. Yet so ingrained was the idea of a decisive battle that the urge was still to fi nd ways to force a satisfactory conclusion. Even those who sensed their own weakness in the face of superior numbers did not

look so much to guile as to superior spirit. After the defeat of 1870–1871,

French theorists glorifi ed the “offensive” and celebrated moral strength as

the key to persuading their men to charge against enemy fi repower. 9]] If the material balance of power was not going to guarantee victory, then the vital

factor had to be found in something more spiritual—what British fi eld mar-

shal Douglas Haig called “morale and a determination to conquer.” The key

text was that of Ardant du Picq, who argued that everything depended on

the emotional and moral state of the individual soldier. He was killed in the 1870 war but his work was published posthumously in 1880 as _Etudes sur_

_le combat_ (Battle Studies). Its infl uence reached the French high command.

Ferdinand Foch, who became supreme allied commander during the Great

War, was convinced that the question of losing was about a psychological

state of mind. Du Picq insisted that the physical impulse was nothing, the

“moral impulse” everything. This lay “in the perception by the enemy of the

resolution that animates you.” By the time the attack arrived, the defend-

ers could be “disconcerted, wavering, worried, hesitant, vacillating.” 10]] The doctrine of the offensive became offi cial French policy. It later came to be described as a “cult.”

German policy started from a different basis. Von Moltke had no doubt

that if Germany could not achieve a quick victory in a future war, its position would soon become dire. The key premise accepted by all German strategists

was that if the country was subjected to attack from both east and west it

could soon be squeezed, unless one of the belligerents could be removed from

the fi ght early on. After 1871, von Moltke became progressively more pessi-

mistic about Germany’s ability to achieve this. As plans were developed for a war against both France and Russia, he realized the need to scale down political expectations even as the military demands became greater. He wanted to

get Germany into the optimum position from which to negotiate a political

settlement. That required going on the offensive (so as to acquire territory

to be used in the eventual bargaining) rather than absorbing the offensives

of others.

The intensity of the debate refl ected von Moltke’s successors’ determina-

tion to avoid exhaustion. They could not bring themselves to prepare for an

inevitable stalemate. They held to the conviction that when it came to the

112

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

crunch, the new political order could and should be created through force of arms. As chief of the German general staff at the turn of the century, Alfred von Schlieffen epitomized this view. The secret, he believed, was to be found in combining a grand and compelling concept with meticulous attention to

detail. In 1891, he described the “essential element in the art of strategy” as bringing “superior numbers into action. This is relatively easy when one is

stronger from the outset, more diffi cult when one is weaker, and probably

impossible when the numerical imbalance is very great.” 11]] In the most probable contingencies for Germany, facing France from the west and Russia from

the east, one enemy must be destroyed before the other was engaged. A fron-

tal assault would cause excessive casualties, leaving insuffi cient capacity for future battles. It would therefore be necessary to take the initiative, fi rst outfl anking the enemy force and then destroying it. Von Schlieffen sought to address the challenge of friction and anticipate the enemy counterstrategy by insisting on careful planning. The whole campaign was choreographed from

mobilization to victory. The enemy would have no choice but to follow the

German script rather than its own. Contrary to the precepts of von Moltke,

this allowed little scope for individual initiative or for much going wrong.

Von Schlieffen was aware that there were few margins for error. He was there-

fore prepared to take political risks, in particular by violating the neutrality of Belgium and Luxembourg, in order to reduce the military risks.

An intense debate has developed among military historians as to whether

there really was ever a Schlieffen Plan, prepared just before von Moltke’s

nephew (known as the Younger) took over as chief of the general staff in 1906.

The German records are incomplete and whatever was bequeathed undoubt-

edly was amended as circumstances changed. 12 At times the general staff

looked to the east rather than the west and adjusted force levels. The think-

ing in 1914, nevertheless, did follow an ingrained strategic concept, using

envelopment to remove one enemy from the war at maximum speed with

minimum losses. This strategy was outlined by von Moltke the Younger in

December 1911, when he recommended that in all circumstances, Germany

should open the campaign by directing all available resources against France.

In the battle against France lies the decision in the war. The Republic

is our most dangerous enemy, but we can hope to bring about a rapid

decision here. If France is beaten in the fi rst great battle, this country,

which possesses no great manpower reserves, will hardly be in a posi-

tion to conduct a long-lasting war. Russia, on the other hand, can shift

her forces into the interior of her immeasurable land and can protract

the war for an immeasurable time. Therefore, Germany’s entire effort

a n n i h i l a t i o n o r e x h a u s t i o n

113

must be focused on ending the war, at least on one front, with a single great blow as soon as possible. [^13]

The German offensive of August 1914 was the culmination of a century of

developments in military thought and practice, updating the received wis-

dom of the Napoleonic period for recent developments in communications

and logistics. It broke from the Clausewitzian model by assuming, without

evidence, that the offense could be the stronger form of warfare. As Strachan notes, the war plans of all European armies in 1914 were Jominian: “operational plans for single campaigns, designed to achieve decisive success through

maneuver according to certain principles.” 14 The enemy defenses would be

circumvented and then engaged with a strength and momentum that would

leave them reeling. This assumed high levels of commitment, skill, élan, and

willpower; and an enemy that would fail to rise to the challenge.

This was a strategy that had been decided upon well in advance and

to which all planning had been geared. To ensure that the plan was prop-

erly executed, troops who could follow commands obediently and precisely

were required. Instead of a Tolstoyan army of individuals shaping outcomes

through numerous individual choices, this was a group turned by discipline

and drill into instruments of the commander’s will. Where latitude was

required for local initiatives in the face of unforeseeable developments, these would still refl ect the commanders’ intent, conveyed not only through direct communications but indirectly through a shared institutional culture and

agreed doctrine. The systems of hierarchy and control, of specialized func-

tions and their coordination, appeared as the highest stage of modern bureau-

cratic development. The general staff had the pick of the brightest military

brains. It set the standards for comprehensive planning and preparation of

individuals to follow straightforward commands in trying conditions.

But none of this could guarantee success. Ensuring victory required that

military imperatives take precedence over any diplomatic considerations.

Most seriously this entailed violating Belgian neutrality, which made it

more likely that Great Britain would enter the war and crush any actual or

potential civilian resistance. Even then, promises of success depended on the assumed superiority of the army, whose resolute will would crush weaker

nations that had inferior plans, poorer tactical grasp, and less-disciplined

troops. Besides, there was no obvious alternative: there was neither the appetite nor the resources for a prolonged war of exhaustion, and there could be

no other way of executing a war of annihilation. Other than the one most

feared by the military, a progressive demilitarization and softening of the

state, the only alternative was to use threats of war to get a better diplomatic 114

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

settlement. As so much depended on getting in an effective fi rst blow, once mobilization began the political situation was soon out of control.

After Napoleon’s fall, the presumption that the great issues that divided

states could be resolved through force of arms was taken for granted yet only tested on a few occasions. Though these occasions left the presumption reinforced they also pointed to reasons for caution: the huge developments in

transportation, in particular the railroads, which facilitated complex move-

ments to encircle opponents and catch them unawares also made it possible

to get fresh reserves to the front; industrialization had led to improvements in the weight, range, and accuracy of both artillery and small arms, making it possible to blast holes in defensive lines but also to make defending

fi re against an onrushing army quite murderous. The basic lesson from the

Napoleonic Wars, that there was only so much one country’s army, whatever

the brilliance of its operations, could do against a much stronger alliance,

remained in place. So was the lesson of 1871 that the stresses of war on

a country could lead to popular anger and revolutionary surges. War was

a radical instrument. It threatened to upturn the international order and

unleash wild political forces at home. It was one thing to have a strategy

for swift military action that would deal the enemy a knockout blow. But

if the enemy survived then there were no compelling strategies for what

came next.

_Mahan and Corbett_

While these debates about land offensives and decisive victories preoccupied

continental powers, Great Britain, was content to rely upon its maritime

strength. Naval strategy was a minority interest and was largely concerned

with whatever Britain had done and was still doing to maintain its sprawl-

ing empire and its intercontinental trade. The dominant concept was com-

mand of the sea, which could be traced back to Thucydides. This essentially

meant being able to move men and materiel wherever you wished without

interference while being able to prevent the enemy’s attempt to do the same.

In the nineteenth century, Great Britain enjoyed the command of the sea. It

had managed to extract the maximum benefi t out of its naval assets, creat-

ing an aura of irresistible strength, despatching warships to remind lesser

powers of the country’s interests, conveying menace, providing assurance,

and creating a bargaining position or infl icting blows on an upstart, all the while ensuring that the imperial lines of communication could be sustained

and reinforced.

a n n i h i l a t i o n o r e x h a u s t i o n

115

This had not required consideration of how to beat an equivalent power in battle, the main preoccupation of land warfare, because for much of the

nineteenth century, Britain did not face such a power. The French might once

have mounted a challenge, but British naval superiority had been reasserted

at Trafalgar in 1805. Since then, there had been no shortage of naval actions but also no serious challenge to Britain’s naval predominance. To maintain

this happy state, the British concluded that they must always have a navy

twice the size of any other. Only at the turn of the century, with the conversion to steam underway and Germany growing in industrial strength, was

this standard threatened. Prior to the Great War, Britain maintained its top

position, but only with a considerable effort.

It was late in the nineteenth century when naval power gained a theo-

rist with a compelling thesis. Alfred Thayer Mahan, after an unhappy and

indifferent naval career, found himself unexpectedly in charge of the new

U.S. Naval War College in 1886. There he developed a series of lectures on

the infl uence of sea power in history. This turned into his two most impor-

tant books, the fi rst concluding with the French Revolution and the second

in 1812. His writings were both prolix and—once retired from the Navy

in 1896 until his death in 1914—prolifi c. 15 His focus was not so much on]]

principles of strategy but on the relationship between naval and economic

power, particularly how Britain’s ascent as a great power had depended not

“by attempting great military operations on land, but by controlling the sea,

and through the sea the world outside Europe.” 16]] As an American he was seeking to encourage his country to follow the British example, not to challenge Britain but to provide extra support so that the two countries could

keep the seas open for trade.

His work was acclaimed in Britain. His central thesis, focusing on the

failure of France to become a naval power while Britain succeeded, was

congenial. Aspiring powers accepted the premise that the British experience

told of the necessity for countries dependent on the sea to have large navies composed of large ships. While it has been argued that Mahan’s historical and geopolitical judgments deserve serious consideration, his views on the actual

deployment of naval power were far less developed. 17]] He repeatedly insisted that the principles of land and sea war were essentially the same, and for

illumination of these principles he turned to Jomini, from whom he claimed

to have “learned the few, very few, leading considerations in military combi-

nation.” His father, Dennis, had been instrumental in ensuring that Jomini

had such a positive reception in the United States. 18]] This led to the stress on the decisive battle. The organized forces of the enemy must be the “chief

objective.” This was “Jomini’s dictum,” piercing “like a two-edged sword

116

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

to the joints and marrow of many specious propositions” and demanded a concentration of force (the “ABC” of any strategy) in preparation for battle.

By following these principles, naval offi cers could achieve the same level of strategic maturity as their army counterparts. [^19] Unfortunately, the “development of the Art of War at sea has been slower, and is now less advanced, than on shore,” Mahan observed. In “the race for material and mechanical development, sea-offi cers as a class have allowed their attention to be unduly diverted from the systematic study of the Conduct of War, which is their peculiar and

main concern.” 20]] He was, however, primarily a historian. When he tried to pull together his ideas on naval strategy into a single volume he confessed

that it was the worst book he had written. 21

While Mahan was a great booster for naval power and gained countless

admirers among American and British naval circles for doing so, his lasting

theoretical contributions were limited. As with others who believed that his-

tory offers timeless principles, he was unable to accommodate into his basic

framework the massive changes in naval power resulting from the new tech-

nologies exemplifi ed by steam power. As with others who sought to promote

the virtues of one type of military power, he was nervous about it being seen as subordinate to another type, and so he dismissed the idea of using the navy to guard shore positions, to prevent it becoming a branch of the army. The

role of navies was to compete with other navies for the command of the sea.

As with others who were focused on decisive battles, Mahan showed little

interest in more limited forms of engagement and was dismissive of engag-

ing in commerce destruction until after the decisive naval battle, for victory would put enemy commerce at your mercy.

Very similar ideas were being developed in Germany by Admiral Alfred

von Tirpitz, who was responsible in the late nineteenth century for turning

the navy of the recently unifi ed Germany from a second-rate force into a

serious challenger to British naval supremacy. His vision was both ambi-

tious and unimaginative. It was similar to Mahan’s except that while Mahan

took his inspiration from Jomini, Tirpitz took his from Clausewitz. He was

preparing for a future war at sea that would look very much like war on land, the “combat of fl eets against fl eets” to gain command of the sea. The model was explicitly derived from land warfare—he even wrote of the “battle of

armies on water.” He argued that the navy’s “natural mission” was a “strate-

gic offensive,” to seek victory in an “arranged mass battle.” Other possibilities, such as coastal bombardments and blockades, were impossible so long

as “the opposing fl eet still exists and is ready for battle.” All this was despite the evident diffi culty of imposing on an enemy a naval battle he wished to

avoid. 22

a n n i h i l a t i o n o r e x h a u s t i o n

117

While Mahan and Tirpitz sought to promote their countries as rising naval powers using remarkably similar concepts of the likely objectives and

methods of war at sea, Britain lacked a naval strategist of note. As Winston

Churchill observed after the Great War, the Royal Navy had made “no impor-

tant contribution to naval literature.” Its “thought and study” were devoted

to the daily routine. “We had brilliant experts of every description, brave

and devoted hearts; but at the outset of the confl ict we had more captains of ships than captains of war.” The standard work on seapower had been written by an American admiral. The best that Britain had to offer was written

by a civilian. 23 The civilian in question was Sir Julian Corbett. Measured and

moderate in his analysis and prose, he provided the most substantial critique of the dominant ethos of the time, asserting the possibilities of limited war, raising questions about the focus on concentrating forces for a decisive battle on land, and suggesting why this was an inadequate way to think about

war at sea. An occasional novelist with a background in law, Corbett lacked

practical naval experience. This was often held against him, along with his

skepticism regarding decisive battles and naval offensives and his readiness

to challenge the great myths of British naval history (for example, those surrounding the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar).

Yet despite all of this, he was given a central role in naval education

as a lecturer at the staff college. He also played a role in policymaking as

an Admiralty insider, even during the Great War. He was then given the

responsibility for overseeing the offi cial histories of the naval war. He was on the side of the reformers, trying to modernize the attitudes and culture

of the Royal Navy. This made him a natural target for conservative elements

in the maritime community. Although he was actively consulted during

the war, the impact of his broad theories has been doubted. 24]] During the Great War, one senior fi gure commended Corbett for having written “one

of the best books in our language upon political and military strategy” from

which all sorts of lessons, “some of inestimable value, may be gleaned.” But

no one had time to read it. “Obviously history is written for schoolmasters

and arm-chair strategists. Statesmen and warriors pick their way through

the dark.” 25

His efforts to accommodate the views of those he was challenging made

his work at times unnecessarily convoluted. Whereas Mahan was in some

respects a polemicist writing for a receptive audience, Corbett was in a trick-ier position, a civilian writing for a skeptical audience. While Mahan sought to apply Jomini, Corbett began with Clausewitz, but with greater subtlety

than Tirpitz. 26 Like Delbrück, Corbett picked up on those aspects of]] _On War_ that allowed for the possibility of something other than decisive battle in

118

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

an absolute war. The wisdom of Britain’s naval strategy, demonstrated by achieving so much with limited resources, was the result of a succession of

limited engagements for limited purposes. It had managed to combine “naval

and military action” to give the “contingent a weight and mobility that are

beyond its intrinsic power.” 27 The potential of limited war at sea was com-]]

pared to the potential for absolute war in continental Europe. There compact, nationalistic, and organized states bordered each other. If war came, popular feeling was apt to be high and it was possible to commit extra resource into

the campaign if battles went badly. The further away from borders, the lower

the political stakes and the greater the logistical problems. This made limitation and restraint more likely. The destruction of the enemy’s armed forces

was a means to an end and not an end in itself. If the end could be achieved

by different means, so much the better.

The vital question for strategy was not how to win a battle but how to

exert pressure on the enemy’s society and government. This argued for consid-

eration of blockade and attacks on commerce (“guerre de course”) as much as

seeking out the enemy fl eet. Major or grand strategy was about the purposes

of war, taking into account international relations and economic factors, to

which the strategy for the actual conduct of war should be subordinate. As

it was highly unlikely that a war would be decided solely by naval action,

except possibly over time as a result of blockade, armies and navies should

not be considered separately. “Since men live on the land and not upon the

sea, great issues between nations at war have always been decided—except in

the rarest cases—either by what your army can do against your enemy’s terri-

tory and national life, or else by fear of what the fl eet makes possible for your army to do.” The relationship between land and sea forces was the business of maritime strategy, from which the fl eet’s specifi c tasks would emerge. That would be the business of a purely naval strategy.

The key to success on land was control of territory; at sea it was control of communications. This was because the sea did not lend itself to possession.

Offensive and defensive operations would tend to merge into one another.

Because of this, the loss of command of the sea, which meant that passage

might be opposed, did not necessarily imply that another power enjoyed

command. “The command is normally in dispute. It is this state of dispute

with which naval strategy is most nearly concerned.” Corbett could see why

it would be desirable to seek out and destroy the enemy fl eet to gain com-

mand of the sea—the equivalent of a Napoleonic decisive battle—but he also

understood why it might not be possible. Trafalgar, he noted, was “ranked as

one of the decisive battles of the world, and yet of all the great victories, there is not one which to all appearance was so barren of immediate result . . . It a n n i h i l a t i o n o r e x h a u s t i o n

119

gave England fi nally the dominion of the seas, but it left Napoleon dictator of the continent.”

By exalting the offensive “into a fetish,” the defensive was discredited. Yet at sea the defensive was stronger because of the ease with which battle could be avoided. A fl eet that knew it was weaker would have every incentive to

avoid the stronger. Unlike Mahan, Corbett saw great advantages in dispersal,

such as avoiding a stronger fl eet, luring a weaker fl eet into danger under the illusion that it enjoyed local strength, and producing a winning combination of ships. In this respect, the “ideal concentration” was “an appearance

of weakness that covers a reality of strength.” The worst concentration, by

the same token, would limit the area of the sea that could be controlled,

leaving other parts vulnerable for any use. “The more you concentrate your

force and efforts to secure the desired decision, the more you will expose

your trade to sporadic attack.” [^28] The Great War gave far more support to Corbett’s views rather than Mahan’s. The one great naval battle, at Jutland in 1915, was inconclusive and in Corbett’s eyes unnecessary, because the Royal

Navy was still able to sustain a blockade that would have weakened Germany

over time. Meanwhile, submarine warfare against British merchant shipping

found Britain unprepared and only belatedly able to cope after adopting a

convoy system.

_Geopolitics_

It may well be that other great powers would have followed Britain into

building large navies if Mahan had never written a word, but he certainly

gave these efforts legitimacy and credibility. They were bound up with what

was essentially a mercantilist vision of economic strength, protected and

enhanced through the exertion of military power. Presenting the oceans as

containing their own sea lanes, pathways for commerce that could be guaran-

teed by a naval hegemon, Mahan introduced a concept that took hold among

maritime enthusiasts. His thesis was vigorously championed by President

Theodore Roosevelt, who was something of a naval historian himself in an

earlier life, and led to a major expansion in the U.S. fl eet after 1907.

Perhaps because the British were aware that their days of naval superiority

were numbered, it was not only Corbett who provided an important quali-

fi cation to Mahan’s thesis. A quite different perspective was provided by the geographer, adventurer, and politician Sir Halford Mackinder. Mahan was

addressing what he assumed to be a real choice for the United States: whether to be a continental or a maritime power. For that reason he bemoaned the

120

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

fascination with developing the country’s interior to the detriment of its sea-boards. Mackinder did not accept this dichotomy. In an essay delivered to

the Royal Geographical Society in 1904, he explained why it was possible

for a land power to acquire strength from the interior which could then be

applied to create a navy. 29 A]] maritime power, and certainly a small island such as Britain, lacked this option. New forms of transport, particularly rail, would make it possible to exploit interior resources in a way that would have been impossible when movement depended on horses. He looked at the great

Eurasian landmass and saw how either Germany or Russia (or the two in

combination) could come to control it all, from which they would gain such

economic power that it would be a comparatively small matter to project it

out to sea. Mackinder explained in 1905: “Half a continent may ultimately

outbuild and outman an island.” 30 On this basis he saw an increasing vul-

nerability, which Britain could only address by closer integration with her

empire.

His theory was given a more mature expression in a book published

just after the First World War in which he gave the Eurasian interior its

name, the “heartland.” This was the “region to which under modern condi-

tions, sea-power can be refused access.” 31 He divided the world into a core

“World-Island”—which was potentially self-suffi cient, comprising Eurasia

and Africa—with the rest of the islands—including the Americas, Australia,

Japan, the British Isles, and Oceania—around the “periphery.” These smaller

islands required sea transport to function. Despite Germany’s defeat in 1918, Mackinder saw the basic danger remaining of “ever-increasing strategical

opportunities to land-power as against sea-power.” This resulted in the advice to keep “the German and the Slav” apart. Three maxims fl owed from his analysis: “Who rules East Europe controls the heartland; Who rules the heartland

commands the World-Island; Who rules the World-Island commands the

World.” 32 The importance of distance, which Mackinder saw being trans-]]

formed by railways and motorized transport, was eventually affected even

more by the ability of aircraft to fl y over both land and sea. Surprisingly, Mackinder paid little attention to the possibilities of air power though it was only a few weeks before he gave his seminal paper in 1904 that the Wright

brothers made their historic fi rst fl ight.

There was much that Mackinder shared with Mahan. International rela-

tions were understood in terms of relentless competition among naturally

expansive great powers. What Mackinder introduced was a way of thinking

about the geographical dimension that showed how the land and sea could

be understood as part of the same world system, and as a source of continuity even as political and technological change affected its relevance. He was not a n n i h i l a t i o n o r e x h a u s t i o n

121

a geographical determinist, accepting that power balances would also depend on “the relative number, virility, equipment, and organization of the competing peoples.” 33 What Mackinder offered was a way of rooting the higher]]-

level strategic discourse in the interaction between states and the enduring

features of their environment.

Mackinder never used the term “geopolitics.” It was coined by the Swede

Rudolf Kjellén, who was a student of Friedrich Ratzel, the fi rst geographer

to focus on political geography. Kjellén’s works were translated into German

and picked up by Karl Haushofer, a former General who founded the German

geopolitical school. 34]]

Although he was not a Nazi, Haushofer refl ected

a world view that thought naturally in terms of distinctive ethnic groups

occupying suffi cient space to exercise economic independence (autarky). The

logic of “lebensraum” (the need to expand living space) became part of Nazi

ideology. Such associations left geopolitics discredited. [^35] Mackinder’s more nuanced approach provided a context for the parochial concerns of individual

states but also reinforced anxieties that there might be a route for a hostile power (for this option was not available to Britain) to eventual world domination. This idea infl uenced the titanic struggles of the coming century. It encouraged the view that there were a number of timeless imperatives arising out of the structure of international politics that states ignored at their peril. These encouraged a focus on the more conservative notions of nationality and territory and played down considerations of ideology and values,

though these might well have been the most important factors when it came

to deciding what was worth fi ghting for and with whom it was desirable to

forge and maintain alliances. So, while geopolitics appeared to move strategy to a higher plane than one which concentrated solely on the operational art,

it suffered from the same defect of failing to attend to the wider political

context.

Brain and Brawn

_Quiet people go out in the morning, and see air-fl eets passing overhead—_

_dripping death—dripping death!_

—H. G. Wells, _The War in the Air_ , _1908_

Few episodes revealed the limitations of military planning more than

the German offensive of August 1914. The general staff controlled what

they could, but their plans had paid insuffi cient attention to what France

might do to disrupt these plans—especially as logistics and communications

lines became extended. The plan’s schedule soon proved impossible to meet,

especially as Belgium put up some resistance. This led to brutal dealings

with civilians (a pattern which continued through the war), including forced

labor, denial of food supplies, and wanton destruction. [^1] Within weeks, the offensive had been halted. Yet the failure to knock France out of the war

and the need to then cope with the Russians and the British (because of the

attack on Belgium) did not lead to a fundamental reappraisal of war aims or

strategic principles. The search was still on for a decisive victory, relying on superiority in temperament, refusal to countenance a hint of timidity, and

faith in some new technique that could turn the tide. The fi rst of these was the use of gas warfare. The next drastic move was unrestricted submarine

warfare, refl ecting optimistic views about the inability of civil shipping to cope with the threat. This had the predictable effect of bringing the United

States into the war. The fi nal gamble was the offensive of March 1918 that left the army extended and exposed.

Delbrück had applauded the initial offensive and thought it would suc-

ceed, but once it stalled he quickly revised his thinking. If Germany could

not annihilate it would have to exhaust the enemy, although Delbrück strug-

gled to assess the relative economic impacts on the belligerents. He argued

for a deal with Britain and France in order to concentrate on Russia. The

uncompromising political and military stance led him to despair. Germany

had “in a sense the whole world leagued against us,” he wrote in 1917, add-

ing that “fear of German despotism is one of the weightiest facts with which

we have to reckon, one of the strongest factors in the enemy’s power.” 2]]

In the middle of this great stalemate, when there seemed to be few obvi-

ous means of breaking the deadlock other than by persevering with the costly

and futile combination of artillery bombardment and infantry charges, plans

began to be drawn up for more daring strategies. In each case the intention

was to realize the potential of a new technology—the tank on the ground or

the airplane in the air—to break the will of the enemy. In both cases the presumed impact of the new weaponry was assumed to be psychological as much

as physical. The aim was to cause what would in effect be a collective nervous breakdown on the enemy side. This directly challenged the assumption that a

decisive victory had to involve the annihilation of the enemy army. In neither case were the plans realistic: the technologies were still in their infancy, the production capacity limited and the tactics underdeveloped. Nonetheless,

in both cases these early plans set the terms for the intense postwar debates about future strategy.

_Air Power_

The Germans were early converts to the value of long-range bombardment

and to the view that its success would lie less in the amount of physical injury caused and more in the enemy’s willingness to continue to prosecute the

war. When the fi rst Zeppelin raids occurred in 1915, the actual results were meager, though in London the ability of the Zeppelins to fl y overhead was

considered humiliating in itself and bad for morale. As the British learned

to deal with the Zeppelins, German aircraft took over with greater effect. In the summer of 1917, a time when morale was already fragile, the fi rst attack on London killed 162 people and injured 432. Up to this point, the British

had concentrated their own aircraft in support of the army in France. This

remained the priority, but after the London raids the government promised

124

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

revenge and a degree of protection to the public. At the time, the Royal Flying Corps’ main interest beyond the French trenches was the German

lines of supply that fed the front. The commander General Hugh Trenchard

was trying to develop a vision of how best to use a still scarce resource as an independent force that could mount concentrated attacks against chosen targets in suffi cient numbers and with suffi cient continuity to make a decisive impact. Although he judged that bombers of greater range could eventually

target Berlin, the only initial response to the attacks on England was some

very limited and rather indiscriminate bombing of Germany.

Trenchard’s vision had a strong infl uence on the group of American air-

men who arrived just after the German raids, as their country entered the

war. Captain Nap Gorrell, one member of this team whose task was to set

out requirements for American aircraft production, began to develop a plan

for an air campaign. In line with Trenchard’s thinking, Gorrell argued that

“a new policy of attacking the enemy” was needed. This he described as “stra-

tegical bombing” geared to impeding the fl ow of supplies from Germany to

the front. The assumption was that there was a linked industrial complex,

involving a limited number of vital targets, upon which Germany’s war effort

depended. Gorrell also assumed that civilians would be demoralized and

reluctant to return to work in the aftermath of such attacks. They might even fi nd air attack so unendurable that they would pressure their governments

to seek terms. To achieve this he envisaged a massive armada of thousands of

aircraft, fl ying night and day, moving systematically from one set of targets to another. The plan did not prosper. It was too visionary in the light of the pressing demands to protect and support the armies at the front, and far too

ambitious in terms of production capability. [^3]

The importance of Gorrell’s plan was that it drew upon the views of the

key fi gures who were all to become vociferous advocates of strategic airpower after the war. These included not only Trenchard but also the American

General Billy Mitchell, whose campaigning for an independent air corps

would lead to his court-martial, and Giulio Douhet, then struggling to get

the Italian military to accept his futuristic views of air power. The connec-

tion with Douhet was through his friend, the Italian aircraft designer Gianni Caproni. It was Mitchell’s stridency in pursuit of institutional independence more than his innovative ideas that got him into trouble with his superiors.

Against the backdrop of America’s industrial strength, he was less worried

about “tactical” missions distracting from the “strategic.” Douhet reported

for the Italian army on the fi rst known combat use of aircraft, in Libya in

1911, and published his landmark book _Command in the Air_ in 1921. [^4] The ideas he expressed were by no means unique to him, but he provided the

b r a i n a n d b r a w n

125

most systematic—and the most strident, especially by the time of the book’s second edition in 1927—presentation of the apparent strategic logic of airpower. [^5] This logic was really a continuation of Mahan’s, which was in turn a continuation of Jomini’s. Mahan assumed a decisive naval battle would allow

for command of the sea; Douhet applied this to the air and assumed that

decisiveness there would produce command of the air.

As Azar Gat has demonstrated, behind the enthusiasm for the new

engines of war, whether on land or in the air, was a modernist fascination

with the possibility of a rationalist, technocratic super-effi cient society built around machines, linked to elitism in political theory and futurism in art,

and feeding naturally into fascism. 6 This did not mean, however]], that those who developed new strategic theories around these weapons adopted the

whole package. Many did not. They were imagining a future not necessarily

far away but still well beyond current capabilities. Their theories developed around a combination of optimism about technology and pessimism about

humanity.

With some variations, postwar airpower advocates relied on fi ve core

propositions. First and most important was the conviction that appropriately deployed airpower provided an independent route to victory. The corollary

of this was that it needed its own independent command and should not be

subordinate to the needs of either armies or navies. This was refl ected in the references to “strategic” aviation, which suggested that long-range bombardment missions were superior to merely “tactical” auxiliary applications. They could on their own attain the purposes of war.

Second, the defense was likely to remain dominant in land warfare,

which meant that defeating the enemy army in battle—the classical route

to victory—was now prohibitively expensive in terms of blood and trea-

sure. Fortunately, it would no longer be necessary to defeat the enemy army

because aircraft could fl y right over the front lines to reach the heart of the enemy. Trenchard explained: “It is not necessary, for an air force, in order to defeat the enemy nation, to defeat its armed forces fi rst. Airpower can dis-

pense with that intermediate step.” 7

Third, in contrast to surface warfare, in the air the offense would be stron-

ger than the defense. As Douhet put it, the aircraft was “the offensive weapon par excellence.” This thought was later most graphically expressed in 1932

by British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin when he warned the “man in

the street” that there was “no power on earth that can protect him from

being bombed. Whatever people may tell him, the bomber will always get

through.” As late as 1937, Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding, commander

of the Royal Air Force fi ghter command, stated that bombing attacks on

126

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

London would cause such panic that defeat could occur “in a fortnight or less.” [^8]

Fourth, these potentially decisive effects would be achieved less by the

actual destruction of people and property than by the consequences of this

destruction on the ability of governments to function and prosecute a war.

Popular pressure would oblige the enemy to sue for peace. Trenchard wrote

in 1928 how the goal of air action was “to paralyse from the very outset the

enemy’s production centres of munitions of war of every sort and to stop all

communications and transportation.” More could be achieved by attacking

the enemy’s “vital centres” than attacking the forces that sought to protect

them. 9 In this, the more people-friendly version, it was the loss of vital infra-]]

structure that would make it progressively diffi cult to feed the nation’s war machine. In the less people-friendly version, it was assumed that the effects would come through popular demoralization, demotivation, and even panic

on such a scale that the government would have to abandon the war.

Fifth, the advantage would go to the side that attacked fi rst. For Douhet,

the “command of the air” would come when it was possible to “prevent the

enemy from fl ying while retaining the ability to fl y oneself.” This would

be achieved by aggressively bombarding the enemy’s air bases and factories

(“destroying the eggs in their nest”), a tactic that favored attacking as soon as possible—even preemptively, before the enemy air force was already on

its way. There would be no time for a formal declaration of war. As we

have seen with land warfare, the main reason to take this sort of risk would

be the expectation that the fi rst blows could be translated into a decisive

victory.

There were practical issues connected to all these propositions. Offensive

long-range bombers would have to carry fuel as well as ordnance and could be

vulnerable to faster, more agile fi ghter aircraft. If they fl ew in daylight these bombers were more likely to be spotted en route to their targets. They might

be safer fl ying at night but would fi nd it harder to hit targets with accuracy.

Then there was the risk of retaliation. Douhet assumed that a war would start with a competition to infl ict as much as damage as possible on the enemy

society, and the victor would be the fi rst to pound the other into submission.

That was a dire prospect, especially if neither side managed a decisive blow.

The logic of this prospect of mutual destruction was mutual deterrence, since both sides would presumably be anxious to protect their people from revenge

attacks. Even during the Allied discussions of a long-range bomber offensive

in 1917, French enthusiasm waned as they contemplated their own vulner-

ability to German retaliation. Unless it was assumed that fi rst blows could

lead to the physical collapse of the war economy, which was unlikely, a lot

b r a i n a n d b r a w n

127

was resting on the assumption that an early victory would result from the impact on civilian morale.

Unlike soldiers who were trained to deal with attack, Douhet assumed

that civilians would be helpless.

A complete breakdown of the social structure cannot but take place in

a country being subjected to . . . merciless pounding from the air. The

time would soon come when, to put an end to horror and suffering, the

people themselves, driven by the instinct of self-preservation, would

rise up and demand an end to the war. 10]]

Douhet was dismissive of anything that detracted from the most massive

early offensives—there was no point in investing in air defenses or keeping

anything in reserve, let alone preparing for auxiliary missions in support of the army or navy. He recognized that this would put a premium on getting

the targeting right, yet he was strikingly vague on targeting priorities. There could be no “hard and fast rules” because much would depend on the “material, moral, and psychological” circumstances. [^11]

Nor did he or the other advocates have much evidence upon which to

base their claims, other than extrapolations from the fi rst responses of Britain and France to German bombs. This led to some curious social theory on the

general softness of the lower classes, the respective resilience of British and German workers, and the consequence of the presence of panicky aliens. Prior

to the war there had been a lot of interest in crowd psychology, inspired in

particular by the Frenchman Gustave Le Bon. He provided a quasi-scientifi c

basis, taken extraordinarily seriously at the time, for those who feared the

entry of the masses into political life and also those who became excited by the possibility of harnessing popular emotions. Chapter 22 considers this more

carefully. For the moment all that is important to note is Le Bon’s claim that individuals lost their distinctive personalities in crowds, and that this collective was highly suggestible. There was no particular reason, however, why

an essentially irrational crowd would demand surrender. The mood might

push in the opposite direction. In 1908, the British author H. G. Wells,

who was well aware of Le Bon’s work, wrote _War in the Air_ . His assumption was that the crowd (in this case, New Yorkers) would not so much panic as

turn extremely belligerent. The authorities in his novel wanted to surrender

but the people, roused to anger, disagreed. With the head “conquered and

stunned,” the body was “released” from its rule.

New York had become a headless monster, no longer capable of col-

lective submission. Everywhere it lifted itself rebelliously; everywhere

128

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

authorities and offi cials left to their own initiative were joining in the arming and fl ag-hoisting and excitement of that afternoon.

The result was that the Germans were forced to make good their threats.

New York was wrecked “because she was at once too strong to be occupied and

too undisciplined and proud to surrender in order to escape destruction.” 12

The actual mechanisms through which a government would be forced

to abandon a war were left unexplained by Douhet and his colleagues. In

this respect, the advocates of this approach suffered from combined psycho-

logical and democratic fallacies by which they assumed that elites would be

obliged to respond to hysterical mass opinion. There were always a variety of possible scenarios short of a panicked surrender. As the Second World War

demonstrated, a population might be stunned into fatalism with no options

other than resigned stoicism, adjusting to the new conditions, turning anger

against the enemy. If they truly wished to stop the war they would need an

effective political opposition. Otherwise they were likely to be cowed into

silent suffering by a repressive regime. Basic factors of social cohesion and political structure, as well as more specifi c ones relating to the extent of the understanding of and support for the war policy and its execution, were just

as crucial. To replace a government or get an existing one to change its mind required both political means and an alternative policy.

These issues illustrated a feature of any approach to confl ict that did not

attempt to achieve its objectives by physically occupying the enemy soci-

ety. Such an approach required a construct of the enemy’s socioeconomic and

political system that provided reliable indicators of its vulnerabilities and potential pressure points. If this was going to lead to a decisive act, rather than contribute to a form of deadly bargaining, the assumption had to be

that if the right points could be found—whether in industrial production,

political control, or popular morale—the system as a whole could be brought

down. This hypothesis continued to have an infl uence, but its foundations

were speculative at best.

_Armored Warfare_

A possible theoretical basis for the assumption was developed by a British

army offi cer, John Frederick Charles “Boney” Fuller. Fuller joined the Tank

Corps in 1916, at the start of what he immediately recognized to be a revo-

lutionary development. At the time armored vehicles were having an impact,

but they were too cumbersome and unreliable to be the basis of an offensive.

b r a i n a n d b r a w n

129

During 1918, Fuller developed a plan for a war-winning offensive, known as

“Plan 1919.” The plan depended on a new tank coming into large-scale pro-

duction the next year. As with Gorrell and his proposed air campaign, Fuller

was overly optimistic about the capabilities becoming available to support

his ambition. The real importance of his ideas, like Gorrell’s, lay in their

relevance for the conduct of future wars.

Although Fuller played no role in the development of the tank and was

not the fi rst to conceive of it developing an offensive role, he was the preeminent fi gure in formulating the new Tank Corps doctrine. Once convinced

that tanks offered much more than support to the infantry, Fuller began to

describe what might be achieved when tanks could be deployed in larger

numbers, at greater speeds, and over longer ranges. Mechanical warfare, he

observed, was about to replace muscular warfare. The days when fi repower

would have to be carried by men or pulled by horses into battle were passing.

The petrol engine was going to revolutionize land warfare just as surely as

steam had revolutionized naval warfare. He knew that the fi rst steps would

be tentative, perhaps not much more than raids against German lines, but

he envisioned a future army of one thousand tanks, dividing for a standard

attack on enemy defensive lines and another attack directed at the enemy’s

command structure. His ideas were refi ned following the Allied retreat dur-

ing the German offensive of spring 1918. He attributed the retreat to the

paralysis of the high command. As “the potential strength of a body of men

lies in its organization,” he concluded, “if we can destroy this organization, we shall have gained our object.” Fuller became an advocate of “brain warfare,” that is, attacks aimed at disorganizing the enemy’s mental processes

and ensuring the collapse of the enemy’s will to resist. There was no need

to target the enemy army; better to target the command structure. In his

plan, the German army headquarters was the major objective. The aim was

to shoot the enemy through the head rather than force death through many

wounds to the body. Literally brainless, the enemy would be confused and its

forces would turn into a rabble. Later in his life he refl ected that Plan 1919

promised victory with a “stupendous drama, the only satisfactory way to win

a war.”

In this metaphor of the army as a body, the headquarters was the brain and

the lines of communication the nervous system, leading into the muscular

forward forces. The whole system required constant supply. It was, however,

still an analogy. As Brian Holden Reid noted, the army was not the same as

an organism because the component parts could exist independently of each

other. “Brains, courage and fi ghting power are not compartmentalized, and

a crisis can throw up a relatively junior offi cer who can provide the guidance 130

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

formerly given by higher authority.” It was the case that the German collapse in 1918 was accelerated when the divisional headquarters was overrun by

tanks, but this was at the end of a long and exhausting war, when morale on

both sides was fragile. This encouraged the view that shock always resulted

in a form of panic, and a tendency emerged to play down the other factors

that might wear down an enemy. Again we can see the similarities with the

early air power theorists, with whom Fuller had an affi nity. He wrote in 1923

about an air attack that would transform London into a “vast raving Bedlam”

so that the government at Westminster would be “swept away by an ava-

lanche of terror.” 13 Fuller had also read Le Bon closely]]. His innovation was to use notions of crowd psychology to consider how not only civilians but also

armies might buckle under pressure.

The odd thing about Fuller’s military theories was that they drew upon

and developed a wider set of ideas that had been gestating for some time and

refl ected his wide but idiosyncratic reading. Fuller dabbled in mysticism and the occult, had an enthusiasm for modernism and a contempt for democracy, and eventually developed a commitment to fascism. His readiness to

challenge conventional religion led naturally, he judged, to a readiness to

challenge conventional military thinking. In addition to Le Bon, social

Darwinism and philosophical pragmatism had also infl uenced his thinking.

He made the familiar claim that his approach to the study of war was sci-

entifi c. His actual method belied this but did refl ect his belief that he had identifi ed patterns that would recur irrespective of time and place. He had

little doubt that his analysis compared more than favorably with what he

considered to be exasperating, amateurish, and doltish senior British offi -

cers. Their incompetence, fully demonstrated during the Great War, was now

revealed fully in their failure to appreciate Fuller’s insights. Yet his approach was based on grandiose claims and a romantic urge to fi nd a form of battle

that avoided the mass slaughter he had witnessed in France. Somehow this

fl awed and unappealing, arrogant and authoritarian character, whose theo-

rizing beyond military matters was eccentric and often barely intelligible,

hit upon an original conception of armored warfare that turned what was

widely viewed as an interesting but limited specialist tool into the basis of a new type of warfare. Fuller became one of the fi rst to focus on the possibility of disorienting the enemy’s “brain” rather than eliminating his physical

strength. [^14]

After the war, refl ecting on the fate of what he described as “pot bellied

and pea brained” armies fi xated on fi repower, Fuller sought to develop further the possibility of using tanks and aircraft in a battle that would be decisive as a result of psychological dislocation rather than physical destruction. As with b r a i n a n d b r a w n

131

many of the technological optimists of the time, he underplayed the logistical diffi culties inherent in his vision and overplayed the extent to which it would not require the enormous armies of the Great War or the vast resources

of industrial societies. 15 His theories depended on a dim view of humanity]].

His fi rst major book, _The Reformation of War_ , made a crude elitist distinction between the masters (super-men) and the slaves (super-monkeys), with the

latter mentally challenged, naturally fearful, and tending to the feminine (a common reference of the time to emotional, hysterical personalities). In his

next major theoretical statement, _The Foundations of the Science of War_ , 16]] he ruminated more on the nature of crowds. This was central to his view of an

army and society at large as an organism which could be swayed by strong

leadership. Fuller saw a grasp of crowd psychology as the “foundation of

leadership.” Crowds, whether they started as heterogeneous or homogeneous,

tended toward a single “mind” controlled by a “soul” which was in itself

dominated by instincts. It was Le Bon’s story of a crowd acting like an irra-

tional individual rather than a mass of separate rational individuals. Fuller’s crowd was “a mere automaton under the will of the suggester, and, through

lack of intellect, its acts [were] always unbalanced and extreme-lower or more exalted than the individual’s, according to the nature of the suggestion it has received.”

To Fuller, crowds were pathologically mad, credulous, impulsive and irri-

table, and ruled by sentiments. To challenge the crowd, the “man of genius,”

refusing to “swim with the stream,” must instead divert “the stream from

its course by compelling it to swirl forward in his own direction.” If, as

Napoleon put it, the moral was superior to the physical by three to one, the

genius was more important than the normal by ten to one. A normal man

should be considered a piece of machinery. Fuller urged that it was necessary to devise for such a man an “accurate system” that could be presented in “so

simple a form, that without thinking, without perhaps knowing what we

intend, he with his hands will accomplish what our brains have devised.” 17

In this he was probably infl uenced by Frederick Taylor, whose system of sci-

entifi c management is discussed in Chapter 32.

Fuller described a “military crowd” by reference to Le Bon’s “mass of men

dominated by a spirit which is the product of the thoughts of each individual concentrated on one idea.” Hopefully this would be the will to win, but

should it become disorganized by surprise or some calamity, then an urge

to self-preservation would take over. An army was an organized crowd, held

together and directed through training and common purpose, but it was a

crowd nonetheless and so could turn when stressed. With strong “mind” and

“soul,” an army could endure, but once it faced heavy losses, morale could suffer and fear take over.

As the battle bursts into fl ame, creative reason holds control or is lost;

imagination rattles the dice of chance and the man obeys, or, like an

animal hunting another, acts on his own intuition. Self-sacrifi ce urges

men on; self-preservation urges men back; reason decides; or, if no

decision be possible, sense of duty carries the will to win one step

nearer to its goal. So the contest is waged, not necessarily by masses of

surging men, but rather by vacant spaces riddled by death. [^18]

In battle, an army shocked and bereft of leadership could lose its discipline and readiness to go forward. In civilian life, there was no real contest. The emotional, impulsive crowd was doomed to panic.

The Indirect Approach

_A strategist should think in terms of paralyzing, not of killing._

—Basil Liddell Hart

Sir Basil Liddell Hart was also shaped in his thinking by his expe-

riences in the Great War (he had been gassed and wounded at the

Somme 1]] ) and his determination that future wars should avoid the sort of mindless slaughter he had witnessed. Fuller was the more original and

powerful thinker, but not always the most accessible. His friend Liddell

Hart had a crisper style, and despite some poor calls in the run-up to the

Second World War, his reputation grew after that war. This was partly

because he gave unstinting support to a new generation of civilian strate-

gists and military historians, who were able to develop their craft in the

comparative security of the universities rather than through continual free-

lancing like Liddell Hart. In addition, Liddell Hart’s ideas about limited

war gained traction as thermonuclear weapons gave new meaning to the

idea of total war. He was also a relentless propagandizer on his own behalf,

to the point of suggesting that the tragedy of the Second World War was

that British generals neglected his ideas on armored warfare, while German

generals turned them into the blitzkrieg. After his death in 1970, his his-

tory was challenged and his self-promotion rebuked, 2 but the central idea

of the “indirect approach” continued to gain adherents in business as well

as military circles.

Initially Liddell Hart’s work was wholly derivative. Before he sought to claim a remarkable parallel development between Fuller’s ideas and his own,

he had pronounced _The Reformation of War_ to be “the book of the century.” He had read T. E. Lawrence’s early presentation of his ideas in _The Army Quarterly_ in 1920 and appears, although this is less easy to document, to have drawn

on the work of Julian Corbett as well. Liddell Hart was never challenged by

those from whom he had borrowed so liberally. Lawrence kept no records and

so was only impressed later by the similarity between his views and those

of his good friend, Liddell Hart. 3]] In 1922 Corbett died. Fuller did not care about the plagiarism, although his wife did. Following Fuller, Liddell Hart

adopted the analogy of the brain controlling the body to call for attacks on

the enemy’s communications and command centers. His appeal for an “indi-

rect approach” as the “most hopeful and economic form of strategy” struck a

chord with those who believed that cleverness was preferable to brute force.

Moreover, unlike Fuller, he asserted his own originality by comparing the

indirect approach to the more direct, which he claimed to be Clausewitz’s

terrible legacy.

Liddell Hart blamed Clausewitz, or at least his followers, for their con-

viction that everything must be geared to decisive battles with the sole aim

of destroying the enemy army through frontal assaults. Everything he hated

about the futile mass offensives and horrifi c bloodshed of the Western Front in the First World War he seemed to blame on Clausewitz, the “evil genius of

military thought.” His presentation tended to caricature, as if Clausewitz was gripped by some sort of bloodlust, unable to view war except in absolutist

terms, anxious for battle at the fi rst opportunity, and seeking to win through overwhelming numbers rather than proper strategy. He wrote furiously in

one of his earliest books about “the Ghost of Napoleon.” 4]] The approach he deplored was mechanical and a-strategic. Clausewitz’s “gospel deprived strategy of its laurels.”

Eventually Liddell Hart acknowledged that the differences between

Clausewitz’s view of war and his own were not large—they both understood

that it was an extension of politics and infl uenced by psychology as much

as brute force. 5]] He could point to the density and philosophical complexity of _On War._ This made it more likely that Clausewitz would be read as an incitement to early battle at the fi rst opportunity rather than at a more advantageous moment. The view that Clausewitz’s disciples extracted simplistic slogans and applied them crudely was clearly expressed late in his

career when Liddell Hart wrote the introduction to Samuel Griffi th’s popular translation of _The Art of War_ . Sun Tzu’s “realism and moderation,” he wrote, formed a contrast to “Clausewitz’s tendency to emphasize the logical ideal

t h e i n d i r e c t a p p r o a c h

135

and ‘absolute’ ” that had led these disciples to develop “the theory and practice of total war beyond all bounds of sense.” Interestingly, Liddell Hart

recorded that he was fi rst made aware of Sun Tzu by a contact in China

in 1927. “On reading the book I found many other points that coincided

with my own lines of thought, especially his constant emphasis on doing

the unexpected and pursuing the indirect approach. It helped me to realize

the agelessness of the more fundamental military ideas, even of a tactical

nature.” [^6] According to one biographer, there was no direct infl uence of Sun Tzu when Liddell Hart was developing his approach in the 1920s because he

did not actually read the book until the early 1940s. 7]] This makes his specifi c mention of 1927 curious, especially since he started to develop his “indirect approach”—so close to Sun Tzu in many clear elements—over the next two

years. There was certainly no mention of Sun Tzu in the fi rst version of his constantly refi ned presentation of his core ideas, _The Decisive Wars of History_ , but the last version, _Strategy: The Indirect Approach_ , included extensive quotes at the front of the book. The Giles translation of Sun Tzu, the one most in

use at the time, includes the line: “In all fi ghting the direct methods may

be used for joining battle, but indirect methods will be needed in order to

secure victory.” Later translations from the Chinese, however, contrasted the straightforward with the crafty, the normal with the extraordinary, or the

orthodox with the unorthodox.

Liddell Hart followed Sun Tzu by prescribing an ideal form of strategy

as it should be rather than how it often turned out in practice. Liddell Hart judged Clausewitz’s defi nition too narrow, too battle-focused, as if this was the only means to the strategic end. Instead, he defi ned strategy as “the art of distributing and employing military means to fulfi ll the ends of policy.”

The ends of policy were not a military responsibility. They were handed

down from the level of grand strategy, where all instruments of policy were

weighed, one against each other, and where it was necessary to look beyond

the war to the subsequent peace. At the other end of the spectrum, tactics

came into play when “the application of the military instrument merges into

actual fi ghting, the dispositions for and control of such direct action.”

In an age of total war, Liddell Hart was seeking limitation, a search that

became even more urgent after the invention of nuclear weapons. He was

an advocate of limited aims as a means of ensuring limited means, although

this urge to proportionality between the two contained an important fal-

lacy: that military means could be geared to the political stakes rather than the strength of the opposition. Large wars could start for small stakes. To this Liddell Hart would reply that if prospective costs were wholly disproportionate to likely gains, the value of the whole enterprise should be questioned.

136

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

The art of strategy required not only fi nding means to achieve a fi xed end but also identifying realistic and desirable ends. His method was to defi ne the

ideal against which actual performance would be judged. Thus the aim of

war was “to subdue the enemy’s will to resist, with the least possible human

and economic loss to itself.” Avoiding loss meant avoiding large battles,

though the basic principles would apply even if battle had to be joined. The

link with Sun Tzu was clear: “The perfection of strategy would be, therefore, to produce a decision without any serious fi ghting.”

Instead of the direct approach, taking the obvious route into a confron-

tation with a prepared enemy, the indirect approach would “diminish the

possibility of resistance.” The vital impact would be in the psychologi-

cal rather than the physical sphere. This required calculating the factors

affecting the will of the opponent. So while movement might be the key

to catching the enemy out physically, surprise was the key to infl uenc-

ing the enemy’s psychology. “Dislocation is the aim of strategy; its sequel

may either be the enemy’s dissolution or his easier disruption in battle.

Dissolution may involve some partial measure of fi ghting, but this has not

the character of a battle.” It is important to note that although Fuller and

Liddell Hart are often seen as intellectual twins, on this they disagreed.

Fuller certainly sought the psychological dislocation of the enemy, but he

saw no problem in taking the direct route if that would have the desired

effect. An indirect approach was “usually a necessary evil,” and “weapon

power” would determine which to choose. Where Liddell Hart was dog-

matic, Fuller was pragmatic. Liddell Hart wanted to avoid battle; for Fuller, it was the likely source of victory. [^8]

In the physical sphere, avoiding battle required upsetting the enemy’s

dispositions by means of a sudden “change of front.” This could be achieved

by separating enemy forces, endangering supplies, menacing routes of retreat, or combining several of these moves. In the psychological sphere, dislocation required that these physical effects be impressed on the commander’s mind,

creating a “sense of being trapped.” Moving directly against an opponent

would not throw him off balance. At most it would impose a strain, but

even if successful, the enemy would retreat to his “reserves, supplies, and

reinforcements.” The aim was therefore to fi nd “the line of least resistance,”

which translated in the psychological sphere into “the line of least expecta-

tion.” It was also important to maintain a number of options. Having alter-

natives kept the enemy guessing, putting him on the “horns of a dilemma,”

and allowed for fl exibility should the enemy guard against your chosen route.

“A plan, like a tree, must have branches—if it is to bear fruit. A plan with a

single aim is apt to prove a barren pole.” 9

Liddell Hart claimed that his theory developed through a careful examination of the whole of military history. Unfortunately, his approach to his-

tory was intuitive and eclectic rather than, as he liked to believe, “scientifi c.”

There were always elements of subtlety, surprise, or innovation in military

victories, and indirectness could be “strategic, tactical, psychological and

sometimes even ‘unconscious.’ ” As Bond noted, Liddell Hart came extremely

close to a circular argument: by his defi nition, a “decisive victory” was an

event which is secured by an “indirect approach.” 10 As with Sun Tzu, Liddell

Hart’s attraction was that he celebrated the subtle intelligence over brute

force. But also like Sun Tzu’s, it raised the questions of how matters would

be resolved if both sides were following an indirect approach, the practical

problems of coordination, and the impact of chance and friction. Although

Liddell Hart later became celebrated as an apostle of maneuver, the cam-

paigns he admired were often attritional, in that they required wearing down

the opponent.

The ideal indirect strategy created conditions in which the enemy was

forced to conclude that defeat had become inevitable before battle was joined.

This strategy relied upon the intelligent maneuver of forces to create a relationship that, once apparent, encouraged the adversary to become more con-

ciliatory. The logic pointed to deterrence. If the likely outcome of battle was known, the best advice would be to avoid the original provocation or—at

the other extreme—go for complete, preemptive surprise. Liddell Hart was

addressing situations which lacked this clarity and were harder to predict or control, by indirect or direct means. If battle was to be avoided, the role of land war must be limited and sea and air power relied on instead. Blockade

from the sea or bombardment from the air might undermine enemy power

by damaging the morale and logistical system of the armed forces and per-

haps the underlying economic and social structure which sustained the state.

Not surprisingly, therefore, Liddell Hart advocated both types of warfare

during his career, although his enthusiasm for both naval blockades and air

raids waxed and waned. The diffi culty was that unless territory was taken the enemy could continue to resist.

Liddell Hart’s advocacy of strategic air power was quite short-lived,

although it included a fl irtation with crowd psychology when he warned

how ordinary people subjected to attack from the air could be “maddened

into the impulse to maraud.” 11]] When it came to following the indirect approach on land, his analysis—following Fuller—focused on the impact of

mechanization. Here too he concluded (on the eve of the Second World War)

that the potential of a well-organized defense was probably more potent

than that of a maneuvering offensive. He hoped that this would reduce

138

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

the likely aggressor’s readiness and ability to disrupt the status quo. Thus, despite his enthusiasm for the indirect approach, Liddell Hart came up constantly against the very real constraints on its implementation, especially

when confronting an opponent of equivalent—let alone greater—raw power

and tactical intelligence. An indirect approach represented a strategic ideal but one only likely to be realized in very special circumstances. Societies

and their armies could prove to be extremely resilient. Getting in a position to mount sustained pressure in a resolute manner requires effective military

dominance—whether at sea, in the air, or on land. This in turn was likely to

require very direct and decisive contact with enemy forces. This led Liddell

Hart to eventually conclude that very little useful purpose could be served

by war.

_Churchill’s Strategy_

_The maneuver which brings an ally into the fi eld is as serviceable as that which_ _wins a great battle. The maneuver which gains an important strategic point may_ _be less valuable than that which placates or overawes a dangerous neutral._

_—_ Winston Churchill, _The World Crisis_

We shall discuss later the reality behind the blitzkrieg story. There is no

doubt that the Wehrmacht’s mastery of armored warfare gained Germany

some great victories in the early stages of the Second World War that led to

virtual domination of Europe. But the domination was never complete and in

the end Germany lost. It was settled by the logic of alliance as much as military prowess. Germany was consistently superior in the fi eld but in the end

could not cope with the combined weight of the United States, the Soviet

Union, and the British Empire. That this would be the eventual outcome was

hardly apparent in the spring of 1940, when only one of the “big three” was

actually at war, and its situation appeared to be parlous. On May 10, 1940,

the German army began an offensive that in ten days saw it move through

Belgium and Holland to the French coast. Soon France fell and Britain was

alone. Yet Britain continued to fi ght when its position appeared hopeless

and eschewed the possibility of a deal with Hitler that might have left it a

diminished but still independent power.

Richard Betts has used this example to query the role of strategy. The

British government’s decision to continue to fi ght was one of the most

“epochal” decisions of the last century, yet at the time it made little strategic t h e i n d i r e c t a p p r o a c h

139

sense. 12 For it to make sense, Betts ar]]gued, Churchill would have had to know in advance and with confi dence that the Germans would be unable

to cross the English Channel, lose the Battle of Britain, and eventually lose the Battle of the Atlantic. Most importantly, Churchill would have had to

assume that by the end of 1941 Britain would be fi ghting alongside the

Soviet Union and the United States.

This is, however, the wrong way to look at the decision in terms of strat-

egy. A better approach was that adopted by Ian Kershaw in his analysis of the decision-making among the great powers during the Second World War. He

did not pose the question of strategy in terms of how to best meet ultimate

objectives but how the available options come to be defi ned and what consid-

erations infl uenced the choices. His starting point was where political leaders

found themselves rather than where they wished to be. 13

As Germany advanced toward France, and Britain’s close ally teetered,

Winston Churchill became prime minister. His fi rst days in offi ce were taken up with whether France could stay in the war and what might be done if she

could not. His own reputation as a war leader had yet to be made: he was

still viewed with suspicion for a career marred by regular lapses of judgment.

Now he had to address the arguments of his foreign secretary, Lord Halifax,

that there was no point in accepting unnecessary suffering if a compromise

deal with Hitler could be found that would preserve Britain’s independence

and integrity. There appeared to be an option using Italy, who had yet to join the war, as a mediator. Churchill convinced his colleagues that this was not

worth pursuing.

The choice they faced was not about alternative means of winning but

about how best to avoid defeat and humiliating terms. It was not about

refusing to negotiate under any circumstances but whether there was any-

thing to be gained by trying to negotiate when circumstances were so dire.

The option of a negotiated outcome was not rejected because of Churchill’s

pugnacity but because the arguments in favor of it were unpersuasive. It

depended on Benito Mussolini, who was becoming an increasingly unlikely

mediator because of his pro-German stance and lack of infl uence over Hitler.

On examination, possible peace terms appeared to be unacceptable. In an

effort to appear reasonable during taxing cabinet discussions, Churchill

professed himself willing to consider concessions in areas of British infl u-

ence or the transfer of a few spare colonies to “get out of the mess,” but

demands which went to the heart of the country’s constitutional indepen-

dence, involving a different sort of government and enforced disarmament,

would be intolerable. 14]] Available terms might be better than those following military defeat, but this was not self-evidently the case. It was possible 140

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

that matters would get even worse and Britain would be subjugated. But it was also possible that this would not happen. Any deal would be better

for Britain if the Germans assumed they were dealing with an opponent

that had some fi ght left. In addition, the very act of exploring a settlement would be viewed abroad as weakness and cause demoralization at home. For

the moment, the country was not beaten and the armed forces felt that they

could organize strong resistance to a German invasion. These discussions

took place before the “miracle” of Dunkirk. The initial expectation had been

that, at best, tens of thousands would escape to Britain from defeated France.

When a third of a million troops were rescued from the beaches where they

were suffering relentless air attacks, this provided an early vindication of the decision to fi ght on.

Churchill could have no idea at the time about the likely course of the

war. According to Eliot Cohen, Churchill did not think of strategy as a blue-

print for victory. He knew that the course of a war could not be predicted

and that steps to victory might not be discerned until they were about to

be taken. He distrusted “cut and dried calculations” on how wars would

be won. For him, strategy was very much an art and not a science—indeed

so art-like as to be close to painting. “There must be that all-embracing

view which presents the beginning and the end, the whole and each part, as

one instantaneous impression retentively and untiringly held in the mind.”

With a few key themes always at the fore and a grasp of context, there was

a framework for taking in new developments exploiting new opportunities.

This was not, as Cohen notes, a machine built “to narrow tolerances and an

exact design,” nor was it “a chaotic welter of unconnected and opportunistic

decisions.” [^15]

While Churchill’s approach to purely military affairs could be impetuous,

he had a natural grasp of coalition warfare. Coalitions were always going to

be central to British strategy. The empire contributed signifi cantly to the war effort in terms of men and materiel, and its special needs had to be accommodated. The United States had the unequivocal potential to tip the scales when a European confrontation reached a delicate stage. Almost immediately after

taking offi ce, Churchill saw that the only way to a satisfactory conclusion of the war was “to drag the United States in,” and this was thereafter at the center of his strategy. His predecessor Neville Chamberlain had not attempted

to develop any rapport with President Franklin Roosevelt. Churchill began at

once what turned into a regular and intense correspondence with Roosevelt,

although so long as Britain’s position looked so parlous and American opin-

ion remained so anti-war, little could be expected from Washington. His fi rst letter was if anything desperate, warning of the consequences for American

t h e i n d i r e c t a p p r o a c h

141

security of a British defeat. If Britain could hang on, something might turn American opinion. Churchill was even prepared to believe that this might

happen if the country was invaded. [^16]

At the time, Hitler’s choices appeared more palatable and easier. German

victories had confi rmed his reputation as a military genius with unques-

tioned authority. Yet he recognized the diffi culty of following the defeat of France with an invasion of Britain. A cross-channel invasion would be complicated and risky. There were also other options for getting Britain out of

the war. The fi rst was to push it out of the Mediterranean, further affecting its prestige and infl uence and interfering with its source of oil. Whether or not this would have had the desired effects, Hitler was wary of his regional

partners—Mussolini’s Italy, Franco’s Spain, and Vichy France. They all dis-

agreed with each other, and none could be considered reliable. Mussolini, for example, used German victories to move a reluctant country into war. He

then demonstrated his independence from Hitler by launching a foolhardy

invasion of Greece. This left him weakened and Hitler furious. Germany had

to rescue the Italian position in Greece and then North Africa, leading to a

major diversion of attention and resources from Hitler’s main project, the

invasion of the Soviet Union.

He considered a war with the Soviet Union to be not only inevitable but

also the culmination of his ambitions, allowing him to establish German

dominion over continental Europe and deal once and for all with the twin—

and, in his eyes, closely related—threats of the Jews and Communism. If he

was going to go to war with Russia anyway, it was best to do so while the

country was still weak following Josef Stalin’s mass purges of the army and

communist party in the 1930s. 17 A]] quick defeat of Russia would achieve Hitler’s essential objective and leave Britain truly isolated. But Hitler also had a view about how the war was likely to develop. Britain, he assumed, only resisted out of a hope that the Russians would join the war. Of course, without a quick win, Hitler faced the dreaded prospect of a war on two fronts—something good strategists were supposed to avoid—as well as increasing strain

on national resources. He needed to conquer the Soviet Union to sustain

the war and to gain access to food supplies and oil. With the Soviet Union

defeated, he reasoned, Britain would realize that the game was up and seek

terms. If Hitler had accepted that the Soviet Union could not be defeated,

his only course would have been to seek a limited peace with Britain that

would have matched neither the scale of his prior military achievements nor

his pending political ambition.

Another reason for acting quickly was that the Americans were likely

to come into the war eventually, but not—he assumed—until 1942 at the

142

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

earliest. Getting Russia out of the way quickly would limit the possibility of a grand coalition building up against him. In this Stalin helped. The Soviet

leader refused to listen to all those who tried to warn him about Hitler’s plans.

He assumed that the German leader would stick to the script that Stalin had

worked out for him, providing clues of the imminence of attack. Churchill’s

warnings were dismissed as self-serving propaganda, intended to provoke

war between the two European giants to help relieve the pressure on Britain.

Unlike Tsar Alexander in 1812, Stalin compounded the problem by having

his armies deployed on the border, making it easier for the German army to

plot a course that would cut them off before they could properly engage. The

result was a military disaster from which the Soviet Union barely escaped.

Yet a combination of the famous and fi erce Russian winter and some critical

German misjudgments about when and where to advance let Stalin recover

from the early blow. Once defeat was avoided, industrial strength slowly but

surely revived and the vast size of the Russian territory was too much for

the invaders. The virtuoso performances of German commanders could put

off defeat, but they could not overcome the formidable limits imposed by a

fl awed grand strategy.

Germany’s fi rst blow against the Soviet Union depended on surprise (as

did Japan’s against the United States), but it was not a knockout. The initial advantage did not guarantee a long-term victory. The stunning German victories of the spring 1940 and the bombing of British cities that began in the autumn approximated the possibilities imagined by Fuller, Liddell Hart, and

the airpower theorists, but they were not decisive. They moved the war from

one stage to another, and the next stage was more vicious and protracted.

The tank battles became large scale and attritional, culminating in the 1943

Battle of Kursk. Populations did not crumble under air attacks but endured

terrifi c devastation, culminating in the two atomic bombs dropped on the

Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki—the war’s shocking fi nale. Our

discussion of American military thought in the 1970s and 1980s will dem-

onstrate the United States’ high regard for the German operational art and

recall that this was not good enough to win the war.

When it came to victory, what mattered most was how coalitions were

formed, came together, and were disrupted. This gave meaning to battles.

The Axis was weak because Italy’s military performance was lackluster,

Spain stayed neutral, and Japan fought its own war and tried to avoid con-

fl ict with the Soviet Union. Britain’s moment of greatest peril came when

France was lost as an ally, but started to be eased when Germany attacked

the Soviet Union. Churchill’s hopes rested on the United States, sympa-

thetic to the British cause but not in a belligerent mood. It was eighteen

t h e i n d i r e c t a p p r o a c h

143

months before America was in the war. As soon as America entered the fray, Churchill rejoiced. “So we had won after all! . . . How long the war would

last or in what fashion it would end, no man could tell, nor did I at this

moment care . . . We should not be wiped out. Our history would not come

to an end.” 18

Nuclear Games

_We may be likened to two scorpions in a bottle, each capable of killing the_ _other, but only at the risk of his own life._

—J. Robert Oppenheimer

Wars normally conclude with calls for a new era of peace and jus-

tice, and the Second World War was no exception. Unfortunately,

the developing tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union and

their ideologically opposed blocs provided few grounds for optimism. The

possibility of a third world war became apparent almost immediately as the

underlying antagonism between Britain and the United States on the one

hand and the Soviet Union on the other surfaced over the fate of the territo-

ries liberated from German occupation. Soon there was talk of a “cold war,”

The Rationality of Irrationality

_This is a moral tract on mass murder: How to plan it, how to commit it,_

_how to get away with it, how to justify it._

—James Newman, review of Herman Kahn, _On Thermonuclear War_

Despite Brodie’s nomenclature, the fi rst atomic weapons were not

“absolute.” They were in the range of other munitions (the bomb that

destroyed Hiroshima was equivalent to the load of some two hundred B-29

bombers). Also, at least initially, the weapons were scarce. The key develop-

ment introduced by atomic bombs was less in the scale of their destructive

power than in their effi ciency. By the start of the 1950s, this situation had been transformed by two related developments. The fi rst was the breaking of

the U.S. monopoly by the Soviet Union, which conducted its fi rst atomic test in August 1949. Once two could play the nuclear game, the rules had to be

changed. Thought of initiating nuclear war would henceforth be qualifi ed by

the possibility of retaliation.

The second development followed from the fi rst. In an effort to extend

its effective nuclear superiority, the United States developed thermonuclear

bombs, based on the principles of nuclear fusion rather than fi ssion. This

made possible weapons with no obvious limits to their destructive potential.

In 1950 the American government assumed that the introduction of thermo-

nuclear weapons would allow the United States and its allies time to build

up conventional forces to match those of the Soviet Union and its satellites.

When Dwight D. Eisenhower became president in January 1953, he saw things differently. He wanted to take advantage of American nuclear superiority while it lasted, and also reduce the burden of spending on conventional rearmament. By this time, the nuclear arsenal was becoming more plentiful and more powerful. The strategy that emerged from these considerations

became known as “massive retaliation,” following a speech made by Secretary

of State John Foster Dulles in January 1954, when he declared that in the

future a U.S. response to aggression would be “at places and with means of

our own choosing.” 1

This doctrine was interpreted as threatening nuclear attack against tar-

gets in the Soviet Union and China in response to conventional aggression

anywhere in the world. Massive retaliation was widely criticized for plac-

ing excessive reliance on nuclear threats, which would become less credible

as Soviet nuclear strength grew. If a limited challenge developed and the

United States had neglected its own conventional forces, then the choice

would be between “suicide or surrender.” Dependence upon nuclear threats

in the face of an opponent able to make threats of its own sparked a surge of

intellectual creativity—later described as a “golden age” of strategic studies. 2

At its core was the key concept deterrence, to be explored with a range of new methodologies designed to cope with the special demands of the nuclear age.

_Deterrence_

The idea that palpable strength might cause an opponent to stay his hand

was hardly new. The word _deterrence_ is based on the Latin _deterre_ —to frighten from or away. In its contemporary use it came to refl ect an instrumental sense of seeking to induce caution by threats of pain. It was possible to be deterred without being threatened, for example, one might be cautious in anticipation

of how another might respond to a provocative act. As a strategy, however,

deterrence involved deliberate, purposive threats. This concept developed

prior to the Second World War in contemplation of strategic air raids. The

presumption of civilian panic that had animated the fi rst airpower theorists retained a powerful hold on offi cial imaginations. The fear of the crowd

led to musings on the likely anarchy that would follow sustained attacks.

Although the British lacked capabilities for mass long-range attacks prior

to the war, they doubted the possibility of defense and believed that only

the threat of punitive attacks could hold Germany back. Ultimately, Britain

had to rely on defense, which it did with unexpected success thanks to radar.

The raids against Britain, and those mounted in return against Germany

t h e r a t i o n a l i t y o f i r r a t i o n a l i t y

157

with even greater ferocity, resulted in terrible civilian pain but had limited political effects. Their main effect was on the ability to prosecute the war by disrupting production and fuel supplies. The surveys undertaken after the

war demonstrated the modest impact of strategic bombing compared with

the pre-war claims. But this did not really matter because the atom bomb

pushed the dread to a new level. As Richard Overy put it, with air power the

“theory had run ahead of the technology. After 1945 the two reached a fresh

alignment.” 3

Deterrence answered the stark exam question posed by the arrival of

nuclear weapons: What role can there be for a capability that has no tactical role in stopping armies or navies but can destroy whole cities? Answers in

terms of war-fi ghting, though explored by the Eisenhower administration,

appeared distasteful; answers in terms of deterrence promised the preven-

tion of future war. It sounded robust without being reckless. It anticipated

aggression and guarded against surprise but could still be presented as essentially reactive. The diffi culty was whether deterrence could be expected to

hold if it was self-evidently based on a bluff. Credibility appeared to depend on a readiness to convey recklessness, illustrated by another of John Foster

Dulles’s comments about the need to be ready “to go to the brink” during a

crisis. Thus the residual possibility of use left a formidable imprint, precisely because it would be so catastrophic.

This reinforced the view that the main benefi t of force lay in what was

held in reserve. The military capacity of the West must never be used to its

full extent, though for the sake of deterrence the possibility must exist. As decades passed, and the Cold War still did not turn hot, deterrence appeared

to be working. At times of crisis there was a welcome caution and prudence

all around. War was avoided because politicians were all too aware of the

consequences of failure and the dangers of preparing to crush enemies with

overwhelming force. The dread of total war infl uenced all considerations of

the use of force, and not just those directly involving nuclear weapons. It

was never possible to be sure where the fi rst military step, however tentative, might lead.

The impossibility of a fi ght to the fi nish affected all relations between the American and Soviet blocs. There developed “a predominance of the latent

over the manifest, of the oblique over the direct, of the limited over the gen-

eral.” 4]] If, as it seemed, there was no way of getting out of the nuclear age, then deterrence made the best of a bad job. While it was often diffi cult to

explain exactly how deterrence had worked its magic—and historians can

point to some terrifying moments when catastrophe was round the corner—

yet a third world war did not happen. The fact that the superpowers were

158

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

alarmed by the prospect of such a war surely had something to do with its failure to materialize.

The importance of deterrence meant that considerable efforts were

devoted to exploring the concept and examining its policy implications.

Deterrence succeeded if nothing happened, which led to a problem when

working out cause and effect. Inaction might refl ect a lack of intention or

an intention once present that had lapsed. Deterrence of an intended action

could be due to a range of factors, including some unrelated to the deterrer’s threats and some related in ways the deterrer did not nececessarily intend.

According to the most straightforward defi nition, that deterrence depended

on convincing the target that prospective costs would outweigh prospective

gains, it could be achieved by limiting gains as much as imposing costs.

Preventing gain by means of a credible ability to stop aggression in its

tracks became known as deterrence by denial, [^5] while imposing costs became deterrence by punishment. Denial was essentially another word for an effective defense, which if recognized in advance would provide a convincing

argument against aggression. Thus the main conceptual challenges con-

cerned punishment, especially the most brutal punishment of all: nuclear

retaliation.

As deterrence became wedded to a foreign policy of containment, inter-

preted as preventing any Soviet advances, both major war and minor provo-

cations had to be deterred, not just those directed against the United States but also those directed against allies, and even the enemy’s enemies. Herman

Kahn, an early popularizer of some of the more abstruse theories of deterrence, distinguished three types: Type I involved superpower nuclear exchanges;

Type II limited conventional or tactical nuclear attacks involving allies; and Type III addressed most other types of challenges. 6 At each stage, the require-]]

ments in terms of political will became more demanding, especially once

both sides had acquired nuclear arsenals. It was one thing to threaten nuclear retaliation to deter nuclear attack, quite another to threaten nuclear use to deter a non-nuclear event. Because it was always unlikely that the United

States would be directly attacked by a major power with anything other than

nuclear weapons, the most likely non-nuclear event to be deterred would be

an attack on an ally. This requirement came to be known as “extended deter-

rence.” Because of the development of Soviet capabilities, U.S. methods of

deterrence became less confi dent, moving from disproportionate to propor-

tionate retaliation, from setting defi nite obstacles to aggression to warnings that should aggression occur the consequences could be beyond calculation,

from assured and unconstrained threats of overwhelming force to a shared

risk of mutual destruction.

_Schelling_

The theorist who did more than any other to explore the conundrums of

deterrence and nuclear strategy was Thomas Schelling. He was one of a num-

ber of fi gures in and around RAND during the 1950s—including Bernard

Brodie, Albert Wohlstetter, and Herman Kahn—who despite their dif-

ferences contributed to a developing framework for thinking about these

weapons that acknowledged their horrifi c novelty yet tried to describe their strategic possibilities. At the time, Kahn—ebullient and provocative, and

one possible model for Stanley Kubrik’s _Dr. Strangelove_ —was the best known.

His book _On Thermonuclear War_ forged a link with Clausewitz, at least in its title, although his biographer doubted whether he had ever even done more

than skimmed Clausewitz: “He never showed a smidgen of interest in any

strategic theorist.” 7 W]]ohlstetter described his prose as “dictated through a

public address system.” 8

He was nuclear strategy’s “fi rst celebrity,” with his “physical mass and

somewhat geeky cast” confi rming myths that the ultimate war would be

the product of the imaginings of “mad geniuses.” A mass of statistics on

the likely character of nuclear war would be qualifi ed by breezy and hardly

comforting statements, such as “barring bad luck and bad management,” and

led to policy options that were evaluated in terms of possible losses of units of humanity measured in the millions. [^9] Kahn’s fellow nuclear strategists objected as much to his showmanship and the bad name he gave their new

profession as to his claims about emerging victorious from the apocalypse.

An enthusiastic advocate of civil defense, Kahn was convinced that control

was possible in all types of confl ict, even nuclear war.

Schelling was a more substantial theorist, developing ways of think-

ing about confl ict that illuminated nuclear issues while remaining relevant

to broader strategic questions. After the mid-1960s, when he felt he had

said much of what he wanted to say about nuclear matters, he turned his

attention to other issues, ranging from crime to cigarette smoking, but still applied the same essential approach. His achievement was underlined by

the award of a Nobel Prize in economics in 2005 for “having enhanced

our understanding of confl ict and cooperation through game-theory analy-

sis.” [^10] Yet Schelling’s relationship to game theory was equivocal. He did not describe himself as a game theorist but rather a social scientist who

used game theory on occasion. He hit upon his big idea before he came

across game theory as a means through which it could be expressed. He

preferred to reason through analogy in ways that purists found maddening.

Schelling’s reputation depended on his gifts as a brilliant expositor who

160

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

wrote with elegance and lucidity, traits for which this particular fi eld of endeavor were not well known. [^11]

Schelling did not claim to have achieved the “science” that had long been

sought in strategy or that formal logic could in principle lead to a mathematical solution. He shared the view, growing among the operational research

community, that advanced mathematics and abstract models were making

their work less accessible to potential users, 12]] and he always opposed the

suggestion that strategy was or should be “a branch of mathematics.” 13]] He confessed to having learned more “from reading ancient Greek history and by

looking at salesmanship than studying game theory.” The greatest achieve-

ment of game theory, as far as he was concerned, was the payoff matrix. It

was extraordinarily useful to be able to put together in a matrix a “simple

situation involving as few as two people and two choices.” 14

His equivocation on game theory was not unique. Other nuclear strate-

gists who worked at RAND during the 1950s tended to talk of following

the “spirit” of game theory rather than its rules. In a 1949 article, Brodie

referred to game theory in a footnote as a source of “mathematical systemati-

zation,” adding that “for various reasons” he did not share the authors’ “conviction that their theory could be directly and profi tably applied to problems of military strategy.” 15 Later]], while fi nding its “refi nements” of little use, he acknowledged the value of the “constant reminder that in war we shall be

dealing with an opponent who will react to our moves and to whom we must

react.” [^16] Few of the books on nuclear strategy made much, if any, mention of game theory. This absence was notable in a book by one of the founders

of game theory, Oskar Morgenstern. [^17] Bruce-Briggs suggests that the close association between nuclear strategy and game theory was a consequence of

the reception of Kahn’s _On Thermonuclear War_ . Although Kahn had used neither game theory nor mathematics, he was accused of being the most extreme

example of a game-theory-wielding militarist, a moniker implying great

technical capacity but no moral sensibility. Schelling was also included in

this category. 18 Schelling observed at the time, “I don’]]t see that game theory is any more involved than Latin grammar or geophysics; but its quaint name

makes mysterious and patronizing references to it an effective ploy.” 19]]

Schelling had little background in military issues. Trained as an economist,

he worked on the implementation of the postwar Marshall Plan for economic

reconstruction in Europe. This led to his general interest in negotiations of all types, particularly the process of fi nding points that could support an

agreed solution, possibly through tacit as much as explicit bargaining. After publishing an article demonstrating the possibility of arriving at common

solutions without direct communication, 20]] he read Luce and Raiffa’s _Games_ t h e r a t i o n a l i t y o f i r r a t i o n a l i t y

161

_and Decisions_ and saw the potential of game theory. 21 His interest in how]]

“nations, people, or organizations go about committing themselves to threats

and promises in bargaining positions” led him into contact with RAND in

1956 and he spent a productive year there from 1958 to 1959. [^22] Schelling was able to test his developing theories in the company of other key thinkers from a variety of disciplines, all trying to make sense of the nuclear age.

Although he was offered jobs in the Kennedy administration, he preferred to

keep his independence. He did work as a consultant, however.

Many of the ideas and concepts Schelling developed along with his col-

leagues at RAND became familiar and entered the strategic vernacular, but

it is important to note just how novel and radical they were. Critics com-

plained, with some justice, that the methodology allowed talk about dread-

ful possibilities in dispassionate terms and contemplated moves that should

never be countenanced by a civilized people. Their models did not offer a way of transcending the Cold War confl ict and failed to accommodate the ideological and geopolitical issues. These were important limitations, but they

should not hide the achievement of developing a way to think about confl ict

that could also accommodate cooperation.

Schelling started with the special features of a game of strategy, compared

with those of chance or skill: “Each player’s best choice depends on the action he expects the other to take, which he knows depends, in turn, on the other’s expectation of his own.” Strategy was all about interdependence, “the conditioning of one’s own behavior on the behavior of others.” This could cover any social relationships in which there was a mixture of confl ict and cooperation.

All partnerships were to some degree precarious, just as all antagonisms were to some degree incomplete. The combination of confl ict and cooperation was

at the heart of the theory. It became irrelevant when there was an absence of either. Schelling noted that the theory “degenerates at one extreme if there

is not scope for mutual accommodation, no common interest at all even in

avoiding mutual disaster; it degenerates at the other extreme if there is no

confl ict at all and no problem in identifying and reaching common goals.” 23]]

On this basis the role of force could be rethought. Traditionally it had

been used by countries to take and hold what they wanted: “Forcibly a coun-

try can repel and expel, penetrate and occupy, seize, exterminate, disarm and disable, confi ne, deny access, and directly frustrate intrusion or attack. It can, that is, if it has enough strength. ‘Enough’ depends on how much an opponent has.” [^24] In setting up an alternative to brute force, Schelling made one of his most startling assertions: “In addition to weakening an enemy militarily

it can cause an enemy plain suffering.” Contrary to prevailing views—and

established international law, for that matter—that stressed the importance

162

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

of avoiding unnecessary suffering, Schelling claimed that the ability to hurt was “among the most impressive attributes of military force.” Its value lay

not in actually doing so, which would constitute a gross failure of strategy, but in what opponents might do to avoid it. So long as the violence could

both be anticipated and avoided by accommodation, it had coercive value.

“The power to hurt is bargaining power. To exploit it is diplomacy—vicious

diplomacy, but diplomacy.” Under this proposition, strategy moved from

considerations of conquest and resistance to deterrence, intimidation, black-

mail, and threats.

Coercion was therefore at the heart of the theory. The hurt did not have

to be nuclear. The same framework could work with less punitive forms, for

example, economic sanctions. It could also take in the traditional distinction between offense and defense, although not in the sense of being able to be

certain of either conquering territory or stopping any invasion at the borders.

The point about coercion was that it involved infl uencing through threats

rather than controlling the opponent’s behavior. The defensive equivalent

was deterrence, persuading an enemy not to attack; the offensive equiva-

lent was “compellence,” inducing withdrawal or acquiescence. Deterrence

demanded an opponent’s inaction; compellence demanded action or ceas-

ing adverse actions. Deterrence was about the status quo and had no obvi-

ous time limits; compellence projected forward to a new place and could

be urgent. Deterrence was easier because all that was required was that an

action be withheld. The target could deny that one was ever contemplated.

Compliance was more conspicuous with compellence, more evidently “sub-

mission under duress,” less “capable of being rationalized as something that

one was going to do anyhow.” The two could merge. Once an initial deterrent

threat had failed and an opponent was acting in a hostile way, the next threat must be compellent. In a confl ict in which both sides could hurt each other

but neither could forcibly accomplish its purpose, and in which the balance

of advantage kept changing hands, the requirement to deter and to compel

could shift, depending on who was on top at any time. 25

Nuclear threats had a special character. Executing them would be an

unusually horrible thing to do, but a state with a nuclear monopoly might

feel that it was not too diffi cult to gain strategic advantage by threatening others. What made the difference was that something equally horrible might

come back in return. How could one benefi t from threats that lacked cred-

ibility because of the risk of retaliation and could thus be exposed as bluff at the fi rst challenge? Again, Schelling addressed this conundrum by turning

traditional concepts upside down. The aim of strategy, it had been supposed,

was to exert the maximum control over the course of an unfolding confl ict.

t h e r a t i o n a l i t y o f i r r a t i o n a l i t y

163

Schelling asked a different question: could there be strategic advantages in accepting a loss of control? Coercive threats worked by infl uencing an opponent’s choices. Perhaps their choice could be made more diffi cult by limiting one’s own. To inject credibility into an apparently irrational stance, why not work to create an essentially irrational situation?

The idea was to shift the onus of decision onto the other side, so that it

was the opponent who was obliged to choose between continued combat

and backing down. Only “the enemy’s withdrawal can tranquilize the situa-

tion; otherwise it may turn out to be a contest of nerves.” 26]] There were precedents: the Greeks burning their bridges to show they would stand and fi ght

against the Persians; the Spanish conqueror Cortez conspicuously burning his

ships in front of the Aztecs. By removing retreat as an option, your men had

no choice but to fi ght, while the enemy would be discouraged by an apparent

display of confi dence.

In the nuclear sphere, at one extreme, choice could be wholly conceded

to the opponent by making the threatened action automatic, beyond recall

unless stopped by an act of compliance. That was the notion of the “dooms-

day machine”: pass a line and nothing could be done to stop the detonation

and the shared calamity. Removing all choice was unacceptable, so Schelling

posed the problem in terms of progressive risk. The opponent would know

that even if the threatener had second thoughts, the threat might still be

implemented. This set up the possibility of a “competition in risk-taking”

which could turn war into a contest of “endurance, nerve, obstinacy and

pain.” This would be not quite a doomsday machine, but the threatened

would know that the threat could not be wholly bluff because the threatener

was not completely in control. Schelling called this “The Threat That Leaves

Something to Chance.” The feature of such threats was that “though one may

or may not carry them out, _the fi nal decision is not altogether under the threatener’s_ _control_ .” [^27] In his version of Clausewitz’s friction, Schelling emphasized the ubiquity of uncertainty that gave this type of threat credibility:

Violence, especially in war, is a confused and uncertain activity, highly

unpredictable depending on decisions made by fallible human beings

organized into imperfect governments depending on fallible com-

munications and warning systems and on the untested performance

of people and equipment. It is furthermore a hotheaded activity, in

which commitments and reputations can develop a momentum of

their own. [^28]

Whereas Clausewitz saw friction as undermining all but the most dogged of

strategies, Schelling saw how these uncertainties might be used creatively, if 164

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

recklessly. The uncertainty would grow as a crisis turned into a limited confl ict and then moved toward general war, getting out of hand “by degrees.” [^29]

Skillful tactics would exploit this fact, not shrink from it. The assumption

was that it was worth letting a “situation get somewhat out of hand” because

the opponent would fi nd such circumstances intolerable. Deterrence was pos-

sible because of a situation in which terrible things _might_ happen (which was credible because of human irrationality) rather than a specifi c threat to do those things (which was incredible because of human rationality).

The potential rationality of irrationality was illustrated using the game of

“chicken.” Two cars were driven toward each other by delinquent teenagers,

Bill and Ben, anxious to prove their toughness. The fi rst to swerve lost. If both swerved, nothing was gained; if neither swerved, everything was lost. If Bill swerved and Ben did not, then Bill suffered humiliation and Ben gained

prestige. The matrix appeared as shown below.

_The fi gures in the corners refer to values attached to alternative outcomes._

The minimax strategy dictated that they both swerved as the best of the

worst outcomes. This represented the natural caution displayed by both sides

during the Cold War. Timing, however, made a difference. Bill was prepared

to swerve, but Ben swerved fi rst. Bill won because he delayed his commit-

ment. He kept his nerve longer. Perhaps he was confi dent that Ben would

swerve because he knew him to be weak-willed. Suppose that Ben was aware

of this impression and sought to correct it. He wanted Bill to think him reckless or even a bit crazy. A number of ruses might reinforce such an impres-

sion: swaggering, boasting, or feigning drunkenness. Irrationality became

rational. If Ben could persuade Bill that he had taken leave of his senses, Ben might just prevail.

This illuminates the basic problem with this line of argument. Even if

one was apparently committed to a patently irrational course to impress the

t h e r a t i o n a l i t y o f i r r a t i o n a l i t y

165

opponent, a foot would still hover close to the brake pedal and hands would stay fi rmly on the steering wheel. What might work for two individuals

was less likely to work for governments who needed to convince their own

people that they knew what they were doing. Even if the internal audience

was tolerant of ruses designed to suggest a loss of control, such stunts could not be a regular feature of crisis management. Whether the game involved

individuals or states, it was diffi cult to pretend irrationality consistently, in one game after another. Like deceptive strategies, pretended irrationality

would be diffi cult to repeat as it would affect perceptions of behavior next time round. Indeed it could be counterproductive if the other side overcom-pensated. The more often the game was played, the more dangerous it could

become. The full importance of any strategic encounter lay not only in the

implications for the matter at hand but also in the long-term impact on the

relationship between the two adversaries. The results of strategies adopted in a particular game would affect their potential success if used in subsequent

games. Game theory presented simultaneous decisions by players. Schelling

understood that the moves often took place sequentially, so that the structure

of the game changed each time. 30

The mutual learning process was important to Schelling’s schema. It was

almost a mission to reorient game theory to take account of the fact that

“people

_can_

often concert their intentions or expectations with others if

each knows that the other is trying to do the same.” Unlike theorists who

argued that equilibrium points could be found using mathematics, Schelling

insisted that points would suggest themselves as being obvious or natural.

This required “some common language that permits them to hold discourse.”

Communication of this sort between adversaries would not allow for great

subtlety or sophistication, especially if the language did not emerge through formal negotiations or declarations. It could be tacit as much as explicit,

dependent on prominent symbols and values in a shared culture, guided by

tradition and precedence, with mutual understandings created and reinforced

through deeds as much as words. It would draw “on imagination more than

on logic; it could depend on analogy, precedent, accidental arrangement, sym-

metry, aesthetic or geometric confi guration, casuistic reasoning, and who the parties are and what they know about each other.” 31 Certain focal points would]]

become salient. They would need to be simple, recognizable, and conspicuous.

In _Arms and Infl uence_ , Schelling gave examples of features that might suggest themselves to opposing forces who could not communicate directly:

National boundaries and rivers, shorelines, the battle line itself, even

parallels of latitude, the distinction between air and ground, the

166

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

distinction between nuclear fi ssion and chemical combustion, the distinction between combat support and economic support, the distinction between combatants and non-combatants, the distinctions

among nationalities. [^32]

Once proper communication was possible, and the players could use direct

speech and overt bargaining, the “pure-coordination game,” Schelling sug-

gests, “not only ceases to be interesting but virtually ceases to be a ‘game.’ ” [^33]

Yet for all the possibilities of indirect communication, the infl uence of

norms and conventions of behavior, or the focal points thrown up by nature,

it was hard to see how they could be more reliable than direct communica-

tions. In circumstances where the opportunities for direct communication

were sparse, as was the case between the two ideological blocs for much of the Cold War, Schelling’s insight about the possibility of still fi nding shared focal points by indirect means was valuable. But it could not be taken too far. It did not necessarily mean that these points would be found when they were really

needed. Moreover, when two sides were working with such different sets of

values and beliefs, what was salient for one might not be so salient for the other.

Without direct communication to verify that an agreed point had been found,

it was possible to miscalulate by assuming that the other side attached the same salience to the same point or by assuming that agreement on such matters was

impossible. It could seem, as Hedley Bull observed in a review of _Arms and_ _Infl uence_ , that the superpowers would be “sending and receiving messages and

ironing out understandings” with “scarcely as much as a nod or a wink.” 34

_First and Second Strikes_

Schelling argued that not only was it possible to think of nuclear strategy in terms of bargaining and coercion but it was unwise to think of it in any other way. This challenged the idea of a decisive victory directly by claiming that at least in the nuclear area it made no sense. That did not mean that there

was no concept of what a decisive nuclear victory would look like. To ensure

success it would have to take the form of a knockout blow that left the oppo-

nent no chance to retaliate. This was not a possibility that either side in the Cold War ever felt able to dismiss entirely. It provided part of the dynamic

of the arms race between the two sides and governed calculations of risk.

A “fi rst-strike capability” came to refer to the potential ability to disarm the enemy in a surprise attack. No military operation ever conceived could be as

fateful. It would be the fi rst and only time it would be attempted and would t h e r a t i o n a l i t y o f i r r a t i o n a l i t y

167

be launched in secret, using untried weapons against a range of disparate targets in a wholly unique scenario, using equally untried defenses to catch

any retaliatory weapons. Whether such a capability was in reach depended on

evaluations of the developing capabilities of offensive and defensive weapons.

In a celebrated RAND study of the mid-1950s, a team led by Albert

Wohlstetter demonstrated that the air bases of the U.S. Strategic Air Command could be vulnerable to a surprise attack. Retaliation from such an attack would be impossible, thereby exposing the United States and its allies to Soviet blackmail. 35 This challenged the prevailing view that nuclear weapons could be used]]

solely in “counter-value” strikes against easily targeted political and economic centers. A “counter-force” strike against military targets would potentially be strategically decisive because it would leave the opponent without any way of retaliating. If, however, the attacked nation was able to absorb an attempted fi rst strike and retain suffi cient forces to hit back then it would have a “second-strike capability.” Wohlstetter believed that this study, drawing on “the tradition of operations research and empirical systems analysis,” far more than

Schelling’s musings, discovered the “vulnerabilities of strategic forces.” 36]]

Suppose both sides had a fi rst-strike capability. Brodie set out the alternative possibilities in a 1954 article in which he observed that in a world in

which “either side can make a surprise attack on the other” it would make

sense to be “trigger-happy.” As with the “American gunfi ghter duel, frontier style,” the “one who leads on the draw and the aim achieves a good clean win.”

If neither side had the capability, however, trigger-happiness would be sui-

cidal, and restraint only prudent. [^37] Depending on how the technology developed, there would either be powerful pressures to preempt at times of high

political tension, which could lead to a dangerous dynamic, or there would be considerable stability, as no premium would be attached to unleashing nuclear hostilities. Thus, confi dence in stability depended on expectations with regard to the opponent’s attitude and behavior. In a compelling example of his mode

of analysis, Schelling described a “reciprocal fear of surprise attack” to show how an apparently stable system of deterrence could suddenly be destabilized

even when there was no “fundamental” basis for either side to strike fi rst: “A modest temptation on each side to sneak in a fi rst blow—a temptation too

small by itself to motivate an attack—might become compounded through

a process of interacting expectations, with additional motive for attack being produced by successive cycles of ‘He thinks we think he thinks we think . . . he thinks we think he’ll attack; so he thinks we shall; so he will; so we must.’ ”

To reduce any chance of such thoughts, nuclear systems should be unequiv-

ocally geared to a second strike: relatively invulnerable and relatively inaccurate. In practice this meant that cities would be threatened, not weapons.

168

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

The logic became even more uncomfortable and paradoxical. Nothing should be done to diminish the murderous consequences of a nuclear war because

nothing should be done to encourage any thought that it was worth starting.

“A weapon that can hurt only people, and cannot possibly damage the other

side’s striking force,” Schelling explained, “is profoundly defensive; it provides its possessor no incentive to strike fi rst.” The danger lay with weapons intended to “seek out the enemy’s missiles and bombers—that _can_ exploit the advantage of striking fi rst and consequently provide a temptation to do

so.” 38 The aim was to stabilize the U.S.-Soviet nuclear relationship. On this

basis, Schelling noted, missile-carrying submarines were admirable for sec-

ond-strike purposes. They were extremely hard to fi nd and destroy at sea, but it was also hard (at the time he was writing) to use them for accurate strikes against the enemy forces. For this reason, Schelling argued that Americans

should not want a monopoly on these submarines, for if they “have either no

intention or no political capacity for a fi rst strike it would usually be helpful if the enemy were confi dently assured of this.”

If such reasoning led to conclusions that seemed quite bizarre to the mili-

tary mind, the same was true for those on the other side of the argument,

campaigning for radical measures of disarmament. The more weapons one

had, the more diffi cult it was for the adversary to wipe them out in a surprise attack. An agreement designed to stabilize the nuclear relationship would be

easier to maintain at higher rather than lower levels, for it would be much

more diffi cult to prepare to cheat by hiding extra missiles if the starting

numbers were high. [^39] Neither the military nor the disarmers were at all sure that their activities should be mutually reinforcing. The term “arms control” was in fact coined in the 1950s precisely to identify forms of mutual

understanding that were compatible with the new imperatives of military

strategy. [^40] It meant that the military had to get used to the idea that while opposing the enemy’s force they must

also collaborate, implicitly if not explicitly, in avoiding the kinds of

crises in which withdrawal is intolerable for both sides, in avoiding

false alarms and mistaken intentions, and in providing—along with

its deterrent threat of resistance or retaliation in the event of unaccept-

able challenges—reassurance that restraint on the part of potential

enemies will be matched by restraint of our own. 41

In line with Schelling’s general interest in how productive agreements could be reached without direct communication, arms control could involve “induced

or reciprocated ‘self-control,’ whether the inducements include negotiated

treaties or just informal understandings and reciprocated restraints.” 42

t h e r a t i o n a l i t y o f i r r a t i o n a l i t y

169

In any event, technological developments supported the second strike.

Attempts to develop effective defenses against nuclear attack proved futile. By the mid-1960s, fears eased of a technological arms race that might encourage

either side to unleash a surprise attack. For the foreseeable future, each side could eliminate the other as a modern industrial state. Robert McNamara,

as secretary of defense, argued that so long as the two superpowers had confi -

dence in their capacity for mutual assured destruction—an ability to impose

“unacceptable damage” defi ned as 25 percent of population and 50 percent

of industry—the relationship between the two would be stable. These levels,

it should be noted, refl ected less a judgment about the tolerances of modern societies and more the point at which extra explosions would result in diminishing marginal returns measured by new damage and casualties, the point at

which—to use Winston Churchill’s vivid phrase—“all you are going to do is

make the rubble bounce.”

If serious fi ghting did begin, the incentives would shift. Assuming no

rush into nuclear exchanges, it would still be possible to shape the develop-

ment of the confl ict by drawing on the potential of what could happen. So

long as cities were spared there was some hope of establishing a new bargain, even in the midst of war. But once cities were destroyed there was nothing else to lose. Attacks on cities would be “a massive and modern version

of an ancient institution: the exchange of hostages.” Keeping something of

value vulnerable was a way of enforcing good behavior. 43]] Like Clausewitz, Schelling saw how raw and angry passions could also undermine restraint.

The process by which a confl ict intensifi ed and became more danger-

ous came to be described as “escalation.” This word (not one that Schelling

favored) came into vogue to describe a tragic process as a limited war became total. It was based on the metaphor of the moving staircase that once started could not be stopped, however much the original decision might be regretted. The term—initially interchangeable with words like _explosion_ , _eruption_ , and _trigger_ —was fi rst used to challenge the idea of a limited nuclear war.

Henry Kissinger, for example, defi ned escalation in 1960 as “the addition of increments of power until limited war insensibly merges into all-out war.” 44]]

Schelling was aware of opportunities to use the process for bargaining pur-

poses as well as how these would become fewer as control over events was

progressively lost. To get the aggressor to stop and preferably go back to

the starting point, relinquishing captured territory, the threat would have

to be credible and serious, yet the circumstances would be those in which a

previous deterrent threat had not been taken suffi ciently seriously. The function of limited war therefore had to be understood less in terms of ensuring

that war stayed limited and more in terms of posing “the deliberate risk of

170

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

all-out war” and keeping the risk of escalation “within moderate limits above zero.” [^45] The role of the fi rst nuclear exchanges would not be “solely or mainly to redress a balance on the battlefi eld” but primarily “to make the war too

painful or too dangerous to continue.” 46

Schelling developed his ideas before it became apparent that the super-

power confrontation would become dominated by thoughts of mutual

destruction. The possibilities that Schelling explored did not materialize

because the consequences of any nuclear use would be so horrendous that

they did not lend themselves to subtle and clever maneuvers. Crisis behavior

became careful, cautious, and circumspect. So much of Schelling’s frame-

work can be considered in retrospect as a mind-clearing exercise, explor-

ing a range of possibilities that never moved beyond speculative hypotheses

but at least demonstrated the inadequacy of conventional strategic thought.

During the 1950s, with memories of past lurches to war still strong, few

were confi dent that a third world war could be indefi nitely postponed. The

exploration of the logic of deterrence, and why it made sense to accept this

logic rather than attempt to circumvent it, was important enough to justify

the effort.

_Existential Deterrence_

It might have even been possible to imagine a major war between the two

superpowers in which nuclear weapons were not used, although few would

have been prepared to rely on continuing restraint. The core problem which

niggled away at America’s strategists was that of extended deterrence, the

commitment to bring nuclear means to the aid of non-nuclear allies. Once a

stalemate was reached, it seemed reckless to consider nuclear war on behalf

of allies. But the Europeans were assumed to have insuffi cient conventional

strength to hold back a determined assault by the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. If

Europe was not to be overrun, there at least had to be a possibility that the United States would initiate nuclear war. Were it not for this basic political commitment, refl ecting a vital interest, there would have been no need to

worry about Schelling’s “threats that left something to chance.” This idea

was best captured by so-called tactical nuclear weapons whose military value

could never be properly explained but conveyed the risk that once entangled

in a land war in Europe, they could trigger nuclear war in a way that was

beyond rational consideration.

By the start of the 1960s, there was a developing view in the United

States that the best way to ease this problem was to reduce dependence upon

t h e r a t i o n a l i t y o f i r r a t i o n a l i t y

171

nuclear threats by increasing conventional forces—to create deterrence by denial. The diffi culty was that a conventional build-up would be expensive

and such obvious efforts to reduce their nuclear liabilities would suggest to European minds that the Americans might consider European security a less

than vital interest. Behind this there was a disjunction between the formal

strategic analysis emerging from the American think tanks and the politics

of Europe, divided between two hostile ideological blocs, yet enjoying some

stability. The Europeans did not view the continent as being on the edge of

war. They understood that nuclear threats might not be credible, but deter-

rence could still work because of the residual possibility that in the irrational, intense circumstances of another European war, nuclear weapons might

be used. The possibility did not have to be very large for political leaders

to decide to stick with a manageable status quo. On this basis, the key to

deterrence was alliance, the close link between American power—including

its nuclear arsenal—and European security. The threat to deterrence was any-

thing which undermined that link.

Here was a clash of strategic frameworks. One was top down, the classi-

cal, grand strategic perspective which focused on the formidable reasons not

to risk war when it was possible to imagine catastrophe for all involved. The other was bottom up, an operational analysis which considered where the

advantage might lie in a confl ict, should the politicians decide the stakes

were worth the fi ght. This pointed to an inability to match Soviet conven-

tional strength. Only increasingly incredible nuclear threats were available

should Moscow take advantage of this vulnerability, raising the possibility

that it just might.

This issue came to a head in 1961 when newly elected President Kennedy

was faced with a major challenge over the status of Berlin. The old German

capital was fi rmly in communist East Germany, yet as part of the postwar

settlement it had been divided into two. West Berlin, connected uneasily to

West Germany, offered an easy route out for East Germans seeking to escape

communism. This was a major irritant to Moscow. There were threats that

summer of a Soviet move to cut off West Berlin and bring it into communist

control. As the city was indefensible by conventional means, any effort to

prevent this carried a risk of nuclear war. Ultimately this risk was suffi cient for the communists to limit the provocation, and they built a wall which

divided Berlin and so kept their people hemmed in.

During that summer’s crisis, a paper by Schelling setting out his ideas

on limited nuclear confl ict was passed to Kennedy. The paper stressed the

importance of heightening the risk to the enemy rather than making a

futile bid to win a decisive victory. “We should plan for a war of nerve, of

172

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

demonstration and of bargaining, not of tactical target destruction.” This paper apparently made a “deep impression” on Kennedy. Schelling had been

talking with McGeorge Bundy, Kennedy’s national security advisor. They

shared a concern that the military seemed unable to think through the “hid-

eous jump between conventional warfare and a single massive all-out blast.” [^47]

His main contribution to policy at this time, however, was to help set up a

“crisis game” that sought to simulate, as closely as possible, the confused

and stressful conditions decision-makers might face and the questions to be

addressed should tensions over Berlin escalate. Schelling’s game explored how the Berlin crisis might unfold. This had the advantage of being a contained

scenario, in which the dimensions and core views of the protagonists were

known. In September 1961, a number of rounds of this game took place in

Washington designed to impress on the participants the “bargaining aspect

of a military crisis.” The games forced senior policymakers—military and

civilian—to work out responses to various contingencies. The conclusions,

which had an effect on both offi cial thought and Schelling’s future theoriz-

ing, emphasized the pressure of events. It was far harder to communicate

effi ciently than was often assumed, as the enemy saw only the actions and not the intent behind them, and there would be far less time for diplomacy to

operate than had been hoped.

Yet it also became extraordinarily diffi cult in the games to trigger a

large-scale conventional war, much less a nuclear confl ict. According to Alan Ferguson, Schelling’s collaborator, “our inability to get a fi ght started” was the “single most striking result.” [^48] The games also highlighted a problem with Berlin: “Whoever it is who has to initiate the action that neither side

wants is the side that is deterred. In a fragile situation, good strategy involves

leaving the overt act up to the other side.” 49 The game therefore gave little

support to the idea that any nuclear use, even for signaling purposes, pro-

vided realistic options for NATO in the event that the Berlin crisis worsened but it did reinforce the size of the gap between conventional and nuclear

war. Reporting back to Kennedy, an aide highlighted the diffi culty of using

“military power fl exibly and effectively for tactical purposes in the conduct of

the day to day political struggle with the Soviet Union.” 50

The next year Kennedy faced an even greater crisis prompted by the dis-

covery that the Soviet Union was building missile sites in Cuba. Many of

the conversations of leading players on the American side were recorded as

they debated potential moves and counter-moves. The president spent much

of the crisis trying to determine the effect of a particular course of action on Moscow, and to do this he tried to put himself in Nikita Khrushchev’s shoes.

In doing so, Kennedy supposed that the Soviet leader was cast in the same

t h e r a t i o n a l i t y o f i r r a t i o n a l i t y

173

mould, responding to the same stimuli and facing the same sort of pressures from his own hard-liners, fi nding it as hard as Kennedy would to back down

from public commitments. He was fearful that a missile strike against Cuba

would lead to a Soviet attack against Turkey, where American missiles of

equivalent range and targeting were based; a blockade of Cuba would revive

the issue of a blockade of West Berlin.

Kennedy formed an in-group of key offi cials—known as ExComm—

to debate the alternatives. One option was to launch air strikes against the

offending bases in Cuba to take them out before they became operational.

This option had to take into account whether it might be possible to get away with a small “surgical” strike or whether the risk could only be removed by

continual and heavy strikes, possibly followed by an invasion. Another option involved a more gradualist approach, demonstrating resolve through a blockade to prevent military equipment getting to Cuba. ExComm’s decisions in

part depended on the practicalities: the air force’s confi dence in their ability to fi nd and destroy the bases, the quality of the air defenses they would face, and the risk that some of the weapons were already operational. When confronting

the possibility of air strikes, especially without warning, a number of mem-

bers of ExComm felt uneasy. The United States had, after all, been the victim of a surprise air strike on December 7, 1941. The president’s speechwriter,

Ted Sorenson, noted that he had no trouble writing the speech announcing

the blockade but great diffi culty writing one to report an air strike. The other advantage of the blockade was it did not preclude tougher action if it failed to produce immediate results. It kept options open and the opponent guessing.

There was still anxiety over whether the blockade could be enforced.

Robert Kennedy wrote of his brother as he waited to see how Soviet ships

would respond.

I think these few minutes were the time of greatest concern for the

President. Was the world on the brink of a holocaust? Was it our

error? A mistake? Was there something further that should have been

done? Or not done? His hand went up to his face and covered his

mouth. He opened and closed his fi st. His face seemed drawn, his eyes

pained, almost gray.

From the other side, consider a long, impassioned private letter to Kennedy

that arrived two days later from the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev:

If people do not show wisdom, then in the fi nal analysis they will

come to a clash, like blind moles, and then reciprocal extermination

will begin. . . . we and you ought not to pull on the ends of the rope

174

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

in which you have tied the knot of war, because the more the two of us pull, the tighter that knot will be tied. And a moment may come

when that knot will be tied so tight that even he who tied it will not

have the strength to untie it, and then it will be necessary to cut it,

and what that would mean is not for me to explain to you, because

you yourself understand perfectly of what terrible forces our countries

dispose. [^51]

On Saturday, October 27, 1962, tensions were at their height after mixed

messages from Moscow—one conciliatory, the other tough—and the added

tension of an American spy plane getting shot down over Cuba. The pre-

sumed response was to retaliate against Soviet surface-to-air missile sites in Cuba. While this might be held back, at some point surveillance would need

to start again, putting U.S. aircraft at risk and making a response unavoid-

able. Robert McNamara set out a possible script. If surveillance aircraft were fi red upon, the United States would have to respond. There would be losses

of aircraft, and “we’ll be shooting up Cuba quite a bit.” This was not a position that could be sustained for very long. “So we must be prepared to attack Cuba—quickly.” This was going to require an “all-out attack” involving air

strikes, with “sorties every day thereafter, and I personally believe that this is almost certain to lead to an invasion, I won’t say certain to, but _almost_ certain to lead to an invasion.”

The next stage assumed a tit-for-tat reprisal from Khrushchev: “If we do

this, and leave those missiles in Turkey the Soviet Union _may_ , and I think probably will, attack the Turkish missiles.” This led inexorably on to the

proposition that “ _if_ the Soviet Union attacks the Turkish missiles, we _must_ respond. We _cannot_ allow a Soviet attack on the—on the Jupiter missiles in Turkey without a military response by NATO.” He continued

Now the minimum military response by NATO to a Soviet attack

on the Turkish Jupiter missiles would be a response with conven-

tional weapons by NATO forces in Turkey, that is to say Turkish and

U.S. aircraft, against Soviet warships and/or naval bases in the Black

Sea area. Now that to me is the absolute minimum, and I would say

that it is _damned dangerous_ to—to have had a Soviet attack on Turkey and a NATO response on the Soviet Union. 52]]

McNamara took this suffi ciently seriously, even though he was assuming

in this script that his own government would take choices that he clearly

thought unwise, to suspect that a nuclear war would be set in motion the

next day. In reality, neither Kennedy nor Khrushchev were prepared to

t h e r a t i o n a l i t y o f i r r a t i o n a l i t y

175

contemplate such a calamity and they found a way to draw back from the brink: withdrawal of Soviet missiles in return for an American promise not to invade Cuba. During the crisis there were many examples of how poorly the

two sides understood each other, yet on the most fundamental issue they had

a shared view. They were determined to avoid a nuclear tragedy.

Although the outcome of the missile crisis was shaped by a shared fear of

nuclear war, one conclusion drawn was that with a clear head and a strong

will, such crises were possible to manage. In particular, the successful out-

come was used to challenge the notion of escalation. This had been not so

much a strategy as something to be avoided. After the crisis, the metaphor

was challenged for failing to recognize the potential for graduated moves,

especially during the early stages of a confl ict before serious battle had been joined. Albert and Roberta Wohlstetter observed that “there are down-escalators as well as up-escalators, and there are landings between escalators where one can decide to get off or get on, to go up or down, or to stay there; or to take the stairs. Just where automaticity or irreversibility takes over is an uncertain but vital matter, and that is one of the reasons a decision maker

may want to take a breath at a landing to consider next steps.” 53

Herman Kahn sought to show that even once nuclear exchanges had

begun there were ways of conducting operations that might keep the pres-

sure on the other side while avoiding Armageddon. He saw escalation as a

dragon to be slain: not so much a phenomenon operating independent of

human action but a possible product of inadequate intellectual and physical

preparation. He introduced the idea that escalation might be a deliberate act.

The noun acquired a verb when he referred to “people who wish to escalate

a little themselves, but somehow feel that the other side would not be will-

ing to go one step further.” 54]] Escalation was transformed from a hopelessly unruly process to one that might be tamed and possibly manipulated. In his

1965 book _On Escalation_ , he introduced the “escalation ladder” with sixteen thresholds and forty-four steps. For most, the striking feature of the book

was the possibility of anyone coming up with almost thirty distinct ways of

using nuclear weapons following their fi rst use at rung fi fteen. 55]] The escalation up the ladder concluded, when all semblance of control had been lost,

with a “wargasm.” Kahn declared himself innocent of the Freudian connota-

tions. Luigi Nono, the radical Italian composer, used Kahn’s ladder as the

theme for a musical composition dedicated to the National Liberation Front

of Vietnam, which moved from (1) “crisi manifesta” to (44) “spasmo o guerra

insensata.” 56

McGeorge Bundy, former national security advisor to both Kennedy and

Johnson, also reacted strongly to analyses such as these. He concluded that

176

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

the arms race had become largely irrelevant in terms of actual international political behavior. Once both sides acquired thermonuclear weapons, there

was a stalemate. The “certain prospect of retaliation” meant that there had

been “literally no prospect at all that any sane political authority, in either the United States or the Soviet Union, would consciously choose to start a

nuclear war.” He wrote of the “enormous gulf between what political leaders

really think about nuclear weapons and what is assumed in complex calcu-

lations of relative ‘advantage’ in simulated strategic warfare.” In the think tanks, levels of “acceptable” damage could involve the loss of tens of millions of lives, so that the “loss of dozens of great cities is somehow a real choice for sane men.” For Bundy, in “the real world of real political leaders” a “decision that would bring even one hydrogen bomb on one city of one’s own country

would be recognized in advance as a catastrophic blunder; ten bombs on ten

cities would be a disaster beyond history; and a hundred bombs on a hundred

cities are unthinkable.” [^57]

Bundy’s belief that the more esoteric strategic debates had lost touch with

reality led in 1983 to the argument that because both sides would be able to

retaliate with thermonuclear weapons even after the “strongest possible pre-

emptive attack,” there was in place a form of deterrence which he described

as “existential,” resting on “uncertainty about what could happen.” 58]] This removed the strategic effect from particular weapons programs, preparations

for employment, or doctrinal pronouncements. So long as any superpower war

carried a high risk of utter calamity, it was best not to take risks. This notion proved to be extremely seductive not only because of its intuitive plausibility but because it solved all those perplexing problems of nuclear policy by

rendering them virtually irrelevant, so long as they did not stray too far into the realms of recklessness and foolishness. Although in policymaking circles

it was still extremely diffi cult to think of ways to assess the size and composition of nuclear arsenals except by reference to the assumed requirements

of actual exchanges, as evidenced in numerous debates in Washington over

new weapons systems, these debates eventually acquired a routine quality.

The scenarios became drained of credibility. Nuclear deterrence worked for

the United States because it warned of the severe dangers of disrupting the

status quo. The sense of danger depended not on the rationality of a nuclear

response but on the residual doubt that once the passions of war had been

unleashed no reliance could be placed on the irrationality of nuclear response.

Guerrilla Warfare

_The power of Armies is a visible thing,_

_Formal and circumscribed in time and space;_

_But who the limits of that power shall trace_

_Which a brave People into light can bring_

_Or hide, at will,—for freedom combating_

_By just revenge infl amed? No foot may chase,_

_No eye can follow, to a fatal place_

_That power, that spirit, whether on the wing_

_Like the strong wind, or sleeping like the wind_

_Within its awful caves_

—William Wordsworth, _1811_

If nuclear weapons pulled military strategy away from conventional

warfare in one direction, guerrilla warfare moved it in another. With

nuclear weapons the issue was about threatening society with extreme force.

Guerrilla warfare was about the response of an enraged society to illegitimate military force. Although it later acquired an association with radical political movements, its basic attraction was as a method that could help weaker sides

survive. Although as a form of warfare it was not at all new, and had recently been adopted in the American War of Independence, guerrilla warfare gained

its name from the tactics of ambush and harassment used during the “little war” fought by Spaniards against French occupation forces at the start of the nineteenth century. Wordsworth’s poem refers to this campaign.

Guerrilla warfare was therefore defensive, fought on home territory with

the advantages of popular support and local knowledge. It was geared to a

strategy of exhaustion, gaining time in the hope that the enemy would tire

or that something else would turn up. Such warfare was unlikely to be suc-

cessful on its own. Irregular forces worked most effectively when providing

a distraction to an enemy also facing regular forces in a more conventional

campaign. Napoleon suffered in Spain because he also faced the British army.

Similarly, Russian peasants made life additionally miserable for French forces in 1812. Clausewitz, who experienced the French occupation of Prussia and

was in a position to observe the Spanish insurrection and the French debacle in Russia, made guerrilla warfare the subject of his early lectures and writing. In _On War_ , it was considered a form of defense. By the 1820s, when Clausewitz wrote most of _On War_ , it had become an uncommon strategy. Popular energies appeared to have been played out and conservative states were in command.

Guerrilla warfare could cause an occupying force trouble, but it was the

“last and desperate resort” of an otherwise defeated people. A general upris-

ing against an occupier would need to be “nebulous and elusive,” because as

soon as it became concrete it could be crushed. Though a strategically defen-

sive concept, the tactics of guerrilla warfare had to be offensive, aiming to catch the enemy unawares. Guerrilla warfare would most likely be effective

when conducted from rough and inaccessible terrain in a country’s interior.

Clausewitz did not see irregular militias as being of much value in the absence of regular forces. [^1] Jomini had a similar response. He understood the challenges militias could pose for occupying forces, and how diffi cult they might make

wars of expansion if popular opinion could readily be excited, but he recoiled from the prospect. Wars in which entire peoples had become animated by religious, national, or ideological differences he considered deplorable, “organized assassination,” arousing “violent passions that make them spiteful, cruel, and terrible.” He acknowledged that his “prejudices were with the good old times

when the French and English guards courteously invited each other to fi re

fi rst” rather than the “frightful epoch when priests, women, and children

throughout Spain plotted the murder of isolated soldiers.” 2

During the 1830s, the possibility that guerrilla warfare might serve an

insurrection was raised by Mazzini’s failed Young Italy campaign, with the

red-shirted Giuseppe Garibaldi emerging as a gifted guerrilla commander.

Despite this example, the main models for revolutionary violence remained a

sudden uprising of the masses that would catch authorities by surprise. The

g u e r r i l l a w a r f a r e

179

idea that they might be worn down gradually in a prolonged campaign did not catch on. Frederick Engels, in an article drafted for Karl Marx, saw

the emergence of the guerrillas in Spain as a refl ection of the failure of the Spanish army. Engels presented them as more of a mob than an army, motivated by “hatred, revenge, and love of plunder.” 3 He tended to think in terms]]

of conventional military formations, even when contemplating revolution,

and assumed that after a revolution a socialist republic would need a proper

army for its defense. The presumption that a revolution would need a dis-

ciplined fi ghting force of class-conscious proletarians continued to infl uence socialist thinking, so that guerrilla warfare was seen as the domain of anarchists and criminals, of drunken riffraff indulging their violent tendencies.

Though somewhat sympathetic to this view in Russia, Lenin refused to dis-

miss guerrilla warfare entirely. But he believed it could only be a subordinate form of struggle, not the main method, and would benefi t from proper party

discipline to keep it under control. Once the mass movement had reached a

certain stage of development, guerrilla warfare was not out of the question

during the “fairly large intervals” that would occur between the “big engage-

ments” in the revolutionary civil war. 4]]

When, after the 1917 uprising, the Bolsheviks found themselves caught

up in a civil war, military commissar Leon Trotsky also saw guerrilla warfare as a useful but subordinate form of fi ghting. It was demanding, so it required proper organization and direction and must be free from amateurish and

adventurist infl uences. It could not “overthrow” an enemy but could cause

diffi culties. Whereas the stronger force would seek annihilation of the enemy using large-scale, centrally directed mass armies, the weaker force—Trotsky

argued—might seek to disorganize the stronger using light, mobile units

operating independently of one another. This followed Delbrück’s distinction

between annihilation and exhaustion. Trotsky was clearly in favor of annihilation. “The Soviet power has been all the time, and is still, the stronger side.” Its task was to crush the enemy “so as to free its hands for socialist construction.” It was the enemy, therefore, that was attempting guerrilla warfare. This refl ected the shift, for the proletariat was now the ruling class and the tsarists were the rebels. Trotsky denied that his strategy was too ponderous and positional, and lacked mobility. 5 The Red Army had begun with “volunteers, rebels, primi-]]

tive, inexperienced guerrillas” and turned them into “proper, trained, disci-

plined regiments and divisions.” Nonetheless, as the civil war became more

challenging, Trotsky sought to form mobile guerrilla detachments, supple-

ments to “the weighty masses of the Red Army,” that would cause problems for

the enemy on its rear. 6 Guerrilla warfare was therefore viewed, even by radicals,]]

as a lesser strategy, a defensive expedient but not a source of victory.

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

_Lawrence of Arabia_

The expansion of the European empires during the nineteenth century

prompted regular uprisings and rebellions, which put their own demands on

regular forces. The British army put these tasks under the heading of impe-

rial policing. The classic discussion was C. E. Calwell’s _Small Wars_ , published in 1896, which observed that as a general rule, “the quelling of the rebellion in distant colonies means protracted, thankless, invertebrate war.” 7]] It was Thomas Edward Lawrence, an archaeologist who made his name during the

Great War seeking to foment an Arab rebellion against Ottoman rule, who

did the most to develop principles about how guerrilla warfare should be

fought rather than how it could be contained. Lawrence had not only a star-

tling story to tell but also impressive literary gifts. His vivid metaphors and aphorisms help explain his infl uence. His memoir of the campaign, _The Seven_ _Pillars of Wisdom_ , remains a classic. His basic philosophy of guerrilla warfare, with a brief history of the revolt, was fi rst published in October 1920. 8]] After the war, he struggled with the myth he had helped to create about himself,

as well as with the failure of the Allied government to honor the promises of independence Lawrence had made to the Arabs.

The campaign against the Turks had begun in 1916 with operations

against the long railroad between Medina and Damascus, a key supply line.

The regular loss of trains frustrated the Turks, for whom fully protecting the railroad appeared impossible against the Arab enemy, Eventually, this turned

into a full-scale Arab revolt—a major distraction for the Turks. Lawrence

described a moment early in 1917. He had been wrestling with the limita-

tions of irregular forces. They could not do what armed forces were supposed

to do: “seek for the enemy’s army, his centre of power, and destroy it in

battle.” Moreover, they would not effectively attack a position nor could they defend one, as he had recently discovered. He concluded that their advantage

lay in “depth, not in face” and that the threat of attack could be used to get the Turks stuck in defensive positions.

Lawrence then became ill and contemplated the future of his campaign

while he recovered. He was “tolerably read” in military theory and impressed

by Clausewitz. Yet he was repelled by the idea of an “absolute war” that was

concerned solely with the destruction of enemy forces in “the one process

battle.” It felt like buying victory in blood and he did not think the Arabs

would want to do that. They were fi ghting for their freedom (“a pleasure

only to be tasted by a man alive”). While armies were like plants, “immo-

bile as a whole, fi rm-rooted, nourished through long stems to the head,” the Arab irregulars were more “a thing intangible, invulnerable, without front

g u e r r i l l a w a r f a r e

181

or back, drifting about like gas.” The Turks would lack enough men to cope with the “ill will of the Arab people,” especially as they were likely to treat the rebellion in absolute terms. They would not realize “to make war upon

rebellion is messy and slow, like eating soup with a knife.” Attacking the

Turks’ supply lines would keep them short of materiel. Instead of a war of

contact there was the possibility here of a war of detachment. This would

involve becoming known to the enemy only when there was an opportu-

nity to attack and avoiding being put on the defensive by “perfect” intel-

ligence. There was a psychological aspect to this. Lawrence spoke, in the

commonplace of the time, of the “crowd” and the need to adjust the “spirit

to the point where it becomes fi t to exploit in action, the prearrangement

of a changing opinion to a certain end.” The Arabs not only had to order

their own men’s minds but also those of the enemy (“as far as we could

reach them”) and of supporting and hostile nations, as well as the “neutrals

looking on.”

To this end Lawrence developed a small, highly mobile, and well-

equipped force, which could take advantage of the Turks having distrib-

uted their forces thinly. The Arabs had nothing to defend and excellent

knowledge of the desert. Tactics were “tip and run, not pushes, but strokes.”

Having made their point in one place, they would not hold it but would

instead move on to strike again elsewhere. Victory depended on the use of

“speed, concealment, accuracy of fi re.” “Irregular war,” Lawrence observed,

“is more intellectual than a bayonet charge.” These tactics reduced the Turks to “helplessness.” Yet he conceded that this irregular war was not the main

event in the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which came as a result of a much

more conventional push by British forces under General Allenby. In this

respect, Lawrence’s campaign was a “side show upon a side show,” though

signifi cant in a supporting role. In his acknowledgment of Allenby’s role

there was a tinge of regret that this deprived him of an opportunity to see

whether war could be won without battles. It had been a “thrilling experi-

ment” to “prove irregular war or rebellion to be an exact science.” He noted

the advantages: an unassailable base (in his case the Red Sea ports protected by the Royal Navy), an alien enemy unable to manage the space it was

occupying, and a friendly population (“Rebellions can be made by 2 per

cent active in a striking force, and 98 per cent passive sympathetically.”).

Lawrence offered the following synopsis:

In fi fty words: granted mobility, security (in the form of denying

targets to the enemy), time, and doctrine (the idea to convert every

subject to friendliness), victory will rest with the insurgents, for the

182

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

algebraic factors are in the end decisive, and against them perfection of means and spirit struggle quite in vain.

It is not surprising to fi nd that Liddell Hart was enamored of Lawrence, for he was the epitome of the indirect approach in action. The two men had brief

correspondence after the war, and Liddell Hart borrowed Lawrence’s insights.

They later became friends when Liddell Hart summarized the main themes

of Lawrence’s thought for an article in the 1929 edition of the _Encyclopaedia_ _Britannica_ , for which he was military editor. Lawrence’s exploits served a didactic purpose in illustrating the indirect approach, and Liddell Hart was

impressed by this man who was both a thinker and doer and had found him-

self with such an infl uential command without have passed through the mili-

tary system. Thereafter, Liddell Hart wrote an admiring biography in which

he put Lawrence on a plinth. 9]] He was intrigued with Lawrence’s observation that the Arabs hankered after bloodless victories. Otherwise he had little

interest in irregular warfare for radical purposes. If anything, Liddell Hart disapproved of it because it normally led to brutality and terrorism. What

enthused him was the possibility that regular warfare could develop along

the lines Lawrence had shown to be possible with irregular warfare. 10

_Mao and Giap_

This same resistance to the idea that guerrilla warfare could be a separate

route to victory was evident in the strategy of Mao Zedong, who led the

Chinese communists to victory over their nationalist opponents in 1949.

Mao saw guerrilla warfare as an acceptable strategy when on the defensive but not as an independent route to victory. He relied on it whenever his immediate need was simply to survive. As this was often the case, his writings on

guerrilla tactics have a certain authority, but his preferred form of warfare involved mobile, regular forces. Reliance on guerrilla warfare was dictated

not only by the fact that for some twenty years Mao’s forces were facing

stronger armies in the former of the nationalist Kuomintang and Japanese

occupation forces (from 1937–1945) but also because he made his base in

rural areas and came to see the peasants rather than the urban proletariat as the source of revolution.

Although Mao came from a rural family, his initial work as a Communist

Party activist in the 1920s focused on labor struggles. This was required by

the Party’s urban leadership, but Mao could not see how the working classes

in such a vast, populous, and agrarian country as China could act as agents of g u e r r i l l a w a r f a r e

183

change. After witnessing peasant uprisings in Hunan, he observed in 1927

that the peasants, properly mobilized, could be “like a mighty storm, like a

hurricane, a force so swift that no power, however great, will be able to hold it back,” sweeping away “all the imperialists, warlords, corrupt offi cials, local tyrants and evil gentry into their graves.” That year a fragile united front

between the nationalists and the communists collapsed. In the ensuing con-

frontation, Mao’s army was defeated and he was forced to fl ee. He concluded

quickly that it was only by means of guerrilla warfare in the expanses of rural

China that survival was possible. 11 The next stage in his thinking, following

the party leadership’s disastrous forays against nationalist cities in 1930, was to conceive of the countryside not so much as a base from which to attack cities but as the place where the revolution could be made. He built up a new power

base—the Kiangsi Soviet—but another failed conventional offensive against

nationalist strongholds in 1934 led to a counterattack which put this base

under pressure. He escaped by a mass evacuation, known as the Long March,

which succeeded to the extent that he evaded capture—at an extremely high

cost. The communists marched some six thousand miles for a year, until a new

safe haven was found in Shensi province in October 1935. By then, Mao’s force had been much reduced, to barely ten thousand men. According to Chang and

Halliday, the nationalists actually allowed the communist army to escape—as

Stalin was holding the son of nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek hostage—

and then Mao took an unnecessarily long route to avoid joining a rival’s larger force. [^12] With the old leadership discredited and a reputation, whether or not deserved, as a military commander and expert on rural China, Mao became

Communist Party leader.

In July 1937, Japan invaded China. Mao had already proposed a united

front against the Japanese. Though agreed upon the previous December,

it was always tenuous in practice, not least because it suited Mao more

than the nationalists as he was able to gain time. The nationalists were

on the defensive, their leaders and offi cials pushed out of signifi cant parts of the country. Meanwhile the Japanese were unable to establish effective

authority, so the communists were given an opportunity to fi ll the polit-

ical vacuum. They were accepted as the representatives of the anti-Japa-

nese united front and given a hearing for the economic and social reforms

they sought. The peasantry were given a chance to transform local power

structures. At the same time Mao was extremely cautious when it came

to taking on the Japanese. He concentrated on survival, especially once

the United States entered the war in December 1941. Even after the war,

when the civil war resumed in China, Mao remained cautious, expecting at

best a negotiated peace with the Kuomintang. 13 By 1947, he had begun to

184

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

appreciate that although the nationalists notionally occupied large parts of the country, their roots were not deep and were at last vulnerable to a communist offensive. He seized power in 1949.

Mao’s ideas had taken shape a decade earlier. In their early formulations

they diverged from received wisdom. As he was not then the Party leader,

these ideas were formulated in more pragmatic and conditional terms than

their more dogmatic later expressions suggested. The most authoritative pre-

sentation of the theory of people’s war was a series of lectures in 1937, in the aftermath of the Long March and the Japanese invasion. These formed the

basis of Mao’s treatise on guerrilla warfare. 14]] They refl ected his conviction that the peasantry could be an agent of revolutionary change. Because he was

not working with the urban proletariat, who were supposed to acquire politi-

cal consciousness as a matter of course, he put political education and mobilization at the heart of people’s war. This required the masses to understand the politics of the struggle, the objectives for which it was being fought, and the program which would be implemented when it was won. The time gained

by guerrilla tactics, therefore, had to be used productively “to conduct pro-

paganda among the masses” to help them gain revolutionary power. Politics,

therefore, always had to be in command.

Mao played down material factors, such as economic and military power,

in which he was evidently defi cient, in favor of human power and morale: “It

is people, not things that are decisive.” 15]] Given the armed struggle in which he had been engaged for over a decade, it was not surprising that he insisted in another famous aphorism that “power grows out of the barrel of a gun,”

refl ecting the twists and turns of the armed struggle that had shaped his life.

Mao had read Clausewitz and Lawrence. 16]] John Shy judged him to be in some respects closer to Jomini, with “similar maxims, repetitions, and exhorta-tions,” and the same “compounding of analysis and prescription” and “didac-

tic drive.” [^17] The infl uence of Sun Tzu was clear in his observations on how to wear down a superior enemy while avoiding battle (“The enemy advances, we

retreat; the enemy camps, we harass. The enemy tires, we attack; the enemy

retreats; we pursue”) and the importance of intelligence and a better grasp

of the situation (“Know the enemy and know yourself and you can fi ght a

hundred battles without disaster”). 18

While guerrilla warfare had by necessity loomed large in his scheme, Mao

was well aware of its limits. He described the basic principle of war as to “preserve oneself and to annihilate the enemy.” Guerrilla warfare was only relevant to the fi rst of these tasks, although this happened to be the one which preoccupied him for all but the last few years of his military struggles. He relied on its defensive properties—popular support and local knowledge—against

g u e r r i l l a w a r f a r e

185

an occupying force. In a well-known metaphor, he described how the people mobilized would be “a vast sea in which the enemy will be swallowed up”

but in which their army would thrive like fi sh. [^19] The importance of keeping unity between the guerrilla army and the local people was stressed in

his three rules (“All actions are subject to command; Do not steal from the

people; Be neither selfi sh nor unjust”) and eight remarks (“Replace the door when you leave the house; Roll up the bedding on which you have slept; Be

courteous; Be honest in your transactions; Return what you borrow; Replace

what you break; Do not bathe in the presence of women; Do not without

authority search the pocketbooks of those you arrest”). 20

Unlike Lawrence, whose fi ghters could go out and attack the enemy at

vulnerable points, Mao was wary of venturing too far from his base. His

strategy was to lure the enemy into his areas of strength. Here he could go on the tactical offensive, but there were limits to the possibilities of a strategic offensive. His expectation of the war with Japan was that it was likely to be protracted. As he contemplated its likely course he identifi ed an optimum

strategy in terms of three stages. The fi rst stage was defensive. Eventually a stalemate would be reached (second stage), and then the communists would

have the confi dence and capabilities to move on to the offensive (third stage).

Although at the time the Chinese were on their own, Mao was aware that

at some point external factors that would undermine Japanese superiority

might come into play. He saw a role for both guerrilla and positional (defense or attack of defi ned points) warfare, but the best results would require mobile warfare. Only that could lead to annihilation of the enemy defi ned in terms of loss of resistance rather than complete physical destruction. Mao was fi ghting an enemy with whom there might be a stalemate, but never a compromise.

So the third stage demanded regular forces. Until these could be developed,

guerrilla units would be crucial. In the third stage they would play no more

than a supporting role.

The most assiduous follower of Mao after his revolution was General Vo

Nguyen Giap, a schoolteacher from Vietnam who fought against colonial

France and then the U.S.-supported anti-communist government in the

south. He immersed himself in Maoist theory and practice in China in 1940

and then returned to Vietnam to lead the fi ght against the Japanese and later the French. He is also reported to have described Lawrence’s _Seven Pillars_ _of Wisdom_ as his “fi ghting gospel” that he was “never without.” Giap took Mao’s three stages seriously, but his major innovation was his readiness to

move between the different stages according to circumstances, whereas Mao

had seen these as sequential steps. Vietnam was a relatively small country

compared to China and so required greater fl exibility. In particular, Giap

186

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

was prepared to use regular forces before the third stage, to hold space, for example.

His description of guerrilla warfare captured the best practice of the Asian

communist struggle of the mid-twentieth century. Guerrilla war served the

broad masses of an economically backward country standing up to a “well-

trained army of aggression.” Against the enemy’s strength was poised a

“boundless heroism.” The front was not fi xed but was “wherever the enemy

is found” and suffi ciently exposed to be vulnerable to a local concentration of forces, employing “initiative, fl exibility, rapidity, surprise, suddenness in attack and retreat.” The enemy would be exhausted “little by little by small

victories.” Losses were to be avoided “even at the cost of losing ground.” 21

In the communist mainstream, from Engels to Giap, guerrilla warfare was

therefore never seen as suffi cient in itself. It was a way of holding out until it was possible to develop a true military capacity. At any time it might be all that could be done to stay in the game. But if the aim was to seize power, the regular forces of the state would have to be defeated.

_Counterinsurgency_

Two books published in the 1950s sought to capture the American struggle

to come to terms with communist insurgencies. Graham Greene’s _The Quiet_

_American_ , based on the author’s experiences in Vietnam in the early 1950s, focused on the earnest but naïve American, Alden Pyle, who had a theoretical

concept of what Vietnam needed but no true understanding. He was “sincere

in his way,” but as “incapable of imagining pain or danger to himself as he

was incapable of conceiving the pain he might cause others.” Eugene Burdick

and William Lederer, a professor and military offi cer, respectively, intended to write a nonfi ction book about the mistakes being made by the Americans in

confronting communism in southeast Asia. But they decided, correctly, that

they could make their point more effectively through fi ction. In _The Ugly_ _American_ , there was more of an American hero. Colonel Edwin Hillendale helped run successful campaigns in South Vietnam and the Philippines. The

message of this book was that Americans seeking to infl uence events in these societies should live among the people and get to know their language and

cultures. “Every person and every nation has a key which will open their

hearts,” observes Hillendale. “If you use the right key, you can maneuver any

person or any nation any way you want.” 22

The main characters in both books were often assumed to have been

inspired by General Edward Lansdale. Greene always denied this was the case

g u e r r i l l a w a r f a r e

187

for his book, but Hillendale evidently was modeled on Lansdale. In 1961, Lansdale became an adviser to President Kennedy after being introduced to

him as one of the few Americans who really understood the demands of coun-

terinsurgency. Lansdale understood that without popular support there was

“no political base for supporting the fi ght.” People had to be convinced that their lives could be improved through social action and political reform, as

well as by the physical protection that came with sensitive military opera-

tions. This required a responsive, non-corrupt government; well-behaved

armed forces; and a cause in which they could believe.

John Kennedy endorsed _The Ugly American_ as a senator, attracted by its central message that people in desperate situations could be as inspired by

the ideals of American liberalism as those of Soviet communism. One of

Kennedy’s fi rst acts as president was to demand that the American military

take counterinsurgency far more seriously. [^23] Kennedy encouraged all those around him to read Mao and Che Guevara, the theorist of the Cuban revolution, and took a personal interest in special forces and their training manuals and equipment. Groups were established to coordinate what was described as

“subterranean war,” with South Vietnam soon the main area of concern. The

challenge was seen to be less with the diagnosis—drawing attention to the

problems with development, weak governmental institutions, and militaries

that were more instruments of repression than sources of security for ordinary people—than in working out what to do about it. There was considerable

study of Maoist doctrine, which meant that American policy became reactive

in the sense of trying to determine whether the North Vietnamese commu-

nists were moving from the second to the third stage, or focusing on counter-

ing communist propaganda and tactics.

The Americans were infl uenced by the successful British experience in

Malaya as described by Robert Thompson. 24]] Under the leadership of Sir Gerald Templer, a communist insurgency had been contained. “The shooting

side of the business is only 25 percent of the trouble,” observed Templer, “and the other 75 percent lies in getting the people of this country behind us.”

The answer was not “pouring more troops into the jungle.” It was instead,

in a phrase Templer made famous, “in the hearts and minds of the people.”

He understood the importance of civic action but also the need to show a

determination to win. This required a readiness to be ruthless. 25]] Templer was successful, but he enjoyed favorable conditions. In Malaya, the communists

were largely associated with the minority Chinese population, their resupply

routes were poor, and economic conditions were reasonable.

The unsuccessful French experiences in Vietnam and Algeria were

refl ected in the writings of David Galula who provided one of the more lucid 188

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

texts on how to counter communist tactics, and who popularized the concept of “insurgency.” He also stressed the importance of the loyalty of the population. A successful counterinsurgency must ensure the people felt protected so they could cooperate without fear of retribution. Victory would require paci-fying one area after another, each serving as a secure base from which to move

to the next. 26]] Galula’s actual experience in Algeria was mixed. His efforts to treat local people positively were not matched by many of his fellow offi cers.

When it came to propaganda, he judged the French “defi nitely and infi nitely more stupid than our opponents.” Like other counterinsurgent specialists,

Galula found that his theory fi tted neither the local political structures nor army culture. 27 The main effect of the attempt by the French offi]] cer class to develop a counterinsurgency doctrine that matched the communists in its

political intensity and ruthlessness was that they began to turn their ire on Paris for not supporting their efforts with suffi cient vigor—even attempting a coup. [^28]

An awareness of the need to give the anti-communist South Vietnamese

government more legitimacy and turn its forces into agents of democracy

and development refl ected a theoretical objective that was far removed from

the realities on the ground. It was understood that any fi ghting should be

done by indigenous forces, but that left open the question of what should

be done when these forces could no longer cope. It was one thing if the

insurgency was a response to local conditions cloaked in the rhetoric of international communism; if it truly was being pushed from outside by commu-

nists, that was another. The U.S. military was doubtful that this was really a new type of insurgency and preferred to treat it as old-fashioned aggression.

Counterinsurgency theory suggested that the role of military action was to

create suffi cient security to introduce programs to improve the social con-

ditions of the people, thereby winning over their “hearts and minds” and

denying the insurgents bases, recruits, and support. Against this the military argued that wars were won by eliminating enemy armed forces and frustrating their operations. This supported a policy of “search and destroy” through shelling and bombing areas where the enemy was believed to be hiding,

though the enemy had often moved on and the attacks led to civilian deaths

and popular resentment.

One of those involved in the internal discussions later commented rue-

fully on the “somewhat simplistic” assumptions about a monolithic form

of threat, following the script of a “war of national liberation.” Under this mindset, sight of the “domestic origins and root causes of internal turmoil”

was lost, which meant that the insurgency was treated as if it was “a clearly articulated military force instead of the apex of a pyramid deeply embedded

g u e r r i l l a w a r f a r e

189

in society.” 29 Another offi]] cial questioned the very description of opponents as

“insurgents” instead of revolutionaries or rebels because this denied the possibility that they might be champions of a popular movement. It was hard to

accept that the opponents were often local and popular and that their victims

were associated with repression. 30]] The basic problem was that ameliorating the “worst causes of discontent” and redressing “the most fl agrant inequities”

would require positive action—and in some cases, radical reform—by the

local government, yet the measures being proposed threatened to undermine

the government’s position because they would involve altering the country’s

social structure and domestic economy. 31]] It is also important to note that the original formulations of counterinsurgency doctrine assumed that the main

work would be undertaken by local forces, assisted by American resources

and advisors. The use of American forces on a large scale was to be avoided. 32]]

There were many examples of this during the 1960s. In this respect, South

Vietnam was the exception, but it was an exception that clouded all later

thoughts on counterinsurgency theory and practice.

By the start of 1965, it was apparent that it was going to be very diffi cult to deal with the domestic sources of insurgency. Instead, American attention switched to dealing with the supply lines coming from the north. The

confl ict was fi rmly framed in terms of a fi ght with the communist leadership in North Vietnam and beyond rather than as a power struggle within South

Vietnam. At this time, Tom Schelling’s concepts of bargaining and coercive

diplomacy were particularly infl uential. This can be seen even in discussions of Vietnam, a situation far removed from the one to which Schelling had

most applied himself—a superpower confrontation over a prized piece of real

estate in the center of Europe and directly linked to a possible nuclear war. 33]]

The fi gure in the U.S. Government most infl uenced by Schelling during the

1960s was John McNaughton, an academic lawyer from Harvard who died in

an air crash in July 1967. He had worked with Schelling on the Marshall Plan

in the late 1940s, and the two remained good friends. When McNaughton

spoke of arms control, for example, he showed interest in the notion of the

“reciprocal fear of surprise attack” and “non-zero-sum games.” 34]] He is said to have remarked that the Cuban missile crisis demonstrated the realism

of Schelling’s games. 35 McNaughton was a key fi]] gure in the development of the U.S. policy on Vietnam, working closely with Secretary of Defense

Robert McNamara and National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy. One of

his memos was famously described by a colleague as the reductio ad absur-

dum of the planner’s art, combining realpolitik with the hyper-rationalist

belief in control of the most refi ned American think tank. 36 In a report of a]]

working group McNaughton chaired in February 1964, 37]] one suggestion was 190

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

pure Schelling: it would be possible to infl uence Hanoi’s decisions by action designed “to hurt but not to destroy.” [^38] Also drawn from Schelling was the proposition that “a decision to use force if necessary, backed by resolute and extensive deployment, and conveyed by every possible means to our adversaries, gives the best present chance of avoiding the actual use of such force.”

The basic principle was that “a pound of threat is worth an ounce of action—

as long as we are not bluffi ng.” [^39]

The main threat his group had in mind was the use of American air

power. At the time, the government was still trying to avoid using ground

forces. But that could not achieve much of direct military value, as the supply lines were hard to disrupt and mass air attacks on civilian populations were

considered unacceptable. McNaughton came up with the idea of coercive air

strikes with a political purpose, which he described as “progressive squeeze-

and-talk,” orchestrating diplomatic communications with graduated mili-

tary pressure. Even if the United States eventually gave up, it was important to show that it had been “willing to keep promises, be tough, take risks, get bloodied, and hurt the enemy badly.” 40 McNaughton was thus trying to fi]] nd ways of giving the impression of commitment without being truly resolute,

of following one course while not closing off others.

At the start of 1965, McNaughton consulted Schelling on exactly how

the North could be coerced in these unpromising circumstances. According

to one account, the two men wrestled unsatisfactorily with the question of

“what could the United States ask the North to stop doing that they would

obey, that we would soon know they obeyed, and that they could not simply

resume doing after the bombing had ceased.” Kaplan comments, with some

satisfaction: “So assured, at times glibly so, when writing about sending signals with force, infl icting pain to make an opponent behave and weaving

patterns of communication through tactics of coercive warfare in theory, Tom

Schelling, when faced with a real-life ‘limited war,’ was stumped, had no idea

where to begin.” 41]] In fact, Schelling was highly skeptical about the likely value of a bombing campaign against the North. He noted the weak diplomacy accompanying the bombing and hoped that there had been private

communications to Hanoi of a less ambiguous nature. 42]] Schelling’s reasoning, while suggestive and provocative, could not by itself generate strategies because that required the introduction of levels of complexity that his theoretical structure could not handle.

The new civilian strategists had some infl uence on the early stages of the

U.S. policy regarding Vietnam, but the overriding infl uence was American

military preferences. In some respects, the two came from the same start-

ing point: a focus on techniques and tactics separate from political context.

g u e r r i l l a w a r f a r e

191

Counterinsurgency theory, like nuclear strategy, developed as a special body of expertise geared to discussing special sorts of military relationships as if they were special types of war. As discussed, Mao and Giap never saw guerrilla tactics as more than expedients for when they were weak. They did not

think they could win a “guerrilla war”—success at this level would allow

them to move on to the next stage defi ned by the familiar clash of regular

armies. What they thought was truly distinctive to their type of warfare was

the attention paid to political education and propaganda.

Vietnam, a war for which the civilian strategists had not prepared and on

which they had relatively little of value to say, marked the end of the “golden age” of strategic studies. Just as the arrival of mutual assured destruction

and a period of relative calm took the urgency out of the Cold War, Vietnam

“poisoned the academic well.” 43]] Colin Gray charged the civilian “men of ideas” with being overconfi dent about the ease with which theory might

be transferred to the “world of action.” The prophets had become courtiers,

living off their intellectual capital. Their “dual-loyalty” to the needs of problem-oriented offi cials on the one hand and the disinterested “policy-neutral”

standards of scholarship on the other “had tended to produce both irrelevant

policy advice and poor scholarship.” 44]] In response to this criticism, Brodie praised policy engagement and defended the small group of civilian strategists who had accepted the burden of making sense of the new nuclear world,

because the military were incapable of doing so. Yet having left RAND in

1966 bemoaning the “astonishing lack of political sense” and ignorance of

diplomatic and military history among the engineers and economists, he

readily accepted Vietnam as a consequence of these tendencies. [^45]

Observation and Orientation

_Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without_ _strategy is the noise before defeat._

—Sun Tzu

With there apparently being little more to say on nuclear strat-

egy and Vietnam having turned into such a bruising experience, the

civilian strategists in the United States withdrew from the fi eld. The think tanks began to dwell more on immediate issues of policy and more technical

matters. The civilians had never had much to say about the classic ques-

tions of regular warfare, though this was a natural focus for the professional military. It was the one area that had been left relatively untouched by the

literature of the 1950s and 1960s due to the preoccupation with the uncon-

ventional areas of nuclear and guerrilla warfare.

One exception was a retired French general André Beaufre. Whereas the

tendency in the United States was to turn strategy into a series of technical and practical issues, Beaufre’s approach was broader and more philosophical.

This was refl ected in his defi nition of strategy as “the art of the dialectic of

two opposing wills using force to resolve their dispute.” 1 This put strategy at

the highest level of policy, taking in not just a clash of arms but all possible elements of power. Strategy appeared as the supreme function of the state,

requiring choices between different forms of power and their coordinated

employment to ensure that their effects were maximized. Success could be achieved by means other than physical force. The target was the enemy’s will

to start or continue a fi ght. Psychological effects were therefore critical.

The dialectic was composed of three interconnecting parts—nuclear, con-

ventional, and cold-war. As a friend of Liddell Hart, Beaufre picked up on

the possibilities of an indirect approach but gave it a broader frame, looking to actions in fi elds other than the military to make an impact. He therefore had a traditional view of conventional warfare as being about a victory

but also assumed that in an age of nuclear deterrence this had become less

interesting. By contrast, the cold war intrigued him, because it was a new

but apparently permanent phenomenon. It was pushing the confl ict out into

all areas, including the economic and cultural, where the two sides might

encounter each other. In this respect, stirring up discontent in colonies or

making humanitarian appeals could be part of the same strategy. The risk in

this formulation was that events that had quite other causes were explained

by this particular “dialectic of opposing wills.”

American readers found Beaufre’s philosophical approach, with its

Cartesian and Hegelian infl uences, hard to follow. Bernard Brodie, with his

pragmatism and view of strategy as “the pursuit of success in certain types of competitive endeavor,” described himself as uncertain of Beaufre’s meaning.

Brodie also found it hard to take Beaufre’s dismissal of military history and his disinterest in the collection of technical data as a distraction. This went against the “general consensus that awareness of technological and other

types of change is a top-level requirement among strategists.” [^2]

Brodie’s reaction to Beaufre may help explain the limited attention paid

to a contribution by James Wylie. Wylie was an American admiral who

wrote a short but lucid guide to contemporary strategy in the 1960s. His

approach was compared at the time to Beaufre’s. 3]] James Wylie’s _Military_ _Strategy_ retains a following, but its impact has been marginal. 4]] Wylie fi rst began to set down his ideas in the early 1950s, partly as refl ections on his Second World War experience. He worked in concert with another admiral,

Henry Eccles, whose thoughts followed a similar path. Both of them put

questions of power at the heart of their analyses. Both wondered what that

meant in terms of an ability to assert “control.” As naval offi cers in the Mahan tradition, they believed that control was the objective of strategy.

Eccles recognized that the issue of control went beyond the purely mili-

tary sphere and was both inward and outward. The distinctive sources of

power that had to be addressed internally included not only politicians and

the public but also logistics and the industrial bases. The external sources,

not only adversaries but also allies and neutrals, were even harder to control. 5

194

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

In these circumstances, control could clearly not be absolute and had to be considered as a matter of degree. Wylie understood strategy as being about

ends and means; it was “a purpose together with a some measures for its

accomplishment,” and war in terms of competing patterns of activity, in

which one side would gain advantage by imposing a pattern on the enemy.

This did not require actual battle. It could work through shows of coercive

force, which could progressively constrain the enemy.

Wylie’s main claim to originality lay in a distinction between two types of

strategy. The idea was prompted by a comment from the German-American

historian Herbert Rosinski in 1951 distinguishing between “directive” and

“cumulative” strategies. Rosinski was certainly aware of Delbrück, and he

may well have been thinking about updating the distinction between wars of

annihilation and exhaustion. Wylie developed his ideas fi rst in a 1952 article.

“It landed with no splash at the time,” he lamented, “and has lain on the deck ever since.” [^6] He tried again in his book. The distinction he drew was between a linear sequential strategy, tending to the offensive, and a cumulative strategy. A sequential strategy would involve discrete steps, each dependent upon

the one before, which together would shape the outcome of the war. This

offered the possibility of forcing the enemy to a satisfactory conclusion, but it also required an ability to plan ahead and anticipate the course of a confl ict.

The risk, of which Wylie was well aware, was that once one step turned out

differently, the remainder of the sequence must follow a different pattern

The Revolution in Military Affairs

_[T] he revolution in military affairs may bring a kind of tactical clarity_ _to the battlefi eld, but at the price of strategic obscurity._

—Eliot Cohen

This “operational” approach to war was never tested in the circum-

stances for which it was designed. At the end of the 1980s, Soviet com-

munism imploded and the Warsaw Pact soon evaporated, taking with it the

possibility of another great power war in the middle of Europe. The American

military soon came to be preoccupied with a quite different set of problems.

Because circumstances had changed so much this might have provided good

reason to challenge the operational approach, but instead it became even

more entrenched, now spoken of as a revolution in military affairs.

There was no need to worry about an extremely large and capable enemy.

The efforts the Americans had put into new technologies had created a qual-

ity gap with all conceivable opponents, while the greater stress on operational doctrine made it possible to take advantage of superior intelligence and communications to work around opponents. Almost immediately, there was a

demonstration of the new capabilities. Iraq occupied its neighbor Kuwait

in August 1990; early the next year, a coalition led by the United States

liberated Kuwait. Up to this point the impact of improvements in sensors,

smart weapons, and systems integration were untested hypotheses. Skeptics

(including Luttwak) warned of how in a war with Iraq the most conceptually brilliant systems could be undermined by their own complexity and

traditional forms of military incompetence. [^1] Yet in Operation Desert Storm the equipment worked well: cruise missiles fi red from a distance of some one thousand kilometers navigated their way through the streets of Baghdad,

entered their target by the front door, and then exploded.

This very one-sided war displayed the potential of modern military sys-

tems in a most fl attering light. The Iraqis had boasted of the size of their army, but much of its bulk was made up of poorly armed and trained conscripts facing professional, well-equipped forces with vastly superior fi re-

power. It was as if they had kindly arranged their army to show off their

opponent’s forces to best advantage. A battle plan unfolded that followed the essential principles of Western military practice against a totally outclassed and outgunned enemy who had conceded command of the air. A tentative

frontal assault saw the Iraqis crumble, yet General Norman Schwarzkopf

went ahead with a complex, enveloping maneuver to catch them as they

retreated, but did not quite cut them off quickly enough. The Americans

still announced a ceasefi re, deliberately eschewing a war of annihilation. This refl ected a determination to keep the war limited and not allow success in

reaching the declared goal—liberation of Kuwait—to lead to overextension

by attempting to occupy all of Iraq. This made good diplomatic and military

sense, yet the consequence illustrated the arguments favoring decisive vic-

tories. Saddam Hussein was able to survive and the outcome of the war was

declared at best incomplete. [^2]

The idea that this campaign might set a pattern for the future, to the

point of representing a revolution in military affairs, can be traced back to the Pentagon’s Offi ce of Net Assessment (ONA), led by Andrew Marshall, a

redoubtable veteran of RAND. He was aware that during its last years there

had been talk in the Soviet Union of a “military technical revolution” that

might bring conventional forces up to new levels of effectiveness. Marshall

became convinced that the new systems were not mere improvements but

could change the character of war. After the 1991 Gulf War, he asked one of

his analysts, Army Lieutenant Colonel Andrew F. Krepinevich, who had been

working on what had become the non-issue of the military balance between

NATO and the Warsaw Pact, to examine the combined impact of precision

weapons and the new information and communication technologies. [^3]

By the summer of 1993, Marshall was considering two plausible forms of

change in warfare. One possibility was that the long-range precision strike

would become “the dominant operational approach.” The other was the

emergence of “what might be called information warfare.” 4 At this point he]]

t h e r e v o l u t i o n i n m i l i t a r y a f f a i r s

215

began to encourage the use of the term “revolution in military affairs” (RMA) instead of “military-technical revolution” to stress the importance of operational and organizational changes as well as technological ones. [^5] Krepinevich described the RMA in 1994 as

what occurs when the application of new technologies into a signifi -

cant number of military systems combines with innovative operational

concepts and organizational adaptation in a way that fundamentally

alters the character and conduct of confl ict . . . by producing a dramatic

increase—often an order of magnitude or greater—in the combat

potential and military effectiveness of armed forces. 6

Although the origins of the RMA lay in doctrine, the driver appeared tech-

nological, a consequence of the interaction between systems that collected,

processed, and communicated information with those that applied military

force. A so-called system of systems would make this interaction smooth and

continuous. 7]] This concept was particularly appropriate in a maritime context. At sea, as in the air, it was possible to contemplate a battlespace empty of all but combatants. Even going back to the Second World War, air and sea

warfare offered patterns susceptible to systematic analysis, which meant that the impact of technical innovations could be discerned.

By contrast, land warfare had always been more complex and fl uid, sub-

ject to a greater range of infl uences. The promise of the RMA was to trans-

form land warfare. The ability to strike with precision over great distances

meant that time and space could decline as serious constraints. Enemy units

would be engaged from without. Armies could stay agile and maneuverable,

as they would not have to move with their own fi repower, except for that

required for self-defense. Instead, they could call in what was required from outside. Reliance on non-organic fi repower would reduce dependence upon

large, cumbersome, self-contained divisions, and the associated potential for high casualties. 8 While enemy commanders were still attempting to mobilize]]

their resources and develop their plans, they would be rudely interrupted by

lethal blows infl icted by forces for whom time and space were no longer serious constraints. The move away from the crude elimination of enemy forces

could be completed by following the Boyd line of acting more quickly and

moving more deftly, thus putting enemy commanders in a position where

resistance would be futile. Enthusiasts hovered on the edge of pronouncing

the “fog of war” lifted and the problem of friction answered. 9]] At the very least, warfare could move away from high-intensity combat to something

more contained and discriminate, geared to disabling an enemy’s military

establishment with the minimum force necessary. No more resources should

216

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

be expended, assets ruined, or blood shed than absolutely necessary to achieve specifi ed political goals.

All of this created the prospect of relatively civilized warfare, unsullied by either the destructiveness of nuclear war or the murky, subversive character of Vietnam-type engagements. It would be professional war conducted by professional armies, a vision, in Bacevich’s pointed words, “of the Persian Gulf War replayed over and over again.” 10]] The pure milk of the doctrine is found in a publication of the National Defense University of 1996 which introduced the notion of “shock and awe.” The basic message was that all efforts

should be focused on overwhelming the enemy physically and mentally as

quickly as possible before there was a chance to react. “Shock and awe” would mean that the enemy’s perceptions and grasp of events would be overloaded,

leaving him paralyzed. The ultimate example of this effect were the nuclear

strikes of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which the authors refused to rule out as

a theoretical possibility, though they were more intrigued by the possibility

of disinformation, misinformation, and deception. 11

The infl uence of such ideas was evident in the 1997 paper “Joint Vision

2010.” It defi ned information superiority largely in war-fi ghting terms as

“the capability to collect, process, and disseminate an uninterrupted fl ow

of information while exploiting or denying an adversary’s ability to do the

same.” 12]] By means of “excellent sensors, fast and powerful networks, display technology, and sophisticated modeling and simulation capabilities,” information superiority could be achieved. The force would have “a dramatically

better awareness or understanding of the battlespace rather than simply more

raw data.” This could make up for defi ciencies in numbers, technology, or

position, and it could also speed up command processes. Forces could be

organized “from the bottom up—or to self-synchronize—to meet the com-

mander’s intent,” leading in turn to “the rapid foreclosure of enemy courses

of action and the shock of closely coupled events.” There would be no time

for the enemy to follow Boyd’s now-famous OODA loop. Arthur Cebrowski

and John Garstka argued that a form of “network-centered warfare” could

make battles more effi cient in the same way that the application of informa-

tion technology by businesses was making economies more effi cient. 13]] In discussing the move from platform-centered to network-centered warfare, the

Pentagon largely followed this formulation (Garstka was one of the authors)

and recognized that, following the physical and information domains, there

was a cognitive domain. Here was found

the mind of the warfi ghter and the warfi ghter’s supporting populace.

Many battles and wars are won or lost in the cognitive domain. The

t h e r e v o l u t i o n i n m i l i t a r y a f f a i r s

217

intangibles of leadership, morale, unit cohesion, level of training and experience, situational awareness, and public opinion are elements of

this domain. This is the domain where commander’s intent, doctrine,

tactics, techniques, and procedures reside. [^14]

This form of warfare suited the United States because it played to

U.S. strengths: it could be capital rather than labor intensive; it refl ected a preference for outsmarting opponents; it avoided excessive casualties both

received and infl icted; and it conveyed an aura of almost effortless superiority. Those ideas were deeply comforting, and not entirely wrong. Information

and communication technologies were bound to make a difference in mili-

tary practice, although the RMA agenda understated the extent to which

American predominance was dependent on not only the sophistication of its

technology but also the sheer amount of fi repower—particularly air-deliv-

ered—at its disposal. Furthermore, while the United States’ evident military

superiority in a particular type of war was likely to encourage others to fi ght in different ways, that military capacity would also constrain opponents’

ambitions. As a regular conventional war against the United States appeared

to be an increasingly foolish proposition, especially after its convincing performance in the 1991 Gulf War, one form of potential challenge to American

predominance was removed, just as the prospect of mutual assured destruc-

tion had earlier removed nuclear war as a serious policy option.

Nonetheless, the presentation of the RMA was shaped by political prefer-

ences about the sort of war the Americans would like to fi ght. It offered a

neat fi t between a desire to reduce the risks of high casualties or Vietnam-

style campaigns and a Western ethical tradition that stressed discrimination

and proportionality in warfare. It assumed professional conventional forces,

as high-quality weaponry reduced the relative importance of numbers and

put a premium on extremely competent troops. Intolerance of casualties and

collateral damage meant targeting military assets rather than innocent civil-

ians. It also precluded resort to weapons of mass destruction. The military

would be kept separate from the civil, combatants from noncombatants, fi re

from society, and organized violence from everyday life. Opponents would

be defeated by means of confusion and disorientation rather than slaughter

because they could never get out of their OODA loop. If this trend could be

pushed far enough, it was possible at some point to envisage a war without

tears, conducted over long distances with great precision and as few people

as possible—preferably none at all—at risk. The objective was to reduce

the role in war-fi ghting of anything recognizably approaching “battle.” The

ideal would be one-sided and highly focused engagements geared to causing

218

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

cognitive confusion. Far from representing a real revolution, the RMA harked back to the earlier, idealized prototype of a decisive military victory settling the fate of nations—indeed of whole civilizations—except that now the

accomplishment could be virtually painless for the greatest military power

the world had ever seen.

There was an unreal quality to this view of future warfare. It was for polit-

ical entities that were not fearful, desperate, vengeful, or angry; that could maintain a sense of proportion over the interests at stake and the humanity

of the opponent. It was a view that betrayed a detached attitude to the well-

springs of confl ict and violence, the outlook of a concerned observer rather than a committed participant. It ignored the physicality of war and war’s

tendencies to violence and destruction. It would hardly be a revolution in

military affairs if those who embraced it only took on confl icts which prom-

ised certain and easy victories. The 1991 Gulf War vindicated this vision, but that was helped by Saddam Hussein’s ignorance of the real military balance.

In this respect, the vindication carried its own refutation. Future opponents were bound to take more care when inviting battle with the United States

given the proven vulnerability of second-rate conventional forces to attacks

by fi rst-rate powers. After 1991 it was unclear who would fi ght such a war.

The American military literature referred to “peer competitors” with compa-

rable military endowments to those of the United States, but it was unclear

exactly who these might be. In addition, for a war to be fought along these

lines, the belligerents must not only have comparable military capabilities

but also inhabit the same moral and political universe. The model was geared

to American strengths and for that very reason was unlikely to be followed

by opponents who would seek to exploit the presumed American weaknesses

of impatience and casualty intolerance. Enemies would be inclined to cause

hurt in an effort to encourage a sense of disproportion in the population and unhinge multilateral coalitions.

Precision warfare made it possible to limit but also to maximize dam-

age. Just as high accuracy made it possible to avoid nuclear power plants,

hospitals, and apartment blocks, it also made it possible to score direct hits.

Even in the American model there were always dual-use facilities that served

both military and civilian purposes—for example, energy and transporta-

tion. Targeting them as part of a military purpose still led to the disruption of civilian life. In other respects the new technologies encouraged a progressive overlap between the civilian and military spheres. High-quality surveil-

lance, intelligence, communications, and navigation became widely available

as consumer gadgets, which could be exploited by crude, small organiza-

tions with limited budgets. Lastly, nuclear weapons and long-range missiles

t h e r e v o l u t i o n i n m i l i t a r y a f f a i r s

219

(whose arrival had also been described at the time as a “revolution in military affairs”) had expanded the means of destruction and extended the range of

its potential application. Attempts to mitigate their effects—for example,

through improving anti-missile defenses—had been unimpressive. The capa-

bility to destroy hundreds of thousands of human beings in a nuclear fl ash

had not disappeared.

_Asymmetric Wars_

When a country was in desperate straits and facing defeat in conventional

war, attacking the enemy’s society might appear to be the only option left.

That is why the history of the twentieth-century war had been so discour-

aging to those who believed that military power could be contained in its

effects. There were a series of measures that the weak could adopt against the strong: concentrating on imposing pain rather than winning battles, gaining

time rather than moving to closure, targeting the enemy’s domestic political

base as much as his forward military capabilities, and relying on an unwill-

ingness to accept extreme pain and a weaker stake in the resolution of the

confl ict. In short, whereas stronger military powers had a natural preference for decisive battlefi eld victories, the weaker were more ready to draw the

civilian sphere into the confl ict while avoiding open battle.

The optimal strategies for those unable to match America’s conventional

military capabilities (almost everyone) would be to attempt to turn the con-

fl ict into what came to be described as an “asymmetric war.” This concept had been around since the 1970s, as a refl ection of the Vietnam experience. [^15] Its resurrection began in the mid-1990s, when it began to refer to any engagement between dissimilar forces. All confl icts were between forces that varied in some respects, in geography or alliance as well as in force structure and

doctrine. Part of strategy would always be identifying aspects of those dif-

ferences that generated special opportunities and vulnerabilities. Even when

the starting points were relatively symmetrical, the aim would be to iden-

tify and describe a critical asymmetry as the vital advantage to secure a victory. The only reason symmetry had worked in the nuclear sphere as mutual

assured destruction was because it had resulted in a degree of stability. In the conventional sphere, symmetrical forces were potentially a recipe for mutual

exhaustion.

As with so many of these concepts, inconsistent and expansive defi nitions

of asymmetry began to drain it of meaning. The 1999 Joint Strategy Review

defi ned asymmetric approaches as those that attempted “to circumvent or

220

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

undermine US strengths while exploiting US weaknesses using methods that differ signifi cantly from the United States’ expected method of operations.”

These could be applied “at all levels of warfare—strategic, operational, land tactical—and across the spectrum of military operations.” Put this way,

the approach became synonymous with any sound strategy for fi ghting the

United States and lost any specifi city. 16 The real interest in asymmetrical]]

warfare was in situations where the two sides would be seeking to fi ght com-

pletely different sorts of war, particularly when Americans persevered with

regular warfare while opponents either escalated to weapons of mass destruc-

tion or adopted forms of irregular war.

The greatest dangers were associated with an enemy that had weapons of

mass destruction, but the most likely scenario was being drawn into irregu-

lar war. Since Vietnam, the U.S. military had taken the view that rather

than make better preparations for irregular war it was best to stay clear of

potential quagmires. This tendency had been reinforced by the most cel-

ebrated account of Vietnam to emerge out of the army. Harry Summers, an

instructor at the Army War College, invoked Clausewitz in explaining how

the American focus on counterinsurgency distracted them from the essen-

tially conventional nature of the war. Summers made his point by working

backwards from the fi nal victory in 1975 of the North Vietnamese army over

the South. This possibility was always inherent in the North’s strategy, but

that did not mean that the prior insurgency in the South had somehow been

irrelevant. For one critic, who had been closely involved in the counterin-

surgency during the 1960s, the problem was that the U.S. army paid insuf-

fi cient attention to the demands of guerrilla warfare and not that they had

neglected the enemy’s “main force.” [^17]

The persistent resistance to Vietnam-type engagements was refl ected in

a distinction between war defi ned in terms of “large-scale combat opera-

tions,” to which U.S. forces were geared, and “operations other than war,”

which included shows of force, operations for purposes of peace enforce-

ment and peacekeeping, and counterterrorism and counterinsurgency, which

had a much lower priority. 18 W]]ariness of irregular wars meant reluctance to develop doctrine and training to accommodate them. It was assumed that

forces optimized for large-scale conventional war would be able to accom-

plish other, supposedly less demanding tasks if absolutely necessary. The

relatively small-scale contingencies that became common in the 1990s were

in effect dismissed as secondary and residual, an inappropriate use of armed

forces, apt to tie them down and catch them in vicious crossfi re while con-

ducting marginal political business that did not even touch on the nation’s

most vital interests. 19

t h e r e v o l u t i o n i n m i l i t a r y a f f a i r s

221

On September 11, 2001, the United States suffered a unique and unexpected attack, which took the notion of asymmetry to the extreme. A low-

budget plan hatched by a small band of Islamist radicals camped in one of

the poorest parts of the world was directed against the icons of American

economic, military, and political strength. Two planes crashed into the

World Trade Center in New York, one into the Pentagon in Washington,

and another would have hit the White House or Capitol Hill had it not been

for passenger action which forced the plane to crash. It did not take long to identify the group responsible—al-Qaeda, an extreme Islamist group based

in Afghanistan and protected by its ideological soul-mates in the Taliban

government.

The government’s response was to declare a “war on terror” and launch

a military campaign designed to overthrow the Taliban and break up al-

Qaeda. Although the provocation was on al-Qaeda’s terms, the response was

on America’s. The Taliban was defeated in a quasi-regular war because the

Americans were able to come in on the side of the Afghan opposition (the

Northern Alliance), who provided the infantry while the United States sup-

plied communications, airpower, and the occasional bribe to help encourage

the factions on the enemy side to defect. On this basis, President George

W. Bush concluded that the campaign had shown that “an innovative

doctrine and high-tech weaponry can shape and then dominate an uncon-

ventional confl ict.” It was a triumph of information-age warfare, with com-

manders “gaining a real-time picture of the entire battlefi eld” and then being able to “get targeting information from sensor to shooter almost instantly.”

There were romantic _resources/books//Strategy_ A History - Lawrence Freedman of U.S. Special Forces riding on horseback call-

ing in air strikes. Bush claimed that the confl ict had “taught us more about the future of our military than a decade of blue ribbon panels and think-

tank symposiums,” 20 suggesting that this approach had a wider application

beyond the special conditions of Afghanistan in late 2001. The next stage

refl ected this perception. Instead of devising a plan to deal with radical

Islamist movements, the United States embarked on a campaign to topple

the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq, because Saddam was suspected of

possessing weapons of mass destruction and was thus a potential source for

any terrorist group that wished to infl ict even more terrible damage upon

the United States. Again the United States was able to demonstrate convinc-

ing superiority in conventional military capabilities as the Iraqi regime was overthrown in short order.

The Afghan and Iraqi campaigns were both apparently decisive; hostile

regimes were toppled quickly after their forces were overwhelmed. In nei-

ther case, however, did this settle the matter. Secretary of Defense Donald

222

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

Rumsfeld had been seeking to make a point about how a war could be fought and won with far fewer forces than would hitherto have been thought prudent. This point was made, although against an enemy barely able to resist. [^21]

The lack of numbers soon appeared imprudent as U.S. forces struggled to

cope with an insurgency. The transition from old to new regime was further

complicated by the fact that the political claim that justifi ed the invasion—

that Iraq was illicitly developing weapons of mass destruction—was shown

to be in error. This encouraged the development of a new rationale based on

helping Iraq make the transition to democracy, a task made even harder by

the U.S.-led coalition’s lack of troops to manage what soon became a dete-

riorating security situation. Out of the minority Sunni community, which

had provided the key fi gures in the old elite, came the hardest resistance.

The Sunnis gained support from those humiliated by Iraq’s occupation and

fearful of the loss of their power. Their numbers swelled with disbanded

military members and volunteers from the many unemployed young men.

It included “former regime elements” and a strong al-Qaeda group led by

the Jordanian Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who was as keen to foment civil war

with the majority Shiites as he was to expel the Americans. Although Shiites

were the natural benefi ciaries of the toppling of the Iraqi regime, radical elements from within this community, led by Muqtada al-Sadr, also turned on

the Americans. The struggles faced by American forces after such apparently

effortless victories demonstrated that victory in battle did not necessarily

result in a smooth political transition. It also demonstrated that whatever

strengths the Americans had in regular warfare, they coped poorly with

irregular warfare.

With U.S. authority under constant challenge and its troops being caught

by ambushes and roadside bombs, there were contrary pressures to both

reduce profi le and put on forceful displays of strength. The coalition was soon militarily stretched and lacking in political credibility. A poor security situation hampered economic and social reconstruction, the lack of which contrib-

uted to security problems. Having ignored counterinsurgency for over three

decades, American forces struggled. They would move through towns and

villages and clear them of insurgents in a show of strength, but without suffi -

cient American troops left behind, the enemy could soon return. This meant

that the local population had no incentive to cooperate with the Americans.

Attempts were made to build up local security forces, but these were often

infi ltrated by the militias. U.S. troops had not been trained to withhold fi re, avoid rising to provocations, and fi nd ways to reach out to wary local people.

They found it hard to separate insurgents from innocent civilians and soon

became suspicious of everyone, which added to the sense of mutual alienation.

t h e r e v o l u t i o n i n m i l i t a r y a f f a i r s

223

More effort was going into intimidating opponents than winning over the undecided. An analysis of operations conducted from 2003 to 2005 suggested that most were “reactive to insurgent activity—seeking to hunt down

insurgents.” Few operations were “directed specifi cally to create a secure

environment for the population.” 22 The strategy of “cordon and sweep” put

the onus on holding territory and killing the enemy. Whatever the military

effects of this approach, the political effects were invariably detrimental.

The perplexing situation in which American forces found themselves

resulted in a resurgence of thinking about counterinsurgency, led by offi cers frustrated by the institutional barriers that had been set up to deny the relevance of irregular forms of warfare. _Military Review_ , the house journal of the Combined Arms Center at Fort Leavenworth, barely covered the issue before

2004. Soon it was averaging about fi ve articles on the topic per issue. 23]] The old classics of guerrilla warfare—from T. E. Lawrence to David Galula—

began to be rediscovered. Offi cers with a knowledge of past counterinsur-

gency practice (for example, John Nagl) began to advise on their application

to Iraq. [^24] David Kilcullen, an Australian offi cer on loan to the U.S. military, became one of the fi rst postcolonial counterinsurgency theorists, updating

the more timeless lessons by incorporating the efforts by al-Qaeda and like-

minded groups to establish a form of global insurgency that ignored national

boundaries. Kilcullen explored the extent to which ordinary people turned

into “accidental guerrillas” less because of their support of extremist ideologies than their resentment at foreign interference in their affairs. To prevent al-Qaeda turning itself into a global insurgency, it had to be disaggregated

into separate, manageable pieces. To prevent it prospering within the infor-

mation environment, the counterinsurgents needed to recognize this to be as

important as the physical environment. 25

The leader of the new counterinsurgency effort was General David

Petraeus. He noted the problems that had arisen because the United States

had become embroiled in a war for which it had not prepared, and he stressed

the political dimension of the problem, emphasizing that it was not just

a matter of military technique. “Counterinsurgency strategies must also

include, above all, efforts to establish a political environment that helps

reduce support for the insurgents and undermines the attraction of what-

ever ideology they may espouse.” 26 At the start of 2007, when the United

States appeared to be on the brink of abandoning Iraq to civil war, President Bush decided on one last push. Petraeus was put in charge of what became

known as the “surge,” although this overstated the importance of numbers as

opposed to a new strategy. 27]] Over the course of the year, there were defi nite signs of improvement, and this came to be seen as a turning point in the

224

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

confl ict in terms of mitigating the push to civil war if not meeting the early American aspirations of turning Iraq into a liberal democracy.

The improvement was not so much the result of extra troops and the

intelligence with which they were deployed, although these were important,

but more due to the extent to which the Iraqis turned away from the logic

of civil war, notably with a strong reaction among the Sunnis to the brutal-

ity of al-Qaeda. As the number of attacks on Shiite sites declined, there was less excuse for revenge attacks on Sunnis. Using American military strength

to reinforce these trends required a more subtle approach to Iraqi politics

than simply handing responsibility for security back to the Iraqi govern-

ment as soon as possible, whether or not they were able to cope. This meant

that the Americans were working with the grain of Iraqi politics rather than

against it.

_War into the Fourth Generation_

To what extent did the experience of the 2000s represent a trend or a set

of unusual circumstances, unlikely to be repeated? For those who took the

former view, there was a theoretical framework that had some credibility

because it could easily accommodate international terrorism. It came under

the broad heading of “fourth-generation warfare.” Like the RMA, this frame-

work had parentage in in OODA loops and maneuver warfare, but it had

taken a quite different turn, away from regular war. 28 Its origins lay in an]]

article by a group led by William Lind, a follower of Boyd and energetic

reformer. [^29] According to this scheme, the fi rst three generations had developed in response to each other (line and column, massed fi repower, and then

blitzkrieg). The new generation began in the moral and cognitive spheres,

where even physically strong entities could be victims of shock, disorienta-

tion, and loss of confi dence and coherence. This principle was then applied

to society as a whole. In the fourth generation, attacks would be directed at the sources of social cohesion, including shared norms and values, economic

management, and institutional structures. This was a move from the artifi cial operational level to a form of upside-down grand strategy, bringing in questions of rival ideologies and ways of life, and forms of confl ict that might not actually involve much fi ghting.

With cataclysmic great power clashes apparently things of the past, the

idea that new wars were wholly to be found in and around weak states per-

sisted. A growing amount of international business appeared to involve states

suffering from internal wars. 30]] The engagement of Western powers in these t h e r e v o l u t i o n i n m i l i t a r y a f f a i r s

225

confl icts was, however, considered discretionary (they were often described as

“wars of choice”) and undertaken on a humanitarian basis to relieve distress.

Though they raised issues outside of military operations, such as economic

reconstruction and state-building, they had only a loose fi t with the fourth-generation theory. If anything, they were distractions to the more tough-

minded of the fourth-generation theorists.

Although the RMA shared the same origins, it could only point to a singu-

lar form of regular warfare, which was unlikely to be fought because it suited the United States. Fourth-generation warfare, on the other hand, pointed

to almost everything else, which is why there were so many versions of the

theory. One strand, most associated with Lind, focused on an eating away of

American national identity as a result of unconstrained immigration and mul-

ticulturalism. He argued this was less a refl ection of social trends and more the result of a deliberate project by “cultural Marxists.” Cultural damage appeared as the product of deliberate and hostile moves, by enemies aided and abetted

by naïve and wrong-thinking elements at home, rather than of broader and

more diffuse social trends or economic imperatives. Another, more infl uential strand, most associated with Marine Colonel Thomas X. Hammes, concentrated on irregular war, especially the forms of terrorism and insurgency which

caused the United States such grief during the 2000s. 31

There were fi ve core themes in the fourth-generation literature. First, it

followed Boyd’s focus on the moral and cognitive domains as where wars are

won or lost. Second, there was a conviction that the Pentagon was mistaken

in its focus on high-technology, short wars. Third, tendencies toward glo-

balization and networks were presented as blurring established boundaries

between war and peace, civilian and military, order and chaos. War could

not be contained in either time or space. It spanned the “spectrum of human

activity” and was “politically, socially (rather than technically) networked

and protracted in duration.” Fourth, the enemies were not easy to fi nd or

pin down. Chuck Spinney, another former associate of Boyd, described the

fourth-generation warriors as presenting

few, if any, important targets vulnerable to conventional attack, and

their followers are usually much more willing to fi ght and die for their

causes. They seldom wear uniforms and may be diffi cult to distinguish

from the general population. They are also far less hampered by con-

vention and more likely to seek new and innovative means to achieve

their objectives. 32

Fifth, because these confl icts were played out in the moral and cognitive

domains, any military action must be considered as a form of communication.

226

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

Lind argued in the original formulation: “Psychological operations may become the dominant operational and strategic weapon in the form of media/

information intervention.” [^33]

As a coherent theory it soon evaporated, not only because of the differ-

ent strands but also because it depended on a historical schema which did

not work. War had never been solely based on regular battle, supposedly

at the center of the three previous generations. Moreover, even virtuosos of

irregular warfare, such as T. E. Lawrence and Mao Zedong, still accepted

that only regular forces could seize state power. The fact that there might

be a number of groups relying on irregular forms, from terrorism to insur-

gency, was a function of their weakness rather than a unique insight into

the impact of new technologies and socioeconomic structures in the modern

world. There was also a tendency to assume that unwelcome developments

had one guiding cause.

In a similar vein, Ralph Peters argued that Western forces must prepare

to face “warriors,” whom he characterized colorfully as “erratic primitives of shifting allegiances, habituated to violence, with no stake in civil order.” He described their approach to war in terms familiar to students of guerrilla warfare. They only stood and fought when they had an overwhelming advantage.

“Instead they snipe, ambush, mislead, and betray, attempting to fool the

constrained soldiers confronting them into alienating the local population

or allies, while otherwise hunkering down and trying to outlast the orga-

nized military forces pitted against them.” 34]] This overstated the problem.

Some might enjoy fi ghting for its own sake, but the most fearsome warriors

were likely to be fi ghting for a cause or a way of life they held dear. The performance of guerrilla bands, militias, and popular armies was mixed to say

the least.

_Information Operations_

A key element in the discussion of asymmetric warfare focused on what were

unhelpfully known as “information operations.” The term was unhelpful

because it referred to a series of related but distinctive activities, some concerned with the fl ow of information and others with its content. Its poten-

tial range was indicated by an offi cial U.S. publication, which asserted as a goal achieving and maintaining “information superiority for the U.S. and

its allies.” This required an ability “to infl uence, disrupt, corrupt, or usurp adversarial human and automated decision-making while protecting our

own.” The mix of the automated and the human was refl ected in references

t h e r e v o l u t i o n i n m i l i t a r y a f f a i r s

227

to electronic warfare and computer networks as well psychological operations and deception. [^35] All this refl ected two distinct strands. The fi rst was the traditional concern with changing the perceptions of others, and the second was

the impact of digitized information.

When information was a scarce commodity it could be considered in sim-

ilar ways as other vital commodities, such as fuel and food. Acquiring and

protecting high-quality information made it possible to stay ahead of oppo-

nents and competitors. Such information might include intellectual prop-

erty, sensitive fi nancial data, and the plans and capabilities of government agencies and private corporations. This provided intelligence agencies with

their raison d’être. While Clausewitz may have dismissed the importance

of intelligence, it came to be of increasing value as improved means were

found to gather information that opponents intended to keep secret. At fi rst this depended on spies, and then the ability to break codes. As telegraphic

communications came into use, their interception could provide evidence on

enemy locations as well as messages. Breaking German signal codes during

the Second World War gave the Allies a valuable advantage in a number of

encounters. Then came the ability to take photographs from the air and later

from space. It became progressively harder to stop opponents from picking

up vital details about military systems and dispositions.

As more information began to be digitized—so that it became simpler to

generate, transmit, collect, and store—and communications became instan-

taneous, the challenges became those of plenty rather than scarcity. There

were large amounts of material that could be accessed, both openly and illic-

itly. Outsiders sought to hack their way through passwords and fi rewalls to

acquire sensitive material, steal identities, or misappropriate funds. Another challenge was maintaining the integrity of information despite attempted

disruption or tampering via the insidious forms of digital penetration known

as viruses, worms, trojan horses, and logic bombs, which were often launched

from distant servers for no obvious purpose—though there was sometimes a

clear and malign intent. The bulk of this activity was criminal and fraudu-

lent, but there were examples of large-scale downloading of government and

corporate secrets by state-funded hackers, attacks that closed down govern-

mental systems, mysterious viruses that affected weapons development pro-

grams, and damaged software that meant military equipment failed to work

properly. Might an army of software wizards use insidious electronic means

to dislocate the support systems of modern societies, such as transport, banking, and public health?

There was no doubt that attacks could cause inconvenience and irrita-

tion, and on occasion make a real difference. In the midst of operations, the 228

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

military might fi nd air defense systems disabled, missiles sent off-course, local commanders left in the dark, and senior commanders confused as their

screens went blank. If they had bought in to the idea that fast-fl owing data streams could eliminate the fog of war, they could be in for a rude shock.

Even without enemy interference, a fog could be caused by a superfl uity of

information—too much to fi lter, evaluate, and digest—rather than the pau-

city of the past. Certainly the new information environment posed problems

to governments in terms of what they could hope to control and their efforts

to infl uence the news agenda. Ordinary people could spread _resources/books//Strategy_ A History - Lawrence Freedman with

cell phone photos and news, often inaccurate and half-digested, could spread

on social networking sites, while governments were still trying to work out

what was going on and shape a response. 36

Did this amount to the danger identifi ed by John Arquilla and David

Ronfeldt in 1993, when they warned that “Cyberwar is Coming!” [^37] Their claim was that future wars would revolve around knowledge. They distinguished between “cyberwar,” which they limited to military systems

(although it became expanded in later use) and “netwar,” which was more

at the societal level. The issue was the same as for any new form of war-

fare: could it be decisive on its own? Or, as Steve Metz put it, could a “politically usable way” be found to damage an “enemy’s national or commercial

infrastructure” suffi ciently “to attain victory without having to fi rst defeat fi elded military forces?” 38]]

The presumption that there might be a decisive cyberwar attack assumed

that the offense would dominate and that the effects would be far-reaching,

enduring, and uncontainable. The threat gained credibility from the fre-

quency with which companies and even high-profi le networks, including the

Pentagon, were attacked by hackers. Protecting and managing privileged

information against sophisticated foes who probed persistently for the weak-

est links in networks became a high priority. But effective attacks required

considerable intelligence on the precise confi guration of the enemy’s digital systems as well as points of entry into their networks. The possible anonymity and surprise of the attack might have its attractions, but any proposal

to mount one would raise obvious questions about the likelihood of success

against an alert opponent, the real damage that might be done, the speed

of recovery, and the possibility of retaliation (not necessarily in kind). An opponent that had been really hurt might well strike back physically rather

than digitally. Thomas Rid warned that the issue was becoming dominated

by hyperbole. The bulk of “cyber” attacks were nonviolent in their intent

and effect, and in general were less violent than measures they might replace.

They were the latest versions of the classic activities of sabotage, espionage, t h e r e v o l u t i o n i n m i l i t a r y a f f a i r s

229

and subversion. “Cyber-war,” he concluded, was a “wasted metaphor,” failing to address the real issues raised by the new technologies. [^39]

Arquilla and Ronfeldt described “netwar” as “an emerging mode of

confl ict (and crime) at societal levels, short of traditional military warfare, in which the protagonists used network forms of organization and related

doctrines, strategies, and technologies attuned to the information age.” In

contrast to the large, hierarchical stand-alone organizations that conducted

police and military operations, and which extremists often mimicked, the

protagonists of netwar were “likely to consist of dispersed organizations,

small groups, and individuals who communicate, coordinate, and conduct

their campaigns in an internetted manner, often without a central com-

mand.” 40 T]]errorists, insurgents, or even nonviolent radical groups would not need to rely on frontal assaults and hierarchical command chains but could

“swarm,” advancing in small groups from many different directions using

different methods in a network held together by cellphones and the web. In

practice, the more visible manifestations took the form of “hacktivism,” a

way of making political or cultural points rather than threatening the econ-

omy or social cohesion. Even if more determined adversaries were prepared

to mount substantial attacks, the result would likely be “mass disruption”

rather than “mass destruction,” with inconvenience and disorientation more

evident than terror and collapse. 41

The use of social networking, such as Facebook and Twitter, during the

early days of the Arab Spring of 2011 illustrated how swarming could leave

governments uncertain about how to cope with a rapidly developing public

opinion. Such tactics followed well-established principles from before the

information age. Radical groups, especially during their early stages, were

often based on loose networks of individuals. To avoid attracting the atten-

tion of the authorities, they found it safer to operate as semi-independent

cells, communicating with each other and their shared leadership as little as possible. To be sure, the Internet and the other forms of digitized communication made it easier to keep in touch, but the number of security breaches

attributed to calls or electronic messages being traced still left them hesitant to talk too openly or too specifi cally. Moreover, radical networks required an underlying social cohesion or an attachment to a clear campaign objective

to bring diverse individuals together. In order to prosper they needed to

move beyond the cellular form. This required a leadership able to mobilize

and then direct suffi cient force to strike signifi cant blows. It was diffi cult to move beyond being a nuisance and harassing the enemy to seizing control

without an authoritative point of decision. As the Arab revolts of 2011–2013

demonstrated, regimes facing serious opposition did not reply with social

230

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

networking of their own but with repression and force, and in the end, it was the possibility of armed rebellion and the readiness of the military to defend the regime that were crucial.

The initial focus was on the role of information fl ows in sustaining stan-

dard military operations, facilitating faster decision-making and ensur-

ing more precise physical effects. The irregular warfare in the 2000s soon

brought into focus the more traditional forms of information warfare, and the Americans appeared to be losing ground to apparently primitive opponents

regarding how these confl icts, their stakes, and their conduct were perceived.

Their opponents lacked physical strength but seemed to know how to turn

impressionable minds. Superiority in the physical environment was of little

value unless it could be translated into an advantage in the information environment. As this was the “chosen battlespace” of its foes, the United States

was now required to learn to conceptualize its victories in terms of shap-

ing perceptions over time rather than in terms of decisive engagements that

annihilated the enemy. [^42] The issue was not so much the fl ow of data but the way that people thought.

The counterinsurgency struggles in Iraq and Afghanistan led to an almost

postmodernist embrace of pre-rational and embedded patterns of thought

that allowed individuals, and broad social groups, to be caught up in a par-

ticular view of the world. Major General Robert Scales sought to explain the

contrast between the failure of Islamic armies when fi ghting conventional

battles Western style and their far greater success in unconventional war.

He developed the concept of “culture-centric warfare.” [^43] In facing an enemy that “uses guile, subterfuge, and terror mixed with patience and a willingness to die,” he argued, too much effort had been spent attempting to gain

“a few additional meters of precision, knots of speed, or bits of bandwidth”

and too little to create a “parallel transformation based on cognition and cultural awareness.” Winning wars required “creating alliances, leveraging non-

military advantages, reading intentions, building trust, converting opinions, and managing perceptions—all tasks that demand an exceptional ability to

understand people, their culture, and their motivation.” This would be a

“dispersed enemy” communicating “by word of mouth and back-alley mes-

sengers” and fi ghting with simple weapons that did “not require networks or

sophisticated technological integration to be effective.”

One refl ection of the growing recognition of cultural factors was that the

Pentagon employed an anthropologist, Montgomery McFate, to consider the

interplay between military operations and Iraqi society. Among the mistakes

she identifi ed were failures to appreciate the role of tribal loyalties as the established civilian structure of power collapsed, the importance of coffee

t h e r e v o l u t i o n i n m i l i t a r y a f f a i r s

231

shop rumors compared with offi cial communications, and the meaning of such small things as hand gestures. [^44] The growing recognition of the importance of the ability to infl uence another’s view of the world was evident in the frequent references to “hearts and minds” in warnings about what was

lost politically by indiscriminate and harsh military operations. The phrase

came to be used whenever there was a need to persuade people through good

works and sensitivity that security forces were really on their side, as part of a broader strategy of cutting militants off from their potential sources of support, including recruits, intelligence, sustenance, weapons and ammunition, and sanctuaries. The counterargument went back to Machiavelli—that

it was better to be respected than loved, that opponents could be intimidated and demoralized by physical strength but encouraged in their opposition by

concessions.

The problem was more an over-facile approach to the hearts-and-minds

concept. In other contexts, “heart” and “mind” were pitted against each

other—strong emotions versus cool calculations, appeals to values and sym-

bols versus appeals to the intellect. This is refl ected in an early use by the British General Sir Henry Clinton when facing a similar problem with the

upstart Americans in 1776. The British, Clinton argued, needed to “gain

the hearts and subdue the minds of America.” 45]] In practice, in discussions of countering both insurgency and terrorism, those opposed to brute force

tended to stress gaining hearts more than subduing minds, as if provisions of goods and services could win the support of a desperate population.

There were three diffi culties. First, as noted, local political loyalties

would depend on local power structures and any measures would have to

be judged in terms of their effects on these structures. Second, while there

were undoubted benefi ts to repairing roads and building schools, or securing power and sanitation, these efforts wouuld not get very far if security was so poor that foreign troops and local people were unable to interact closely and develop mutual trust. They were the sort of policies that might help prevent situations deteriorating but were less likely to help retrieve it once lost.

A more minds-oriented approach might establish that trust by addressing

questions about who was likely to win the continuing political and military

confl ict and the long-term agendas of the various parties. The insurgents

could sow doubts about who among the local population could be trusted,

about what was real and what was fake, about who was truly on one’s side and

who was pretending. As the insurgents and counterinsurgents played mind

games to gain local support, they could be as anxious to create impressions

of strength as of kindness, to demonstrate a likely victory as well as to hand out largesse. In terms of the cognitive dimensions of strategy, this was as

232

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

important as any feel-good effect from good works. Both would depend on the actual experiences of the local population and local leaders, and the mental constructs through which it was interpreted.The third problem was that

this strategy required greater subtlety than just an awareness that differ-

ent people had different cultures. It was hard to argue against an improved

sensitivity about how others viewed the world and the need to avoid ethno-

centrism. _Culture_ was itself a slippery term, often being used as something that envelops individuals and shapes their actions without them being able

to do much about it. The term could include almost anything that could

not be explained by reference to hard-nosed matters of interest. Attempts to

defi ne another’s strategic culture often then came up with something remark-

ably coherent, without contradiction and almost impervious to change. At

least among academics, this approach was largely giving way to a practice of

referring to some received ideas that help interpret information and navigate events but which were subject to regular modifi cation and development. We

shall return to some of these ideas in the last section of this book when we

develop the idea of “scripts.” 46 The importance of an exaggerated view of cul-

ture was that it could lead to the assumption that alien attitudes and uncooperative behavior refl ected the persistence of an ancient way of life, untouched by modern infl uences, asserting itself whatever the conditions.

Against the suggestion that individuals were socialized into hard cul-

tures sharing assumptions, norms, patterns of behavior, and forms of mutual

understanding that could be implicit, unspoken, or taken for granted—

that were all but impenetrable to an outsider—was the possibility that in

a dynamic situation where communities were being subjected to new infl u-

ences and challenges, cultures were likely to develop and adjust, and become

less effective in binding people together. Thus, observed Porter, in the lit-

erature on reconstructed Islamists, warrior peoples, and insurgencies fed by

cultural difference, it was as if the people encountered did “not act but are acted upon by impersonal historical forces, taking orders from the culture; or that modes of warfare are singular and fi xed by ancestral habit.” People were able to learn and accommodate within their cultures new types of weapons

and forms of confl ict. References to the durability of hatreds and the evocation of cultural symbols could encourage stereotypes of the primordial and

the exotic as harmful as those that assumed that all people were seeking to

remake themselves in a Western image. Explaining problematic behavior as

a consequence of people being set in their ways was not only condescend-

ing but also let off the hook those in the intervening forces, whose actions

might have prompted a hostile reaction, and underestimated the extent to

which opponents in a prolonged confl ict would interact and pick up ideas,

t h e r e v o l u t i o n i n m i l i t a r y a f f a i r s

233

weapons, and tactics from each other. 47 The need to have convincing stories]]

impressed itself on offi cers trying to work out how they coped with a vicious enemy while trying to stay on the right side of the people they were supposed to be helping. Kilcullen observed the insurgents’ “pernicious infl uence”

drew on a “single narrative”—simple, unifi ed, easily expressed—that could

organize experience and provide a framework for understanding events. He

understood that it was best to be able to “tap into an existing narrative that excludes the insurgents,” stories that people naturally appreciate. Otherwise

it was necessary to develop an alternative narrative. 48]] It was not so easy for a complex multinational force to forge a narrative that could satisfy a variety of audiences. A British offi cer saw the value of one that not only helped explain actions but also bound together “one’s team, across levels of authority and

function; the diplomatic head of mission, the army company commander, the

aid specialist, the politician working from a domestic capital, for instance.”

He recognized that this might lead to variations in the story, but so long as there was an underlying consistency this need not be a problem. But liberal

democracies found it hard to generate consistent stories, or to appreciate the

needs of the local front line as against those of the distant capital. 49

A generally rueful collection of essays put together by the Marine Corps

suggested that the United States had proved inept at “quickly adapting the

vast, dominant, commercial information infrastructure it enjoys to national

security purposes.” 50 It was perplexing to have been caught out so badly by

al-Qaeda, who seemed to be as brazen in their message as they were outra-

geous in their attacks. Yet in an apparent war of narratives the United States was on the defensive, preoccupied with challenging another’s message rather

than promoting their own. Attempts were made to fashion notionally attrac-

tive communications without being sure how they were being received. In

addressing their new target audiences, the Western communicators had to

cope with rumors and hearsay, popular distrust of any reports from offi cial

sources, a reluctance to be told by foreigners what to think, and competition with a multitude of alternative sources. People fi ltered out what they did not trust or what they found irrelevant, or they picked up odd fragments and

variants of the core message, interpreting and synthesizing them according

to their own prejudices and frameworks.

Most seriously, there could be no total control over the impressions being

created by either the actions of careless troops or the policy statements of

careless politicians. There might be a group of professionals working under

the label of information operations, but the audiences could take their

cues from whatever caught their attention. The United States might have

invented mass communications and the modern public relations industry,

234

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

but these were challenges that went beyond normal marketing techniques.

Those with backgrounds in political campaigning or marketing who were

asked to advise on getting the message out in Iraq and Afghanistan often

opted for short-lived projects that had no lasting effect. Moreover, these individuals knew that they would be judged by how their products went down

with domestic audiences; thus, those were the groups to which they tended

to be geared. Not only did this miss the point of the exercise but it could also blind policymakers, who often fell into the trap of believing their own propaganda. Jeff Michaels developed the idea of a “discourse trap” whereby the

politically comfortable and approved language used to describe campaigns

led policymakers to miss signifi cant developments. By refusing to acknowl-

edge that early terror attacks in Iraq could be the responsibility of anybody other than former members of the regime, for example, they missed the alienation of moderate Sunnis and the growth of Shia radicalism. [^51]

Attempts to persuade individuals to see the world in a different light

and change their views were diffi cult enough and required insight into their distinctive backgrounds, characters, and concerns. It was far harder to do this for a whole category of people from an unfamiliar culture with extremely signifi cant internal currents and differences that would be barely perceptible to outsiders. It was important when conducting military operations to understand that their effects went well beyond the kinetic to infl uencing the way that those caught up in confl icts understood their likely course and what

was at stake. This affected the way that allegiances and sympathies might

be broken and put together. Understanding this could help avoid egregious

errors that might alienate important sections of the population. But because

it was hard to measure and pin down effects on beliefs, it was not surprising that commanders trusted the surer results of fi repower. 52 If the challenge was]]

to reshape political consciousness to produce an alignment of views with

powerful foreigners, there were bound to be limits to what could be done

by the military. Favorable _resources/books//Strategy_ A History - Lawrence Freedman, let alone whole belief systems, could not

be fi red directly into the minds of the target audience as a form of precision weapon. If there was a consolation, the success of al-Qaeda was also exaggerated. Modern communications media undoubtedly created opportunities

for the almost instantaneous transmission of dramatic and eloquent _resources/books//Strategy_ A History - Lawrence Freedman,

and to any modern-day Bakunin there were extraordinary opportunities for

“propaganda of the deed.” [^53] The same factors, however, that worked against successful offi cial “information operations” could also work against the militants—random violence, irrelevance to everyday concerns, and messages that

grew tedious with repetition. 54]] As Ben Wilkinson observed in a study of radical Islamist groups, the real problem was not the lack of a simple message but t h e r e v o l u t i o n i n m i l i t a r y a f f a i r s

235

the implausibility of the cause and effect relationships they had to postulate if they were to convince themselves and their supporters of eventual success.

This led them astray, caught by “bad analogies, false assumptions, misinter-

pretations and fallacies,” overstating the role of human agency, with little

room for the accidental and the unpredictable. All this made for a bad case of

“narrative delusion.” [^55] Radical strategists might be at special risk of narrative delusion, because of the size of the gap between aspirations and means, but it is one to which all strategists are prone.

The Myth of the Master Strategist

_. . . in 1793 a force appeared that beggared all imagination. Suddenly_

_war again became the business of the people—a people of thirty millions,_

_all of whom considered themselves to be citizens. . . . The resources and_ _efforts now available for use surpassed all conventional limits; nothing_

_now impeded the vigor with which war could be waged._

—Clausewitz, _On War_

The framework for thinking about war and strategy inspired by

Napoleon and developed in its most suggestive form by Clausewitz was

not easily displaced. So shrewd were Clausewitz’s insights and so compel-

ling his formulations that it was hard to think of alternative ways to study

war effectively. Those who drew attention to their greater knowledge about

past wars and developments that he could not have imagined missed the

point. The enduring power of his analytical framework lay in the dynamic

interplay of politics, violence, and chance. It was because of this that writers on military strategy continued to assert their fealty to the great master. One of these, Colin Gray, wondered why modern strategic thought compared so

poorly with _On War_ . There were no war leaders comparable to Napoleon able to inspire great interpretative theory. He also pointed to a lack of military practitioners comfortable with theory or civilian theorists familiar with practice. The complexity of modern warfare challenged the lone theorist, while

those concerned with national strategy had become too focused on immediate policy issues.

Gray had an exalted view of the strategist as someone who could view

the system as a whole, taking account of the multiple interdependencies and

the numerous factors at play in order to identify where effort could be most

profi tably applied. In his _Modern Strategy_ , he identifi ed seventeen factors to take into account: people, society, culture, politics, ethics, economics and logistics, organization, administration, information and intelligence, strategic theory and doctrine, technology, operations, command, geography, fric-

tion/chance/uncertainty, adversary, and time. Proper strategy required that

these be considered holistically—that is, both individually and in context

with the others. 1

This was picked up by Harry Yarger, a teacher at the U.S. Army War

College, who went even further: “Strategic thinking is about thoroughness

and holistic thinking. It seeks to understand how the parts interact to form

the whole by looking at parts and relationships among them—the effects

they have on one another in the past, present, and anticipated future.” This

holistic perspective would require “a comprehensive knowledge of what else

is happening within the strategic environment and the potential fi rst-, sec-

ond-, and third-order effects of its own choices on the efforts of those above, below, and on the strategist’s own level.” Nor would it be good enough to

work with snapshots and early gains: “The strategist must reject the expedi-

ent, near-term solution for the long-term benefi t.” So much was expected of

the true strategist: a student of the present who must be aware of the past,

sensitive to the possibilities of the future, conscious of the danger of bias, alert to ambiguity, alive to chaos, ready to think through consequences of

alternative courses of action, and then able to articulate all this with suffi cient

precision for those who must execute its prescriptions. 2]] This was a counsel of perfection. There was only so much knowledge that an individual could

accumulate, assimilate, and manipulate; only so many potential sequences of

events that could be worked through in a system that was full of uncertainty, complexity, and chaos.

Gray also concluded that this was too much, accepting that he had also been

too ambitious. Yarger, he observed, “appeared to encourage, even demand, an

impossibility.” 3 Even making a start on these factors required a considerable]]

technical and conceptual grasp. Nonetheless, Gray still described a strategist as someone rather special, with an “exceedingly demanding” job description,

able to see the “big picture,” and familiar with all of war’s dimensions. He

quoted with approval Fred Iklé’s observation that good work on national

strategy required a “rotund intellect, a well-rounded personality.” 4]] Similarly, 238

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

Yarger had described strategy as “the domain of the strong intellect, the lifelong student, the dedicated professional, and the invulnerable ego.” [^5]

Could there be such a master strategist with this unique grasp of affairs?

If ever found, this person would be a precious resource and in great demand,

torn between hard looks into the future and the need to take time to com-

municate conclusions in an intelligible form to those who must follow them.

As such systematic and forward thinking would open up numerous risks

and possibilities, any value to a practitioner would require sharpening the

focus. An all-encompassing view of the environment might be welcome by

a government before embarking on a major initiative where it could expect

to take the fi rst move, but could also be a luxury when coping with sudden

developments that had unaccountably been missed. Then strategy might be

more improvised and ad hoc. In such circumstances, the master strategist

might feel a tad unprepared.

The supposed holistic view of the master strategist would also be prob-

lematic. There were good reasons to pay attention to “systems effects,” the

unanticipated results of connections between apparently separate spheres of

activity. The likelihood of unexpected effects was a good reason to take care when urging bold moves and then to monitor closely their consequences once

taken. Exploring the range and variety of relationships within the broader

environment could help identify creative possibilities by generating indirect forms of infl uence, targeting an opponent’s weakest links, or forging surprising alliances. 6 This did not, however]], require a view of the whole system.

There had to be some boundaries. In principle everything was connected to

everything else; in practice the repercussions of a localized action might fade away quite soon. In addition, a holistic view implied an ability to look at a complete system from without, whereas the practical strategist’s perspective

was bound to be more myopic, focusing on what was close and evidently

consequential rather than on distant features that might never need to be

engaged. Over time the focus might change. That was not an argument to

attempt to anticipate everything in advance but to recognize the unreality of insisting on setting out with confi dence, certainty, and clarity a series of steps that was sure to reach long-term goals.

The idea that societies, and their associated military systems might be

comprehended as complex systems encouraged the view, refl ected in the per-

plexing searches for enemy centers of gravity, that hitting an enemy system

in exactly the right place would cause it to crumble quickly, as the impact

would reverberate and affect all the interconnected parts. The frustration of the search was a result of the fact that effects would not simply radiate out from some vital center. Societies could adapt to shocks. As systems, they

t h e m y t h o f t h e m a s t e r s t r a t e g i s t

239

could break down into more viable subsystems, establish barriers, reduce dependencies, and fi nd alternative forms of sustenance. Feedback would be

constant and complex.

Clausewitz did present war as a dynamic system but it was also remark-

ably self-contained. He was a theorist of war and not of international poli-

tics. 7 He looked backward to the political source of war but that was not]]

where he started. At the level of national policy, what eventually became

called grand strategy, questions had to be asked about how goals were to

be best met. The answers might exclude the armed forces or assign them

only a minor role. It was only at this more political level that the success

of any military operations could be judged and claims of victory assessed.

The quality and timelessness of Clausewitz’s analysis of the phenomenon of

war left behind the context from which it sprang, that is, the upheavals set

in motion by the French Revolution. His focus on decisive victory required

reassessment in the light of changes in the political context. Even when it

was pointed out that Clausewitz had begun to reappraise limited war, the

concept of a decisive battle retained its powerful hold over the military profession. The attraction was not hard to see: it gave the armed forces a special role and responsibility. The fate of the nation was in their hands, a point to be emphasized when seeking additional resources or political support. If affairs could be settled without decisive battles, then the general staffs could lose their importance and clout. Battle, however, became increasingly problematic as fi repower became more ferocious over greater ranges and more men

could be mobilized to pour into a fi ght. To retain the possibility of decisiveness, some critical new factor had to be found. Prior to the First World War

it was detected in the motivating effects of high morale and a brave national spirit. Afterwards the focus was on the possibilities of surprise and maneuver to overcome the devastating effects of enemy fi repower by disorienting them.

This interest was revived in the United States during the later decades of the twentieth century though the outcomes of the regular military campaigns

could be predicted as much by reference to the raw balance of military power

as to any superior operational cleverness.

Even then, apparent victory could be compromised as regular wars turned

into irregular struggles. This need not have been news. Clausewitz had noted

the effectiveness of the fi rst guerrillas in Spain against Napoleon. Occupying armies regularly faced harassment from a sullen and resistant population.

This phenomenon was evident in the challenges to colonialism. When regu-

lar battles seemed to lead to stalemate, governments could well try to break

the deadlock by seeking to coerce civilian populations, whether through

naval blockades or air raids. Popular morale became as important if not more

240

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

so than military morale. So from the micro-level of counterinsurgency as well as the macro-level of nuclear deterrence, the key effects were not those posed by one armed force against another but those posed against the adversary’s

political and social structures.

Once the civilian sphere was acknowledged to be so important then ques-

tions of perceptions and how they might be infl uenced came to the fore.

Deterrence required infl uencing the expectations of those who might be con-

templating aggressive action to remind them of why this might be a bad

idea; irregular warfare required separating the militants from their possible supporters by demonstrating this was a cause doomed to failure and offering few rewards if successful. There was little science in this. A sense of the danger of nuclear war did not require subtle messaging, while attempts to

shape the views of people caught up in a war in which they were reluctant to

take sides could easily be undermined by a single dramatic event or a lack of understanding of local concerns. Unless the message was very strong, as with

nuclear war, it was easier in retrospect to explain the behavior of others than in prospect to infl uence that behavior through “information operations.” The counterinsurgency campaigns of the early twenty-fi rst century refl ected a

keen appreciation of narratives, but they were more relevant when illuminat-

ing problems than as sources of solutions. Looking back, it was possible to

discern the processes by which the predominant views within a community

had begun to shift, but that was not the same as providing the basis for a

forward-looking strategy.

The practical diffi culties of this complex interaction between the civilian

and military spheres were aggravated by the political separation of the two

spheres in terms of the higher command structures. The traditional military

view, affi rmed by von Moltke, was that once the purposes of war had been set by the political leadership, the war’s subsequent conduct was the military’s

responsibility. The civilians must then take a back seat. It was enough to have to cope with a resolute and wily enemy without having to deal with panicking civilians as well, especially once modern communications constantly

put temptation in their way. When an immediate connection could be made

between the head of state and the most junior front-line commander, the con-

sidered judgments of a whole chain of command might be swept away by a

few inexpert and clumsy sentences. Under any circumstances, abrupt shifts in

political direction combined with amateurish attempts at playing the great

commander were bound to irritate the professionals.

This was the blind spot resulting from the focus on battle, expressed

in the belief that the operational art was something best left to military

commanders. 8]] This model of civil-military relationships whereby the actual t h e m y t h o f t h e m a s t e r s t r a t e g i s t

241

deployment and employment of armed force was a largely military responsibility was wholly inadequate. The two spheres needed to be in constant

dialogue. Political ends could not be discussed without regard for military

feasibility. Diplomatic activity would be shaped by military options and

risks. Whether or not to offer diplomatic concessions, seek resources or bases from third parties, or construct alliances, depended on military assessments.

These assessments in turn led to assumptions on the shape of the rival coali-

tions and their ability to withstand long wars or extend their reach through

bases. The idea of a military strategy separate from a political strategy was not only misleading but also dangerous.

Civilians could not ignore the supposedly operational issues associated

with military strategy. They needed to consider whether the way a war was

being fought was consistent with the purposes for which it was being fought,

and to look beyond coming battles to the following peace. They needed to

keep the public and allies, potential or actual, on their side. This required consideration of the burdens a society could accept and the harm it could

legitimately impose on others, and of how to lead a polity toward these limits or away from them. When it came to operations, most military organizations

had to improvise at some point, whatever the “lessons” they believed they

had learned from previous wars. As they did so, the generals and admirals

would often quite properly disagree among themselves on how the enemy

would best be defeated. The single military view was the exception rather

than the rule, and the differences regularly turned on assessments that were

essentially political. The military would need regular political guidance as

circumstances changed and old plans became redundant.

The attempt to develop a science of strategy was thus thwarted by the

inherent unpredictability of military affairs and compounded by the even

greater unpredictability of political affairs. Wars were not won through

applying some formula that only seasoned military professionals could grasp,

for example, by insisting on a maneuverist rather than an attritional philosophy, clever ways of catching the enemy by surprise versus the single-minded

delivery of fi repower. Military campaigns had to be designed according to

circumstances, and successful commanders would show fl exibility in their

operational decisions. In explaining success and failure in war it would be

wrong to discount the operational art, but as often as not the key to a suc-

cessful strategy was the political skill necessary to deny the enemy a winning coalition while forging one’s own.

The origins of a distinctive concept of military strategy lay in the urge

to control, and as we shall see in the next two sections, a similar urge was

infl uential in the origins of both political (even revolutionary) and business 242

s t r a t e g i e s o f f o r c e

strategy. This urge shaped strategies to control the battlefi eld through the complete elimination of enemy armies. It was also evident in a determination

to maintain the operational sphere as the privileged domain of the military.

Pure control was always an illusion, at most a temporary sensation of success, which would soon pass as the new situation generated its own challenges.

Extracting a state from an attritional confl ict would require awkward nego-

tiations, while even impressive victories involved a concept of a sustainable peace and the question of how to deal with the defeated. The idea of a master strategist was therefore a myth. On the one hand, it demanded an impossible

omniscience in grasping the totality of complex and dynamic situations or

an ability to establish a credible and sustainable path toward distant goals.

On the other hand, it failed to take account of what were often the real and

immediate demands of strategy-making. This was to bring together a variety

of disparate actors to agree on how to address the most pressing problems

arising out of the current state of affairs and plot a means of advance to a

much better state.

The attempt to control the course of battle came at a time of growing

logistical complexity, mass armies, and political upheaval. As we have seen

this led to two core principles that proved to be very resilient even as their limitations should have become evident and the circumstances in which they

had to be implemented became even more challenging. The fi rst, which had

unassailable logic, was that complete control could only reliably be achieved through elimination of the enemy army. The second was that this required

maintaining the operational sphere as the privileged domain of the military.

This gave debates on military strategy a sharp but also narrow focus. The

political dimension was seen as something separate, a source of goals and

eventual peace terms but irrelevant to operational conduct.

A military goal of annihilation went naturally with a political goal of

subjugation, though that was not always achievable. When the structure of a

confl ict was examined more broadly, it was likely that the ability to impose a degree of political control on situations would depend on not only the capabilities of the enemy armies but the extent of the popular determination to

resist subjugation and what sort of measures could be taken against a hostile population, sources of fi nance and essential commodities, and the strength

and cohesion of the competing alliances. Clausewitz accepted the potential

importance of these factors. In his concept of “centers of gravity,” he sug-

gested that they could be addressed through a targeted military effort. In[pa r t I I I](index_split_000.html#p9)

Marx and a Strategy for the

Working Class

_Philosophers have only interpreted the world . . . the point, however, is to_ _change it._

—Karl Marx, _“Theses on Feuerbach”_

The last section had the United States puzzling out how to cope with

irregular warfare, with the concept of decisive victory no longer seem-

ing so relevant and a focus on intense local struggles taking center stage. As it sought to try to cope with terrorist atrocities and ambushes, the United

States was aware that it was in a competition to obtain the acquiescence if

not the active support of the ordinary people in whose name war was being

waged. The armed forces were encouraged to reach out to these people, to

fi nd ways of talking to them, and to persuade them that they were truly

on their side. These efforts, however, kept on coming up against barriers to

comprehension set down by language and culture, as well as past actions,

policies, and pronouncements that made the job of persuasion even harder.

This question of how minds can be turned, especially in large numbers and

in a shared direction, looms large in this section, because that has long been a preoccupation of radicals and revolutionaries determined to upend the existing structures of power on behalf of the masses—though the masses were

reluctant participants, if not actively hostile to the whole endeavor.

This section looks at strategy from the perspective of the underdogs, or at least those claiming to act on their behalf, who faced a large gap between desired ends and available means. These were the people for whom strategy

was most challenging. They had to mobilize support in ways that would

not invite suppression. If suppression was likely, they needed to consider

clandestine survival and even violent responses of their own. They asked

whether all could be persuaded to rally around the same goals or whether

compromise would be necessary, and if so how much would be acceptable.

Radical groups with distant goals could fi nd comfort in an isolated purity,

while those who tasted success saw the value of accommodating the views

of others. As they devised plans of campaign, the issues that dominated the

military discourse—endurance and surprise, annihilation versus exhaustion,

direct battle or indirect pressure—all made their appearance, often in forms

that revealed their military origins.

Theories loom larger in this section, especially those which address the

big questions of power and change in industrial societies. Radicals offered

theories which described a better world and the historic forces that might

make it happen; conservative theories explained why this new world might

never materialize and how it might not be any better if it did, warning of the delusions of change and the likely emergence of new elites who would display

the same traits as the old. Proponents of violence had theories about how

it could be a source of personal as well as social liberation, sweeping away

decrepit states whatever their notional strength, while advocates of nonvio-

lence spoke not only of prudence but also the advantages of the moral high

ground. Because of the fear the masses roused and the frustrations of those

who felt that the masses should be more roused than they were, there were

theories of consciousness (lots of them) bemoaning the malleability of belief, the suggestibility of crowds, the impact of propaganda, and the entrenched

paradigms and narratives of domination.

Theories charted and also exemplifi ed the processes of bureaucratization

and rationalization, offering strategies of effi cient design and implementa-

tion, explaining why even revolutionary politics required professionalization and sound organization. This became one of the touchstone issues of political life, especially on the left, for it posed sharply the issue of whether it was possible to avoid the bad habits of the powerful while staying effective. There

were regular denunciations of the party apparatchiks atop disciplined orga-

nizations from those who believed this to be denying the authenticity of the

human spirit. By and large, strong organization triumphed over the integrity

of spontaneous action. We will nonetheless conclude with the management

of presidential campaigns, in the mainstream rather than fringes of political 248

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

life, but still drawing on theories of social change and political beliefs. Not only did politics become more professional, but so did theory. Occupying an

important role in this story is the rise of the social sciences, yearning to be taken as seriously as the natural sciences, with fi ndings of universal validity untainted by partisan interests. In this section and the next, we will see social science—though never wholly value free—represented at times as a source

of public policy that, once accepted by an enlightened state, could render

politics, and therefore strategy, unnecessary.

_The Professional Revolutionaries_

We start with would-be insurrectionists developing strategies to overturn

the existing social order. This requires us to return almost to the starting

point of the last section, for the development of professional revolutionar-

ies was, along with the Napoleonic Wars, a consequence of the great French

Revolution of 1789. Though this became the inspiration and benchmark for

all revolutions that followed, it was not the result of a plot or the culmination of any deliberate strategy. It was a response to the rigidity and ineptitude of the _ancien regime_ and shaped by the Enlightenment, a revolution in ideas and modes of thought. The actual events took everyone by surprise, including

those who were propelled to its leadership. The Jacobin Club, which pro-

moted the core ideas of citizenship and the rights of man, and then the ter-

ror, was formed just after the actual revolution. Initially moderate, it became increasingly radical in its program and methods. Then the revolution turned

in on itself and fell in behind Napoleon. In both international and national

affairs the theories of power, violence, and change inspired by this period

exercised a continuing hold over revolutionary as well as military strategy.

The ruling conservative elites met at the 1815 Congress of Vienna deter-

mined to prevent further outbreaks of revolutionary fervor and battlefi eld

carnage. Some were prepared to permit greater democracy, but most were

convinced that only paternalistic monarchies could maintain order. But this

was a time of great social and economic upheaval. European societies seethed

with discontent. Peasants despaired at the disruption to their traditional patterns of life; workers began to organize, sometimes tenuously and sometimes

forcefully; the liberal middle classes railed against the barriers to their freedom, infl uence over affairs, and ability to make money; the ruling elites,

drawn from the land-owning aristocracy, fretted about their hold on power.

During the 1840s, economic recession and harvest failures combined to cre-

ate a widespread view that this was a pre-revolutionary time, that something

m a r x a n d t h e w o r k i n g c l a s s

249

was about to break. It was time for those who yearned for revolution to make plans.

This was the epoch, as Mike Rapport has noted, that introduced the “pro-

fessional revolutionary, who plotted tirelessly for the violent overthrow of the conservative order.” [^1] The professionals believed that revolutions were events that could be started deliberately and did not have to wait until unanticipated surges of popular feeling overwhelmed rotten state structures. Because

of 1789, the idea of revolution was not a fantasy. There was no need to be

cowed by claims of an established order divinely inspired and beyond human

interference. What had happened once could happen again. The revolution-

aries schemed and argued about how to turn popular demonstrations and

discontent into a proper insurrection. Animated by a sense of huge possibil-

ity, they debated strategy and on occasion tried to turn their theories into

practice.

Eventually many of these ideas became stale, as a result of both familiar-

ity and futility. They became the slogans of distinct, and often sectarian,

mass political organizations. In the fi rst decades of the nineteenth century, however, they were fresh, fl uid, and exciting, refl ecting intellectual and

political ferment. This was a time of innovation in radicalism. Political

positions described in terms of “Left” and “Right” followed the seating

arrangements in the chamber of the post-Revolution French Legislative

Assembly. “Socialism,” referring to the need to address the “social ques-

tion,” was fi rst used in 1832, and “communism,” referring to a belief in

complete equality and common ownership of land and property, entered

the lexicon in 1839.

The theorists of revolution drew on the theorists of war. They embraced

the same metaphors: they struggled, they attacked, and they fought. They

looked for the insurrectionary equivalent of the decisive battle, a moment

when it was clear who was going to come out on top. “Clausewitz’s emphasis

on decisive action and on the tactical offensive even in the strategic defensive became,” according to Neumann and von Hagen, “the stock-in-trade of revolutionary strategy.” 2 Power would have to be wrested from the ruling elites.]]

That would require defeating the organized violence of the state. Preferably

the army would capitulate in the face of just demands and the horror of being asked to fi re on their own people, but if necessary they would have to be

defeated in direct combat. Insurrections, therefore, were a form of battle and subject to similar rules. But in the face of superior fi repower, numbers were all-important to the revolution. Somehow the broad mass of ordinary people,

the poor and the dispossessed, peasants and workers, had to be mobilized

and directed. They would fi ght not only to overcome their present misery

250

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

but also for a new and better society, altogether more admirable and noble, righteous, harmonious, and prosperous.

So while the new class of professional revolutionaries might present them-

selves fi rst as militants, organizers, and commanders, they also had to make their names as thinkers, articulating the inchoate aspirations of the masses, analyzing what had gone wrong and offering a vision of how all could be put

right. The revolutionaries acquired their notoriety by the power of their ideas and their ability to spread them through newspapers, pamphlets, and books.

Not surprisingly, the reconciliation of meager means to glorious but some-

what distant ends often required considerable intellectual gymnastics and

heroics of belief. This led to rancorous disputes as to the relative merits of a range of impossible strategies. It was one thing to defi ne a good society, quite another to explain how it would be the natural outcome of a great popular

movement. It was one thing to develop an intellectually consistent narrative

to explain how the revolution could work itself through to the desired out-

come, quite another to follow its lines when the moment for revolution came.

These great dramas would allow the revolutionaries a glimpse of everything

they had been trying to achieve. The question was whether there would be

anything more than a glimpse. They were unlikely to get many opportunities

to fi nd out.

Most of these professional revolutionaries were born well after 1789, in

the fi rst decade of the nineteenth century. Almost two centuries later, many still retain their reputations as defi ning fi gures of the left. At the extreme was Louis-Auguste Blanqui, an irrepressible French activist, imprisoned

for much of his life, with a predilection for highly organized conspiracies.

Though revolution would be undertaken on behalf of the masses their actual

participation would neither be expected nor welcomed. He gave his name to

“Blanquism,” which came to refer in leftist circles to the idea that revolution was best achieved through a putsch or coup d’état. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon

was the fi rst to promote anarchy, which he defi ned in 1840 as “the absence of a master, of a sovereign.” He posed the question “What is property?” to which he famously answered “Theft.” Anarchism was later given a quite different

tinge by the Russian Mikhail Bakunin, whose revolutionary convictions and

ideas were still gestating during the 1840s. A more nationalist theme came

with the Italian Giuseppe Mazzini, working to unify his fragmented country,

which he wished to be republican and socialist. He insisted that patriotism

was not incompatible with internationalism. In Hungary, Lajos Kossuth took

a similar view as he led the struggle against Austrian domination.

And then there was Karl Marx, a man respected for his formidable intel-

lect by his fellow revolutionaries, but actively disliked, not least for the scorn m a r x a n d t h e w o r k i n g c l a s s

251

that he heaped on them. Born in 1818 in Trier in Prussia to a Jewish family converted to Christianity, Marx was supposed to become a lawyer. Instead, at

university he became attracted to philosophy, especially to the radical group known as the Young Hegelians. They took the core themes of the great philosopher, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, particularly his celebration of

reason and freedom, while rejecting his idea that history had reached a sat-

isfactory conclusion in the contemporary Prussian state. Marx’s own break

with the Young Hegelians came as he stressed the importance of looking

at the material causes of historical change. Marx moved to France in 1843,

where there was less censorship, and worked as a journalist. There he met

his lifetime collaborator, Friedrich Engels, the son of a German industrialist, who was based in Manchester, a center of the industrial revolution. Engels

had just published his own book, _The Condition of the Working Class in England_ _in 1844_ . They soon became partners. Engels provided Marx with fi nancial support but also drafts for his articles, particularly on military history and theory, in which he had considerable expertise. They established their basic

philosophy in _The German Ideology_ (written in 1845–1846, although only fi rst published in 1932), which denied the possibility of independent “morality, religion, metaphysics, all the rest of ideology and their corresponding

forms of consciousness.” Their claim was avowedly materialist. “Life,” they

insisted, “is not determined by consciousness, but consciousness by life.” 3]] In practice, as they would discover, the most perplexing problems for the revolutionary strategist could be found in the interplay between the two.

Marx’s role in the revolutionary sphere was comparable to Clausewitz’s in

the military sphere. As Clausewitz provided a theory of war, Marx provided

a theory of revolution, though not in quite so abstract a form. The actual

infl uence of Clausewitz on Marx was slight. Engels read him more carefully,

but not until the 1850s. If there was an infl uence it was because they were

all operating in the same historicist tradition. In this respect, they shared—

though not intimately—“historical and intellectual family ties.” 4]] Marx’s theory demonstrated the role of revolutions in the dynamics of historical change, a consequence of the class struggles that accompanied the changing forms of

production. While the theory gave hope to revolutionaries, it was less helpful in telling them what to do. Unlike Clausewitz, who worked out his theory

as a result of the experience of war, Marx developed his theory prior to his

experience of revolution, and then at once found its application problematic.

Nonetheless, his extraordinarily powerful theory impressed even his

opponents during his lifetime and continued to exercise a hold over the

socialist imagination. Revolutionaries of the twentieth century almost

invariably traced their strategies and political programs back to Marx. His

252

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

writings ranged from serious journalism to deep philosophy. Some important pieces were not published during his lifetime. Scholars and activists alike

have explored the meanings and implications of key passages, searching for

guidance in his commentaries on dimly remembered events and otherwise

obscure philosophers. Appropriate quotes from the master gave legitimacy to

otherwise dubious proposals, while the potential for competing claims about

what Marx “really meant” caused numerous splits among those claiming to

carry his banner. The problem with the interpretation of Clausewitz was that

he was revising his only major work when he died. The problem with the

interpretation of Marx was that he completed many works without ever sug-

gesting that he was revising anything.

_1848_

Marx dismissed all the competing radical notions of the time. Religious

imperatives, patriotic appeals, claims to civilized values and assertions of

human rights, reactionary politics, and reformist gradualism were all illu-

sions, refl ecting either the crude interests of the current ruling class or the ideological residues of those that had gone before, leading the masses to

rationalize their own enslavement. For Marx his theory was a vital weapon

in itself, a source of confi dence in the proletariat, a means of explaining to working people their potential and their destiny.

Strategy had to be grounded in class struggles. There was no point in

trying to reconcile the irreconcilables through appeals to goodwill, justice, equality, or the boundless possibilities of the human will. The revolutionary process was about taking power according to prevailing economic and social

conditions. Marx’s theory inclined toward economic determinism which

could argue for waiting for the historical process to reach its inevitable conclusion. But Marx was an activist and anything but fatalistic. At all times

his aim was to develop the power of the working class. He cast himself as a

strategist for the proletariat and viewed other classes as potential allies or opponents according to their ability to help or hinder its onward march.

On the eve of the revolutionary year of 1848, Marx, not yet 30, was assert-

ing himself as a political leader with a distinctive approach, evidently a cut above the pamphleteers of his time. His forceful writing, combining intellectual rigor with heavy sarcasm, took on acknowledged leaders of socialist

thought, especially those of the dreamier sort, and gained converts to his

more scientifi c approach. He was not, however, a natural leader. Instead, he lacked charisma and empathy, and he never gained a huge popular following.

m a r x a n d t h e w o r k i n g c l a s s

253

A lecturer more than an orator, argumentative rather than conciliatory, he preferred analysis to emotion. As so often on the left, the message of proletarian unity was combined with disdain for anything other than the course

he advocated. He had no fear of splits. Better to have revolutionary clarity

and vigor than an artifi cial accommodation with wrong-headed and muddled

notions. Neither Marx nor Engels had any aptitude for coalition building at

a personal level.

His fi rst political association was with a traditional group of the left

known as the League of the Just, which had all the clandestine affectations

of a secret society. Marx and Engels, with the help of others, turned this into a more open association known as the Communist League in 1847, opening branches in Germany, France, and Switzerland. The former slogan “All

Men are Brothers!” was replaced by “Proletarians of All Lands, United.”

The two men sought and gained a commission to provide a defi nitive com-

munist manifesto. After six intensive weeks of writing, largely by Marx, it

was fi nished in February 1848. Its famous opening statement—“A specter

is haunting Europe, the specter of communism”—was meant to be ironic.

Communism was not a specter, a ghostly apparition, but a real power and

now in the open, calling for the “forcible overthrow of all existing social

conditions.” The particular list of demands, the sort with which political

manifestos tend to be associated, was something of a rag-bag, put together

in a great hurry as the publication deadline approached. Most important was

the coherent presentation of the theory. “The history of all hitherto existing society,” the manifesto explained, “is the history of class struggles.” In the current epoch, class antagonism was being simplifi ed “into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other—bourgeoisie and

proletariat.” The unique advantages of communists was that they were the

most “advanced and resolute” with the clearest understanding of “the lines

of march, the conditions, and the ultimate general results of the proletarian movement.” This was not a strategy for a state, nation, party, or institution—

and certainly not for an individual. Rather it was for a class, defi ned in terms of the relationship to the means of production.

During 1848, revolution spread like an epidemic across Europe, with

the most important outbreaks in France, Germany, Poland, Italy, and the

Austrian Empire. Although the contagion began in Sicily, it was France that

led the way in the intensity and seriousness of its own uprising. After the fall of Napoleon, France had returned to a monarchy, supposedly constitutional.

As Charles X sought to acquire real power in 1830, he provoked a successful

popular revolt, giving further support to the view that this was the one country in Europe where taking to the streets invariably made a difference. Charles’s 254

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

replacement, Louis Philippe, however, was not much better and maintained rule by a privileged elite. The barricades went up again in 1834, providing

the backdrop for Victor Hugo’s _Les Misérables_ . This uprising was suppressed, but in February 1848, after soldiers had fi red into a crowd and the mob converged on his palace, Louis Philippe abdicated and fl ed to England. Soon a

provisional government proclaimed the Second French Republic, along with

universal male suffrage and relief for the poor.

The revolution, however, soon suffered from both economic and political

chaos as the wealthy fl ed, businesses closed down, and the members of the

new government argued with each other. The French socialists were in their

language and aspirations creatures of 1789, idealists rather than materialists, concerned with rights and justice rather than capitalism. In rural France,

Paris was seen to be selfi shly imposing new taxes to support a better city life.

Soon demands were heard for more order. Conservatives gained control of the

government and with the army began clearing out the barricades. The mid-

dle classes were content, but the working classes were left seething. By June, feeling abandoned, the workers of Paris once again put up the barricades.

The government forces were ruthless and effective. For four days the workers

fought, but in the end it was a massacre and they were defeated.

In Germany, the main arena for Marx and Engels during these heady

months, the situation was complicated by the national question. Under the

Congress of Vienna, with its stress on an orderly balances of power rather

than disruptive self-determination, there was a loose German Federation,

which brought together Austria, at its head, along with Prussia and 38

smaller states. To confuse matters further, the Hungarian territories were

part of the Austrian Empire but not the German Confederation. The whole

top-heavy arrangement, when combined with the authoritarian quality of the

individual states, was designed to cause aggravation. The cause of German

unity based on national sovereignty went hand in hand with demands for

greater democracy.

The revolutions followed a general pattern. An upsurge of broadly based

anger resulted in large demonstrations. Stones got thrown. Troops responded.

Some demonstrators died. The anger swelled and barricades went up. Where

streets were narrow and crowded, the barricades provided real barriers to state control though they were useless in wide thoroughfares and squares. Having

lost control of the populated parts of their city centers, the authorities were caught between further bloodshed and political concessions. Divided among

themselves, they made enough concessions to satisfy the crowds and then

retired to regroup. At fi rst, therefore, the revolutionaries had the “unity of

purpose, across social and political divisions” and prevailed. 5]] But insurrection m a r x a n d t h e w o r k i n g c l a s s

255

was not the end of the story. There might have been opportunities to create new state institutions, including armed forces, to protect the revolution and take it forward, but the uncertainties in the new situation instead created

tensions between radicals and moderates. The middle classes wanted reform

but were petrifi ed of revolution and persistent disorder. The left overreached itself and played to middle-class fears. There were debates about whether

demands went too far or not far enough. Meanwhile the monarchs and their

governments rediscovered their ruthlessness and organized their forces. In

often bloody battles, the radicals were defeated, their leaders were thrown

into prison or escaped into exile, and the population was cowed. In France

it was different because of the abdication of Louis Philippe. But it was the

exception that proved the rule—in revolution as in war, the quality and cohe-

sion of the contending coalitions made a critical difference.

The initial stance of Marx and Engels for Europe in general and Germany

in particular, following the logic of the recently published

_Communist_

_Manifesto_ , was that workers should support a democratic revolution in preparation for the struggle for socialism. The larger the coalition challenging

the old order the more likely it was to be successful. With universal suffrage and freedom of speech, the working classes would be better able to organize

their own revolution. At the very least, a move to the next historical stage—

even if it took time to complete—would allow the working class to grow in

numbers, consciousness, organization, and militancy. 6]] The risk was that the triumphant bourgeoisie would immediately move to suppress communist

activity. To counter this, communists had to be constantly reminding the

working class that even while working on a democratic revolution, relations

with the bourgeoisie were bound to be hostile and antagonistic. Out of this

came the idea of “permanent revolution,” suggesting that there would be no

time to relax after stage one of the democratic revolution before moving on

immediately to the proletarian stage two.

The speed of events excited them. France was the country where the

revolutionary tradition was strong and class struggles were sharp and deci-

sive. As the fi rst news came from Paris in February, Engels exclaimed: “By

this glorious revolution the French proletariat has again placed itself at the

head of the European movement. All honor to the workers of Paris!” 7]] The subsequent disappointment was followed by more excitement with news of

the June uprisings. Marx concluded that the great moment had come. “The

insurrection [is] growing into the greatest revolution that has ever taken

place,” he wrote, “into a revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoi-

sie.” 8]] Even the crushed uprising was judged to be a sort of advance. By exposing the harsh reality of class struggle, it would forge a more complete

256

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

communist consciousness. Whereas February had been the “beautiful revolution, the revolution of universal sympathy,” June was “the ugly revolu-

tion, the repulsive revolution, because reality took the place of the phrase.”

Marx was not unique among revolutionaries in assuming that failure would

make the working class more ferocious and determined rather than despair-

ing and fatalistic.

By this time Marx and Engels were in Cologne. This was an area Marx

knew, with a relatively substantial working class and an intense political

situation. He established, using a timely inheritance, a campaigning news-

paper, the _Neue Rheinische Zeitung_ (New Rhenish Newspaper), to promote the radical cause. The paper began publication on June 1 and soon gained some

six thousand subscribers. It refl ected Marx’s belief that the proletariat was too small to move alone and so must unite with the peasants and lower middle

classes (petit bourgeoisie) against the bourgeoisie. This unity was unlikely

to be achieved by urging socialism on small property holders. So weeks after

publishing the _Communist Manifesto_ , Marx and Engels made comparatively tame demands—a standard democratic program of a unifi ed republic and

universal male suffrage with some additional measures to address social

issues. The fi rst rally Marx organized was in a rural area where he brought

workers and peasants together. 9]]

At the time the main workers’ organization was the Cologne Workers

Council, with some eight thousand members. Its founder Andreas Gottschalk

concentrated on improving social and working conditions rather than wider

political action. [^10] He judged Marx too extreme in his ultimate goals yet too moderate in his method. He had little sympathy for an orderly progression

through revolutionary stages and scant interest in a democratic revolution.

Marx argued for support of democratic candidates in elections. The alterna-

tive was “to preach Communism in a small corner magazine and found a

small sect instead of a large party of action.” 11]] Gottschalk was for boycotting elections and pushing at once for socialism.

When Gottschalk was arrested in July 1848, Marx and Engels took over

the council and redirected it to support the democratic movement. This new

stance was not particularly popular, especially when coupled with a request

for dues from members. Membership declined sharply. The revolution was

turning out to be hard work. The workers were not necessarily progressive.

They might be concerned about social conditions and annoyed with big busi-

ness, but they also yearned for preindustrial days of work and had no appetite for deep class confl ict. This lack of revolutionary fervor depressed Marx. He later observed wryly that if German revolutionaries ever stormed a railway

station, they would buy a platform ticket. 12]] He hoped that the news of the m a r x a n d t h e w o r k i n g c l a s s

257

June events in Paris would galvanize the German revolution. Instead it was the counterrevolutionaries who were emboldened.

As the German governments cracked down, Marx became more radical.

From early 1849, he emphasized purely proletarian demands for a social-

ist republic. As 1850 began, he took heart from deteriorating economic

conditions. His spring 1850 essay on “Class Struggles in France” raised the

prospect of the proletariat imbued with a new revolutionary consciousness,

matured by its defeats, and ready to accelerate the historical process. The

events of the previous year meant that “different classes of French society had to count their epochs of development in weeks where they had previously

counted them in half centuries.” 13]] The revolutionary process could create its own momentum, its ferocity shattering idealistic illusions and forging

a sense of class interests and destiny in the face of the desperate measures of the ruling class. Prior to this time, Marx had backed demands for workers’

rights; now he mocked them for leaving capitalism in place.

His optimism was premature. The mood was against more uprisings and

bloodshed. Caution prevailed. The European economy recovered and the rev-

olutionary moment slipped away. Marx and Engels were left politically iso-

lated, with time to refl ect on their disappointment. Then it got even worse.

In December Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte, nephew of the Emperor, managed

to get himself elected as the fi rst president of the new republic, on a vaguely progressive platform. As president, Bonaparte worked with the conservative

assembly, but an impasse developed over his continuing interest in social

reform. In November 1851, he mounted a coup d’état and a year later he

abolished the Second Republic and established himself as emperor.

Engels remarked to Marx how Louis-Napoleon’s coup d’état was a travesty

of the Eighteenth Brumaire (the date in the French Revolutionary Calendar

when the fi rst Napoleon seized power in a coup). This was a re-enactment,

“once as grand tragedy and the second time as rotten farce.” 14]] Marx picked up on this theme in one of his most brilliant and sardonic pieces of historical writing, _The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon_ . The proletariat had allowed itself to be tempted by revolutionary activity and so ran “ahead of

itself, positing solutions which under the circumstances, degree of education and relations could not be immediately realized.” It had lost its way, abandoned by the fearful petit bourgeoisie while the peasantry was still besot-

ted with the Napoleonic legend. Only the conservatives acted on their true

interests. Prior to the uprisings, Marx and Engels had recognized the fear of disorder as the wedge that might divide the revolutionary working classes

from the rest. But having broken with old-style social democracy, Marx was

now inclined to blame the failure on the leadership of the radical movements.

258

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

“Men make their own history,” he observed in a famous passage from the _Eighteenth Brumaire_ , “but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing

already, given and transmitted from the past.” This was a profound though

simple strategic insight. Individuals worked to shape their own destinies but their choices were conditioned by the situations in which they found themselves and the way that they thought about the situation. “The tradition of

all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living.” At the moment when men started to engage in revolution, “creating something

that did not exist before,” they suffered from a failure of imagination, looking back rather than forward. They “anxiously conjure up the spirits of the past

to their service, borrowing from them names, battle slogans, and costumes

in order to present this new scene in world history in time-honored disguise

and borrowed language.” The original French Revolution appeared fi rst in

the image of the Roman Republic and then the Roman Empire, while the

Revolution of 1848 could only parody that of 1789. Somehow Marx urged

the “social revolution of the nineteenth century” to fi nd its “poetry” from the future rather than the past.

Marx himself was also guilty of this. As MacGuire notes, “it is diffi cult

to escape the all-pervading infl uence of the French Revolution of 1789 on

Marx’s thought.” [^15] It set a benchmark against which all else was judged: the drama of the storming of the Bastille, the subsequent revolutionary justice,

and the readiness to rethink everything including the calendar and forms of

greeting—to reconceive the world from the bottom up rather than the top

down. This was both the prototype and archetype for a contemporary revolu-

tion. While trying to lead Cologne workers in 1848, Marx called the Jacobin

Convention the “lighthouse of all revolutionary epochs.” During this period

he constantly referred to the _resources/books//Strategy_ A History - Lawrence Freedman and lessons of 1789, from the role of

peasants to models of leadership and the likelihood of a European War. His

strategy for the German revolution in 1848 was encapsulated by the phrase

“the French Revolution radicalized.” 16]] The _Eighteenth Brumaire_ itself depends on the comparison.

Marx was also trapped by a theoretical construct developed prior to the

revolution that turned out, at fi rst test, to be a poor guide to political practice. His theory offered a compelling narrative with which to address the

proletariat and explain its true interests and historical role, on the ascendant and destined to outlast all others, but failed when considering the proletariat of 1848, small and politically immature, one class in a wider confi guration, needing allies if it was to make any progress. There were four basic problems with his construct.

m a r x a n d t h e w o r k i n g c l a s s

259

First, class had to be more than a social or economic category but an identity willingly accepted by its members. The proletariat had to be not

just a class _in_ itself, but also a self-aware political force, a class _for_ itself.

This was the problem of consciousness. The Manifesto referred to the even-

tual “moment of enthusiasm . . . in which this class fraternizes and fuses with society.” But would this class identity develop purely as a result of shared

experiences and suffering, or depend on constant prompting by communists,

or be forged, as at times Marx seemed to think in 1848, through the actual

experience of revolution?

Second, consciousness-raising as a class required undermining the com-

peting claims of nation and religion, yet for many workers there was no inconsistency with being a socialist, a patriot, and a Christian. Some of the most important revolutionary fi gures of the time, such as Mazzini and Kossuth,

based their appeals fi rst on nationalism. The cause of Polish emancipation

from Russia was widely embraced, including by Marx. The Manifesto insisted

on “the common interests of the proletariat independently of nationalism”

but Marx was also well aware of national differences in terms of economic and political structures. Indeed he could generalize about national character in

ways that would now be considered outrageous. Engels was even more prone

to ethnic stereotypes.

Third, despite the Manifesto’s claims of a developing polarization the class

structure in 1848 was extremely complex. It contained groups who might be

historically doomed but for the moment were very much alive. They made

possible a wide range of political confi gurations and outcomes. Marx assumed that “the small manufacturers, merchants and rentiers, the handicraftsmen

and the peasants, all these classes fall into the proletariat.” [^17] But these groups did not necessarily identify with the urban working classes and had their own interests. The petit bourgeoisie were exasperating to Engels: “invariably full of bluster and loud protestations, at times even extreme as far as talking goes”

but “faint-hearted, cautious and calculating” in the face of danger and then

“aghast, alarmed and wavering” when matters became serious. 18]] The peasants were particularly hard to call. Were they as nostalgic as the aristocrats for the old feudal order that was now slipping away, or were they being radicalized

by new forms of rural ownership? The tension was evident in the Manifesto

which presented the peasantry as reactionary and obsolete but then called

for an alliance between workers and peasants in Germany. The artisans, petit

bourgeoisie, shop-keepers, and landlords were also all present in signifi cant numbers and with their own political views. Even the working classes in

1848 were a mixed grouping, far more likely to be found in small workshops

than large factories, and so viewing mechanization as part of the problem

260

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

rather than a mark of progress, as a source of further misery more than a necessary stage in economic development. After the failed revolutions Marx

blamed the degenerate lumpenproletariat for providing the militia to defeat

the June uprising (although actually the mobile guard’s social composition

was representative of the wider working class).

Fourth, the greatest confusion came from the Manifesto’s presumption

that a bourgeois revolution must precede the proletarian. This would create

the conditions for the growth of the proletariat and their consciousness of

their capacity to take control of industrial society. But that was some way

down the line. The immediate strategic implication was to urge the working

classes to back the middle classes in their revolution. For the bourgeoisie, the course was clear. They could subvert and circumvent the established order

through their entrepreneurial creativity. Eventually political affairs would

catch up and fi nd space for this dynamic class. There might be gain in this

for the proletariat in the form of greater democracy. The promise, however,

was not of opportunities for an evolutionary working-class advance but, if the theory was correct, further exploitation and immiseration. As Gottschalk put

it when accusing Marx of fi nding the misery of the workers and the hunger of the poor a matter of only “scientifi c and doctrinaire interest,” why should the

“men of the proletariat” make a revolution and spill their blood, to “escape

the hell of the Middle Ages by precipitating ourselves voluntarily into the

purgatory of decrepit capitalist rule in order to arrive at the cloudy heaven of

your Communist Credo.” 19

_The Strategy of Insurrection_

After the economic distress, so eagerly anticipated in 1849, failed to mate-

rialize, Marx and Engels judged that uprisings were unlikely to succeed so

long as the army remained loyal to the state. If one did succeed, possibly in France, then it could only survive if it triggered a response elsewhere and,

most importantly, could put together a coalition of revolutionary countries to defeat the armies of the reactionaries. As Marx settled down to study political economy, Engels concentrated on military affairs in an effort to assess the potential balance of forces between revolutionary and counterrevolutionary

countries. His approach was unsentimental and mechanical. “The more I mug

up on war, the greater my contempt for heroism—a fatuous expression, hero-

ism, and never heard on the lips of a proper soldier.” 20]] Engels doubted that a single country could reproduce Napoleon’s early successes. The modern art

of war, based on mobility and mass, was now “universally known.” Indeed

m a r x a n d t h e w o r k i n g c l a s s

261

the French were no longer the “pre-eminent bearers” of this tradition. His conclusion was not encouraging. Superiority in strategy and tactics, Engels

concluded, would not necessarily favor the revolution. A proletarian revolution would have its own military expression and give rise to new methods of warfare, refl ecting the elimination of class distinctions. But this was likely, Engels assumed, to intensify rather than diminish the mass character and mobility

of armies and was, at any rate, many years away. In the fi rst instance, when it came to defending the revolution from internal enemies, the bulk of the army

would still need to come from “the mob and the peasants.” In such a case,

the revolution would adopt the means and methods of modern warfare. And

so “the big battalions [would] win.” Marx respected Engels for his military

knowledge but was far less inclined to stress the military factor over others.

This became apparent during the American Civil War. Although both were

frustrated with the North, Marx was always more confi dent that its superior

material strength would win out in the end, while Engels worried about the

Confederacy’s superior mastery of military arts. In the summer of 1862, Engels was convinced that “it is all up,” but Marx disagreed, observing that “you let

yourself be swayed a little too much by the military aspect of things.” 21

In June 1851, Engels wrote to Joseph Weydemeyer, a former military

offi cer and close friend who later that year emigrated to the United States, explaining that he needed the “elementary knowledge . . . necessary to enable me to understand and correctly evaluate historical facts of a military nature.”

This included maps and manuals. He asked for an opinion of Clausewitz

and also of “Monsieur Jomini, of whom the French make such a fuss?” [^22] He read Clausewitz but found Jomini more reliable. In 1853, again writing to

Weydemeyer, Engels described Prussian military literature as “positively the

worst there is,” noting in particular that “despite many fi ne things, I can’t

really bring myself to like that natural genius, Clausewitz.” 23]] By 1857, he had warmed to Clausewitz despite his “strange way of philosophizing,” noting with approval Clausewitz’s suggestion that fi ghting is to war what cash

payment is to trade. 24

The interest in military matters also refl ected the split which ended the

short life of the Communist League. This came in 1850 as a result of Marx’s

doubts about the imminence of revolution. The opposition was led by August

von Willich, a former military offi cer described by Engels as a “brave, cold-

blooded, skilful soldier” though a “boring ideologist.” 25]] In London, where the émigrés now congregated, Willich was more popular among exiles, sharing

tavern life and optimistic talk of returning to liberate Germany. He presented himself as an impatient man of action compared to the elitist and patronizing “literary characters” like Marx and Engels. Whereas they seemed more

262

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

interested in reading than revolution, confi ning their work to education and propaganda, and were prepared to support a democratic push, Willich’s followers had no interest in supporting bourgeois elements to power but aimed

immediately for supreme power. Preparations for revolutionary war began,

with drills, shooting practice, and a hierarchical, military-style organization.

Marx was always hostile to the view, most associated with Blanqui, that

revolution was a matter of will and military skill as much as material con-

ditions. There was no point urging people to fi ght against hopeless odds. 26]]

“While we say to the workers, you have fi fteen or twenty of fi fty years of

civil and national wars to go through, not just to alter conditions but to alter yourselves and qualify for political power,” Marx explained to Willich, “you

on the contrary say: we must obtain power at once or we might as well lay

ourselves down to sleep.” 27]] In September 1851, Marx wrote to Engels, reporting comments by Willich’s colleague Gustav Techow on the lessons of the

events of 1849. 28]] According to Techow, revolution could not work if confi ned to a single faction or even nation. It had to become general. Barricades could only signal popular resistance and test a government. Far more important was

organization for proper war, which required a disciplined army: “This alone

makes an offensive possible and it is only in the offensive that victory lies.”

National constituent assemblies could not take responsibility because of their internal divisions, arguing about matters that could only be truly decided

after victory and foolishly expecting an army to be democratic. Enthusiastic

volunteers would stand little chance against disciplined and well-fed soldiers.

The revolutionary army would need compulsion, “Iron rigor of discipline.” In

Engels’s dismissive assessment, Techow was postponing the struggle between

different classes and perspectives until after the war. A military dictator would suppress internal politics. Yet Techow had no idea about how to recruit such a large army. [^29] A revolution in 1852 would be stuck on the defensive, confi ned to “empty proclamations” or doomed military expeditions.

In September 1952, Engels looked back to the Frankfurt-based German

National Assembly from May 1849, which—with leftists and democrats

largely in charge—had effectively challenged the three largest states of

Austria, Prussia, and Bavaria. There was a strong movement for mass action,

including insurrections in Dresden and Baden (in which Engels and Willich

participated). The National Assembly might have called upon people to take

up arms in its support. Instead it allowed the insurrections to be suppressed.

These events prompted Engels to observe:

Now, insurrection is an art quite as much as war or any other, and

subject to certain rules of proceeding, which, when neglected, will

m a r x a n d t h e w o r k i n g c l a s s

263

produce the ruin of the party neglecting them. . . . Firstly, never play with insurrection unless you are fully prepared to face the consequences of your play. Insurrection is a calculus with very indefi nite

magnitudes, the value of which may change every day; the forces

opposed to you have all the advantage of organization, discipline, and

habitual authority: unless you bring strong odds against them you are

defeated and ruined. Secondly, the insurrectionary career once entered

upon, act with the greatest determination, and on the offensive. The

defensive is the death of every armed rising; it is lost before it measures

itself with its enemies. Surprise your antagonists while their forces

are scattering, prepare new successes, however small, but daily; keep

up the moral ascendancy which the fi rst successful rising has given to

you; rally those vacillating elements to your side which always follow

the strongest impulse, and which always look out for the safer side;

force your enemies to a retreat before they can collect their strength

against you; in the words of Danton, the greatest master of revolution-

ary policy yet known, DE L’AUDACE, DE L’AUDACE, ENCORE

DE L’AUDACE! 30]]

The message was that once a revolutionary process had begun, it had to be

sustained. It needed momentum and to stay on the offensive. Hesitate and

all would be lost. The initial uprising would not be suffi cient. The fi ght

would have to be seen through to the complete defeat of the counterrevolu-

tion, which, of course, could require full-scale war with reactionary countries.

Engels accepted the full logic of the war of annihilation, should the military course be chosen.

The question this raised, however, was what to do if this course led to

certain defeat. If revolutionary strategy was a matter for cool calculation, this would argue for prudence and patience. But if revolutionary strategy was a

matter of temperament, refl ecting a deep commitment to transformational

change as a matter of urgency, restraint could feel unbearable. Either way, as we shall see in the next chapter, radical politics could be intensely frustrating, either living with injustice while waiting for a moment when change

might become possible, or else striking out against injustice even when the

cause was hopeless.

Herzen and Bakunin

_People don’t storm the Bastille because history proceeds by zigzags._

_History proceeds by zigzags because when people have had enough, they_

_storm the Bastille._

—Alexander Herzen

Alexander herzen was a rare combination of a commitment to radi-

cal change with a fear of the consequences of reckless action. He is the

hero of playwright Tom Stoppard’s remarkable trilogy, _The Coast of Utopia_ , in which Stoppard portrays the circle of mainly Russian radical émigrés who

moved in and out of Herzen’s life during the middle of the nineteenth century.

Herzen was born in 1812 in Moscow, just before Borodino. An illegitimate

child of the aristocracy, he became a brilliant writer and conversationalist, a shrewd observer of the human condition, and—while in exile—an infl uential

agitator for change in Russia. 1 Stoppard’]]s plays were held together by the interaction between the personal and public dramas of Herzen’s life, including his wife’s tempestuous affair with a German revolutionary. The intellec-

tual meat came from the constant question about how to stimulate and direct

radical political change. In Stoppard’s plays the great revolutionary fi gures of this time look forward with enthusiasm and without qualms to a coming

revolution that in reality fi lled Herzen with deep foreboding.

Stoppard draws on the philosopher Isaiah Berlin, also a fan of Herzen,

in portraying a man who “favored the individual over the collective, the

actual over the theoretical,” and could not accept that “future bliss justifi ed present sacrifi ce and bloodshed.” For Herzen, according to Stoppard, “there

was no libretto or destination, and there was always as much in front as

behind.” [^2] When a radical spoke of the “Spirit of History, the ceaseless March of Progress,” Herzen exclaimed, “A curse on your capital letters! We’re asking people to spill their blood—at least spare them the conceit that they are

acting out the biography of an abstract noun.” 3

With his liberal skepticism and general distrust of intellectuals on a mis-

sion, Stoppard did not do full justice to Herzen’s libertarian socialism. 4]] Until the emancipation of the serfs in 1861, Herzen was playing an important role

in generating pressure for change in Russia. His paper, _The Bell_ , was required reading among intellectual and elite circles in Russia. He produced this in

conjunction with his close friend, the poet Nicholas Ogarev. Many readers,

even from the elite, shared his sense of humiliation that Russia was the backward country of Europe, still mired in feudalism and unable to join in the

economic, social, and political dynamism of the time. Herzen’s method was

to expose scandals, mock censorship, and reveal abuses, concentrating on the

reasons why reform was necessary and not on how it should be achieved. He

was even prepared to invest hopes in Tsar Alexander, to whom he made direct

appeals. At fi rst this was politically astute, making it possible to condemn the government vigorously without appearing to call for revolution.

This stance led to disputes with revolutionaries who could see no rea-

son to trust the Tsar and accused him of lacking a program. He particularly

quarreled with the nihilists. This was a group described by another member

of Herzen’s circle, the novelist Ivan Turgenev, in his 1862 book _Fathers and_ _Children_ . A nihilist “does not bow down before any authority, and accepts no principles on trust, however much respect they may enjoy.” The nihilists

were resolutely materialist, refusing to believe anything that could not be

shown to be true. All abstract thought and aesthetics were decried. Their

sole interest was to create a new society. One of their intellectual leaders was Nicholas Chernyshevsky. His novel _What Is to Be Done?_ , written while in prison in 1862 and escaping the censor only by mistake, was generally given

low marks as literature. It nonetheless became a handbook for young zealots,

demonstrating how revolutionaries should steel themselves for the struggles

ahead. Whatever Herzen’s personal views, his press in London was respon-

sible for the covert publication of many of the key nihilist texts.

Stoppard staged his version of a real encounter between Herzen and

Chernyshevsky in 1859. Chernyshevsky had once been an admirer but now found

Herzen an irritating “dilettanti of revolutionary ideas.” His wealth and social position allowed him a disengaged approach to the struggle and to embrace the 266

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

delusion of reform, that authority might undermine itself. For Chernyshevsky,

“only the axe will do.” Herzen considered such arguments divisive. He could

not endorse a stance that would serve the government by driving the reformists into the arms of the conservatives. “[A] re we ridding the people of the yoke so that they can live under a dictatorship of the intellectuals?” Better to move forward by peaceful steps than have blood fl owing in the gutters. 5]]

The Tsar’s Emancipation of the Serfs of March 1861 was the turning

point. Herzen made this an occasion for a big party at his London home, but

the celebration was soon muted. Not only were the details of the declaration

a deep disappointment, revealing it to be something of a fraud, but it was

followed almost immediately by a massacre in Warsaw by Russian troops.

Herzen’s sympathy was with the peasants and the Poles, and his anger ran

deep. Having worked to hold together a reforming coalition, he could now

no longer do so. The betrayal was too great. He broke with the liberals, who

feared both restlessness at home and an uprising in Poland. He wrote in _The_ _Bell_ in November 1861 that “a moan is growing, a murmur rising—it is the fi rst roar of the ocean waves, which seethe, fraught by storms, after the terrible wearisome calm. _To the people! To the people!_ ” 6]] This may have been more exasperation than a political program, but it was interpreted as a call

to revolution. Momentarily Herzen did wonder about whether to support

revolution, but he could not bring himself to back leaders who claimed to

speak for a people they so evidently disdained. He refused to accept talk of

the backwardness of the peasants and so moved toward populism, coming to

trust more in the wisdom of ordinary people than that of the intelligentsia.

“Manna does not fall from heaven,” he observed, “it grows from the soil.”

Unable to abandon either his radical beliefs or his reluctance to back a self-appointed revolutionary elite, despised by both moderates and extremists, he

saw with great clarity and poignancy the gap between ends and means:

Like knight-errants in the stories, who have lost their way, we were

hesitating at the cross-roads. Go to the right, and you will lose your

horse, but you will be safe yourself; go to the left and your horse will

be safe but you will perish; go forward and everyone will abandon you;

go back—that was impossible. 7

_Bakunin_

In Stoppard’s trilogy, Marx made a cameo appearance as rude and boor-

ish. In a dream sequence, Marx was shown delivering choice epithets for

h e r z e n a n d b a k u n i n

267

the other leading revolutionaries of 1853 (“fl atulent bag of festering tripe,”

less use than the “boil on my arse,” “unctuous jackass,” “impudent wind-

bag”). 8 Certainly at this time Marx and Engels had become disenchanted]]

with many of their fellow revolutionaries. Late in his life Engels described

how after a failed revolution, “party groups of various shades are formed,

which accuse each other of having driven the cart into the mud, of treason and of all other possible mortal sins. . . . Naturally, disappointment follows disappointment . . . recriminations accumulate and result in general bickering.” 9]]

Looming larger in Stoppard’s account, as in Herzen’s life, was Mikhail

Bakunin, appearing as a lovable rogue, a poseur full of contradictions, always asking for money, in a fantasy world of his own yet of undoubted charisma.

Having been an insurrectionary tourist in 1848, Bakunin was imprisoned in

Russia and then sent to exile, from which he escaped. Thereafter he moved

from one promising revolutionary setting to another, elaborating a distinc-

tive anarchist doctrine as he did so. He shared much with Marx: rebels from

comfortable backgrounds, drawn to Hegelian philosophy during their forma-

tive years, engaged with the stirrings of 1848, and enthusiasts for a working class neither knew well. They both studied philosophy in Berlin in 1840 but

did not meet until 1844. Their paths crossed a number of times over the fol-

lowing years, including during the heady days of 1848. 10]] Bakunin distrusted German intellectuals and their tendency for pedantry, but not as much as

Marx distrusted Russians, which is one reason he refused to have anything to

do with Herzen.

Bakunin could be an original and penetrating theorist, but he was impa-

tient, often left work unfi nished, and was prone to contradictory statements.

When it came to political economy, he was a disciple of Marx’s. He even

contemplated (and received an advance for) a Russian translation of _Capital_ .

At times Marx appreciated Bakunin’s energy and commitment. Though

Bakunin believed that Marx had denounced him in 1853 as a Russian agent,

they patched over their differences. In the end their effective political careers concluded as they rowed furiously over the direction of the revolutionary

movement. “He called me a sentimental idealist and he was right,” acknowl-

edged Bakunin, “I called him vain, treacherous and cunning, and I too was

right.” 11

Herzen’s most quoted description of Bakunin conveys a formidable physi-

cal impression, how his “activity, his laziness, his appetite and everything

else, like his gigantic stature and everlasting sweat he was in, everything, in fact, was on a superhuman scale . . . a giant with his leonine head and tousled

mane.” 12 In a telling description of the professional revolutionary of the time,

Herzen refers to a “passion for propaganda, for agitation, for demagogy, if you 268

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

like, to incessant activity in founding and organizing plots and conspiracies and establishing relations and in ascribing immense signifi cance to them”

but also to a “readiness to risk his life, and recklessness in accepting all the consequences.” [^13] His supporters objected, both then and now, to the idea that he was borderline deranged and attributed his wild destructive urges

to his curious upbringing in an aristocratic idyll. 14]] Herzen, who liked and admired Bakunin, pointed to a different sort of tension, an intense version

of one facing all revolutionaries caught between ambitious ends and meager

means. The stage was far too small for the role Bakunin wanted to play, and

he fi lled it too easily. “His nature was a heroic one,” observed Herzen, “left out of work by the course of history.” Bakunin “incubated the germ of a

colossal activity for which there is no demand.” He admitted to “a love for

the fantastic, for unusual, unheard-of-adventures, for undertakings that open up a boundless horizon and whose end no one can foresee.” [^15] Opposing all states, and believing in the wholesome spontaneity of the unfettered masses,

he could still concoct plans for clandestine societies organized on hierarchical lines. In practice a poor conspirator, he could still imagine himself as a “secret director,” working upon the masses and then on post-revolutionary society as

an “invisible force.”

_The First International and the Paris Commune_

Neither Marx nor Bakunin was responsible for the formation of the

International Workingmen’s Association (IWA), which eventually became

known as the First International. It was set up in 1864 to encourage coop-

eration among workers’ associations with the aim of promoting “the protec-

tion, the rise, and the complete emancipation of the working class.” It was

non-sectarian and broad-based, drawing in the numerous refugees based in

London and the kaleidoscope of philosophies prevalent at the time, includ-

ing democrats and anarchists, internationalists and nationalists, idealists and materialists, moderates and extremists.

For Marx this was an opportunity to return to actual politics. He approved

of the international links and the focus on the proletariat. This created opportunities to develop a more acute class consciousness and meant that it was

worth putting to one side misgivings about the IWA’s narrow popular base

and ideologically suspect comrades. Marx soon became the International’s

wordsmith, managing to stay sensitive to its diverse currents of opinion.

He observed to Engels how he had “to phrase matters” so as to incorporate

his opinion in a form “acceptable to the present point of view of the labor

h e r z e n a n d b a k u n i n

269

movement.” It would take time “before the re-awakened movement will be in a position to use the bold language of yore.” When drafting the association’s Address to the Working Classes, he even used phrases about “duty” and

“right” or “truth, morality, and justice,” though they were “placed in such a

way that they can do little harm.” 16]] The fi nal product was therefore measured and cautious, quite different from the assertiveness of the Manifesto. His natural inclination to collectivism and centralization was toned down. Rather

than lead from the front, for the moment he was pushing from behind.

Bakunin’s years of prison and exile meant that he was unaffected by the

post-1848 gloom among émigrés, and he did not really engage with the IWA

for four years after its foundation. Over this time his position became more

explicitly anarchist. He made his entry into the association at a congress in Basel, with Marx absent. The powerful impression he created led Marx to see

him not so much as an errant comrade but as a dangerous rival. Marx had been

arguing with anarchists since the 1840s when he took on Proudhon, thereby

ensuring a rift between two wings of the same movement that was never

healed. Proudhon’s strength lay in his writings, as his strategic judgment was always problematic. He had thrown himself into the uprisings in Paris in

1848, as a writer and speaker, but also briefl y entered the National Assembly.

This unhappy experience, after which he complained about the isolation

and fear of the people that marked his fellow representatives, left him more

enthusiastic about economic than political progress. In 1852, he had decided

that Louis-Napoleon could lead France down a revolutionary road, a position

he later abandoned. Although he retained a following in France, Proudhon

drifted to the right in his views, becoming increasingly xenophobic, loathing direct action while recoiling from strikes and elections. Rather than wrestle with how to mobilize the masses to topple the state, he urged withdrawal

from organized politics of all forms to concentrate on educating people in the

ways of mutual support among free men. 17]] “The Workers, organized among themselves, without the assistance of the capitalist, and marching by Work to the conquest of the world, will at no time need a brusque uprising, but will

become all, by invading all, through the force of principle.” 18]] So he dealt with the problem of strategy by not advocating any course that needed one.

Bakunin represented a quite different strand of anarchism. He rejected all

forms of collectivism but enthusiastically embraced revolution, asserting the creativity of destruction. “Only life itself, freed from all governmental and doctrinaire fetters and given the full liberty of spontaneous action, is capable of creation.” A compelling orator, he was a much more charismatic fi gure

than Proudhon. He also had his own international network of activists. Marx

accused Bakunin of maintaining a clandestine organization independent of

270

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

the IWA. There was some truth to the charge: Bakunin was maintaining his network in order to give the movement as a whole a surreptitious push in the

preferred direction. At the same time, Marx’s campaign was tendentious and

spiteful. The net result was to fi nish off the IWA. Eventually in 1872, Marx was able to get both Bakunin expelled and the seat of the association’s general council moved to the United States, which effectively led to its demise.

Their differences were brought to a head by the Paris Commune of 1871,

a defi ning event for revolutionaries, comparable in signifi cance to 1848 and just as unsuccessful. It followed the Franco-Prussian War. As Louis-Napoleon

was defeated, radicals took over in France, declared the Third Republic, and

continued to resist. After fi ve months, Paris fell in January 1871. The drama was still not over. The city was in a fevered state. The people were well

armed and the radicals took control. Prime Minister Adolphe Thiers from

the Center-Right government fl ed to Versailles, where he regrouped with

those of his troops, police, and administrators who had not gone over to the

radicals. In Paris, a central committee arranged elections for a commune.

Sundry radicals and socialists stepped forward, some looking back to the glo-

ries of 1789 while others looked forward to the new communist utopia. Louis

Blanqui’s election as president was largely symbolic as the government had

already arrested him. The red fl ag was fl own, the old Republican Calendar

reinstated, church and state separated, and modest social reforms introduced.

Feminist and socialist ideas were actively canvassed. In the leadership, anarchists, revolutionary socialists, and sundry republicans worked reasonably

well together. It did not last. Thiers’s new army eventually found a way into the city and overwhelmed a brave but hopeless defense, conducted with little

central coordination and direction. Paris was retaken and reprisals began,

with estimates of initial executions as high as twenty thousand.

Neither Marxists nor Bakuninists played a major role in the Commune.

“They owed more to the commune than the commune owed to either of

them.” 19]] Marx’s _The Civil War in France_ claimed the Commune as a prototype for a revolutionary government, the “dictatorship of the proletariat,” a term that later acquired more sinister overtones. The Commune demonstrated

that the working class could hold power but also the diffi culty of using the established state machinery for its own purposes. The Communards had “lost

precious moments” organizing democratic elections rather than instantly fi n-

ishing off the Versailles government once and for all. This, Marx thought,

might have been achieved by conscripting the able-bodied and having a cen-

tralized command. Bakunin’s view was quite different. The whole meaning

of the Commune lay in its spontaneity and decentralization to workers’ coun-

cils. Marx’s idea of a hard state under strong central direction appalled him.

h e r z e n a n d b a k u n i n

271

He warned of the “ruling of the majority by the minority in the name of the alleged superior intelligence of the second.” In retrospect, Bakunin’s warnings about the rise of a new elite and the oppressive role of the state under socialism looked prescient. 20 They fl]] owed naturally from his conviction that the state was the root of all evil, and from his opposition to anybody setting themselves up as a power over others.

Marx denied that he considered a strong coercive state necessary for

the indefi nite future. It would eventually, as Engels put it, “wither away.”

According to the theory the emancipation of the proletariat would be the

emancipation of all humanity. As a means of class domination, the state

would become redundant. The theory offered comfort, but Marx was never

sentimental about the exercise of political power or under any illusions about how vicious class struggle could become. The bourgeoisie would not hand

over power willingly and they would fi ght to get it back if it was taken

from them. That could, and probably would, involve war with reactionary

states. So, in the short term, Marx did not doubt for one minute that the

proletariat would have to fi ght to hold on to power. This was the lesson of

the Commune. To believe that the revolution could survive without central

direction and coercive capacity was naïve. For Engels, revolution was “cer-

tainly the most authoritarian thing there is; it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifl es, bayo-

nets and cannon—authoritarian means, if such there be at all.” 21

For his part, Bakunin considered Marx naïve to believe that a state so forged would ever wither away. States could be expressions of any sectional interests and not just classes. Even well-intentioned revolutionary elites were capable of authoritarianism and deploying state power to maintain and develop their own

position. “I am not a communist,” he explained, “because communism con-

centrates and absorbs all the powers of society in the state; it necessarily ends with the concentration of property in the hands of the state.” Instead, Bakunin argued for “the abolition of the state, the radical elimination of the principle of authority and the tutelage of the state.” He sought “free association from the

bottom up, not by authority from the top down.” 22 The challenge was not to

those who wielded political power but to the very idea of political power. He acknowledged that the revolution must contend with “a military force that

now respects nothing, is armed with the most terrible weapons of destruction.”

Against such a “wild beast,” another beast was needed, also wild but more just,

“an organized uprising of the people; a social revolution which, like the mili-

tary reaction, spares nothing and stops at nothing.” 23

Though this approach “allowed power to be studied in its own right,” 24]] it assumed that revolutions could be conducted in a way that abolished political 272

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

power rather than transferred it. Power to Bakunin was an artifi cial construct, an unnecessary and therefore immoral imposition on humanity. Without

power, humanity would be in a more authentic state, with laws refl ecting

its essentially harmonious nature. Only this optimism could deny anarchy

its connotations of chaos and disorder, with less potential-fulfi lling liberation and more chronic insecurity. But if the revolution was against power how

could it succeed? Bakunin solved the problem for himself by describing a

restricted role for a professional revolutionary, though he still left himself open to charges of hypocrisy. Though objecting to power in principle, he seemed

to fancy it for himself, as he was always at the heart of these conspiracies. In 1870, for example, he contemplated the “creation of a secret organization of up to 70 members” who would aid the revolution in Russia and form the “collective dictatorship of the secret organization.” This organization would “direct the people’s revolution” through “an invisible force—recognized by no one,

imposed by no one—through which the collective dictatorship of our organi-

zation will be all the mightier, the more it remains invisible and unacknowl-

edged, the more it remains without any offi cial legality and signifi cance.”

Bakunin was, of course, operating in a milieu infested by government

agents, where survival depended on concealing intentions and networks. The

conspiracies were also largely products of Bakunin’s lively imagination. Few

of his plans came close to serious implementation. Nonetheless, Bakunin

put some effort into defi ning the special role for professional revolutionaries.

True, they must be exceptional, constituting a “sort of revolutionary general staff composed of individuals who are devoted, energetic, intelligent, and

most important, sincere and lacking ambition and vanity, capable of serv-

ing as intermediaries between the revolutionary idea and popular instinct.” [^25]

The metaphor of the general staff was revealing in itself: this was after all the strategy-making body of a conventional army. Moreover, Bakunin’s critique

of orthodox political activity always warned how “the best, the purest, the

most intelligent, the most disinterested, the most generous, will always and

certainly be corrupted by this profession [of government].” This is why he

opposed participation in elections. Good people were not enough.

The way out of the logical morass was to stress how limited a role pro-

fessional revolutionaries could play, whatever their intentions. For Marx,

revolutions were positive, constructive events, arising naturally out of shifts in underlying economic conditions. Bakunin described them as supremely

unpredictable affairs, with deep causes that could neither be manipulated nor necessarily recognized by those encouraging or opposing them. Revolutions

“make themselves, produced by the force of affairs, by the movement of the

masses—then they burst out, instigated by what often appear to be frivolous

h e r z e n a n d b a k u n i n

273

causes.” They emerged out of “historical currents which, continuously and usually slowly, fl ow underground and unseen within the popular strata,

increasingly embracing, penetrating, and undermining them until they

emerge from the ground and their turbulent waters break all barriers and

destroy everything that impedes their course.” In this respect they were not

set in motion by individuals or organizations. Instead, they “occur indepen-

dently of all volition and conspiracy and are always brought about by the

force of circumstances.” 26

It is interesting to note how close this view of history was to Tolstoy’s.

Both conveyed a sense of events emerging out of the individual responses of

many people to their circumstances in ways that could neither be predicted

nor manipulated. The infl uence was quite possible. Tolstoy’s _War and Peace_ was written during the 1860s, appearing fi rst in a serialized form and then

in its fi nal version in 1869. Both men were also infl uenced by Proudhon.

Proudhon showed Tolstoy his own new book, _War and Peace_ , when the two met in Brussels in 1861. Tolstoy borrowed the title as an act of homage. 27]] His own brand of Christian anarchism, which took inspiration from the simple

faith of the peasantry, was close to Proudhon’s vision of a new society developing from the bottom up.

Unlike Tolstoy or Proudhon, Bakunin did see even modest scope for

human agency in providing direction to revolutions. There was a role for

bringing together the popular instinct—the people were socialist without

realizing it—with revolutionary thought. If they did not, then they might be

taken in by those who sought a dictatorship, using the people as “a stepping-

stone for their own glory.” As one biographer put it, “the intellectual should play the junior role in this process, acting, at best, as helpful editor while the

writing of the script was the work of the people themselves.” 28]] This was a comforting hypothesis but as much of a fudge as Marx’s claim that the proletarian dictatorship would be no more than a transitional phase. The idea

that there were forms of authority and infl uence so pure and natural that they could be distinguished from artifi cial and oppressive forms depended on an

extremely simplistic view of power. Politicians always claimed to be no more

than servants of the people, listening as much as leading, but in practice—as Bakunin observed—things often turned out differently.

A contrast between the two approaches can be found in their responses

to the events of September 1870 as Prussia occupied France. Marx, writing

for the IWA, used contemptuous language but his analysis was tight, well

informed, and subtle, describing the maneuvers which led to the end of the

Second Empire and the German war of conquest. He wanted the German

working class, which had supported the war, to insist on an honorable peace

274

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

with France, while the French working class must escape their fascination with the past. He noted presciently that if the working classes stayed passive, “the present tremendous war will be but the harbinger of still deadlier international feuds.” The overall perspective was that of a caring spectator.

Bakunin’s _Letters to a Frenchman on the Present Crisis_ , addressed to no one in particular, was long and rambling but deeply engaged. One core theme was

that the German army could be defeated and another was that this required

an alliance between the working class and the peasants. Together, the French

people could not be conquered by any “army in the world, however powerful,

however well organized and equipped with the most extraordinary weapons.”

If the bourgeoisie had not been so pathetic, there could already have been “a formidable insurrection by guerrillas or, if necessary, by brigands” against the Germans. Much now depended on the peasants. Though they could be ignorant, egoistic, and reactionary, they retained “their native energy and simple unsophisticated folkways” and would react badly to the “ideas and propaganda which are enthusiastically accepted by the city workers.” Yet the gulf

between the two was really only a “misunderstanding.” The peasants could

be educated away from their religion, devotion to the emperor, and support

for private property if only the workers made the effort.

As the actual moment of revolution had arrived, it was too late for orga-

nization-building or the “pretentious scholastic vocabulary of doctrinaire

socialism.” Instead, this was a time to “embark on stormy revolutionary

seas, and from this very moment we must spread our principles, not with

words but with deeds, for this is the most popular, the most potent, and the

most irresistible form of propaganda.” Once stirred up the peasants could

be incited “to destroy, by direct action, every political, judicial, civil, and military institution, and to establish and organize anarchy through the whole countryside.” At such times it “is as though an electric current were galvanizing the whole society, uniting the feelings of temperamentally different

individuals into one common sentiment, forging totally different minds and

wills into one.” Alternatively it might be one of those “somber, dishearten-

ing, disastrous epochs, when everything reeks of decadence, exhaustion, and

death, presaging the exhaustion of public and private conscience. These are

the ebb tides following historic catastrophes.”

_Propaganda of the Deed_

This notion of the “propaganda of the deed” refl ected Bakunin’s growing

impatience with theory and a conviction that only dramatic action could

h e r z e n a n d b a k u n i n

275

penetrate the dim consciousness of the befuddled masses. Here the aim was to show how the peasants could be rid of their shackles. If only they could see the vulnerability of the existing order, their best instincts would kick in and the uprising would follow. Because the sort of deeds chosen by anarchists to

stir up the masses often involved assassination, Bakunin came to be viewed

as the intellectual father of radical terrorism. A key part of Marx’s indictment against Bakunin was his association with Sergei Nechayev. Bitter, ascetic,

and militant, Nechayev took nihilism to destructive extremes, claiming the

right and obligation to do anything in the name of the cause (a conclusion

he did not solely reserve for revolutionary business). On meeting Bakunin

in Switzerland in late 1868, he claimed to have escaped from prison and to

represent a Russian revolutionary committee. This led Bakunin to proclaim

him a member of the Russian Section of the World Revolutionary Alliance

(number 2771). [^29]

The next few months were disastrous for Bakunin. Later he rejected

Nechayev’s brutal philosophy. Despite allegations to the contrary, he prob-

ably did not coauthor some of Nechayev’s starker publications, which cel-

ebrated the role of “poison, the knife, the noose” and spoke of the purifying effects of “fi re and sword.” The “massacre of personages in high places,”

Nechayev claimed, would create a panic among the ruling classes. The more

the mighty were shown to be vulnerable the more others would be embold-

ened, leading eventually to a general revolution. Nechayev’s most notorious

publication was the _Catechism of a Revolutionary_ , which opened: “The revolutionary is a doomed man. He has no interests of his own, no affairs, no feel-

ings, no attachments, no belongings, not even a name. Everything in him is

absorbed by a single, exclusive interest, a single thought, a single passion; the

revolution.” 30 It was the revolution alone which distinguished between good

and evil. In the end Bakunin, beguiled by a young man whose energy and

militancy offered hope for the future, did not break with Nechayev because of his philosophy but because of an abuse of hospitality. Nechayev took off with his money, issued gruesome threats to a publisher on his behalf, attempted

to seduce Herzen’s daughter, and murdered a fellow student to protect his

own reputation.

Bakunin died in 1875, exhausted and disillusioned, his revolutionary

energy sapped and his dreams dashed. Though he left behind substantial

movements in Italy and Spain, as well as Russia, the immediate legacy lay in

the pursuit of the “propaganda of the deed.” This focus on deeds as a spur to revolt demoted words, and resulted in even less attention being paid to the

arts of persuasion. For example, the Italian Errico Malatesta, who discovered the writings of Bakunin in 1871, was explaining fi ve years later how “the

276

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

revolution consists more in deeds than in words . . . each time a spontaneous movement of the people erupts . . . It is the duty of every revolutionary socialist to declare his solidarity with the movement in the making.” Although

Malatesta later argued against anarchist terror, at the time the language was forceful. A “river of blood” separated the movement from the future as they

sought to destroy all existing institutions. 31]] Having urged an insurrectional approach on the Anarchist International, he then went off to make his propaganda through deeds, turning up in villages in Campania with an armed

band, burning tax registers, and declaring the end of the monarchy. Malatesta and his followers were soon arrested. Yet Malatesta was noted for his analytical and debating skills, evident when it came to infl uencing juries in political trials. A police informer described him as seeking to “persuade with calm,

and never with violent language.” He deliberately avoided “the pseudoscien-

tifi c phraseology, violent and paradoxical turns of phrase or verbal abuse that were the stock-in-trade of so many of his fellow anarchists and socialists.” [^32]

Thereafter he moved around Europe as well as Argentina, Egypt, and the

United States, fomenting rebellion where he could and debating the char-

acter of the good society and how to overthrow the old order without using

power or creating a new power in its place. Later in his long life he deplored indiscriminate terror, insisting that only justifi able violence would support liberation. “One thing is certain,” he wrote in 1894, “that with a number

of blows of the knife a society like bourgeois society cannot be overthrown,

being built, as it is on an enormous mass of private interests and prejudices and sustained, more than it is by force of arms, by the inertia of the masses and their habits of submission.” [^33]

The heated language of revolution, however, never encouraged a sense of

limitation when it came to force. The International Anarchist Congress, held

in London in 1881, urged exploring all means for the “annihilation of all rulers, ministers of state, nobility, the clergy, the most prominent capitalists, and other exploiters,” with special attention to be paid to the study of chemistry and the preparation of explosives. The German anarchist Johann Most argued

in the spirit of the Jacobins for the extermination of the possessing classes.

In his pamphlet entitled “The Science of Revolutionary Warfare: a manual

of instruction in the use and preparation of Nitro-Glycerine, Dynamite,

Gun Cotton, Fulminating Mercury, Bombs, Fuses, Poisons, etc, etc.,” he

wrote: “In giving dynamite to the downtrodden millions of the globe, sci-

ence has done its best work. A pound of this stuff beats a bushel of ballots

all hollow.” Assassinations became regular. Starting with Tsar Alexander II

in 1881, the assassins took out a French president, a Spanish prime minister, an Italian king, and a U.S. president (McKinley), failing with the German

h e r z e n a n d b a k u n i n

277

kaiser. The murder of Archduke Ferdinand of Austria in August 1914 provided the trigger for the First World War. An association between anarchism

and terror was established and endures to this day, despite the best efforts of its adherents to stress its gentler and more humane aspects.

The novelist Joseph Conrad wrote perceptively about the anarchists and

the circles in which they operated. In his note to _Under Western Eyes_ , he commented on how the “ferocity and imbecility” of autocratic rule provoked the

“no less imbecile and atrocious answer of a purely Utopian revolutionism

encompassing destruction by the fi rst means to hand, in the strange convic-

tion that a fundamental change of hearts must follow the downfall of any

given human institution.” 34]] His most famous characterization of the futile revolutionaries of his time was in _The Secret Agent_ , published in 1907. The most notorious character was the bomb-maker known as the Professor (in fact

a reject technician from a chemistry department) who lusted after the perfect detonator. By wiring himself up to explode, the Professor concluded that

he had rendered himself untouchable by the police. Yet behind his “sinister

loneliness” was a “haunting fear” that the people were too feeble to overthrow the established order. He was frustrated by the “resisting power of numbers,

the unattackable stolidity of a great multitude.” He bemoaned the fact that

the “social spirit of this people is wrapped up in scrupulous prejudices, and that is fatal to our work.” To break the “worship of legality,” he sought to

trigger repression.

The most sinister fi gure in the book agreed. This was not an anarchist,

but Vladimir, from an unnamed embassy clearly meant to be Russia’s. To

Vladimir, England was a weak link in the fi ght against terror. “This country,”

he complained, “is absurd with its sentimental regard for individual liberty.”

What was needed, he concluded, was a “jolly good scare” for which this was

the “psychological moment.” What would be the best sort of scare? Attempts

on monarchs or presidents were no longer so sensational while attacks on

churches, restaurants, and theaters could easily be explained away. He wanted

“an act of destructive ferocity so absurd as to be incomprehensible, inexpli-

cable, almost unthinkable; in fact, mad? Madness alone is truly terrifying.”

And so by this reasoning he identifi ed his target as “the fi rst meridian.” The hapless Adolf Verloc was told to blow up the Greenwich Observatory. The

book was based on a real incident of 1894, in which the building was not

touched but the bomber was blown to pieces. Conrad described this episode

as “a blood-stained inanity of so fatuous a kind that it was impossible to

fathom its origin by any reasonable or even unreasonable process of thought.”

In his book neither the Professor nor Vladimir are able to trigger the repression they sought and the story becomes one of individual tragedy. 35]]

278

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

Anarchism was not solely about individual terror. Notably, a genuinely popular mass movement was developed in Spain during the fi rst decades of

the twentieth century. Anarchism was a formidable presence on the Left in

Spain, more so than communism. It came in a variety of forms, including

strong syndicalist tendencies among the workforce. The Confederación

Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) was formed in 1911 and a decade later it had

over a million members. It shunned politics and committed itself to direct

action in the economic sphere, denouncing all forms of power. Politics

was never far away, however. There was suffi cient organization to have

all members agreeing that after appropriate branch discussion they were

bound by the majority view. Unsurprisingly for a movement of such a size,

it soon had an extremist wing, ready to engage in violent insurrection, and

a moderate wing, prepared to do deals with employers and the state. In the

early 1930s, the extremists, having organized themselves into an effective

Bakunin-type conspiracy within the CNT, supplanted the moderates. This

was a time of growing social unrest, and the movement began to face real

choices. The consequences of their actions were evident and not merely

theoretical.

Having abstained in the 1933 election, and let in a right-wing govern-

ment, many members voted in 1936 in support of the leftist Popular front.

Then came General Franco’s coup against the Republic. The resistance was

led by the CNT, with its members to the fore in running areas on collec-

tivist principles controlled by the Republic. The harsh realities of power

began to intrude. The fi rst choice was whether to dissolve the local gov-

ernment in Catalonia and set up what would be in effect an anarchist dic-

tatorship or work with the sort of institutions they had always denounced.

The leadership chose collaboration. As Franco’s forces gained ground, the

CNT leadership accepted the need for a united front with the socialists

and was soon requiring its members to follow a party line. On entering

government, the CNT paper observed that because anarchists were now

ministers, the state was no longer oppressive. There was conscription and

demands for strict military discipline, while the social experiments (some

of which had been successful) were halted. In practice, an army composed

of militias, each with their own political sponsor, was always likely to

lead to factional in-fi ghting. As the more disciplined force, and with the

Republic increasingly reliant upon Soviet support, communists soon dom-

inated the offi cer corps. [^36] Eventually the communists, with Soviet backing, turned on the anarchists and a civil war within the civil war began.

To anarchism’s association with terror, the experience of Spain added an

association with futility and ineffectuality.

h e r z e n a n d b a k u n i n

Anarchists might see with great clarity the temptations and perversions of power, as well as its incompatibility with their ideal society, but they

were unable to demonstrate how to function effectively without it. When

an opportunity came to exert infl uence over human affairs, they either had

to forget their past strictures against accepting positions of power or let others who were less squeamish about power take their chance. The anarchists

understood how the means employed shaped the ends achieved, but by ruling

out all effective means as potentially corrupting, they were left waiting for the people to take an initiative that they could support. There was, as Carl

Levy has noted, something paradoxical about this reluctance to take power

because the anarchists, more than most, “relied on its leaders (local, national and international) to help preserve institutional continuity.” 37]] But leaders who had to pretend that they were not leading could not provide strategic

direction. Indeed, a refusal to address directly the possibilities of power precluded the possibility of a serious strategy leaving them only the role of angry critics. The question of leadership thereafter continued to divide the Left,

with two extremes on offer. On the one hand were the purists who dared do

little more than nudge the masses in the right direction; at the other extreme were those who put themselves fi rmly in the vanguard of change and insisted

that there was no other way forward than the one which they set.

Revisionists and Vanguards

_The time of surprise attacks, of revolutions carried through by small_

_conscious minorities at the head of masses lacking consciousness is past._

—Frederic Engels, _1895_

Engels’s last published work, which appeared a few months before

his death in 1895, is sometimes known as his “testament.” That was not

how he viewed it, but it was nonetheless a refl ective piece, using the republication of Marx’s 1850 _Class Struggles in France_ to comment on the changing fortunes of the working-class movement during the second half of the

century. The political signifi cance of the piece was that it was used by the leadership of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) to justify the parliamentary strategy they had been following, with some success, and to warn

against violent revolution. Because of Engels’s singular authority, those who continued to yearn for a more militant approach to revolution found it troubling. They could argue, with some justice, that Engels had been put under

pressure by the SPD hierarchy to tone down his language because a new

antisubversion law was under consideration. Yet despite insisting that he

was not ruling out force, and that the more optimistic aspects of his analysis only truly applied to Germany, he acknowledged that his views on socialist

strategy had changed signifi cantly since 1848. Then revolution was seen as

a “great decisive battle,” that once commenced would continue, no doubt

at length and with many vicissitudes until it concluded with the “fi nal victory of the proletariat.” Almost fi fty years on, however, a street-fi ghting insurrectionary victory over a regular army could only be envisaged as a rare exception.

The infl uence of the military debates of the past decades was evident as

he tried to think of ways in which insurrectionists could operate as a successful army. The only way the balance of forces could be tilted in favor of the

revolution was by playing on the doubts of troops about the cause for which

they were fi ghting and encouraging them not to fi re on their own people. In all other circumstances, the superior equipment and discipline of the regulars would prevail. It was always likely that poorly armed demonstrators would

be outnumbered, but now army reserves could use the railways to rush to any

trouble spot. Their arms would also be far more effective. Even city planners had been working against the revolution. Cities were now “laid out in long,

straight, broad streets, tailor-made to give full effect to the new cannons and rifl es.”

It would be diffi cult for the revolution to defend a single borough, never

mind a whole town.

Concentration of the military forces at a decisive point is, of course,

out of the question here. Hence passive defense is the predominant

form of struggle; an attack will be mounted here and there, by way of

exception, in the form of occasional thrusts and assaults on the fl anks;

as a rule, however, it will be limited to the occupation of positions

abandoned by retreating troops. 1

The only value of the barricade was in its moral rather than material effect, as a means of shaking the “steadfastness” of the military. This was another reason why revolutions could not be undertaken “by small conscious minorities

at the head of masses lacking consciousness.” If the masses were not directly involved there was no chance.

By contrast, universal male suffrage had created real opportunities and

the working classes, via the SPD, had taken full advantage. If the steady rise in the party’s vote continued, “we shall grow into the decisive power in the

land, before which all other powers will have to bow, whether they like it or not.” The risk to the rise of socialism in Germany therefore would be “a clash on a grand scale with the military, a blood-letting like that of 1871 in Paris.”

To avoid that, resources should be conserved. So Engels saw it as ironic that the “revolutionaries” and “overthrowers” were thriving far better on legal

methods. It was the “parties of order” that were “perishing under the legal

conditions created by themselves.” If the movement was “not so crazy as to

282

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

let ourselves be driven to street fi ghting in order to please them,” it would be their opponents who would have to contemplate illegal action.

Engels privately was adamant that he could not advocate complete absti-

nence from force. He was annoyed at being presented as “a peaceful wor-

shipper of legality at any price.” 2 He was of the view that when socialists]]

acquired the sort of electoral strength that would justify them taking power, the government would clamp down. It might then be necessary to take to

the streets. A couple of passages in his testament, which the party hierarchy feared were too infl ammatory, referred to the need to avoid frittering away

strength in “vanguard skirmishes” but to “keep it intact until the decisive

day.” Rather than start the revolutionary process on the streets as a way of

stimulating support, his view was that it would only be taken when the

masses were fully behind the revolution, for this would be the time when the

resolve of the government troops would be at its lowest. A few years earlier he had explained that he doubted that the SPD would be allowed to take power

as a majority party. He gave ten to one odds that well before that point “our rulers” would “use violence against us, and this would shift us from the ter-

rain of majority to the terrain of revolution.” 3

_Revisionism_

Marx’s theory implied economic determinism, but as an activist he never

denied the possibility of consequential action within the political sphere.

Works such as _The Eighteenth Brumaire_ made little sense unless it was recognized that the links between class interests and political action could be diffuse and distorted, and that poor choices caused revolutionary opportunities

to be lost. Marx would not dismiss any setting, including parliamentary elec-

tions, where the cause of the working class might be promoted. His political

judgments could be quite pragmatic even while he remained dogmatic in his

underlying theory.

By insisting on the scientifi c basis of socialism, not a mere act of imagination but a causal theory, everything had to turn on how the working classes

came to understand their situation and struggle against it. The key moment

would come when the proletariat moved from being a class _in_ itself to one _for_ itself, grasping their full power and potential. One reading of Marx was that this should, somehow, happen naturally—almost spontaneously—as collective eyes were opened to the reasons for their misery and how all could be

transformed. But what role did this leave for the party? Surges of popular

anger and yearnings for a better life so often resulted in dashed hopes and

r e v i s i o n i s t s a n d v a n g u a r d s

283

more persecution and misery. Radical movements either petered out or suddenly took a turn toward respectability, becoming part of the system rather

than a means to its overthrow.

This was the curse of Marx, from which he personally suffered: a theory

of inevitable, progressive change but one that could doom the activist to

frustration. If the politics could never be right without the correct mate-

rial base, what was the revolutionary politician to do? One answer was to

wait until the conditions were right, building up strength until the moment

eventually arrived and the working class was ready. The alternative was to

fi nd a way of accelerating the pace of change, creating conditions in which

class consciousness could develop faster. The SPD as the most substantial and confi dent of all Marxist parties presented itself as having found the happy

medium. The rise in class consciousness could be measured in the growth

of party membership and steady successes in elections. There would be no

mystery about when the moment of transition to socialism would come: the

party would have majority support among the electorate. The risk was that

successes in achieving improvements in workers’ conditions would drain the

movement of its revolutionary fervor, while the party would develop a stake

in the system.

Marx and Engels had always put a far greater stress on a correct social-

ist program rather than a particular strategy. When the SPD was founded

in 1875, they were furious with their acolytes, August Bebel and Wilhelm

Liebknecht, for merging with Ferdinand Lassalle’s General German Workers’

Association, which they disapproved of as reformist and unscientifi c. Marx

accepted cooperation between the two parties but not the joint program,

which he saw as an attempt to fi nd common ground with the bourgeoisie,

as if confl ict was based on an unfortunate misunderstanding. It was vital

not to “expunge the class struggle from the movement” or even hint at the

possibility that workers were too uneducated to emancipate themselves and

could only be freed by the bourgeoisie. 4 Three years later]], Engels published a critique of the gradualist notions of the blind socialist philosopher, Eugen Dühring, who argued against the determinism of Marx and Engels and for

self-governing cooperatives. This tract, known as _Anti-Duhring_ , played a signifi cant role in transmitting Marxism in an accessible form to a new genera-

tion of socialists. It urged the working class not to settle for second-best, not to rely on philanthropy when they deserved power.

In 1891, following the repeal of an antisocialist law, the SPD adopted

the Erfurt Program, written by Karl Kautsky and Eduard Bernstein. This

still anticipated the end of capitalism but was prepared to pursue social-

ism through peaceful means. After Engels died it was Bernstein, his literary

284

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

executor, who began the process of adjusting revolutionary theory to reformist practice. He noted, contrary to Marx’s predictions, that working-class conditions were not declining but improving. In 1898, he published _Evolutionary_ _Socialism_ , which, as the title suggested, concluded that revolution was unnecessary and that combinations of cooperatives, unions, and parliamentary rep-

resentation allowed the progressive and benign transformation of society. He

contrasted an intelligent, methodical, but slow process of historical development, depending on legislative activity. While revolutionary activity offered faster progress, it was based on feeling and depended on spontaneity. For

Bernstein, “the movement [was] everything, the goal nothing.”

His erstwhile collaborator Karl Kautsky disagreed, presenting himself

as a keeper of the true faith. As the leading exponent of Marxism in the

leading party which embraced Marx, Kautsky was extraordinarily infl uential

in shaping views about scientifi c socialism. His approach was plodding and

unrefl ective, betraying no doubts about the essential correctness of Marxism and its broad application. Even after the turmoil of the Great War and the

Bolshevik Revolution, he never deviated from a set of views acquired at an

early age. The science told Kautsky that socialism would develop as capi-

talism matured and classes polarized. He argued against Bernstein that the

issue was not so much the increasing poverty of the workers but the sharpen-

ing of class antagonism. Eventually capitalism would be ripe for destruction

and the proletariat could take power. Premature action could not lead to the

destruction of capitalism. Exactly how the right moment could be properly

recognized he never quite explained, nor how the seizure of power would

actually occur. It would be a revolution, but its form was hard to judge in

advance. His hope was that the more the working class prepared during the

prerevolutionary struggles, the more likely the great event would pass peace-

fully. This left him claiming that SPD was a revolutionary party that saw no

point in actually making a revolution.

In principle this made little sense. A party preparing for a long haul of

gradual acquisition of power had educational and organizational tasks quite

different from one geared to a “once-and-for-all act of violence.” 5]] Yet in terms of political strategy it made perfect sense. As the party’s chief theoretician, Kautsky had hit upon a formula that followed Engels: dogmatic Marxism

combined with cautious politics. It kept the revolutionaries in the fold but

gave the authorities no excuse for repression. It was hard to argue with suc-

cess. From 10 percent in the 1887 Reichstag elections, the social democrats

polled almost double in 1890, getting up to over 30 percent by 1903. To

understand the maturity of the class consciousness of the proletariat, one only had to observe the SPD’s developing support. 6]]

_Rosa_

Rosa Luxemburg was a ferocious critic of the revisionists, but she was also

wary about the complete identifi cation of the worker’s cause with the party.

Though born in Russian-ruled Poland, she moved to Zurich after her radi-

cal politics got her into early trouble. There she gained a doctorate and then moved to Germany, soon establishing a reputation as brilliant but extreme

in her views. She provided a unique link between the Russian and German

parties and at different times was active in both, although that meant she

also could be an outsider in both. She described herself as “thrice stigma-

tized: as a woman, as a Jew, and as a cripple.” As an intellectual, she introduced a complex proof of why capitalism was doomed economically. Her

main impact, though, was as a theorist of socialist strategy and tactics. She was a lively writer, with a vivid turn of phrase, refl ecting her conviction that readers must be enthused and inspired and her despair at the language of

party articles: “The style is conventional, wooden, stereotypical . . .just a col-

orless, dull sound like that of a running engine.” 7

Luxemburg’s starting point was that workers would become increasingly

socialist through struggle and experience. The task for a party was to help

draw this out, but there was no need to impose the ideology from above. She

was opposed to the very idea of a centralized, bureaucratic party. The real

tactical innovations were not the organizational inventions of party leaders

but the “spontaneous product of the movement in ferment.” Where there

had been upsurges, “the initiative and conscious leadership of the Social

Democratic organizations played an insignifi cant role.” She was aware of the potentially troubling implications of Engels’s preface to _The Class Struggles_ _in France_ . This supported the legal struggle and rejected a rush to the barricades. She insisted, however, that Engels was referring to how the pro-

letariat would struggle while confi ned by the capitalist state, not to the

actual seizure of power. He had been “giving directions to the proletariat

oppressed, and not to the proletariat victorious.” When the moment came,

the proletariat would do whatever was necessary to secure the future of

socialism. Only by falling for “Blanquism,” or a coup d’état, was there a

risk of a premature seizure of power. So long as reliance was placed on the

“great conscious popular mass,” then the moment would be right for power

because, by defi nition, this could only have come about as a result of the

“decomposition of bourgeois society.” It was impossible to believe that “a

transformation as formidable as the passage from capitalist society to socialist society can be realized in one happy act.” The struggle would be a long

one, no doubt with setbacks. What she found diffi cult to imagine was how

286

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

the struggle could proceed, or the point of victory be identifi ed, without attacks on state power. [^8]

She hit upon the idea of the mass strike as the best way to avoid the pit-

falls of parliamentary reformism without risking all in a premature insurrec-

tion. Her inspiration came not from Germany but from Russia. In January

1905, there began in Russia the fi rst serious uprising in a European country since the 1871 Commune. Against the backdrop of Russia’s defeat in the

war with Japan, and with the shooting of unarmed workers marching on

the Winter Palace to deliver a petition to the Tsar as the trigger, years of

economic and political anger spilled over onto the streets. Numerous orga-

nizations, from workers’ committees to trade unions, sprang up, refl ecting

the unrest and giving it expression. Soldiers and sailors mutinied, peasants

seized land, and workers put up barricades. Luxemburg returned to Warsaw

to play her part and emerged convinced that the true revolutionary method

was the strike. This would be the spontaneous expression of an objective

revolutionary condition, a deeply radicalizing process from which appropri-

ate organizations would emerge. Class feeling would be awoken“as if by an

electric shock.” Once a real, earnest period of mass strikes began, all calculations of cost would become “merely projects for exhausting the ocean with

a tumbler.” [^9]

There was nothing particularly new in the idea of the mass strike, but

it was not normally associated with Marxists. Its potential had been dem-

onstrated by the General Strike in Britain in 1842, which involved some

half a million workers. This was a response to wage cuts during tough eco-

nomic times but then picked up on the political demands associated with the

Chartists. Even then the Chartist leadership was equivocal about the connec-

tion and in Britain, as elsewhere in Europe, strikes had come to be associated with trade unions and economic demands. Only anarchists adopted the idea

of political strikes as a refl ection of the sort of mass spontaneity celebrated by Bakunin. For that reason alone, the tactic was treated skeptically by Marxists.

In 1873, Engels had mocked the Bakuninist idea that

one fi ne morning all the workers in all the industries of a country, or

even of the whole world, stop work, thus forcing the propertied classes

either humbly to submit within four weeks at the most, or to attack

the workers, who would then have the right to defend themselves and

use this opportunity to pull down the entire old society.

According to Engels, a mass strike required a “well-formed organization of

the working class and plentiful funds.” Before that was achieved, the work-

ers would have achieved power by other means. And if they did have the

r e v i s i o n i s t s a n d v a n g u a r d s

287

organization and the funds “there would be no need to use the roundabout way of a general strike to achieve its goal.” [^10]

Luxemburg therefore needed to explain how her idea met Engels’s objec-

tions. She argued that 1905 had demonstrated something new about the

tactic and that it had nothing to do with anarchism. However, her enthusi-

asm for the idea of change coming about as a natural, organic response of the working classes to their conditions rather than as a device of party strategy was not far away from Bakunin. In her treatise, she thus went out of her

way to demonstrate her contempt for anarchism. Still, her distrust for party

bureaucrats was evident in the polemics against those who treated tactics as if a “board of directors” could decide on them for an appointed day, and against those who respected only “orderly and well-disciplined” struggles that ran

“according to plan and scheme.” In Russia in 1905 there was “no predeter-

mined plan, no organized action.” The parties were almost left behind by the

“spontaneous risings of the masses.” Here she was careful to argue that the

events were not wholly spontaneous but refl ected years of agitation by social democrats.

Nor did she agree with those, such as the German trade unions, who saw

strikes in a separate category of economic actions. The economic and political spheres could not be separated. One fed off the other. The advantage of the

mass strike was that this was where they came together. The strikes could

start with economic demands and then the combination of socialist agitation

and government responses would turn them into something more political.

Above all, they would be consciousness-raising events: “The most precious,

lasting, thing in the rapid ebb and fl ow of the wave is its mental sediment: the intellectual, cultural growth of the proletariat, which proceeds by fi ts and starts, and which offers an inviolable guarantee of their further irresistible progress in the economic as in the political struggle.” Her aim was to assert the role of the mass strike in Germany as the “fi rst natural, impulsive form of every great revolutionary struggle.” The more developed the antagonism

between capital and labor, the more effective the mass strikes. They would

not replace “brutal street fi ghts,” for at some culminating point the armed

power of the state would have to be faced. This would be no more than “a

moment in the long period of political struggle.” 11

In his memoir, Leon Trotsky described being present at an encounter

between Luxemburg and Kautsky in 1907. The two had been close friends

but since 1905 had diverged. Trotsky described Luxemburg as small and frail

but intelligent and courageous, with a “precise, intense and merciless” style.

Kautsky, by contrast, Trotsky found “charming,” but with an “angular and

dry” mind lacking in “nimbleness and psychological insight.” He was caught

288

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

up in the reality of reform: revolution was just a “misty historical prospect.”

Together they went to a demonstration, and the exchanges between the two

intensifi ed: “Kautsky wanted to remain an onlooker, whereas Rosa was anx-

ious to join the demonstration.” [^12] The antagonism between the two came out in 1910 over Luxemburg’s continued advocacy of the mass strike.

We noted in the last section the infl uential distinction, introduced by the

military historian Hans Delbrück, between a strategy of annihilation, which

demanded a decisive battle to eliminate the enemy’s army, and a strategy of

exhaustion, which drew on a range of alternative means to wear down the

enemy. These could also be understood respectively as strategies of overthrow or attrition—terms that might be more helpful in the context of political

strategy. In 1910, responding to Luxemburg, Kautsky drew explicitly on

Delbrück’s work. While overthrow depended on drawing “forces rapidly

together in order to go to meet the enemy and to deal decisive blows by

means of which the enemy is overthrown and rendered incapable of strug-

gle,” with attrition

the commander-in-chief initially avoids any decisive battle; he aims

to keep the opposing army on the move by all sorts of maneuvers,

without giving it the opportunity of raising the morale of its troops by

gaining victories; he strives to gradually wear them out by continual

exhaustion and threats and to consistently reduce their resistance and

paralyze them. 13

Kautsky was all in favor of attrition. Luxemburg’s mass strike was an attempt at overthrow, imprudent because it would provoke the state repression and

antisocialist legislation he was so anxious to avoid. What if a mass strike

was called and few turned up? All the gains from the parliamentary strategy

would be lost.

_Lenin_

Kautsky’s distinction between overthrow and attrition was also adopted by

Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, the leader of the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democrats. He was arguing about the meaning of 1905 with the opposing

Menshevik faction who had used Kautsky’s formulation. [^14] Later, Kautsky and Lenin would fall out, but for the moment Kautsky was the leader of European

socialists and Lenin had his own disagreements with Luxemburg.

Lenin’s extraordinary appetite for factional struggle refl ected his top

priority, which was to get the right form of party organization—with him

r e v i s i o n i s t s a n d v a n g u a r d s

289

in control. It was for this reason that while the 1905 revolution was getting started, he was locked in battle in a party congress in London, vying

for control of the party newspaper. His approach to all revolutionary mat-

ters betrayed a single-mindedness acquired at an early age. Lenin’s formative political experiences included his brother Aleksandr being executed for an

attempted assassination attempt against the Tsar and expulsion from uni-

versity for participation in demonstrations. In 1891, having spent two years

studying Marx, he was drawn into more active politics (as were others of his

generation) by the terrible famine that overtook the country that year, which was only aggravated by government action. He began to identify himself as a

socialist revolutionary, true to the word of Marx. He had followed the famil-

iar Russian path of imprisonment and exile, traveling around Europe, attend-

ing meetings with other revolutionaries, attempting to establish clandestine

organizations that could escape police scrutiny, and editing a revolutionary

paper ( _Iskra_ ) while in Zurich.

If Lenin had a model it was Rakhmetov, the new man of Chernyshevsky’s

novel, _What Is to Be Done_ ? He shared the ascetic lifestyle, neither smoking nor drinking, and had a total devotion to the cause, for which he was prepared to sacrifi ce all. He also borrowed Chernyshevky’s title for his fi rst major statement of strategy, published in March 1902 when he was 33. The character

he deliberately cultivated was hard, tough, disciplined, and uncompromis-

ing, prepared to break with old comrades over points of doctrine and tactics, blistering in his polemics. There was little attempt at empathy with those

of different views; he could not admit to error. Into his own _What Is to Be_ _Done?_ Lenin poured all that he had studied in theory and learned in practice.

He intended it as a landmark statement. It took broadly accepted positions

in socialist circles to ruthlessly logical conclusions. Even those who deplored revisionism recoiled at the starkness of Lenin’s message.

If moving quickly to a revolution meant accelerating the pace of histori-

cal development, in the case of Russia there was an awful lot of history to be passed through in short order. Russia was backward in its material development, straining to leave feudal times. At the same time, it was forever show-

ing symptoms of mass discontent and militancy. Lenin’s energies were geared

to making revolution. His pamphlet explained why alternative approaches

led to dead ends and why his own might succeed, but only if it was con-

ducted relentlessly by a tightly controlled and disciplined party.

For much of _What Is to Be Done?_ Lenin’s main target was “economism.”

The economists in question derided doctrinaire Marxists for fi lling workers’

heads with unrealizable demands. Better to concentrate on practical propos-

als that could show real and early results. In the context of the oppressive

290

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

conditions prevailing in Russia, economic demands were less risky than political demands, which could be left to the bourgeoisie who were still waiting for their revolution. Lenin derided this approach as “tailism,” following rather than leading the proletarian movement. He pointed to the German

SPD as demonstrating how effective organizations could encourage workers

to embrace socialism as the best explanation for their everyday struggles.

Because socialism was the best explanation it must not be diluted. The “phi-

losophy of Marxism” was “cast from a single block of steel.” It was impossible to “eliminate a single substantial premise, a single essential part, without

deviating from objective truth, without falling into the arms of bourgeois,

reactionary falsehood.” 15

As his critics pointed out, this assumed that workers could not be trusted

with their own struggle and so must be guided by those with the education

to grasp socialist theory. “Social-Democratic consciousness,” Lenin wrote,

“had to be brought to the workers from without. The history of all coun-

tries shows that the working class, exclusively by its own effort, is able to develop only trade union consciousness.” As there were only two forms of

political consciousness—bourgeois and socialist—failure to adopt one inevi-

tably meant being part of the other. Lenin did not seem, however, to have

worried about this part of the equation. He was optimistic about the natural

instincts of workers. So he was not suggesting that the efforts of a vanguard of professional revolutionaries could substitute for those of the working class.

His main concern was with the defects of Russian socialism. With its lim-

ited political development and poor organization, it was unable to give the

struggle the necessary coherence and purpose and steer it away from “bour-

geois consciousness.” This required professional revolutionaries. He was

not against a democratic party in principle, but in practice revolutionaries

were bound to act conspiratorially, otherwise they could not survive. One of

Lenin’s closest associates turned out to be a police agent.

None of this was particularly controversial among mainstream European

Marxists, other than the sharpness of his bifurcation between bourgeois and

socialist consciousness resulting in the odd conclusion that purely working-

class movements were almost bound to be bourgeois unless they were led

by professionals, versed in the theory, who were invariably from the bour-

geoisie. Nor was Lenin expecting leadership from intellectuals, a group far

too dreamy, individualistic, and impervious to party discipline for his taste.

What mattered was the party, which needed proletarian roots and support,

but which had to set the objectives and the associated strategy for the move-

ment as a whole. The anarchists had warned how the party could become an

end in itself, but the Marxists had insisted that any supreme role would be

r e v i s i o n i s t s a n d v a n g u a r d s

291

a momentary function of the exigencies of the revolutionary process rather than refl ecting the self-interest of the leadership.

Lenin insisted that the party was no more than a means to an end, yet

he lavished care and attention on matters of organization and leadership in

a quite unique way. If the revolution was to succeed, then endless disputes

about small points of theory and forms of internal democracy designed to

give everyone their say—whether or not they were truly committed to the

cause—were luxuries that could not be afforded. Essential political work

required organization, and in the face of police agents and a dispersed leadership, often in exile, this was bound to take on conspiratorial aspects. In addition, many other energetic alternatives were competing in the same political

space. The Russian Social Democratic Workers Party was in a fragile state.

Lenin’s ideas were therefore aspirational, looking forward to a party that

could serve as the instrument of a decisive leadership, sure in theory and

determined in practice.

Lenin’s capacity for organization and drive was at fi rst turned against critics within his party rather than the system he was trying to overthrow. The

Second Party Congress met in Brussels in July 1903, with Lenin’s group

associated with _Iskra_ , the party paper that he edited. The outcome was two parties rather than one, although it took another congress in 1905 for the

split to be confi rmed. The argument between Lenin’s Bolsheviks (majority)

and the Mensheviks (minority) came over control of the paper. This became

linked to claims that Lenin was determined to create an all-powerful central

committee, and was in turn connected to the question of whether member-

ship should be confi ned to those wholly committed to the party program

and prepared to work for it or opened up to those who were only prepared to

give some support. One route turned the party into a focused elite group; the other created the basis for a mass party, with some expectation of democratic control of the leadership by the party. In addition there were wider differences over strategy. The Mensheviks were inclined to ally with the liberals

and use parliamentary means. Lenin would place little reliance on parliament

and saw peasants as more natural allies.

In all these radical groups there was tendency for disagreements to be

naturally elevated to core issues of principle and theory. Lenin aggravated the situation even more. The Mensheviks (who bizarrely embraced a name that

diminished their standing) were also not particularly good at compromises,

largely as a result of inner disagreements. Their leadership was not united

and their discipline was poor. Lenin was a polarizing infl uence, making no

claim to an open mind and showing scant patience with trimmers and com-

promisers. He would rather control a small group than share power with a

292

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

larger one. He recorded an argument with a party member who deplored

“this fi erce fi ghting, this agitation one against the other, these sharp polemics, this uncomradely attitude!” Lenin retorted that this was good:

Opportunity for open fi ghting. Opinions expressed. Tendencies

revealed. Groups defi ned. Hands raised. A decision taken. A stage

passed through. Forward! That is what I like! It is something different

from the endless wearying intellectual discussions, which fi nish, not

because people have solved the problem, but simply because they have

got tired of talking. [^16]

Far from fi nding splits in the party depressing, he relished them even if they meant estrangement from old colleagues. His critics accused Lenin of being a

Blanquist, aiming to achieve power through a coup d’état. Lenin denied this.

The masses must be there but they would need direction. Revolution was

bound to be an authoritarian event, needing a coercive dictatorship inspired

by “a Jacobin mentality.”

Rosa Luxemburg was appalled at these organizational proposals, undoubt-

edly with her own experience of the German SPD bureaucracy in mind. She

saw them strengthening the forces of conservatism and undermining creativ-

ity, denying all sections of the party—and the wider movement—the ability

to use their initiative. Lenin’s “ultra-centralism” was “full of the sterile spirit of the overseer.” It was all about control, binding the movement rather than

unifying it. Yet social democracy in Russia stood “on the eve of decisive battles against Tsarism.” Surrounding the party with a “network of barbed wire,

is to render it incapable of accomplishing the tremendous task of the hour.”

The question of the moment, she argued, was “how to set in motion a large

proletarian organization. No constitutional project can claim infallibility. It must prove itself in fi re.”

_One Step Forward, Two Steps Back_

The events of 1905 could be taken as a vindication for Luxemburg. Despite

all the failures, she emerged with a vision for the future and a grand strategic project. For Lenin, by contrast, it was the start of a diffi cult period. Even as that year’s revolution got underway, the infi ghting continued through into

February 1905 at yet another congress. This time the Mensheviks got the

upper hand, largely because the party’s elder statesman, Plekhanov, swung

away from Lenin. The title of Lenin’s assessment of the congress, _One Step_ _Forward, Two Steps Back_ , conveyed his gloom at the setbacks. His opponents r e v i s i o n i s t s a n d v a n g u a r d s

293

were accused of being opportunistic. Now in charge of _Iskra_ , they countered by lambasting his intolerance and elitist centralism. Both factions claimed to be acting in the interests of the proletariat. For the Mensheviks this meant

supporting the developing workers movement; for the Bolsheviks this meant

ensuring the supremacy of a true proletarian ideology, whatever the current

beliefs expressed by actual workers.

So as the divided party leadership squabbled and exchanged polemics in

exile, a real revolutionary situation, which they were unable to lead, appeared to be developing at home. Their contribution to the events was tiny, part

of a wide range of political tendencies—including those of liberals and dis-

gruntled junior offi cers, who all sought the end of the monarchy. The focal

points were the local workers’ councils—the Soviets—that emerged in St.

Petersburg and Moscow. The Bolsheviks viewed them with suspicion but

they had to make some accommodation. Their evident limitations con-

fi rmed Lenin’s misgivings about the consequences of a lack of organization.

After the authorities broke up the Soviets, there was a desperate uprising in Moscow. In the face of the army, the inadequately armed revolutionaries were

slaughtered.

It was November before a general amnesty made it safe for Lenin to return

to Russia from Geneva. By this time the revolution had peaked. An all-Rus-

sian strike had begun in October and the Tsar had promised constitutional

changes which helped diffuse the immediate crisis, and then the authori-

ties persecuted the revolutionaries. All options seemed poor for socialists and they argued among themselves on where and how to position themselves in

the narrow political space available.

The experience clearly left Lenin unsettled. So long as there was general

sympathy for the broad political movement, there was no need to distract it

through terrorism and random violence. Once it had been defeated, he became

more militant, demanding more direct action. Like Engels after 1849, Lenin

concluded after 1905 that he must study military strategy. “Great historical

struggles can only be resolved by force and in modern struggles the organiza-

tion of force means military organization.” 17 He enthused about armed mili-]]

tants building barricades, with “a revolver, a knife, a rag soaked in kerosene for starting fi res.” He complained about his comrades having talked for six

months about bombs without a single one being manufactured. This appears

to have refl ected frustration more than strategy. He toyed with the methods

of the terrorists, including expropriation of funds from banks. This action

for action’s sake confi rmed Lenin’s reputation as a hard man, but it also made him appear reckless.

294

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

_War and Revolution_

On the eve of the Great War, the socialist parties of Europe had confi dence

in their future. In France and Germany in particular, they were becoming

formidable electoral forces. They met together in the Second International,

founded in 1889 to mark the centenary of the French Revolution, and with

anarchists safely excluded to avoid the fate of the First International. The

ideological arguments were strong, but the different factions were generally

on speaking terms (which is why Lenin’s behavior was considered so outland-

ish). Issues of revisionism and mass strikes were divisive but rarely caused

comrades to fall out completely. There was one issue, however, that was

potentially more divisive than the ideology and that was war. War involved

nationalism, which was in principle threatening to class solidarity.

While Marxists were not pacifi sts they had been assumed to be antimili-

tarist and antiwar, for war would do nothing for the working classes. They

were well aware of the great power tensions of the time and the risk that

this could turn into a major confl ict. There were earnest debates about what socialists could do to stop such a catastrophe, including use of strikes and

demonstrations. None of this got very far, in part because there was a disbe-

lief that anything so awful would ever come to pass, whatever the bellicos-

ity evident in a number of countries, and a pacifi st action could be easily

presented as unpatriotic, providing an excuse for repression and the loss of

public support. The only agreed position was that workers should hinder the

outbreak of war; but if it occurred, they should bring it to a rapid conclusion.

Here Luxemburg and Lenin came to a similar discordant view. If war came it

should be used to hasten the revolution.

As the crisis developed during July 1914, the mainstream socialist par-

ties lacked urgency. They did not appreciate how serious it was this time

compared with previous crises. There was not necessarily much the Second

International could do. Among socialists, views of war had been shaped by

—Carl Sandburg, _Chicago_

Any student of society, at least in Europe, during the last decades of

the nineteenth century was unavoidably engaged with Marx as the most

substantial as well as the most infl ammatory fi gure in the fi eld. However

doubtful one may have been of his conclusions, let alone the revolutionary

agitation undertaken in his name, the strength and range of his analysis com-

manded attention. Sociology developed as a discipline in response to Marx.

One of its founders, Émile Durkheim, planned a study of Marx, although it

was never undertaken. His motives were both intellectual and political. He

had begun to study pre-Marxian socialism, according to his colleague Marcel

Mauss, “from a purely scientifi c point of view, as a fact which the scholar

should look upon coldly, without prejudice, and without taking sides.” 1]]

While rebutting Marx, sociology also served as a source of the “general form of social consciousness of the bourgeois intelligentsia” and the “reformulation of liberal ideology.” 2 Liberalism lacked a dominant doctrinal source]]

and contained many different strands. There was nonetheless a clear political project which was to fi nd a way to avoid divisive class wars, which meant

providing a credible basis for a program of reform to be implemented by an

enlightened state. To those, particularly in the United States, who despaired of unconstrained capitalists or corrupt and manipulative party bosses as a

source of wise policy, scientifi c research offered the possibility of real progress.

In Marx’s schema, questions of power and interest were central. A more

positivist science suggested something apolitical, disinterested, and dispas-

sionate—as if investigating natural phenomena. When so much was at stake

politically, could they really follow the evidence wherever it took them and

be indifferent to the implications for the powerful and those who challenged

them? In practice, mainstream social science was not politically innocent.

Some supported conservative arguments by demonstrating the resilience of

established social structures and, in the face of democratic optimism, the persistence of hierarchy. On the whole, however, the practitioners placed them-

selves on the side of progressive forces, representing the assertion of reason in human affairs, challenging myth and superstition. A Marxist had no trouble

recognizing in such claims the ideology of a ruling group, professing a truth that happened to suit the interests of the bourgeoisie. The test of this ideology was whether it could provide a compelling account of economic and

social change, and in the process, a guide to purposive action.

_Max Weber_

Max Weber exemplifi ed both the problems and potential of social science.

Born in 1864, he was the son of a minor liberal politician with whom he

had a distant relationship. Weber’s reputation and infl uence grew after

his death from pneumonia in 1920, not least because (like Clausewitz) his

devoted widow ensured that his writings were properly organized for post-

humous publication. Her biography, published after the Second World War,

presented him as moderate liberal, representing the best of Germany that

had been suppressed by the Nazis. His views (along with his personal life)

are now acknowledged to have been much more complex, certainly liberal

(always evident in his readiness to speak up for the right of individuals to

voice their opinions) but also imperialist and committed to a strong German

state. 3

He would not naturally appear on a list of strategic theorists, yet his infl uence was considerable. First, he sought to make the case for a value-free social science. Second, in his most famous work, _The Protestant Ethic and the_ _Spirit of Capitalism_ , he offered an alternative to Marx, demonstrating the role of cultural factors in the development of capitalism. Third, he described the spread of the rationalism of science into all aspects of life, turning him into an unenthusiastic prophet of bureaucratization. Fourth, he offered a view of

politics that accepted it as part of a constant drama. Lastly, from this came a way of describing strategic choices that demanded attention to consequences

as much as a yearning for an ideal.

The _Protestant Ethic_ was notable for its concluding note of despair at the progressive “rationalism of western culture,” with its celebration of routines, the calculable, predictable and instrumental, so that nature was subordinate

to science and society to bureaucracy. The progressive complexity of organi-

zation, the specialism of knowledge, and the need for professional staffs all ensured bureaucracy’s ascent. His conclusion warned of a coming “iron cage”

in which a rational civil service administration, whose true value was only

technical, would be viewed as the “ultimate and single value in reference to

which the organization of all affairs ought to be decided.” Those who lived

in this cage would be “specialists without spirit, sensualists without heart.”

Bureaucracy was soulless and insensitive, staffed by pliant men with a nar-

row vision, competent but lacking in creativity, without any sense of a deeper purpose.

Bureaucracy played the same sort of role in Weber’s worldview as capital-

ism did in Marx’s. He understood its growing strength and irresistibility, for in his own work he sought to be a professional and competent technician, but

he was unable to cheer. And while Marx had confi dence that history would

overturn capitalism, Weber held no such hope with regard to bureaucracy.

Science had encouraged disenchantment in the loss of an unquestioning reli-

gious belief but could not offer a new enchantment. Weber valued freedom

and openness and could not object in principle to legal codes, sound admin-

istration, and responsible offi cials. Life might be drained of a deeper meaning and stuck with the mundane, but at least the system worked. Bureaucracy

was “formally the most rational known means of carrying out imperative

control over human beings. It is superior to any other form in precision, in

stability, in the stringency of its discipline, and in its reliability.” [^4] Likewise, politics was a permanent condition, unavoidable yet vexing, for nothing of

permanence could result, whether peace, justice, or redemption. The sphere

of politics was one of power and constant struggle. Power was about the abil-

ity to impose one’s will in the face of resistance, which pointed to matters

302

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

governed by force or the potential use of force. Politics was therefore bound up with the state. Politicians had to persuade others to follow, but this could no longer be done on the basis of custom and religion, and the bureaucratic

method could not in itself be a source of values. This created the challenge

of legitimacy, a test Weber posed in terms of acceptability rather than inher-

ent worth. 5 The nature of political belief was a central puzzle for W]]eber, although one he tended to address in terms of types of belief rather than their substantive content.

During and just after the Great War, Weber delivered two lectures in

Munich at the invitation of the Free Student Youth. The fi rst, in November

1917, considered “Science as a Vocation,” and the second, in January 1919,

“Politics as a Vocation.” Both are now considered landmark events in the

history of social science. Weber had personally followed each vocation (or

calling), but science most successfully. Part of his challenge was to work

out what one could do for the other. The objectivity of science and the

partisanship of politics had to be kept separate. The professor, he insisted, should not demand the right “to carry the marshal’s baton of the statesman or reformer in his knapsack.” This had an important consequence: once

values were excluded, social science could not generate a political theory on its own. Though his own views were strongly held, Weber avoiding claim-

ing that they were founded on science. 6 By the end of the war]], the strain of holding strong views while resisting the temptation to insist that they were

scientifi cally based was evident. One of the audience at the 1919 lecture

has described how “this gaunt, bearded man looked now like a prophet tor-

mented by visions of disaster, now like a medieval warrior before leaving for battle.” [^7]

For different reasons he did not make either the scientifi c or political

vocations particularly appealing. Social science came over as especially for-

bidding, 8]] combining a highly disciplined work ethic with ascetic self-denial.

As Weber stressed practical diffi culties and the need for specialist expertise, he adopted conceptual formulations that were not always accessible. While

the importance of science as a vocation came to be seen in Weber’s emphasis

on the fact/value distinction, he went beyond discussing the limits of scien-

tifi c knowledge as a source of political values to how it might “be employed to clarify the existence of facts and value in the world, and to aid thereby

the selection of the means through which values should be pursued.” [^9] In this way science could serve strategy, by identifying the means necessary to

achieve goals. Then it might be discovered that when faced with the appro-

priate means they are “such that you believe you must reject them. Then you

simply must choose between the end and the inevitable means. Does the end

b u r e a u c r a t s , d e m o c r a t s , a n d e l i t e s

303

‘justify’ the means? Or does it not?” Science could not be a source of strategy because ends had to be identifi ed by means of values which were outside its

purview, but it could be of great strategic value by explaining why certain

means might work or why certain ends were out of reach. The choice could

be between “the lesser evil or of the relatively best.” The interaction between science and values, effectively between means and ends, pointed not to their

essential harmony but to constant tension. In “numerous instances,” Weber

observed, “the attainment of ‘good’ ends is bound to the fact that one must be willing to pay the price of using morally dubious means or at least dangerous ones—and facing the possibility or even probability of evil ramifi cations.” 10]]

These dilemmas may now seem commonplace, but none before and few since

have expressed them with such clarity, such an underlying conviction that no

political system could ever resolve them defi nitively.

This theme was picked up in the second lecture. The context was even

darker. Now the war was over, but Germany was still reeling from the sur-

render to Allied armies of the previous November and subsequent revolu-

tionary and counterrevolutionary activity. While there was no doubt about

his personal vocation as a scientist, at this his period of most active engagement, he displayed no special aptitude for politics. During the war he had

worried about over-ambitious and aggressive war aims and was unhappy that

his country was fi ghting the United States. When the war historian Hans

Delbrück organized a petition, to counter one organized by more extreme

academic nationalists, Weber signed up. In 1918, he returned to Germany

from Vienna, where he had a visiting professorship, and seemed ready to take

on a leading political role. It did not happen. He was involved in the com-

mittee on the new constitution and played some part in the formation of the

new centrist German Democratic Party, but he was given no senior role in its

leadership. A biographer observed that his political understanding was not

always the best and “his tiresome tendency to get bogged down in unneces-

sary and unproductive controversies is not exactly evidence of a born politi-

cian.” 11 As an active campaigner for the party]], his tendency to lambast Left and Right alike in his speeches did not make him a natural coalition maker

just when a coalition was needed. After it became apparent in 1920 that he

was not going to be a major player, he withdrew from the party leadership,

observing: “The politician should and must make compromises. But I am a

scholar by profession . . . The scholar does not need to make compromises or

to cover folly.” 12 The political vocation was not for him.]]

Sentimentally he remained attached to the notion of a strong German

state, was hostile to pacifi sm, and was angered by the sudden surge of revo-

lutionary activity despite the involvement of a number of his friends. 13]] He 304

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

feared the demilitarization of the country, which would leave it powerless, and was annoyed at the disorder fomented by the revolutionaries. When he

spoke in Munich, it was not long after the murder of the Spartacist leaders

Luxemburg and Liebknecht, an action that he deplored though he had also

recently expressed his irritation with the two theorists (“Liebknecht belongs in the madhouse and Rosa Luxemburg in the zoo”). He had only agreed to

give the lecture because he feared that if he did not the lectern would be

taken instead by Karl Eisner, the radical head of what Weber considered to

be an incompetent Bavarian government.

This was a time when the dilemmas of political life were thrown into sharp

relief. Defeat in war and convulsive revolutions illuminated how imperfect

could be the fi t between ends and means. It led Weber to present an analysis that went to the heart of the tensions in strategic thinking, insisting on the pointlessness of lofty goals if there was no means of achieving them. He continued to stress the need to analyze means by reference to their consequences.

Weber opened his lecture with his customary refusal “to take a position

on actual problems of the day.” This was followed with compelling defi ni-

tions of politics and the state. Politics was about “the leadership, or the infl uencing of the leadership, of a political association, hence today, of a state.” As the state could not be defi ned by its ends, for there were many possibilities, it had to be defi ned by its means, “namely, the use of physical force.” By this he was not saying that force was the normal or only means available to the

state, just that it was specifi c to the state. The state was therefore defi ned as “a human community that (successfully) claims the monopoly of the legitimate

use of physical force within a given territory.” Only the state could legitimize violence. Once that monopoly was threatened (as it was both externally and

internally at that time), then the state was in trouble.

The state’s authority would come from one of three sources: tradition,

bureaucracy, or charisma. As tradition was no longer available and bureau-

cracy was too narrow, Weber looked to charisma, by which he meant a certain

quality of political leadership, the ability to gain authority through sanctity, heroism, or exemplary character. Charisma was a political quality defi ning

a leader’s separate role from a civil servant. The politician must be prepared to “take a stand, to be passionate,” while the civil servant must “execute

conscientiously the order of the superior authorities, exactly as if the order agreed with his own conviction.” The issue was how would power best be

exercised: “What kind of a man must one be if he is to be allowed to put his

hand on the wheel of history?”

The choice was between an ethic based on convictions (ultimate ends)

and one based on responsibility, between acting according to underlying

b u r e a u c r a t s , d e m o c r a t s , a n d e l i t e s

305

principle—even if this was detrimental to the cause—and acting according to the likely outcome. The lecture challenged those who refused to compromise on principle, the “intellectuals in this carnival we decorate with the

proud name of ‘revolution,’” for their empty romanticism, “devoid of all feeling of objective responsibility.” Refusing to think about outcomes gave evil

its opportunities. He scorned the revolutionaries whose actions favored the

forces of reaction and oppression yet blamed others. Pure motives were not

enough if they led to bad consequences.

Those who at that time in Germany sought “to establish absolute justice

on earth by force,” a number of whom were presumably in his student audi-

ence, should think about what this would mean. Could they be sure that

their followers shared the same agenda? Might not this really be about the

emotions of hatred, revenge, resentment, “and the need for pseudo- ethical

self-righteousness,” or else about a desire for “adventure, victory, booty,

power, and spoils”? Could such followers be kept suffi ciently rewarded and

motivated? Would doing so contradict the original motives and objectives of

the leaders? Would not this “emotional revolutionism,” therefore, eventually

give way—probably quite soon—to “the traditionalist routine of everyday

life”? If the revolutionaries really thought the problem was the stupidity and baseness of the world, how did they think they were going to eradicate it?

He challenged the pacifi sm of the Sermon on the Mount. The politician, he

insisted, must take the opposite view, for without resistance he was “respon-

sible for the evil winning out.”

So Weber was speaking up for an ethic of responsibility, which recog-

nized from the start the defi ciencies of others and evaluated actions in terms of likely consequences. Yet he also worried about a politics focused purely

on immediate effects without an underlying cause to give it meaning. His

ideal was one in which the ethic of ultimate ends and responsibility come

together in “a genuine man—a man who can have the ‘calling for politics.’ ”

Here he was looking for the charismatic fi gure, a hero as well as a leader, who would not “crumble when the world from his point of view is too stupid or

too base for what he wants to offer.” He was not optimistic: “Not summer’s

bloom lies ahead of us, but rather a polar night of icy darkness and hardness, no matter which group may triumph externally now.” He urged a politics

based on “both passion and perspective,” for “man would not have attained

the possible unless time and again he had reached out for the impossible.” [^14]

Weber’s distrust of actions based on purity of motive rather than assess-

ment of consequences refl ected confi dence in the ability to assess conse-

quences and the role of scientifi c research in facilitating such assessments.

Social action might always remain something of a gamble, but the odds

306

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

could be shortened by formulating a reasonable hypothesis on what might be expected from alternative courses of action. Without this confi dence, how was one proposed course of action to be assessed against another?

_Tolstoy_

If Weber had one fi gure in mind as representative of the ethic of ultimate

ends it was Count Leo Tolstoy. The author was addressing all the issues con-

nected with science, bureaucracy, and modernism that bothered him, but

from a completely different perspective. At one point, Weber even thought

about writing a book on Tolstoy as the great idealist of his time. Tolstoy,

Weber allowed, was at least consistent, if “nothing else,” in opposing both

war and revolution, but that left him irreconcilable not only with war but

with the world and the benefi ts of culture. [^15] The preoccupation with Tolstoy was evident when Weber took aim at Tolstoy’s antirationalist and antisci-entifi c views in “Science as a Vocation.” In “Politics as a Vocation,” Weber picked on Tolstoy’s favorite text, the Sermon on the Mount, when mocking

the ethic of love which said “Resist not him that is evil with force.”

This was Tolstoy’s creed. Through a series of spiritual crises he had come

to reject the pomp and privilege of the Orthodox Church and devise his own

unique form of Christianity. The Sermon on the Mount and the principle of

turning the other cheek was at its core. This led to a set of rules revolving around living in peace, not hating, not resisting evil, renouncing violence in all circumstances, and avoiding lust and swearing. If only these rules could

be embraced universally, there would be no more wars nor armies, nor indeed

police and courts. He challenged established ecclesiastical and secular power but was also against violent revolution as immoral and futile. He rejected the urban for the rural, and the generation of wealth for communion with nature.

We have already met Tolstoy in his role as an antistrategist. The well-

springs are the same. He was deeply skeptical about the ease with which

deliberate causes could be linked with specifi c effects and therefore disdained those who claimed this as their expertise. He despised most of all, noted

Berlin, “experts, professionals, men who claim special authority over other

men.” In _War and Peace_ , he had mocked the presumption of those who claimed that a great general’s act of will, expressed through orders delivered down the chain of command, could affect the actions of large numbers of men and so

turn history. Generals and revolutionary intellectuals could claim to be fol-

lowing a scientifi c strategy, but they were deluded because they had become

separated from and did not understand the ordinary people upon whom their

b u r e a u c r a t s , d e m o c r a t s , a n d e l i t e s

307

schemes depended. Change, for better or worse, was the result of countless decisions of individuals caught up in events. Unfortunately, ordinary people

were ignorant and uneducated, connected perhaps through their common

feelings and values but unable to make suffi cient sense of their plight or come together to create a new world.

Tolstoy might be of the Enlightenment when it came to his search for

truth and an intense, gnawing belief that with a determined enough search

it could be found, but he was also of the counter-Enlightenment in so many

key respects, horrifi ed by modernization and an exaggerated confi dence in

science, by efforts at political reform that lost sight of what he saw to be the fundamentals of the good life. He could not be “fi tted into the public movements of his own, or indeed any other, age. The only company to which he

belongs is the subversive one of questioners to whom no answer has been, nor

is likely to be given.” [^16] Gallie observed, with understatement, that organized action was not Tolstoy’s “forte” and that he was “distressingly weak on the

practical side.” 17 Even his own family was far from convinced about his new]]

way of life. 18 What he offered, and in his case this was not trivial, was the

power of example and many books and articles.

His uncompromising pacifi sm, challenge to tsarism, and exposés of the

sufferings of the poor meant that his core messages were received loud and

clear, and his effectiveness as a propagandist for his own views was enhanced by not only the way he lived but his literary gifts. His polemics included

vivid descriptions of the struggles for existence in the city slums, the routine cruelties of army life, and the aristocracy’s capacity for self-deception. His analyses of the iniquities of militarism and myopic patriotism were laced

with sardonic wit and at times prophetic insight. He described the war fever

of the future, as priests “pray on behalf of murder” and newspaper editors

“set to work to arouse hatred and murder,” and described how thousands of

“simple, kindly folk” will be “torn from peaceful toil” and trudge off to war, until these poor souls “without knowing why, will murder thousands of others whom they had never before seen, and who had done nor could do them

any wrong.” 19 In this respect, war for T]]olstoy was an extreme version of a much more general malaise, of unnatural divisions within humanity, which

it both refl ected and aggravated. And to explain how men could allow this

to happen to them he deployed his own version of false consciousness—men

had been “hypnotized” not only by their governments but, most tragically of

all, by each other. Only by exposing the myth of patriotism could the spell

be broken. At the heart of his antistrategic vision was the belief that divisions within human society were unnatural, and so if they were healed there would

be no need for struggle and confl ict.

308

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

In 1882, Tolstoy participated in the census of Moscow. He wrote an article that year, asking the “What Is to Be Done?” question that Russians often

seemed to ask themselves at this time. [^20] Moscow had experienced a period of fast growth, swelled by immigration from the countryside, with all the associated problems of overcrowding, poverty, crime, disease, and exploitation.

The census, he explained, was a “sociological investigation.” He added that,

uniquely for a science, sociology’s object was the “happiness of the people.” 21]]

Unfortunately, despite this objective, whatever “laws” might be elucidated by gathering information, and whatever long-term benefi ts came through following these laws, little would happen of immediate benefi t to the poor people

whose lives were being reported. A compelling description of a wretched state of affairs could be an essential fi rst step to action: “All the wounds of society, the wounds of poverty, of vice, of ignorance—all will be laid bare.” But it

was not enough. When encountering someone hungry and in rags, insisted

Tolstoy, it was “more moment to succor him than to make all possible inves-

tigations.” Instead of scientifi c detachment and a hurried moving on from one sad case to another, he urged forming relations with the poor and needy.

The true aim should be to break down “the barriers which men have

erected between themselves.” 22]] This meant rejecting charity, which did no more than assuage the guilty consciences of the elite while reinforcing divisions. All should work together to heal the wounds of society. His call was to community and fraternity, which required like-minded people to reach out

to the poor and oppressed. The benefi ts would be both material and spiritual.

The alternative he warned was class warfare: “It need not be thus, and it

should not, for this is contrary to our reason and our heart, and it cannot be if we are living people.”

Unfortunately, as he soon discovered, where he led few followed.

Furthermore, as he explored the under-life of the city, the more he concluded that have-nots were as corrupted by city life as the haves. The issue was not just the scale of the problem but the sort of society Moscow had become. He

still could fi nd some nobility among the poor, but when it came to drink-

ers and prostitutes he could make as much sense of them as they could of

him. This was an alien culture, resistant to his overtures, surviving in ways that he found disagreeable. The more he explored city life the more his previous hopes appeared naïve. Eventually one night he stopped researching.

He felt foolish and impracticable, like a physician who has uncovered the

sore of a sick man but must recognize that “his remedy is good for noth-

ing.” He stopped taking notes. “I asked no questions, knowing that nothing

would come of this.” 23]] The answer to “What Is to Be Done?” appeared to be

“Nothing.”

b u r e a u c r a t s , d e m o c r a t s , a n d e l i t e s

309

While he still blamed the excesses of his class for social divisions, he now saw urban life as the problem. Cities were venal and corrupt places,

beyond reform. The cause went even deeper—the fault lay in the whole

path humankind had taken in pursuit of economic development. Money

had been allowed to get in the way of proper human relations. They could

only be restored on the land where money could be irrelevant and people

need not be alienated from each other and the beauty of nature. He set an

example, returning to his estate in Yasnaya Polyana where he sought to cre-

ate his own rural utopia, with but one garment, no money, and fulfi llment

through manual labor. With this complete retreat from modernity, Tolstoy

insisted that he was living the only life that could be true to his faith. His stance was passive and uncooperative, but there was no direct action, for

that would have involved both a degree of organization and a presumption

of human agency.

“The Anarchists are right in everything,” he wrote in 1890, “in the

negation of the existing order, and in the assertion that, without Authority, there could not be worse violence than that of Authority under existing

conditions.” Their one mistake, he continued, was to think that this could

come about through a revolution. It would only come about by there being

“more and more people who do not require the protection of governmen-

tal power . . . There can be only one permanent revolution—a moral one: the

regeneration of the inner man.” 24

_Jane Addams_

In May 1896, Tolstoy received a visitor at Yasnaya Polyana: Miss Jane

Addams of Chicago. The daughter of a wealthy Illinois farmer, Addams

was then in her mid-30s, and on her way to becoming one of the most

admired and infl uential women in America. Her fame rested on the Hull

House Settlement, founded in Chicago in 1889. This was modeled on the

Toynbee Settlement in the East End of London, which she had visited a

few years earlier. The underlying concept was that the educated and privi-

leged should settle among the poor and deprived to the benefi t of both. At

Hull House, which at its peak was composed of thirteen buildings, could be

found shelter, facilities for bathing, and a playground. In addition to opportunities to learn about and enjoy the so-called high culture of art, literature, and music, there were guest speakers and opportunities for debate, research,

and campaigning.

310

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

Addams had read many of Tolstoy’s books. She described _What to Do?_ , published in the United States in 1887, as the source of her view that “only

he who literally shares his own shelter and food with the poor, can claim to

have served them.” 25 The infl]] uence was evident, to the point of the great man being depicted in a mural in the Hull House dining room. As a strong

pacifi st and Christian with doubts about organized religion, she also explicitly embraced Tolstoy’s commitment not to resist evil. She declared herself

“philosophically convinced of the futility of opposition, who believe that evil can only be overcome with good and cannot be opposed.” Poverty, disease,

and exploitation were a challenge for society as a whole and must be resolved through forms of reconciliation before they led to confl icts that could tear society apart. She described the Gospel as “an outward symbol of fellowship,

some bond of peace, some blessed spot where the unity of the spirit might

claim right of way over all differences.” [^26]

Nonetheless, her encounter with Tolstoy was disappointing. He paid lit-

tle attention to her description of Hull House while “glancing distrustfully

at the sleeves of my travelling gown.” The amount of cloth this involved, he

declared, was suffi cient to clothe many young girls. Was this not a “barrier to the people”? And, when discovering that she had a farm in Illinois, was

she not an “absentee landlord”? He suggested she would do more use “tilling

her own soil” than by adding to the crowded city. The charges were unjust,

but bothered her suffi ciently to determine to spend two hours each day at the bakery on her return to Chicago. She tried but failed. This was not the best

use of her time. [^27] This small incident revealed why she could not be a true follower of Tolstoy.

Tolstoy found the division of labor a crime against nature; Addams

accepted that it was unavoidable. Her whole project was about getting peo-

ple to accept the logic of inter-dependence. Whereas Tolstoy gave up on

the city because it forced divisions among humanity, Addams believed that

the city could and must be made to work for all its inhabitants. The fun-

damental point of principle Addams, and other progressives, shared with

Tolstoy was a belief that social divisions were unnatural and could and must

be transcended. But whereas Tolstoy believed in a world in which men, the

land, and the spirit joined in unity, Addams sought to create a world without struggle in one of the least likely cities of the world, Chicago.

Chicago was then the world’s fi fth largest—after London, New York,

Paris, and Berlin. It had taken shape far more recently than the others. The

combined effects of the railroads, the city’s position as the commercial and

business center of the Midwest, and massive immigration had resulted in

b u r e a u c r a t s , d e m o c r a t s , a n d e l i t e s

311

the population doubling from fi ve hundred thousand in 1880 to over a million in 1890, and to double again to well over two million by 1910. Some

60 percent of the population had been born abroad, and all but 20 percent

were of recent immigrant stock. Germans, Poles, Russians, Italians, and

Irish all formed distinctive and self-conscious communities, often in uneasy

relationships with each other. After a great fi re in 1871 destroyed the old

wooden buildings, the city was largely rebuilt in stone and steel. 28]] Chicago invented the skyscraper. Money went into the arts, parks, and a brand new

university, paid for by John D. Rockefeller. Life in the city was tough and

conditions were dire. The “fi rst in violence,” wrote radical journalist Lincoln Steffens in 1904, “deepest in dirt; loud, lawless, unlovely, ill-smelling, new; an overgrown gawk of a village, the teeming tough among cities. Criminally

it was wide open; commercially it was brazen; and socially it was thoughtless and raw.” [^29] For his novel _The Jungle_ , Upton Sinclair went undercover in the stockyards to expose the awful circumstances of immigrant workers in the

meatpacking industry.

Max Weber visited Chicago in the fall of 1904 en route to a major scien-

tifi c congress in St. Louis. He described it, in a striking metaphor, as being

“like a human being with its skin peeled off and whose intestines are seen at

work.” 30 He toured the stockyards, watching the automated process whereby

an “unsuspecting bovine” entered the slaughtering area, was hit by a hammer

and collapsed, gripped by an iron clamp, hoisted up and started on a journey

which saw workers “eviscerate and skin it.” It was possible, he observed, to

“follow a pig from the sty to the sausage and the can.” At the time of his

visit the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workman’s Union were

smarting after a defeat in a strike aimed at getting the stockyards union-

ized. Weber, apparently with a degree of exaggeration, described the after-

math: “Masses of Italians and Negroes as strike-breakers; daily shootings

with dozens of dead on both sides; a streetcar was overturned and a dozen

women were squashed because a non-union man had sat in it; dynamite

threats against the Elevated Railway, and one of its cars was actually derailed and plunged into the river.” 31 He also visited the Hull House Settlement,]]

about which his wife Marianne wrote in glowing terms: “It includes a day

nursery, accommodations for 30 women workers, a sports facility for young

people, a large concert hall with a stage, an instructional kitchen, a kinder-garten, rooms for all kinds of instruction in needlework and manual tasks,

etc. During the winter 15,000 people of both sexes come here to receive

instruction, inspiration, counsel, and enjoy themselves.” 32

Addams had inserted herself and Hull House into a maelstrom of urban

divisions, a result of the persistent issue of race and the treatment of blacks, 312

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

agrarian decline and urban rise, inter-ethnic tensions, and constant clashes between capital and labor. She attached herself to Progressivism, the major

liberal project in the United States at the time. The Progressives saw the

social problems of the time as the core challenge for government and feared

that without urgent action they would lead to fractures that would be impos-

sible to heal. Government must be a unifying force, above sectional interests, on behalf of society as a whole. In this Addams was a democratic optimist,

convinced of the capacity of ordinary people to play constructive roles in civic affairs, with their own ideas on how to bring order and decency into their

lives. She contrasted this to what she considered the naïve view, attributed

to the English Fabians, “that somewhere in Church or State are a body of

authoritative people who will put things to rights as soon as they really know

what is wrong.” 33 By making great art and big ideas available to ordinary

people, she believed that they would be better able to develop themselves and make informed choices in their lives.

As a formidable social and political critic, she castigated the failure of

the city government to clean the streets, educate the children, and regulate

the workplace. She was a feminist, believed in racial equality, and backed

labor unions. Yet her deepest conviction was that no confl ict need be pur-

sued to the point of violence and that ways could be found to reconcile the

apparently irreconcilable. While she associated with socialists, she rejected economic determinism, class consciousness, and all preparations for a violent confrontation. While supporting unions, she wished they would make more

of an effort to reach out to those they saw as their enemies. Hull House, she insisted, was “soberly opened on the theory that the dependence of classes on

each other is reciprocal.” 34]] She understood why people were driven to extreme ends, but could not approve. She was at the same time appalled by a city

apparently out of control, failing to ensure a decent way of life for its inhabitants, and desperate for an alternative to class warfare as a source of change.

Somehow she wanted to get all the sections of the community, capitalist and

worker, conservative and agitator, meeting under one roof. Then they would

see through their differences to let the bemused immigrant, coping daily

with the unscrupulous and exploitative, meet a “better type of American.” 35

Her philosophy was set out in an essay prompted by a bitter dispute in

Chicago involving the Pullman Company. The origins of this dispute did

not lie simply in crude business practices but Pullman’s paternalism in pro-

viding their workers with their own township. A recession led to cuts in

workers’ wages but not the rents for their homes. The workers’ reaction was

intense, leading to a dispute that lasted for months, considerable violence

(thirteen deaths), and martial law. In her essay, Addams likened the confl ict b u r e a u c r a t s , d e m o c r a t s , a n d e l i t e s

313

to that between King Lear and his daughter Cordelia, a confl ict that both lost because of their failure to appreciate the other’s position. [^36] “We are all practically agreed that the social passion of the age is directed toward the

emancipation of the wage-worker,” she wrote:

But just as Cordelia failed to include her father in the scope of her

salvation and selfi shly took it for herself alone, so workingmen in the

dawn of the vision are inclined to claim it for themselves, putting out

of their thoughts the old relationships; and just as surely as Cordelia’s

conscience developed in the new life and later drove her back to her

father, where she perished, drawn into the cruelty and wrath which

had now become objective and tragic, so the emancipation of working

people will have to be inclusive of the employer from the fi rst or it will

encounter many failures, cruelties and reactions. 37

Addams recognized the existence of confl icts, acknowledged that they were

not wholly artifi cial, and accepted that groups might frustrate and irritate each other. But she also believed that it must be possible to prevent these

confl icts from descending into violence. The problem, as Elshtain observed,

was that she was committed to a “best-case scenario of the cosmopolitan

future,” which played down the pugnacity of the various ethnic groups. Her

own ability to navigate the complex ethnic politics of Chicago and identify

shared interests turned this into her core mission. She saw suffi cient exam-

ples of people putting aside their prejudices and traditional antagonisms

as a result of the exigencies of the daily struggle for survival to make her

optimistic about what could be achieved with any confl ict, including one

between states. Given the chance to express itself, the inherent goodness of

people could overcome difference and even render war irrelevant. Presenting

herself as “spokesperson for all peace loving women of the world,” she risked her popularity by opposing the U.S. entry into war in 1917. After the war,

she devoted her energies to promoting peace, to the point of winning the

Nobel Prize in 1931. She assumed that “the reconciliations resulting from

the imperatives of city life could be replicated at an international level” and was convinced that “any concern for defense and security was tantamount to

accepting militarism and authoritarianism.” 38

_John Dewey_

Addams shared Tolstoy’s wariness about detached academic research that

did little for the subjects. Nonetheless, largely at the instigation of Florence 314

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

Kelley, who had a doctorate from Zurich and past dealings with Engels, Hull House was the center of a series of studies of the neighborhood, providing a

compelling description of urban life at the turn of the century. It refl ected progressive optimism that if the facts could be made known about social

conditions, then measures might be taken to address them. [^39]

At the University of Chicago, the idea that social research and action

should go together was taken as almost a given. Albion Small was the found-

ing head of the university’s sociology department, the fi rst in the United

States, and until the start of the Second World War, the discipline’s American

“capital.” [^40] Small was an ordained minister who saw little incompatibility between his Christianity and social inquiry, and promoted sociology as chart-ing a way forward between the forces of reaction and revolution. It was a tool for democratic change: “Conventionality is the thesis, Socialism the antith-esis, Sociology is the synthesis.” [^41] In an article tellingly entitled “Scholarship and Social Agitation,” he provided a robust defense of the progressive creed.

American scholars, he wrote, should “advance from knowledge of facts to

knowledge of forces, and from knowledge of forces to control of forces in the interest of more complete social and personal life.” He lacked either sympathy with or confi dence in any conception of sociology, “which is satisfi ed with abstractions, or which does not keep well in mind the relation of all research to the living interests of living men.” For these purposes, Chicago provided

an exceptional base. It was a “vast sociological laboratory.” 42]]

This experimental aspect excited John Dewey, who joined the University

of Chicago in 1894 with an established reputation in psychology and phi-

losophy. By the time he arrived he was moving into more radical political and intellectual positions, encouraged by his wife Alice. The university itself was not a comfortable place for radicals. Men had been fi red for giving too vocal support for labor. But Dewey also saw Chicago as “fi lled with problems holding out their hands and asking somebody to please solve them.” He found

his outlet at Hull House, where he became a friend of Addams and lectured

regularly. His arrival coincided with the Pullman strike. Although at fi rst all his sympathies had been with the unions, Addams persuaded him of the need

to promote reconciliation rather than struggle. This view was reinforced by

the costs of the union’s failure. His distinctive brand of liberalism refl ected an interest in the health of the social organism, which could be damaged

by unnecessary divisions, rather than in the more classical liberal concerns

with individual rights. But he also felt a fi rm conviction that this could be achieved through democracy, which he later claimed to be the one constant

in his long life. 43]] He shared this particular form of democratic optimism with Addams. It was refl ected in an educational philosophy focused on creating

b u r e a u c r a t s , d e m o c r a t s , a n d e l i t e s

315

conditions in which all could realize their potential by learning how to think about the self as part of society, which in turn would encourage compromise

and accommodation. His view was that all those affected by institutions,

from schools to the workplace, should have a role in their decision-making.

He advocated participatory democracy, a source of both better government

and an improving and civilizing experience. Unlike Addams, he was not a

pacifi st and did support America’s entry into the First World War, although

he took an ardent antiwar stance thereafter. 44]]

What he sought from philosophy was not a “device for dealing with the

problems of philosophers” but instead “a method, cultivated, by philoso-

phers, for dealing with the problems of men.” 45]] It was to offer a challenge to conservatism and an alternative to revolution. The radicals and conservatives needed to be brought together. The radicals would provide the “future vision

and the stimulus to act,” but “without the wisdom of past experience,” they

would be “wanton and disorganized,” following only “the random and con-

fused excitation of the hour.”

This created a special role for the social reformer. As “psychologist, social worker, and educator,” this person had to “interpret opposing sides to each

other, simultaneously reconciling social antagonists and completing the

incomplete personalities of individuals involved.” 46]] A view of society as an organic whole challenged laissez-faire economics based on assumptions of

autonomous individuals. Lazy Darwinian talk about the survival of the fi t-

test, which taken too literally was a recipe for violence, had to be replaced by the imperatives of social solidarity. If there was an evolutionary process at work it was the gradual acceptance that the rational way forward would be

based on cooperation and reciprocity rather than individual gain. 47]] This was a philosophy for the non-strategist, whose aim was to overcome confl icts rather than conduct them effectively. Yet he also adopted pragmatism, which as a

philosophy has come to be associated with strategy.

The origins of the word _pragmatism_ lie in the Latin _pragmaticus_ , linked in Roman times to being active and businesslike. For a while it had a negative

connotation as excessive activity, in the sense of meddling or interfering. By the nineteenth century, however, pragmatism had become more positive. It

referred to treating facts or events systematically and practically, being realistic and factual, aiming at what was achievable rather than what was ideal.

Its origins as a philosophical construct go back to the eighteenth-century

German philosopher Immanuel Kant. As an example of a situation in which

it was necessary to act in the face of uncertainty, Kant used a doctor treating a patient and making a diagnosis on the basis of observed symptoms. As he

could not be sure that this was the right treatment, his belief was contingent.

316

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

Another physician might come to a different and better conclusion. “Such contingent belief, which yet forms the ground for the actual employment of

means to certain actions, I entitle pragmatic belief.” This describes exactly the sort of belief required for strategy, one acknowledged to be no more than a best guess in the face of uncertainty, but suffi cient to permit action.

Charles Pierce took the view that Kant was not describing a particular

type of belief but all belief, for all was contingent. All actions were bets

because all depended on a degree of guesswork. A belief that worked was a

winning bet. The psychologist and philosopher, William James, who died

aged 68 in 1910, is widely considered to be the true father of pragmatism.

He took Pierce’s insight and developed it further. He defi ned the pragmatic

method as “the attitude of looking away from fi rst things, principles, ‘cat-

egories,’ supposed necessities; and of looking toward last things, fruits, consequences, fact.” [^48] For James, ideas did not start true but became true as a result of events. An idea’s “verity is in fact an event, a process; the process namely of its verifying itself.” What were described as beliefs were not about truth but about preparations for action. “Beliefs, in short, are really rules for action; and the whole function of thinking is but one step in the pro-

duction of habits of action.” 49 On this basis, the test was not how much a

belief described reality but whether it was effectively prescriptive. As with banknotes, which had value so long as they were accepted as currency, so with ideas. They were true so long as this was acknowledged by others. This could

stand as a shrewd observation about the fate of ideas in the public arena,

though it had awkward implications for the reliability of claims about truth.

Pragmatism could be a prescription of how to think, a form of reasoning

that encouraged a proper evaluation of the outcomes of actions, to be com-

mended to strategists and contrasted with modes of thought that were crude

and insensitive. Or it could be a description of how everybody thought, with

the understanding that some were more effective thinkers than others. As a

response to a growing awareness of the conditionality of knowledge, beliefs

became working hypotheses and events experiments. Just as physical scien-

tists could only confi rm their hypotheses through experiment, so all social

action was an attempt to validate through experiment a hypothesis about

consequences.

It was on this basis that Dewey retained a commitment to the idea of a

progressive, experimental science. This was captured in his preference for the term “instrumentalism” rather than “pragmatism,” though this did not catch

on. [^50] Pragmatism worked for him as a means of making sense of the origins of beliefs and how they developed through experience. Unlike Weber, he did

not consider facts to exist separately from values. The viewer’s perspective was b u r e a u c r a t s , d e m o c r a t s , a n d e l i t e s

317

bound to shape how he saw the world. The worldview changed not because of shifting values but because of different forms of engagement. Dewey was suffi ciently confi dent in the working hypothesis that thinking and acting were part of the same process to not only develop an educational theory on this

basis but also apply it in what became known, tellingly, as the Laboratory

School in Chicago.

Thoughts were therefore not so much revelations of reality as means of

adapting to reality. Truth was what worked in practice. Views of reality were always partial and incomplete, our own constructions rather than objective

representations. As critics observed, this line of argument led to relativism if pushed too far; one set of beliefs was as good as any other so long as it

worked as a guide to action. But whether or not it “worked” depended on

how effects were evaluated. 51 This is why social research was important, for

if it were cumulative, then the risk of being surprised by the consequences of actions should be reduced. So when considering the standard ethics question

of whether ends justifi ed the means, Dewey had no doubt that means could

only be justifi ed by results. He accepted that confi dence in particular means leading to a desirable end might need to be qualifi ed by the same action having other, less-desired consequences. Before acting, therefore, it was neces-

sary to consider the full range of possible consequences, intended as well as

unintended, and on that basis make a choice. 52]] That required considerable foresight. Without it, the value of pragmatism was undermined.

Dewey linked an intellectual process with a social process. He was in

accord with Tolstoy in assuming that a good life was one developed as part

of a community. Because of the potential for confl ict—and here he differed

from Tolstoy—Dewey saw democracy as a way of bringing individuals’ needs

in line with each other and the wider community, transcending apparent

antagonisms, and integrating the private with the public. This meant accept-

ing that individual goals might not be met in full while there was prog-

ress toward social goals, and that this could be achieved by an active state.

Confl ict was not a means of resolving problems; it was the problem to be

resolved.

Dewey decided not to go to the 1904 Congress to which Weber had been

invited and so the two did not meet (although he met James at Harvard).

Weber would have been aware of Dewey’s work because of the overlap, at

least in some core themes, with his own. They were on similar tracks in

their appreciation of the scientifi c method, their focus on the relationship of thought to action, and their stress on the need to judge actions by consequence as much as intent. There were also crucial differences between the

two. While Dewey did not take seriously attempts to separate fact from

318

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

value, Weber insisted upon it. While Dewey saw democracy as inclusive and participatory, for Weber the value of democracy was as a means of electing a

proper leader from a wide pool and ensuring a degree of accountability.

It was as a strategist’s philosophy that pragmatism prospered. It came to

be taken to refer to a particularly political virtue, a talent for adapting ends and means to a changing environment; demonstrating fl exibility; accepting

a world of contingency, trial, error, policy reversals, and shifting positions.

A pragmatist could be compared favorably with the dogmatist, who refused

to compromise and was impervious to circumstances and negligent of evi-

dence. But Dewey combined this strategist’s philosophy, pragmatism, with

an a-strategic worldview, which sought to deny deep confl icts and supplant

politics with research-led reform. Menand observes that “a time when the

chance of another civil war did not seem remote, a philosophy that warned

against the idolatry of ideas was possibly the only philosophy on which a

progressive politics could have been successfully mounted.” [^53] In this respect it provided a form of thinking that appeared both provocative and reassuring. But there was no inherent reason why this should be so. Consideration

of consequences depended on confi dence that they could be discerned, at least to a useful approximation. This might allow the best choice to be made, but

that choice might still be between two evils.

In 1936, Robert Merton, an American sociologist infl uenced by Weber,

wrote “The Unanticipated Consequences of Purposive Social Action.” 54]] The main explanation normally offered for why all consequences could not be

anticipated, Merton noted, was ignorance, which led to the view that more

and better knowledge would steadily improve the quality and effectiveness

of action. But there were limits to what knowledge could be acquired and,

anticipating a point that would be made many years later by behavioral econ-

omists, Merton questioned whether it was always worth the time and energy

to acquire extra knowledge. Another factor was error, assuming for example,

that just because a course of action had produced a desired result a previous time it would do so again, without paying regard to variations in circumstances. This could refl ect carelessness or something more psychological, “a determined refusal or inability to consider certain elements of the problem.”

Next came what Merton called the “imperious immediacy of interest,”

putting an emphasis on the short term to the exclusion of consideration of

later consequences. An action might be rational in seeking to ensure a particular outcome, but “precisely because a particular action is not carried out in a psychological or social vacuum, its effects will ramify into other spheres of value and interest.” Lastly, he made the point central to all strategy: “Public predictions of future social developments are frequently not sustained

b u r e a u c r a t s , d e m o c r a t s , a n d e l i t e s

319

precisely because the prediction has become a new element in the concrete situation, thus tending to change the initial course of developments.” He

took the example of Marx’s predictions. The “socialist preaching in the nine-

teenth century” led to labor organizations which took advantage of collective bargaining, “thus slowing up, if not eliminating, the developments which

Marx had predicted.”

At the heart of any debate on strategy was the question of cause and effect.

Strategic action presumed that desired effects would follow from the choice

of appropriate courses of action. In principle, social science should have made strategic choices easier, because causal relationships would be much better

understood. This created its own ethical imperatives. For Weber, the possi-

bility of appreciating the likely consequences of action or inaction meant that it was irresponsible not to take advantage of the greater insights that social science had to offer. For Dewey, it was also foolish, because it meant denying an opportunity to get the most from every action. For Tolstoy, the foolishness was only in the conceit that social processes—in all their complexity—could

ever be properly grasped. There could be no true experts in these matters. No human mind could grasp the totality of factors that were at play in great and social and political processes. There could be no strategy because there could be no confi dence in the difference any particular action could make.

In the early decades of the twentieth century, to deny the possibility of

strategy was to abandon hope in the face of enormous and pressing social

and political issues. Yet there were undoubtedly good reasons for caution.

The more complex and novel the situation, the harder it would be to link

actions with consequences. Unintended outcomes might be as signifi cant as

the intended. Even when short-term goals were reached the benefi ts might

be overwhelmed by adverse longer-term consequences. Most challenging

of all were those situations where there was an opponent seeking to refute

one’s working hypothesis. Even if cause-effect relationships were properly

understood, there might still not be available measures suffi cient to generate the required effects. It was one thing to change education policy and quite

another to alter the course of capitalism or dispel a pernicious myth to which the masses were in thrall. The optimism that enlightened social policies

informed by a progressive social science could heal the wounds of industrial-

ization barely survived during the mid-century’s ideological, economic, and

military calamities. The transformational social and political changes that

were set in motion in the later decades of the century were barely infl uenced by the prescriptions of mainstream social science, but were the result of individuals and groups seeking to improve their lives through collective action.

Formulas, Myths, and Propaganda

_Frankly to manufacture thought_

_Is like a masterpiece by a weaver wrought._

—Goethe, _Faust_

Whereas weber and Dewey represented distinctive strands of the

liberal critique of Marxism, there was a more conservative critique

developed by the so-called Italian school of neo-Machiavellians. Notable

among them were the Sicilian Gaetano Mosca, who held a number of aca-

demic and political positions within Italy during a long life; the German

sociologist Robert Michels, who spent most of his career in Italy; and the

Italian Vilfredo Pareto, who began his career in Italy but then decamped to

Geneva. Their ideas developed as an explicit correction to expectations of a

progressively more equal and democratic society, and were marked less by

strategic considerations than by a keen sense of the limits of what strategy

might achieve. They were part of a movement away from political economy

and into sociology, as explanations were sought for the less rational aspects of social behavior. They were described as the heirs of Machiavelli, 1]] not only because of the Italian link but also because they took him to be a model of an unsentimental approach to the study of politics, accepting the harsh realities of its practice and refusing to take at face value the comforting rhetoric of its practitioners.

The core proposition was that a minority would always rule over a majority. The key questions therefore revolved around the means by which the elite sustained its position and how it might be displaced. The most signifi cant

empirical work on the impact of organizational needs on democratic claims

was undertaken by Robert Michels, a student of Weber’s. As an active mem-

ber of the German Social Democrat Party, Michels had come to recognize the

importance of the party bureaucracy in shaping its goals and strategy. While

nobody doubted that capitalist parties were non-democratic, whatever they

might say about the “will of the people,” 2]] socialist parties posed a sharper test for the democratic principle because of their proclaimed egalitarianism.

Michels’s analysis fi tted in perfectly with Weber’s theories of bureaucratization. Unlike his radical student, however, Weber was content with the con-

sequential loss of revolutionary élan. Concepts such as the “genuine will of

the people,” he explained to Michels, “have long since ceased to exist for me; they are fi ctitious notions.” 3]]

Michels’s study of the pre-war SPD demonstrated how growth and elec-

toral success drained the party of militancy: “Organization becomes the vital essence of the party.” So long as the party was growing the leadership was

content, reluctant to put the organization at risk by taking any bold steps

that might challenge the state. As they developed an interest in their own

self-perpetuation, Michels noted, “from a means, organization becomes an

end.” 4]] Organization was demanding and complicated, requiring specialist skills. Those who knew how to manage fi nances, look after members, produce

literature, and direct campaigns acquired superior knowledge and controlled

both the form and content of communications. So long as they stayed united,

the relatively incompetent masses had no chance to impose their will. “Who

says organization, says oligarchy.” This was Michels’s “iron law.”

Beyond this law, and his consequential disillusionment with socialism,

Michels did not offer much of a general theory. In this respect, Mosca was

more important. His starting point was simple: in all political systems, at all times and places, there was a ruling class, a “minority of infl uential persons, to which management, willingly or unwillingly, the majority defer.” 5]] Mosca considered rule by a single individual to be as unlikely as by the majority. This was because of the necessity of organization. Majorities were inherently disorganized and individuals by defi nition lacked organization. So only minorities could stay organized, which meant that key political struggles

must also take place within the elite. To become preeminent, hard work and

ambition made a difference, more so than a sense of justice and altruism.

Most important were “perspicacity, a ready intuition of individual and mass

psychology, strength of will and, especially confi dence in oneself.” 6]] Changing 322

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

circumstances infl uenced the rise and fall of elites—priests would fare best in a religious society and warriors in one at war. If a particular social force declined in importance so would those who derived their power from it.

Pareto followed closely on Mosca (not always, Mosca suggested, with full

attribution). Trained in engineering and after a spell in industry, Pareto fi rst made his name in economics and then in sociology. As an economist at the

University of Lausanne he worked in the neoclassical tradition. Here he fol-

lowed Léon Walras, the father of general equilibrium theory, responsible for

the proposition that if all other markets in an economy are in equilibrium,

then any specifi c market must also be in equilibrium. In his 1885 book

_Elements of Pure Economics_ , Walras proved this mathematically, thereby setting a precedent for economic theory that would be picked up enthusiastically in

the middle of the next century, particularly in the United States.

Pareto gave his name to two contributions. The Pareto principle sug-

gested that 80 percent of effects came from 20 percent of the causes. This

rough rule of thumb indicated that a minority of inputs could be responsible

for a disproportionate share of outputs, in itself a challenge to notions of

equality. Secondly, and more substantively, he gave his name to the concept

of Pareto effi ciency, which also infl uenced later economic thought. In 1902

he published a critique of Marxism, which marked his move away from eco-

nomics toward sociology. Pareto appreciated Marx’s idea of class confl ict and his hard-edged approach to the analysis of human behavior, but parted company on the belief that class confl ict would be transcended through proletarian victory. The people might well believe that they were fi ghting for a great cause, and maybe the leaders did too. In practice, however, the elite would

look after itself. Even in a collectivist society there would still be confl ict—

for example between intellectuals and non-intellectuals. One of Pareto’s most important and infl uential themes, derived from his background in engineering and economics, was that of social equilibrium. He argued that societies

were inherently resistant to change. When disturbed by either internal or

external forces, some counteracting movement developed and they tended

to return to their original state. His elitism was refl ected in his view of the masses as the body of humanity left over after the elite have been subtracted (“the incompetent, those lacking energy, character and intelligence”), 7]] just as most conduct was in a residual nonlogical category once the logical had been

subtracted.

An intriguing aspect of Pareto’s work was his analysis of the role of strat-

egy in political systems. This was not quite how he phrased the issue, but it is a reasonable decoding of the rather idiosyncratic language he adopted, notably in his most important work, the four-volume study published in English

f o r m u l a s , m y t h s , a n d p r o p a g a n d a

323

as _The Mind and Society_ . 8 Rather than talk of strategy Pareto referred to “logi-]]

cal conduct.” This was essentially procedural rationality: action should be

oriented to an attainable goal using means appropriate to that goal. In his

terminology, that would mean that the objective end (what was achieved)

and the subjective purpose (what was intended) would be identical. This set

a very high standard for logicality. With “nonlogical conduct,” by contrast,

objective ends and subjective purposes would diverge. Here, either action

lacked purpose, or the claimed purpose was out of reach or could not be

attained by the methods employed. Not surprisingly, he found this to be

common. Examples of nonlogical conduct might be the practice of magic,

reliance on superstition, dependence on routine, yearnings for utopias, and

exaggerated confi dence in the competence of individuals and organizations or in the effectiveness of particular tactics.

Pareto saw the roots of nonlogical action in “residues” (what is left over

when the logical is taken away). These were constant, instinctive factors infl uencing behavior, while “derivations” changed over time and space. The analy-

sis of residues began in the second of a four-volume work and soon became

extraordinarily discursive and complicated. Well into volume four, the pre-

vious six residues were effectively reduced to two, and these were shown to

match Machiavelli’s distinction between lions and foxes, as representatives of force and guile. The residue associated with foxes, Pareto’s Class I, refl ected the “instinct of combinations”—the impulse to make connections between

disparate elements and events, to think imaginatively, encourage attempts

to outwit others, maneuver out of trouble, generate ideologies, and form

expedient coalitions.

By contrast, Class II residues, those associated with lions, refl ected the

“persistence of aggregates,” referred to tendencies to consolidate established positions, instincts for permanence, stability, and order. The lions would

demonstrate an attachment to family, class, nation, and religion and make

their appeals to solidarity, order, discipline, property, or family. Pareto associated lions with a greater readiness to use force. Although the lions seemed to be more conservative and foxes more radical, this was not necessarily the case.

In Pareto’s terminology, ideology was a derivation and thus a rationalization for something deeper. Force might be used to protect the status quo as well as to overthrow it. In this way Pareto represented as “residues” the two poles of classic strategy, force and guile, one solving problems with physical strength and the other with brainpower. Pareto did not present these characteristics as matters of degree but as distinctive and exclusive types.

The elite was more likely to be composed of intelligent foxes, maintain-

ing their position through cunning and deceit, with the more stolid and

324

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

unimaginative lions found among the masses, bound by a sense of group loyalty. Foxes would seek to govern through consent, and so would devise

ideologies to keep the masses satisfi ed and seek short-term fi xes to crises rather than use force. Here lay the vulnerability of the foxes. Their readiness to compromise and squeamishness when it came to using force would weaken

the regime. At some point, their maneuvers would no longer work and they

would face hard opponents who could no longer be outwitted. When the

more tough-minded lions governed, they tended to rely on force and would

be uninterested in compromise, claiming to be defending higher values. As

neither group would endure on its own, the most stable regime would have

a mixture of both types. In practice, each would tend to recruit their own

kind. Fox regimes would degenerate over time and become vulnerable to a

sudden show of force; lion regimes would more likely be infi ltrated by foxes and would thus experience more gradual decline. Out of all of this Pareto

postulated the “circulation of elites.” There was always an elite, but it could change in composition. The advantage should be with the shrewd and the

cunning, but not to the point where violence could never be advised.

The idea that political history can be viewed as a dialectic between prac-

titioners of force and guile had a certain appeal. But Pareto was generaliz-

ing out of his own political context, refl ecting his skepticism of democratic claims and distaste for the corrupt and cynical politics of his time, and then looking for historical parallels to bolster his theory, playing down the impact of material changes and the growing importance of bureaucratic organization. [^9] This did not, as we shall see, prevent his ideas from infl uencing conservative circles as they looked for intellectually robust alternatives to socialism and Marx.

_Crowds and Publics_

Conservatives might assume that elites were always present; radicals might

be convinced that they could be overthrown. Both had an interest in how

they managed to hold on to power when force was used so rarely. Both looked

to ideology as the explanation. Whether or not elites were vulnerable would

depend on the strength of the ideological hold over the masses. Marx assumed

that such a challenge would develop with the class struggle. A growing self-

consciousness would lead the working class to acquire a political identity

and become more than an analytical category. Unfortunately for the theory,

not only had the class structure developed in more complex ways than Marx

envisaged but workers had also persistently embraced incorrect thoughts.

The challenge for socialists was to demonstrate the scientifi c correctness as well as the political potential of a true class consciousness. They must battle with the purveyors of false consciousness, from the clergy fi lling workers’

minds with religious nonsense to reformers—possibly even more perni-

cious—claiming that they could make the system responsive to the needs of

workers without revolution. For the conservative elitists, political stability did not depend on whether beliefs were false or correct but whether they kept the masses satisfi ed, or else encouraged insurrectionary sentiments.

Mosca wrote of a “political formula” that would serve the ruling class by

providing a persuasive link to broader concepts that were generally under-

stood and appreciated. Examples might be racial superiority, divine right,

or the “will of the people.” The formula needed to be more than “tricks

and quackeries,” deliberate deceptions by cynical rulers. Instead, it should

refl ect a popular need. Mosca assumed a mass preference to be “governed

not on the basis of mere material or intellectual force, but on the basis of a moral principle.” A formula might not correspond to “truth” but it needed

acceptance: should skepticism about its validity become widespread, then

the effect would be to undermine the social order.

The fascination with consciousness was boosted by the developing fi eld of

social psychology. A particularly infl uential book was Gustave Le Bon’s _The_ _Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind_ , which we have already encountered as an infl uence on the military thinker “Boney” Fuller. Published in France in 1895

but soon widely translated, it was in many respects another deeply conserva-

tive, elitist lament about the unraveling of hierarchy, about how the “divine right of the masses” had displaced the “divine right of kings.” Le Bon was

hostile to socialism and labor unions as examples of how the masses could be

exploited by malign demagogues. What caught attention was his exploration

of the sources of irrationality in the psychology of crowds. Le Bon argued,

in a theme that was to become ever more prominent in social thought, that

a far more important infl uence on conscious acts than deliberate reason was

“an unconscious substratum created in the mind in the main by hereditary

infl uences.” Such infl uences became strong as individuals turned into crowds, and irrationality was given full rein.

Moreover, by the mere fact that he forms part of an organized crowd,

a man descends several rungs in the ladder of civilization. Isolated, he

may be a cultivated individual; in a crowd, he is a barbarian—that is,

a creature acting by instinct. He possesses the spontaneity, the vio-

lence, the ferocity, and also the enthusiasm and heroism of primitive

beings, whom he further tends to resemble by the facility with which

326

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

he allows himself to be impressed by words and _resources/books//Strategy_ A History - Lawrence Freedman—which would be entirely without action on each of the isolated individuals compos-ing the crowd—and to be induced to commit acts contrary to his most

obvious interests and his best-known habits. An individual in a crowd

is a grain of sand amid other grains of sand, which the wind stirs up

at will. [^10]

Le Bon’s tone was pessimistic but he held out a possibility for getting a grip on the masses. Because their views did not refl ect their interests, or indeed any serious thought, the same impressionable crowd that could fall prey to

the nonsensical notions of socialist demagogues might be just as suggestible

to contrary notions put forward by a shrewd elite that had studied group

psychology. Making appeals to reason was pointless when illusion was the

key. The requirement was for drama, for a compelling and startling image—

“absolute, uncompromising and simple”—that “fi lls and bests the mind.”

Mastering the “art of impressing the imagination of crowds is to know at the

same time the art of governing them.” Le Bon became essential reading for

governing elites.

A subversive version of a similar idea came from the Frenchman Georges

Sorel, a provincial engineer who turned in middle age to study and writ-

ing. His politics veered wildly during his life, although his contempt for

rationalism and moderation was a constant. Hughes described his mind as

“a windy crossroads by which there blew nearly every new social doctrine of

the early twentieth century.” 11]] His critical stance turned him into a percep-

tive social theorist who was taken seriously in his time. 12]] He embraced Marx idiosyncratically, presenting him as less the prophet of capitalism’s economic collapse and more the predictor of the bourgeoisie’s moral collapse. 13]] He took from Le Bon the conviction that the rationality of man was lost among the

masses, which meant that he was unable to place a faith in mass political

movements.

Disgusted with decadent elites, cowards, and humbugs who lacked the

gumption to fi ght for their privileges and were eager to make accommoda-

tions with their adversaries, he imagined them being swept away in an act

of decisive, cleansing violence. The model he had in mind was a Napoleonic

battle, ending with the utter defeat of the enemy. He is largely remembered

for one book, _Refl ections on Violence_ , _w_ ritten during his syndicalist phase, a movement which appealed to him partly because it did not involve political

parties. Here he developed his most potent idea, that of the myth. In its content, a myth need be neither analytical nor programmatic. It could be beyond

refutation, nonlogical and irrational, a composition of _resources/books//Strategy_ A History - Lawrence Freedman as much as

327

words, which “by intuition alone, before any considered analyses are made, is capable of evoking as an undivided whole the mass of sentiments which

correspond to the different manifestations of the war undertaken by socialism against modern society.”

The stress on the importance of intuition betrays the infl uence of the

French philosopher Henri Bergson, whose lectures Sorel attended in Paris.

The only real test of a myth was whether it could drive a political movement

forward. It would be more about conviction and motivation than the exposi-

tions of systematic ideas. A successful myth would compel men to act in a

great radical cause, convincing them of their ultimate triumph. Myths were

negative in their inspiration—more about destruction than creation. Sorel

had a particular aversion to utopianism and claims that men would act out of

goodness. Examples were primitive Christianity or Mazzinian nationalism.

At the time of _Refl ections_ , the myth that he had in mind was a syndicalist general strike. He had lost confi dence in a Marxist revolution. Later he was prepared to accept either Lenin’s Bolshevism or Benito Mussolini’s Fascism.

Arguably, the focus on fi nding a myth that worked and evaluating ideas by

their ideological effects could be considered pragmatic, even if this was not quite what the pragmatists had in mind.

_Gramsci_

One of those infl uenced by Sorel was Antonio Gramsci. A childhood accident

had left him short, hunchbacked, and sickly, but his formidable intellect and wide-ranging interests enabled him to get a scholarship to university and

then establish himself as a radical journalist. He was active in the Factory

Council movement in Turin, supported by Sorel, and then helped found the

Italian Communist Party (PCI) after it split from the socialists in 1921. After spending eighteen months in Moscow as Italian delegate to the Communist

International, Gramsci watched with dismay as disunity on the left allowed

for the rise of Fascism in Italy. Though initially spared prison as a member of the Chamber of Deputies, and so almost by default becoming general secretary of the PCI, he was eventually arrested in November 1926. Aged 35, he

was sentenced to twenty years imprisonment by the Fascists. By the time of

his release, his health was shattered and he died in 1937.

While in prison he fi lled numerous notebooks with notes on a vast range

of issues, stimulated by voracious reading. His thoughts were intended to be

developed more systematically once he regained his freedom. They remained

notes, however—sketchy, incomplete, and often deliberately lacking in

328

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

clarity to confuse his jailors. As a body of work they are now considered to represent an important contribution to both Marxist and non-Marxist theory. Gramsci was not truly “discovered” until after the Second World War,

long after his death, when he was acclaimed as a humane and non-dogmatic

Marxist. He challenged the mechanistic formulations inherited from the days

of the Second International, arguing against reliance on historic laws of progress to produce a happy socialist conclusion and taking account of culture as much as economics. Of particular note was his attempt to address the docility of the working classes in the face of their evident exploitation.

He was aware of the neo-Machiavellians and shared some of their con-

clusions. For example, he accepted that for the moment, while there were

classes, there really were “rulers and ruled, leaders and led.” Any politics

that ignored this “primordial, irreducible” fact was doomed to failure. 14]] For the rulers, consent was preferable to coercion. This could only be achieved

by convincing the ruled that the established political order served their

interests. The ability to dominate through the power of ideas rather than

brute force Gramsci called “hegemony.” He was not the fi rst to use the word, derived from the Greek _hegeisthai_ (to lead), and the underlying proposition was not new. The _Communist Manifesto_ observed that “the ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of the ruling class.” Lenin had warned that trade unionism served bourgeois rather than proletarian ideology, and used “hege-

mony” in its original sense as leadership. 15 Gramsci’]]s explorations into the sources of hegemonic rule, however, enriched the concept to the point where

it became part of the mainstream political lexicon.

The problem for Marxism was the supposedly close relationship between

economics and politics, so that a change in material conditions should lead

inexorably to changes in political consciousness. Yet, noted Gramsci, “at certain moments the automatic drive produced by the economic factor is slowed

down, obstructed or even broken up momentarily by traditional ideological

elements.” 16 T]]o take the obvious example, bourgeois claims that democracy and equality could be achieved through parliamentary means had proved

persuasive. So long as this continued, the ruling class could avoid force. Only when they lost hegemonic ground would more authoritarian measures be

necessary. This would be tested at times of crisis, when governments seeking

to defl ect popular anger would need to fi nd ways of manipulating thoughts

and creating an acquiescent public.

Gramsci divided society into its political and civil components. Political

society, the realm of force, included the instruments of the state: govern-

ment, the judiciary, the military, and the police. Civil society, the realm of ideas, included all those other bodies, from religious, media, and educational f o r m u l a s , m y t h s , a n d p r o p a g a n d a

329

institutions to clubs and political parties relevant to the development of political and social consciousness. Here the ruling class must market its ideas if it was to achieve the appearance of rule by consent. Successful hegemony

was evident in shared patterns of thought, concepts of reality, and notions

of what was commonsensical. This would be refl ected in language, customs,

and morality. The ruled were persuaded that their society could and should

be integrated rather than divided by class confl ict.

This did not happen by cynically implanting a big idea in the popular

consciousness. The ruling class could naturally draw on tradition, patriotic

symbols and rituals, linguistic forms, and the authority of the Church and

schools. The elite’s vulnerability was that there still had to be a relation-

ship to actual experience. For this reason, the effort to sustain hegemonic

consent might well involve concessions. Even so there was still a puzzle, for the working classes might be expected to have a conception of the world

refl ecting their condition. Gramsci believed that they did, but it might only be embryonic. It would manifest itself in action, but this would be “occasionally, by fi ts and starts,” when “the group is acting as an organic totality.”

This conception could coexist, “for reasons of submission and intellectual

subordination,” with one derived from the ruling class. 17]] Thus two theoretical consciousnesses almost competed with each other, one refl ected in prac-

tical activity, binding workers together, the other inherited from the past

and uncritically accepted, reinforced through language, education, politics,

and the mass media. True consciousness was therefore obscured or defl ected.

Given the opportunity, however, it would assert itself.

It was not necessary for hegemonic thoughts to be truly believed; their

presence could be suffi cient to cause confusion and thereby paralysis. The

challenge for communists was to engage in counter-hegemonic work, to pro-

vide the conceptual tools to enable the workers to appreciate the causes of

their discontents. This would require activity in all the relevant arenas of

civil society. Indeed, until this was complete, the party would not really be ready for power. It must fi rst turn the tables on the ruling class and become itself hegemonic. Gramsci presented the party as a Machiavellian prince acting for a group: “The modern prince . . . cannot be a real person, a concrete individual. It can only be an organism, a complex element of society in which the cementing of a collective will, recognized and partially asserted in action, has already begun. This organism is already provided by historical development and it is the political party.” 18 This would only work, however]], if it remained closely in touch with those whose will it was seeking to forge and

direct. Gramsci was no fan of democratic centralism, which was geared to

seizing dictatorial power. He wrote doubtfully about how this would require

330

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

of the masses a “generic loyalty, of a military kind, to a visible or invisible political center.” This would be sustained, ready for the moment when direct

action could be taken, by means of “moralizing sermons, emotional stimuli,

and messianic myths of an awaited golden age in which all present contradic-

tions and miseries will be automatically resolved and made well.” [^19]

To explain what he had in mind he used a military analogy. The rul-

ing classes’ intellectual domination of civil society could be understood as

a series of trenches and fortresses that could only be undermined and sub-

verted by a patient but relentless war of position. The alternative, a war of maneuver—actually a form of frontal attack on the state—had long been

the revolutionaries’ dream and had recently been successful in Russia. But

Lenin was able to mount an opportunistic campaign to seize power by tak-

ing advantage of an organized party, a disorganized state, and a feeble civil society. These, Gramsci believed, were exceptional and peculiarly “eastern”

conditions, quite different from the complex civil societies and structures of Western states, where the only course was fi rst to fi ght the battle of ideas.

“The war of position in politics,” he insisted, “is the concept of hegemony.”

This was, according to one authority, “a capsule description of his entire

strategic argument.” 20]]

Gramsci never got the chance to complete his analysis, let alone put it

into practice. Nonetheless, there was a tension at its heart that fl owed from his core Marxism. He would not abandon the idea that, ultimately, economics

drove politics, that class struggle was real and could shape consciousness, and that there would come a time when a majority working class would be able

to attain power and rule with genuine hegemonic consent. Yet his analysis

suggested a much more fl uid set of relationships and possibilities, and pat-

terns of thought that were disjointed and incoherent. It was problematic for

a Marxist to accept that politics was an arena autonomous from economics,

with its own tendencies and passions, but allowing the possibility of a range of factors intervening between the two rendered their relationship tenuous. If ideas had consequences of their own and were more than refl ections of shifts in the means of production and the composition of classes, how could it be

assumed that the battle for ideas would remain linked with the underlying

class struggle? Once it was admitted that individuals could hold notionally

contradictory thoughts in their heads, why stop with the contest between

the hegemonic ideas of the ruling class or the incipient counter-hegemony

of the ruled? What about normal muddle and confusion, or ideas which cut

across those linked to class struggle, or inaction resulting from calculations based on prudence, a fear of unemployment, recollections of past failures, or

distrust of party leaders? 21

331

The military analogy Gramsci adopted was essentially that fi rst introduced by Delbrück, between strategies of annihilation and exhaustion. It

had been employed by Kautsky in 1910, and then Lenin in his argument

for preparatory work and building up strength. Gramsci may have been

updating the metaphor to take account of the past war, comparing the failed

maneuvers of the war’s early stages with the hard slog that followed, includ-

ing the trenches and fortifi cations, but the underlying point was the same.

A strategy of annihilation or overthrow or—for Gramsci—maneuver prom-

ised a quick and decisive outcome but required surprise and an unprepared

opponent. Given the advantages of the state in such a contest, it was only

prudent to think in the long term. Gramsci argued therefore for an extended

campaign for hegemonic infl uence. By the time state power came, socialism

would already be on its way to being achieved.

As a prescription, this was barely different from Kautsky’s, except that

Gramsci envisaged a broader advance in the fi eld of ideas and was more skeptical about the parliamentary route. His starting point was also weak. Notably, his ideas on how a war of position might be fought seemed designed to avoid

early violence, with a focus on demonstrations, boycotts, propaganda, and

political education. The problem of how successful counter- hegemonic work

in the civil sphere would eventually translate into a transfer of power in the political sphere was left ambiguous, presuming a point at which the ruling

class would be dominant but no longer hegemonic. It was hard to see how

a war of maneuver could be avoided at this point. Nor did Gramsci deal

with the even larger problem of how this new hegemony would develop in

circumstances where economic and social structures were becoming more

variegated.

Outside of prison, this strategy would have appeared moderate and

patient, avoiding the charges of authoritarianism attracted by Leninists, but effectively putting off the revolution and leading inevitably to pacts and

compromises with other parties. In practice, Gramsci was himself the intel-

lectual prisoner of the party line just as he was a physical prisoner of the

Fascists. He was fi ghting a hegemonic war within himself. Every time he

acknowledged that the way men thought affected the way they acted and that

thoughts would by no means necessarily follow the imperatives of class, he

was subverting the intellectual and political tradition in which he had been

reared but which, consciously or subconsciously, he was coming to challenge.

Gramsci’s situation was poignant. Not only would he never get the chance

to apply his ideas in practice, but also he would have been thwarted if he had tried. He would probably have been expelled from the party if he had pro-pounded his ideas as an activist. When his work was eventually published

332

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

posthumously, it initially included only those selections the PCI considered safe to release. Once confi dence was lost in Marxism as a scientifi c revelation of the laws of history, Gramsci’s project would unravel or at least go off in directions that had little to do with his original purpose (which is what happened after the war when it inspired academic cultural studies).

The Communist Party turned into a project to maintain hegemony. Party

members were required to be faithful to the prevailing line and to explain

it without hesitation or any hint of incredulity to followers, however incon-

sistent, contradictory, or at odds with the evidence it might seem. Offi cial ideologists engaged in whatever intellectual contortions were necessary to

support the leadership and knew they were in trouble if they showed signs

of doubt or independent thought. As the ideologies moved from the streets

to government, ideological discipline was extended to the population as a

whole. As the party line was tested daily against everyday experience and

divergences had to be explained away, the requisite shifts in the offi cial position caused confusion. An ideology that claimed to explain everything had

to have positions on everything and sometimes these could be risible. Even

with core support among the population, doubts were bound to develop and

hegemony was in the end maintained less by the credibility of the case than

by threats of retribution against doubters, apostates, critics, and deviants. In this way, the extremism of the original propositions on class consciousness,

political formulas, myths, and hegemony came to be matched by the extrem-

ism of their implementation by totalitarian states.

The Nazis in Germany, possibly with Le Bon and Sorel in mind, provided

the most disturbing example of how a ruling elite, with ruthlessness and

little intellectual shame, could work to shape the thoughts of the masses.

They used modern forms of propaganda, from staged rallies to controlled

radio broadcasts. Although neither Adolf Hitler nor his propaganda chief

Joseph Goebbels ever admitted that they would stoop to what they called the

“big lie,” their descriptions of how their enemies could do so left little doubt about their views. In explaining the success of Jews in defl ecting blame for Germany’s defeat in the Great War away from themselves, Hitler drew attention to “the principle—which is quite true within itself—that in the big

lie there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily.” Because of “the primitive simplicity of their minds,” they were more likely to fall victim to the big lie than the small lie as it “would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal

untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the impudence

to distort the truth so infamously.” 22]]

_Burnham_

The impact of Stalinism on leftist thought in open societies can be seen in

the United States as questions were raised as to whether Western capitalist

societies really were following the path set down by Marx or might instead be becoming more durable and less self-destructive. The Communist Party, following the Soviet line, dominated far-left politics during the 1930s. Trotsky, in exile in nearby Mexico, became a rallying point for those who remained

attracted by Marxism, especially during the terrible economic conditions of

the Great Depression, yet were appalled by Stalinism’s vicious and devious

nature. The Trotskyist group in the United States was the largest of any

(although at about one thousand members, it was not enormous). Many of

the key fi gures attracted to a Marxism independent of Moscow came together

in New York, a redoubtable intellectual grouping in terms of its vitality, if not political infl uence. Eventually practically all abandoned their Marxism, and many became conservatives, driven by their anti-Stalinism. Out of this

group came some of the most formidable intellectuals and writers of post-

war America. This included the contemporary neoconservative movement,

initially composed of leftist veterans, often deploying the polemical skills

developed during the faction fi ghts of the 1930s.

One of the key fi gures to emerge from this milieu was James Burnham,

a professor at New York University. He was one of the sharpest Trotskyist

brains until he broke away over Trotsky’s support for Stalin’s pact with Hitler, which Burnham saw as a complete betrayal. This was coupled with a more

esoteric dispute over the philosophical validity of dialectical materialism.

From that point anti-communism dominated his thoughts and he moved

fi rmly to the right. In 1941, during the early stages of this journey, without changing his rigorous, quasi-scientifi c, predictive style, and still focusing on the means of production to see where power lay, Burnham published a highly

infl uential book, entitled _The Managerial Revolution_ . He identifi ed a new class—not the proletariat—moving into a dominant position. As the title

implied, the book’s core thesis was that the managers, who provided the tech-

nical direction and coordination of production, were now in charge, replac-

ing capitalists and communists alike. Within this trend he saw both Nazi

Germany (at the time assuming a German victory in Europe) and President

Roosevelt’s New Deal. 23 After the war he was accused of plagiarism, pos-]]

sibly with some justice, by Bruno Rizzi, an eccentric leftist who earned his

living as a traveling shoe salesman. Even if he had not read Rizzi’s 1939 _The_ _Bureaucratization of the World_ , [^24] he would have been aware of it. Trotsky felt the need to address it because it drew on his own critique of the Soviet Union 334

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

and then took it further than any good Marxist could allow, in identifying a bureaucratic class controlling the state apparatus in diverse types of society.

Burnham’s next book, _The Machiavellians_ , attempted to give a more political dimension to the economic analysis of _The Managerial Revolution_ . This drew explicitly on Mosca, Sorel, Michels, and Pareto. It sought to reassert

Machiavelli’s candor about the role of elemental interests and instincts in

politics, with power exercised for its own sake, maintained if necessary by

force and fraud. He asserted the possibility of an objective science of poli-

tics, neutral with respect to any political goal, undertaken independent of

personal preferences, considering the struggle for social power “in its diverse open and concealed forms.” This could not rely on taking what was said

at face value; everything that was said and done needed to be related to a

broader social context to appreciate its meaning. Much of the book was given

over to an exposition of the theories associated with the neo-Machiavellians, stressing the core division between the rulers and the ruled. His summation

was a mixture of Pareto and Sorel. He took from the former the minor role

played by logical or rational action in political and social change. “For the most part it is a delusion to believe that in social life men take deliberate steps to achieve consciously held goals.” More frequent was nonlogical action

“spurred by environmental changes, instinct, impulse, interest.” Sorel came

in with the proposition that to maintain its own power and privilege, the

elite depended on a political formula, “which is usually correlated with a

generally accepted religion, ideology or myth.”

Burnham identifi ed the new elite as the men “able to control contempo-

rary mass industry, the massed labor force, and a supra-national form of political organization.” He assumed that this control could be exercised by means

of a compelling political formula. So, rational behavior for the elite would be to get the masses to accept unscientifi c myths. If they failed to sustain beliefs in the myths, the fabric of society would crack and they would be overthrown. In short, the leaders—if they themselves were scientifi c—must lie. 25]]

This was the nub of the problem with Burnham’s analysis. Under a Nazi

or Stalinist state, myths could be manufactured and sustained as a means of

social control. In both these cases, the underlying ideology was rooted in the leadership but it could also be sustained by coercive means. Dissent could be punished. Certain ideas played an important role in Western societies, but

this role required a much more subtle analysis than Burnham’s because the

marketplace of ideas was much larger. Critics objected to Burnham’s cynical

approach to American democracy as if it were comparable to totalitarian-

ism, and to his muddled analysis of power and where it was located. 26]] The proposition that a political formula could be developed by an elite and then

f o r m u l a s , m y t h s , a n d p r o p a g a n d a

335

just handed down to the masses was far too simplistic. Ideas were far more diffi cult to control than physical conditions. Not all of the original message would be picked up even by a willing recipient.

_Experts and Propaganda_

Up to the point when the Nazis moved the art of propaganda to a new and

disturbing level, great strides had been made in developing the theory and

practice in the United States. Because of the totalitarian experience, it became very diffi cult to read earlier claims about what might be achieved by propaganda without a painful sense of where it could all lead. Given the impor-

tance attached to infl uencing the way people thought about their condition,

which continued into the twenty-fi rst century, it is important to consider the earlier development of Western theories of public opinion.

Robert Park provides a starting point. He was a former student of Dewey’s

who went on to succeed Small as head of the Chicago Sociology Department.

His doctoral dissertation was written in Germany in 1904 on “The Crowd

and the Public.” 27 He contrasted Le Bon’]]s vivid descriptions of how individuals joining a crowd lost their personalities and instead acquired a collective mind with the views of Gabriel Tarde, another Frenchman who thought Le

Bon outdated. Tarde was interested in how power could fl ow from some indi-

viduals as they were imitated by many others. In addition to imposed, coer-

cive power, this imitation gave society its coherence. The developing print

media had special signifi cance because it made possible simultaneous and

similar conversations without regard for geography. Views could be packaged

like commodities and then transmitted to millions, a capability which he

recognized to be a powerful weapon.

As he refl ected on the Dreyfus affair in France during the 1890s (the con-

troversy surrounding a Jewish offi cer’s conviction of spying for Germany),

Tarde observed a collective opinion developing without individuals gather-

ing together. From this came his view of the public as a “spiritual collectivity, a dispersion of individuals who are physically separated and whose cohesion

is entirely mental.” 28]] For this reason he could not agree “with that solid writer, Dr. Le Bon, that this was ‘the age of the crowd.’ ” It was the “age of the public, or the publics—and that is quite different.” [^29] An individual could only join one crowd but could be part of many publics. A crowd might be

excitable but a public would be less emotional with calmer opinions.

Park developed this idea of a dichotomy between crowds—homogenous,

simple, and impulsive, responding emotionally to perceptions of events—and

336

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

the much more admirable public—heterogeneous and critical, addressing facts, comfortable with complexity. The hope for an ordered and progressive society depended on the public, which “precisely because it is composed

of individuals with different opinions—is guided by prudence and rational

refl ection.” [^30] Once the public ceased to be critical, it became tantamount to a crowd, with all feelings moving in the same direction.

Whether the crowd or the public would predominate depended on the

role of the media. The so-called muckraking journalists saw the newspapers

as an agent of enlightenment and democracy. “Publicity,” wrote one in the

1880s, is “the great moral disinfectant.” 31]] But if the media lost its higher role and pandered to the crowd, the public could be pulled down with it. The

possibility that the suggestibility of crowds could be magnifi ed rather than countered was underlined by the experience of the First World War. The U.S.

Government’s Committee on Public Information (CPI), set up as the coun-

try entered the war in 1917, impressed all those involved with the apparent

ease with which a bellicose opinion could be shaped by using every avail-

able means to put out the word about the danger of German militarism and

the need for a robust response. Led by former progressive journalist George

Creely, who famously observed that “people do not live by bread alone: they

live mostly by catch phrases,” the CPI used all media from townhall meet-

ings to movies to get across core messages.

One of those who had urged the formation of the CPI, was involved in

its activities, and was impressed by its performance was Walter Lippmann. 32]]

A precocious, high-minded, articulate, and infl uential journalist, Lippmann

was alive to the intellectual currents of the time. Before the war, he had

struck up a friendship with the elderly William James and was intrigued by

the psychoanalytical movement’s insights regarding the development of con-

sciousness and the sources of irrationality. He had become uneasy about how

the popular press was always pointing to conspiracies and searching for sen-

sationalist revelations. He saw this as fomenting unrest and making rational

debate impossible. In 1922 he published his landmark book _Public Opinion_ .

What people knew, he argued, was only through a “picture in their heads” of

the “pseudo-environment” to be found between people and their real envi-

ronment. Understanding the way these pictures were formed, sustained,

and challenged was important because it affected behavior. “But because it

_is_ behavior,” Lippmann observed, “the consequences, if they are acts, operate not in the pseudo-environment where the behavior is stimulated, but in

the real environment where action eventuates.” Or, as Chicago sociologist

William Thomas put it a few years later in a theorem which came to bear his

name: “If men defi ne situations as real, they are real in their consequences.” 33]]

Lippmann also noted the extent to which individuals clung on to their

“system of stereotypes” because it provided an “ordered, more or less consis-

tent picture of the world, to which our habits, our tastes, our capacities, our comforts and our hopes have adjusted themselves.” Because of this,

any disturbance of the stereotypes seems like an attack upon the foun-

dations of the universe. It is an attack upon the foundations of OUR

universe, and, where big things are at stake, we do not readily admit

that there is any distinction between our universe and the universe.

A world which turns out to be one in which those we honor are unwor-

thy, and those we despise are noble, is nerve-racking. There is anarchy

if our order of precedence is not the only possible one. 34

In addition to the familiar perceptual problems of prejudicial stereotypes,

most people lacked the time and the inclination to engage in a more disci-

plined search for the truth. If they relied on newspapers, then what they got was selective and simplifi ed.

Some form of picture was unavoidable but, picking up on a standard pro-

gressive theme, Lippmann feared that the pictures would be drawn by sec-

tional interests or by a press which played to natural selfi shness, supported by dubious advertising. All this meant that “public opinion” was suspect.

Contrary to the notion of a “common will” emerging naturally from the

people, public opinion in practice was a construct and democratic consent

could therefore be manufactured. The test of good government was not the

degree of public participation in the process but the quality of the output.

Unlike Dewey, who was confi dent that people were the best judges of their

own interests and participatory democracy the best means of creating a sense

of shared community, Lippmann was fi rmly on the side of representative

democracy. He was, however, with Dewey in his optimism about science,

including the social sciences, as a motor of progress.

Lippmann regretted that the social scientist was not yet playing this role,

whereas the engineer had been doing so for some time. He put this down to a

lack of confi dence. The social scientist was unable to “prove his theories before offering them to the public,” yet “if his advice is followed, and he is wrong, the consequences may be incalculable. He is in the nature of things far more

responsible, and far less certain.” Social scientists were therefore explaining decisions already taken but not infl uencing those yet to be taken. “The real sequence,” according to Lippmann, “should be one where the disinterested

expert fi rst fi nds and formulates the facts for the man of action, and later makes what wisdom he can out of comparison between the decision, which

he understands, and the facts, which he organized.” They could bring another

338

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

dimension to government, representing “the unseen” with a “constituency of intangibles,” covering “events that are out of sight, mute people, unborn

people, relations between things and people.” Contrary to later suggestions

that he wanted experts to rule, Lippmann’s prescription went no further than

encouraging them to tutor governments in what would make for wise policy.

Nor was he arguing that experts were superior to ordinary people. They were

required not so much as a counter to the masses but to the standard progres-

sive bugbears—the urban party machines, the big trusts, and a press that was

driven more by advertising revenue than a mission to inform. 35

One form of expertise that he saw coming to the fore was “persuasion” as

“a self-conscious art and a regular organ of popular government.” He con-

tinued with what turned out to be understatement: “None of us begins to

understand the consequences, but it is no daring prophecy to say that the

knowledge of how we create consent will alter every political premise.” Like

many others writing on this topic at this time, he was prepared to describe

this as “propaganda” without necessarily implying a sinister meaning. The

term’s origins lay in the Catholic Church’s methods of taking its teaching to those who were not yet converted. The standard defi nition of the time simply saw propaganda as any method “for the propagation of a particular doctrine

or practice.”

During the Great War, it had acquired its more sinister meaning as accu-

sations were made of deliberate lying in order to bolster morale or to confuse or slander enemies. Harold Lasswell, who was to become a major fi gure in

U.S. political science, made his name with a theory of propaganda. By his

defi nition it involved “the management of collective attitudes by the manip-

ulation of signifi cant symbols” and was socially “indispensable” given the

unavoidable gap between the public and the elite. He deplored the negative

connotations the concept had acquired. It was no more moral or immoral

than a “pump handle.” It was necessary because individuals were poor judges

of their own interests and so had to be helped by offi cially sanctioned com-

munication. With experts on the mobilization of opinion, what could once

“be done by violence and intimidation must now be done by argument and

persuasion.” 36 The strategic challenge for the propagandist was “to intensify

the attitudes favorable to his purpose, to reverse the attitudes hostile to it, and to attract the indifferent, or, at the worst, to prevent them from assuming a hostile bent.”

This sense of a struggle between reason and emotion, evident in the indi-

vidual but now elevated to a feature of a whole society, was become increas-

ingly infl uenced by Freudian theories. Freud challenged the distinction

between individual and group psychology. After the war he moved on from

f o r m u l a s , m y t h s , a n d p r o p a g a n d a

339

his dialectic of the unconscious and the conscious to a more complex structure. [^37] Now he identifi ed the “Id,” refl ecting those unconscious, instinctual, passionate, amoral, disorganized aspects of the personality, seeking pleasure,

“a cauldron full of seething excitations,” which the organized, conscious,

knowing ego seeks to manage by bringing in line with reality. It represented

reason and common sense, acting on the Id like “a man on horseback, who

has to hold in check the superior strength of the horse.” Its task was complicated by the super-ego, which brought to bear considerations of conscience

and morality—a legacy of the father fi gure and a refl ection of external infl uences such as teachers—posing socially appropriate behavior against what-

ever instant gratifi cation was sought by the Id.

An example of Freud’s infl uence was William Trotter, a British surgeon

who became an early follower. In 1916, Trotter published his book on the

“herd instinct,” based on articles written in 1908 and 1909 but reinforced

by the experience of war. Trotter argued that human beings were naturally

gregarious, and so were insecure and feared loneliness. This led to a fourth

instinct—in addition to self-preservation, nutrition, and sex—which had the

distinction of exercising “a controlling power upon the individual from with-

out” so that it impelled people to do things they would not otherwise wish to do. Trotter saw this as a source of the tension between individuals and society, between commonsense and prevailing norms, the source of senses of sin and

guilt. The idea of the “mass mind” and a fascination with the psychology of

crowds was not new, but those who had written on it before were apt to see it as a negative force, the source of mob actions, whereas Trotter encouraged a

more positive view. Freud respected Trotter’s views, although he judged that

they took too little account of the role of leadership and the need of members of a group to be “loved” by their leader. 38]]

The practical possibilities of these various ideas were demonstrated by

Edward Bernays, the best available example of the working propagandist at

this time. He was a nephew of Sigmund Freud and he traded on this rela-

tionship when explaining his understanding of emotions and irrationality.

After getting involved in the CPI, Bernays set himself up in 1919 as a public relations counsel (he was the fi rst to use the descriptor). Though his methods were all his own, both Lippmann and Freud were major infl uences on his

thinking. Politically he was a progressive and optimistic that the techniques he was describing could be used for the betterment of society, although this

optimism was shaken when he discovered that Goebbels’s library contained

his books. His fi rst book, _Crystallizing Public Opinion_ , was published in 1923, a year after Lippmann’s _Public Opinion_ , from which Bernays quoted liberally.

He sought to demonstrate that his was a respectable profession with serious

340

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

credentials, rooted in social science and psychiatry. In a complex society, governments, corporations, parties, charities, and a number of other groups were constantly striving to gain favor and advantage. Even if they had wanted to

ignore public opinion, the public had an interest in what they were up to.

He noted that large corporations and labor unions were now seen as “semi-

public services” and that the public, now enjoying the benefi ts of education and democracy, expected a voice in their conduct. Given this, there was a

requirement for expert advice about how to do this effectively. 39]]

This much in Bernay’s argument was unexceptional. What was striking

was the blunt language he used to describe what public relations profes-

sionals could offer, and the presumption of success. In _Crystallizing Public_ _Opinion_ , Bernays explained how “the natural inherent fl exibility of individual human nature” made it possible for governments to “regiment the

mind like the military regiments the body.” He opened a 1928 book, entitled

_Propaganda_ , by asserting that: “The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society.” Those responsible constituted “an invisible government

which is the true ruling power of our country.” As a result, “we are governed, our minds molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men

we have never heard of.” He argued for a strict ethical code for his profession, including that the needs of society as a whole come fi rst. He insisted that the masses could not be made to act against their core interests and that political leaders were by far the most important infl uences when it came to creating

“the established point of view.” Nonetheless, his formulations aggravated

the sense of an affront to democracy. If, as Lippmann also appeared to be

saying, opinions were shaped from the top down, this undermined the view

that in democracies, power should come from the bottom up. The conclusion

that Bernays drew from this was that by understanding the “mechanism and

motives of the group mind” it might be possible “to control and regiment

the masses according to our will without their knowing about it.” This he

thought could be done “at least up to a certain point and within certain

limits.” [^40]

Bernays as an advisor to governments, charities, and corporations was a

natural strategist. He distinguished himself from advertising men, whom

he portrayed as special pleaders seeking to get people to accept a particular commodity. His approach was more holistic (advising his clients on their

complete relationship with their environment) and indirect (seeking to get

people to view the world in different ways). In a later article with the provoc-

ative title “The Engineering of Consent,” 41 he explicitly discussed the strat-

egy of public relations. He also adopted the military metaphor. Having urged

f o r m u l a s , m y t h s , a n d p r o p a g a n d a

341

careful preparation in terms of available budget, clarity of objectives, and a survey of current thinking, attention must be given to the major themes,

which he described as “ever present but intangible,” comparable to the “story line” in fi ction, appealing to both the conscious and subconscious of the public. Then came the campaign: “The situation may call for a blitzkrieg or a

continuing battle, a combination of both, or some other strategy.” An elec-

tion might be close and need something quick. It would take longer to get

people to think differently about a health issue. When it came to tactics, he emphasized that the aim was not simply to get an article into a newspaper or

get a radio slot but “to create news,” by which he meant something that “juts out of the pattern of routine.” Events which made news could be communicated to “infi nitely more people than those actually participating, and such events vividly dramatize ideas for those who do not witness the events.” His

more famous campaigns were encouraging “bacon and eggs” for breakfast by

getting leading physicians to endorse the need for a “hearty” breakfast, hav-

ing famous fi gures from vaudeville meet with President Calvin Coolidge in

an attempt to boost his image, and—notably—an imaginative stunt for the

American Tobacco Company. He persuaded ten debutantes to light up with

their cigarettes during the 1929 Easter Parade, thereby notionally striking

a blow for feminism by undermining the taboo against women smoking in

public. The cigarettes became “torches of freedom.” 42

Bernays invited obvious criticisms: usurping the role of democracy by tak-

ing upon himself to shape peoples’ thoughts, encouraging mass effects rather

than individual responsibility, and relying on cliché and emotional attitudes rather than intellectual challenge. Bernays argued that in an age of mass

media, the techniques were unavoidable and propaganda was ubiquitous.

People and groups had a right to promote their ideas and the competition

in doing so was healthy for both democracy and capitalism. He also invited

an exaggerated response, because of the exaggerated claims he made for his

profession and his eager embrace of the mantle of propagandist. 43]] While after the Second World War this was a mantle few would accept, the issue of how

political consciousness developed and could be infl uenced was well estab-

lished. Bernays’s contribution was to demonstrate that the impulses need not

only be to shape thinking about underlying political ideologies but also to

frame more specifi c issues. During the course of the political struggles of the 1950s and 1960s over race and war, strategies came to focus increasingly on

how to create the right impression.

The totalitarian ideologies of Communism and Nazism attempted to

demonstrate in practice the suggestibility of the broad masses to political

formulas devised by a privileged elite. They sought deliberately to insert

342

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

coherent worldviews into the consciousness of whole populations and enforce their dictates, sliding over the evident anomalies and inconsistencies and

gaps that developed with lived experience. Their success, moreover, owed

much to the fearful consequences of any shows of dissent, doubt, or devia-

tion from the party line. Once the coercive spell was broken, the underlying

ideas struggled to survive on their own. Belief systems turned out to be more complex and varied and public opinion less malleable than the elite theorists had supposed. What Bernays was pointing to was something more subtle, at

levels below grand ideological confrontations, where the attitudes involved

were more specifi c and the behavioral consequences less demanding. Rather

than words governing deeds, as anticipated by the ideologists, there was a

close relationship between the two, and successful politicians and campaign-

ers realized that this needed to be understood if even fl eeting victories were to be achieved, never mind lasting change.

The Power of Nonviolence

_When evil men plot, good men must plan._

—Martin Luther King, Jr.

An improved understanding of how to infl uence public opinion

offered new opportunities for political strategy. Those who for reasons

of ethics or prudence did not wish to resort to force could consider strategies based on creating persuasive impressions, moving opinion in their direction

without coercion. The strength of these strategies, however, depended on the

extent to which they were moving elites along with the public. Even if there

were shifts among the public, what would be the mechanisms by which this

would affect the policies of governments? Was it just a question of repack-

aging good ideas to ensure that they attracted attention, or would they still need some pressure behind them to achieve the desired response?

Many of these issues were addressed by the suffragette movement. The

advance of democracy in Western capitalist states might have blunted the

revolutionary ardor of the labor movement by offering constitutional means

to redress grievances, but it also added to the sense of injustice felt by those denied democratic rights. The British Empire, with a liberal ideology at its

beating heart but institutionalized suppression around its periphery, was

rocked most by demands for political equality. Among these, including anti-

colonial campaigns and agitation for Irish Home Rule, was a determined and

eventually successful campaign by women demanding the right to vote. This

campaign was unique because it posed a challenge not only to the political system but also to orthodox views of gender and the most basic of human

relationships. The tactics adopted by the suffragette movement had a lasting

impact not only as a means of gaining attention in the face of male conde-

scension but also as a direct challenge to stereotypes of femininity, such as a supposed inability to develop and sustain a political argument. At the same

time, part of the case was that women not only deserved equality but would

bring special qualities to public life.

The campaign in Britain stretched from proposals to include women’s

suffrage in the Reform Act of 1867 to the Equal Franchise Act of 1928.

Female political rights extended slowly over this period, as women moved

into philanthropic and civic affairs. There was dogged resistance to granting women the same rights as men, and it only broke under the weight of the

First World War. The suffragette campaign had many strands: some were

prepared to work with the established political parties while others found

this futile; some framed the issue narrowly in terms of political rights while others sought to address economic issues and challenge orthodox male expectations of a woman’s role. In terms of strategy, there was a constitutional

wing—which worked through petitions, lobbying, and demonstrations—

and a militant wing—the Women’s Social and Political Union (WSPU), led

by the redoubtable mother and daughter team of Emmeline and Christabel

Pankhurst. As to which had the most effect, or whether they detracted from

or reinforced each other, opinions are still divided. The militants are now

best remembered for the direct action: slashing paintings, arson, breaking

windows, chaining themselves to railings, and prison hunger strikes. But

they were only one part of a movement that was extremely varied in its forms

and preoccupations.

The militancy developed as a result of progressive disillusion, fi rst with

the Liberal Party reluctance to honor its ideals, then with the lack of pri-

ority given to women by the labor movement, and a growing conviction

that legislative routes were being exhausted. The core themes, however, were

derived from classic liberal ideals: opposition to forms of arbitrary power that resulted in individuals having obligations but no rights. The rhetoric could

be traced back to the French Revolution and then the Chartists, except that

gender now displaced class. The militant tactics were justifi ed on the basis, as Christabel Pankhurst put it, that “those who are outside the Constitution

have no ordinary means of securing admission; and therefore they must try

extraordinary means.” The techniques used by the WSPU helped them gain

attention, although what might have worked most to their advantage was

the opportunity as a result of being arrested to make their case in court and t h e p o w e r o f n o n v i o l e n c e

345

turn a defense against criminal charges into a political debate. In a jury trial in 1912, for example, Emmeline Pankhurst was able to present herself and

her organization as smart, eloquent, capable, well organized, and not at all

emotional or hysterical. In particular, she and other suffragettes were able to give their acts a compelling political rationale, which led in Emmeline’s case to the jury calling for leniency.

After this, the rhetoric became more extreme. Christabel Pankhurst even

invoked terrorism. The “politically disinherited ones, whether they are men

or whether they are women,” she insisted, “are obliged to challenge the phys-

ical force used by their tyrant to keep them in bondage.” While passive resistance was dismissed as subservient, active resistance was claimed as “grander and more purifying.” There were more attacks on property, though not on

people. This led to concerns elsewhere in the movement that militancy rather

than suffrage was becoming the issue. Supporters drifted away, and WSPU

moved more underground. In the end, the war provided a useful pretext for

ending the militancy without losing face. Indeed, while those on the nonvio-

lent wing of the movement were antiwar, the Pankhursts became active in

war work and were notable for strident anti-German, anti-pacifi st, and later

anti-Bolshevik rhetoric. 1

The American suffragette movement, which achieved its goal in 1920,

was far less militant. There was a close link with the progressive movement,

which pushed to the fore the stresses of industrialization, such as poor women forced to work for meager wages while still caring for children. Although it

did become more activist in the years before the First World War in response

to the rather staid practice of the main association and contacts with the

British movement, the preferred method in America was to show numeri-

cal strength through picketing, rallies, and parades. Quakerism, which had

long allowed women a role—even as preachers—particularly infl uenced the

movement. Quakers provided much of the early leadership and insistence on

Existential Strategy

_There is a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious,_

_makes you so sick at heart, that you can’t take part; you can’t even tacitly_ _take part, and you’ve got to put your bodies upon the levers, upon all the_ _apparatus and you’ve got to make it stop. And you’ve got to indicate to_

_the people who run it, to the people who own it, that unless you’re free, the_ _machines will be prevented from working at all._

—Mario Savio, _Free Speech Movement, December 1964_

It had been young people who had sustained the later campaigns of the

civil rights movement. Their experiences in the South had radicalized

them, both in their critique of American society and their demand for a new

politics. In the early 1960s to the extent that they were organized it was as part of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), which was

largely made up of black activists (although initially not exclusively so), or else the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), which as the name suggests

was based in the universities and was largely white. Both initially refl ected anger at the gap between the ideals upon which their country was based and

the reality of racial divides and preparations for nuclear war. Both were set up with fi rm commitments to nonviolence, but both by the end of the 1960s

had embraced violence and factionalism.

Of the two, SDS attracted the most comment: an active and radical political force emerging out of a disadvantaged minority was less surprising than

one emerging out of the affl uent majority. Moreover, SDS came to be seen as

part of a broad cultural shift that went well beyond politics. There was a generational break between those whose formative experiences had been depres-

sion and the fi ght against Germany and Japan and those who had grown

up in relative comfort but found the social constraints they had inherited

frustrating. This was refl ected in changing musical preferences, attitudes to sex, and the use of recreational drugs. A key word for the decade, borrowed

from anti-colonial struggles, was “liberation.” The word came to be applied

to any group, including women and gays, that felt constrained by social con-

ventions and outdated laws. In this respect, it challenged the role of the state in everyday life and was individualistic rather than collectivist in inspiration.

This helps explain why there was such an uneasy fi t with the orthodox

Left, which was collectivist and enthusiastic about the possibilities of the

state and the role of labor unions. It had been marginalized by affl uence, its rhetoric seen as an echo of old struggles long lost and won, with its internal politics still marked by in-fi ghting between communists, Trotskyites, and

social democrats. The young activists fresh from the freedom rides in the

South, where they had often been in jail or suffered beatings, had little time for those who had spent their time trading theoretical blueprints for socialism. Although SDS was intended initially to be the student branch of the

League for Industrial Democracy, another of John Dewey’s causes which now

represented the pro-union, anti-communist strand in American socialism, it

took off on its own trajectory. So the revolt was against not only the complacent liberalism and social conservatism of mainstream America but also the

social democratic tradition. This tradition of mass parties organized to fi ght parliamentary elections on the basis of an agreed program refl ecting a more

or less coherent ideology had never really taken root in America. The new

radicals were more in a libertarian, anarchist, anti-elitist tradition, desperate for authenticity even at the expense of lucidity, suspicious of all authorities and organizational discipline. Instead of decisions being taken by individuals who were detached, remote, and looking after their own interests, a way

had to be found to engage ordinary people so that they could shape their own

destinies.

When SDS was formed in 1962, meeting at the United Auto-Workers

retreat at Port Huron, Michigan, there was a clash with the social democrats

of the League for Industrial Democracy. Tom Hayden, a Michigan student

journalist and the lead author of the Port Huron Statement that set SDS in

motion, described his wonder that “seemingly serious people could get so

e x i s t e n t i a l s t r a t e g y

367

enmeshed in such endlessly divisive hair-splitting debates.” “As a formative experience,” he noted, “we learned a distrust and hostility toward the very

people we were closest to historically, the representatives of the liberal and labor organizations who had once been young radicals themselves.” [^1] The old leftists in turn were shocked by the indifference of the young activists to

the working-class cause and the unions, and their reluctance to get drawn

into denunciations of communism. Instead of the rigorous analysis of clas-

sic texts, the new radicals were suspicious of theory. Political acts had to be genuine expressions of values and sentiments. Convictions took priority over

the calculation of consequences, refl ecting a wariness of expediency and a

refusal to compromise for the sake of political effects. At times it seemed as if deliberate and systematic thought was suspect and only a spontaneous stream

of consciousness, however inarticulate and unintelligible, could be trusted.

Todd Gitlin, an early activist and later analyst of the New Left, observed

how actions were undertaken to “dramatize” convictions. They were “judged

according to how they made the participants feel,” as if they were drugs offering highs and lows. If it was the immediate experience which counted for

most, then there was little scope for thinking about the long term. 2

This left the new radicals caught by Weber’s paradox. Though Weber

was dispirited by the steady bureaucratization of society and politics, he considered it irresponsible to ignore the logic of functionality. The emerging

political form of the new radicals embraced an ethic of irresponsibility. There could be no separation of means and ends. Every compromise, every denial of

a core value meant that something precious had been lost, diminishing what-

ever might eventually be achieved. Their tactics, highlighted by the sit-in,

instinctively challenged all rules. They were often strikingly lacking in both theory and organization, reveling in activism but without a clear direction.

The underlying philosophy was existentialist rather than socialist.

This experiment in existential strategy failed because those features that

made it so culturally liberating, and where the effects were actually long-

lasting, also made it politically exasperating. When positions were articu-

lated in terms of core values rather than alternative outcomes compromises

were hard to arrange and coalitions became fragile. Without hierarchy, when

every decision was subject to constant challenge and re-examination, orga-

nization became slow and ponderous, and implementation tentative. The

activists, doubting rationality and trusting feelings, became increasingly

angry. Their distaste for the politics of expedience and compromise led to

isolation and irrelevance and vulnerability to the intervention of groups

based on hard theory and disciplined organization against which they had

initially rebelled.

_Rebels_

Instead of the polarized class struggle anticipated by Marx, postwar capitalist society was marked by an improved standard of living, apparently developing into a self-satisfi ed but undifferentiated mass society. The salaried middle classes were on the ascendant, largely to be found in large, impersonal organizations. The daily grind of life was hardly grueling. Yet there appeared to be something missing. The critique was not of growing misery and poverty but

of dreariness, not so much physical deprivation but of a psychological void.

William Whyte’s _The Organization Man_ suggested a degree of homogenization in the American middle class, refl ected in standardized career paths,

consumer tastes, and cultural sensibilities, with an accompanying degree

of docility. The fault, he argued, was not in organization but its worship,

“the soft-minded denial that there is a confl ict between the individual and

society.” 3 Indeed, much of the writing about this group, including David]]

Riesman’s _The Lonely Crowd_ and C. Wright Mills’s _White Collar Workers_ , suggested that the rise of this class was joyless.

Riesman argued that inner-directed personalities followed life goals

established at an early age, had a strong sense of values, and were therefore apt to suffer from guilt when deviating from those values. They were giving

way to other-directed personalities, who took cues from their environment

and were dependent on their contemporaries or even the media for direction.

The distinction was between following either an internal gyroscope or an

external radar. _The Lonely Crowd_ became one of the most popular books ever written by a sociologist. In contrast to the earlier progressives who looked to other-directedness as a means of binding society together and encouraging a

democratic sensitivity, it encouraged the view, probably more than Riesman

intended, that there was something pernicious about social conventions and

political orthodoxy as uncritically transmitted through the mass media. 4]] The idea that adapting to the social environment risked denying core values was

also a theme of Erich Fromm’s _Fear of Freedom_ . Fromm, a refugee from Nazi Germany, warned of the dangers of rootless individuals seeking security in

conformism or authoritarianism. Freedom had to be about more than lack

of restrictions. It needed to be more positive, creative, authentic, expressive, and spontaneous, as well as less respectful of the received wisdom of experts or the dictates of common sense. Social structures were presented as suppressing the natural, positive side of human nature rather than as restraining the

negative, coercive side. 5

The enthusiasts for the cultural developments of the 1960s saw it as an

affi rmation of this positive side of human nature against the conformism of

e x i s t e n t i a l s t r a t e g y

369

the corporate state. When in 1970 Theodore Roszak looked back approvingly over that decade, he described the many developments he applauded as

responses to the “technocracy.” This, echoing Weber, was described as corpo-

rate power combined with a state of mind according to which

the requirements of our humanity yield wholly to some manner of for-

mal analysis which can be carried out by specialists possessing certain

impenetrable skills which can then be translated by them directly into

a congeries of economic and social programs, personnel management

procedures, merchandise, and mechanical gadgetry.

These experts, to be found at the corporate center, believed that most human

needs had been fi lled; where there was a problem, it was the result of a mis-

understanding. 6]] In different ways, Roszak claimed, the poetry, literature, sociology, political tracts, and demonstrations of the time challenged this

technocratic presumption. In this respect, the politics of the decade was

but one part of a general revolt against rationality, whether in challenges

to bureaucracy and scientifi c expertise, or in hedonistic life styles and the disparagement of conventional careers. Claims of objective knowledge

were distrusted. Instead of worldviews being shaped by the accumulation

of knowledge, “knowledge” always deserved quotation marks, refl ecting an

underlying worldview rather than actual reality.

What did this mean for strategy? At a general level it challenged an idea

of strategy based on not only the presumption of choice but also the avail-

ability of methods for choosing well, which included the need to pay close

attention to the operating environment and think ahead. In some respects,

liberalism as it had developed through the twentieth century could pride

itself on having created the optimal conditions for strategy-making: the right of free political expression, the ability to organize, and respect for the scientifi c method as a means of bringing clarity to choice and thinking through

consequences. Now the New Left appeared to see this approach as problem-

atic, a form of thinking that constrained the range of choice and excluded

those affected by decisions from contributing to their resolution, and a stress on organization, which meant hierarchy.

It could also be the case that there was little point in worrying too much

about relating ends and means because of the utter hopelessness of the stra-

tegic task in the face of a complacent majority culture. The aspirations of the young radicals were beyond the scope of rational planning. Not surprisingly,

therefore, a strategy of absolute ends emerged, heroic and romantic, doomed

to fail but magnifi cent in its ambition and noble in its honesty. The aim was to affi rm existence rather than realize goals, and in this there was a nod across 370

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

the Atlantic to the French existentialists with their deep musings about the human condition, full of absurdity, abandonment, and despair, but also

stressing the unavoidability of choice. Jean-Paul Sartre might seem to dwell

on the futility of action, but his point was that hopelessness was not in itself a reason for passivity. Indeed, choice was unavoidable for men were “condemned to be free.” They did not choose the circumstances of their existence, but they were obliged to respond. The quality of their responses, whether

heroic or cowardly, was their responsibility and would eventually defi ne their

lives. 7]] More infl uential than Sartre, at least in the United States, was Albert Camus. Politically, Camus was closer to the anarchists than the communists,

and his strong anti-Soviet views caused a break with Sartre. In 1940, he was

a pacifi st but the experience of occupation led him to join the resistance,

eventually editing the underground journal, _Combat_ . This was the inspiration for his allegorical 1947 novel, _The Plague_ . As a plague almost overwhelmed the Algerian City of Oran, the citizens were in denial and then, instead of

abandoning hope, the community found a way of defeating the disease and

regained its solidarity in the process. The doctor, Bernard Rieux, summed up

the philosophy: “All I maintain is that on this earth there are pestilences and there are victims, and it’s up to us, so far as possible, not to join forces with

the pestilences.” 8]] From Camus came the argument that rebellion made a life worth living, even when this meant acting in the face of overwhelming odds.

So long as one was acting with integrity there was no need to worry about

being an underdog, for integrity mattered more than consequences.

_Mills and Power_

C. Wright Mills died of a heart attack in his mid-40s in 1962. Mills was

controversial at the time and has remained so since, not least because of his larger than life personality and his readiness to cast himself as a dissident. 9]]

He was the classic inner-directed man, true to his own values, describing

himself as a loner who never worked with a political group. The early years

of his career saw him subjected to three infl uences, two of which remained

critical for his own ideas. The pragmatists were the fi rst infl uence, and the subject of his doctorate. He shared their belief in the public role of intellectuals. There was an affi nity with James’s anti-militarism and Dewey’s advocacy of participatory democracy. At the same time, Mills was skeptical of Dewey’s

quasi-scientifi c framework and over-mechanical view of politics, his reluc-

tance to come to terms with the problem of power and to acknowledge its

manipulative, emotional, and coercive elements. 10 Y]]et Mills also appreciated e x i s t e n t i a l s t r a t e g y

371

Dewey’s commitment to intelligence as a form of power. Both were opinionated, although by contrast with Dewey’s ponderously functional prose,

Mills’s was laced with invective and value-laden categories.

Hans Gerth, an émigré from the Frankfurt School, helped move Mills

from philosophy to sociology, and introduced him to the work of Max Weber.

From Weber, Mills then derived his basic explanatory framework, the inter-

weaving of class, status, power, and culture, and the alarm at the role of

large bureaucracies in all areas of life. Marx was not read or taken seriously by Mills until well into his career, after which Mills became progressively

more Marxist. He was also becoming more of an activist intellectual toward

the end of his life, defending the Cuban Revolution and developing links

with the British New Left (composed of Marxists, often scholarly, who had

left the Communist Party). Part of his appeal to students was that he already identifi ed them as potential agents of change, ready to challenge the forces of inertia and conservatism. [^11]

His books combined subtle analysis and research with a searing social

critique. The critique became more strident during the course of the 1950s

as his own international reputation as a dissenting intellectual grew. He was preoccupied with the structures of power: how in modern corporate America

the elite no longer needed brute force or coercion to sustain its position but could instead rely on manipulation. His target was what came to be described

as the “pluralist” school, which argued that democracy could function with

a relatively low level of citizen participation. Since everybody got something out of the political process and had no cause for either excessive distress or joy, somehow it was working effectively and fairly.

The debate on power was an important one and Mills’s book, _The Power_

_Elite_ , was always cited on one side of the argument, often against Robert Dahl’s _Who Governs: Democracy and Power in an American City_ . [^12] Part of the diffi culty was that they refl ected two different views of power and how to

measure it, and both views were relevant to the developing debates about

radical politics. Power was, and still is, regularly referred to as an attribute of a political entity, measured in terms of the more blatant indicators of military and economic strength. Yet it was evident that an ample stock of both

did not guarantee favorable outcomes in all encounters. The powerful did

not always get their way. Resources needed to be considered in the context

of the problems they were supposed to solve. A card player might have great

skill and a wonderful hand of cards for bridge but not for poker. There was

therefore a difference between _putative_ and _actual_ power, between capabilities

and effects, the potential and the act. 13]] Dahl’s defi nition stressed the ability to infl uence: “A has power over B to the extent that he can get B to do

372

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

something that B would not otherwise do.” 14]] It was not enough that A had capacity: it was only really power as revealed in quite specifi c relationships through measurable effects, by B being made subject to A’s will.

One of the most important and lasting challenges to this view came not

from Mills but two political scientists, Peter Bachrach and Morton Baratz,

in a 1962 article:

Of course power is exercised when A participates in the making of

decisions that affect B. But power is also exercised when A devotes his

energies to creating or reinforcing social and political values and insti-

tutional practices that limit the scope of the political process to public

consideration of only those issues which are comparatively innocuous

to A. To the extent that A succeeds in doing this, B is prevented, for

all practical purposes, from bringing to the fore any issues that might

in their resolution be seriously detrimental to A’s set of preferences. 15]]

This second face of power had an almost insidious quality: it was about how

A sustained a position in a power structure, of power over others, by keeping issues off the agenda and creating a background consensus that denied B the

opportunity to begin to challenge A, never mind defeat A in a direct con-

frontation. It was this line of critique that by the end of the decade had been embraced by the radicals, although often in a far cruder, “false-consciousness”

way than these authors intended. Mills avoided the simple Marxist analysis

of government being the executive committee of the ruling class or of mass

consciousness being shaped by bourgeois ideology. His description of the

power elite was more about a bureaucratic convergence of interests, including corporate executives and the “warlords,” than an organized conspiracy, but he insisted that the system of checks and balances was no longer working and

so encouraged the view of a vital resource being monopolized by a privileged

view, so that they could get what they wanted when they wanted it. 16]]

Mills became as much of a pamphleteer as a scholar, “prepared to step forth

and brazenly pin his indictment like a target to the enemy’s chest.” 17]] His catchy rhetoric remained nonetheless an extension of his sociology. His impatience with mainstream sociology was refl ected in his book _The Sociological_ _Imagination_ , 18 in which he derided what he saw to be the two false paths]]

of mainstream sociology: self-important grand theory on the one hand and

abstracted empiricism, full of microscopic studies that remained marginal

to the big questions of the day, on the other. The true purpose, he insisted, should be to connect private troubles with social and political structures. If an individual was unemployed that was a private trouble: if 20 percent of the population was unemployed that was a structural issue and thus a task for

e x i s t e n t i a l s t r a t e g y

373

sociology. In this role, he argued, sociology could be the master discipline of politics. The sociological imagination would feed the political imagination.

“Before you are through with any piece of work, no matter how indirectly

on occasion,” he insisted, “orient it to the central and continuing task of

understanding the structure and the drift, the shaping and the meanings, of

your own period, the terrible and magnifi cent world of human society in the

second half of the twentieth century.”

_The Port Huron Statement_

Tom Hayden was a natural wordsmith and was the fi rst to fi nd fresh language to convey a new mood. The Port Huron Statement, for which he was the lead

author, was discussed in June 1962 by a group of about sixty people, feel-

ing—as he later remarked—that they “were giving voice to a new generation

of rebels.” [^19] There were a number of infl uences. Arnold Kaufman, Hayden’s philosophy professor at Michigan, had introduced him to John Dewey as an

exponent of the democratization of all social institutions. From Camus came

a way of thinking about rebellion as a way of life, and from C. Wright Mills

a critique of the prevailing distribution of power, but also something more

personal. It was partly that they were both lapsed Catholics. But it was also that what unsettled him about his own family could be explained. As he read

Mills, Hayden saw a portrait of his father, an accountant for Chrysler: “proud in his starched white collar, occupying his accountant’s niche above the union work force and below the real decision makers, penciling in numbers by day,

drinking in front of the television at night, muttering about the world to no one in particular.” 20]]

Mills explained for Hayden “the factors that made people uninterested

and apathetic in the face of Camus’s plague.” Bureaucratic elites welcomed

passivity and had no incentive to encourage true democracy. Mills had writ-

ten of the emergence of the “cheerful robot,” a creature of mass society with an illusion of freedom but unable to infl uence the larger structures of power.

“Between the little man’s consciousness and the issues of our time, there

seems to be a veil of indifference. His will seems numb; his spirit meager.”

In this spirit the Port Huron Statement opened, acknowledging the awk-

wardness of the position of students: “We are people of this generation, bred in at least modest comfort, housed now in universities, looking uncomfortably at the world we inherit.” They did not claim to be speaking for the

masses but were a self-declared minority observing that “the vast majority

of our people regard the temporary equilibriums of our society and world

374

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

as eternally-functional parts.” Students “don’t even give a damn about the apathy.” [^21]

A Millsian analysis was offered of why people felt so powerless and had

succumbed to indifference: “People are fearful of the thought that at any

moment things might be thrust out of control. They fear change, since

change might smash whatever invisible framework seems to hold back chaos

from them now.” Yet here was optimism about humanity. “We regard men as

infi nitely precious and possessed of unfulfi lled capacities for reason, freedom, and love.” If core values could be rediscovered in a “moral realignment” then

there was a possibility of a “political realignment.” 22 Politics was not a means

to an end. It was an end in itself, participation and engagement serving to

heal the divide that had opened up between people and their society. The

New Left, the statement insisted,

must transform modern complexity into issues that can be understood

and felt close-up by every human being. It must give form to the feel-

ings of helplessness and indifference so that people may see the politi-

cal, social and economic sources of their private troubles and organize

to change society. In a time of supposed prosperity, moral compla-

cency and political manipulation, a new left cannot rely on only ach-

ing stomachs to be the engine of social reform. 23

The immediate cause for the students was civil rights in the South. This met

their appetite for activism and provided experiences that were more instruc-

tive and meaningful than anything that could be gained through studying

the political classics. But that could only take the movement so far. The

aim was to move the demand for rights into all institutions rather than just

the electoral process. The starting point for their demands to be heard was

therefore their own institutions—the universities. Here they were expected

to conform, accept what they were told in class without demur, and follow all rules at risk of expulsion. Gradually this new mood made itself felt. A clash over the rights of CORE to organize on the San Francisco Berkeley campus

led to the fi rst big student demonstrations.

Dick Flacks, a young academic closely involved with the Port Huron

Statement, observed the tension between the developing movement as a

way of life and as an agency of change. The way of life he called “exis-

tential humanism,” which required no more than acting according to core

beliefs, constantly striving “to approach an ethical existence,” but he saw

that this could be irresponsible, searching “for a personally satisfying mode of life while abandoning the possibility of helping others to change theirs;

of placing tremendous hope in the movement of the immediate community

e x i s t e n t i a l s t r a t e g y

375

for achieving personal salvation and gratifi cation—then realizing that these possibilities are, after all, limited and, consequently suffering disillusionment.” As did Weber, Flacks sought to reconcile convictions with

responsibility. This meant acting “politically because our values cannot be

realized in any durable sense without a reconstruction of the political and

social system.” Politics, however, apart from an existential ethic would be

“increasingly manipulative, power-oriented, sacrifi cial of human lives and

souls,”—in short, “corrupted.” The answer, suggested Flacks, was “strategic

analysis,” though he acknowledged the prevailing suspicion of an “explicit

and systematic preoccupation with strategy” as imposing artifi cial con-

straints, restricting spontaneity, and reducing responsiveness to what people really wanted. As it was the property of a few, “acting in terms of strategy

is elitist.” Unfortunately, without strategy there would be no sense of pri-

orities, inarticulateness, and “almost random behavior among students who

want to do effective social action.” [^24]

This described the problem rather than identifi ed solutions. As with pre-

vious generations of radicals, the only way out of the dilemma appeared to be to get among the people, working with them to address their issues without

claiming that they had all the answers. So it was that Hayden joined a com-

munity program, the Economic Research and Action Project, in Newark.

The prohibition on elitism was limiting. There were other “liberal forces”

in the area with whom it might be advisable to coalesce, but Hayden found

them “extremely self-serving,” with “wide community contact but no active

and radical membership base” and programs that “would do very little to

change the real lives of the poor.” Entering into “political bartering” would violate “the basic trust we have with the neighborhood people. Our place is

at the bottom.” 25 Liberal strategies assumed that the “masses are apathetic

and can only be roused because of simple material needs or during short

periods of great enthusiasm.” Because of this, “they need skilled and respon-

sible leaders.” The complaint then followed a familiar path: leaders presumed that only they could maintain the organization. Because people reacted with

“disinterest or suspicion” to such elitism, the leadership was able to call the masses apathetic, although he also acknowledged a worrying tendency to

“think subserviently.”

Hayden was considering not the broad masses of Marxist mythology but

a minority underclass. 26 He recoiled from the obvious answer]], which was to form coalitions or at least make temporary arrangements with the powerful.

This was rejected because no more than “welfare-state reforms” would be on

offer, bound to fail because they were “not conceived by the poor people they are designed for” and allowed the middle class to relax “into the comfortable 376

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

sense that everything is being managed well.” His focus was so relentlessly about power, and avoiding appearing to want it, that the assumption had to

be that if those at the bottom had power they would do well by themselves

and others. But would they want the things that the activist believed they

ought to want? If their minds had been turned by years of powerlessness and

a consumerist culture, might their demands and the efforts they were pre-

pared to put behind be disappointing?

Unsurprisingly, he was left with a “mystery” when looking for a “work-

able strategy.” His aim was “a thoroughly democratic revolution,” reversing

the abdication of power to “top-down organizational units,” out of which a

“new kind of man” might emerge who could not be manipulated because

it was “precisely against manipulation that he has defi ned his rebellion.”

The poor would transform decision-making by acting on their aspirations,

working against the grain of “an affl uent and coercive society.” As he later accepted, the fl aw in this analysis was assuming that the aspirations of the poor would be any different from the middle-class society whose values he

personally derided. He already was aware of the diffi culty of fi nding lead-

ers who could forswear an interest in the organization for its own sake or a

rank and fi le who understood and committed themselves to the movement’s

goals. 27

While Hayden was struggling to sustain his commitment to participa-

tory democracy, SNCC was in the process of abandoning it. James Forman, as

executive secretary, had argued in 1964 for a proper mass organization rather than uncoordinated activists to compete with other civil rights organizations. To the centralizers, this simply required individuals to subordinate

their own issues to the needs of the collective.

This was hard for many activists to take. They were afraid that a dis-

tant center would be insensitive to local concerns and indulge in empire-

building. Moreover, it went against SNCC’s founding ethos. Participatory

democracy in practice, however, had been found frustrating and exhausting.

There were the familiar problems of fi nding local people able to commit

time and energy to the cause, and the tendency for the principle to paralyze

decision-making with constant discussions which nobody dared bring to a

conclusion, as every attempt to take an initiative was challenged as usurpa-

tion of democratic rights. In her book, _Freedom Is an Endless Meeting_ , Francesca Polletta recounts how demands to “let the people decide” came up against

the exasperating tendency of the people to be moderate and risk averse, seek-

ing social services rather than revolution. This led to the conviction that

people needed to have their real interests explained to them. There were also deeper factors at work. There was an issue with educated northerners who

e x i s t e n t i a l s t r a t e g y

377

were often seen by the local southerners as being self-serving, with a patronizing reverence for the untutored wisdom of the poor and ignorance of local

culture. According to Polletta, this was more about class and education than

race, though there were concerns about white liabilities as black community

organizers. By 1966, however, black power had taken over and the new lead-

ership of SNCC wanted to distinguish themselves from northern liberals by

something tougher and more militant. 28

_The Heroic Organizer_

It is worth comparing the experience of community organization as an exer-

cise in participatory democracy with that of the man who did more than

most to develop the idea of organizing local communities to take on local

power structures. Saul Alinsky was born in Chicago in 1909 and joined the

University of Chicago’s sociology department as an undergraduate in 1926.

The department was then under the leadership of Robert Park. Park, who

had come to sociology later in his career after starting off as a reporter, was attuned to city life in all its forms and studied it with an almost voyeuristic curiosity. _Introduction to the Science of Sociology_ , the book he published in 1921

with his close colleague Edwin Burgess, was for two decades a core text in

the fi eld. Burgess, a diffi dent man and in Parks’s shadow, was more of a social reformer. He viewed “social research as the solutions to society’s ills,” but less in terms of elite prescriptions and more in democratic terms, as a means of

“harnessing social change.” [^29]

Park and Burgess took students on fi eld trips to explore Chicago, from the

dance halls to the schools, the churches, and the families. The city was large and diverse, with distinctive immigrant communities. Organized criminal

gangs, of which Al Capone’s was the most famous, fl ourished during the

Prohibition Era. The proximity to Canada meant that Chicago was a natural

base for smuggling illicit liquor into the United States, and vicious com-

petition developed over the control of the trade. The city should be a focus

of study, Park argued, for it showed “the good and evil in human nature in

excess. It is this fact, perhaps, more than any other which justifi es the view that would make of the city a laboratory or clinic in which human nature and

social processes may be most conveniently and profi tably studied.” [^30] Critical to this school of thought was the conviction, bolstered by research, that social problems had social rather than personal causes. Burgess took this a step

further than Park, arguing that the role of researchers was to “organize the

community for self-investigation.” The community should survey its own

378

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

problems, educate themselves about social issues, and develop a core group of leaders prepared to organize for “social advance.”

Burgess became a major infl uence on Alinsky, not least because he rec-

ognized in his student an ability that his academic record had obscured. [^31]

Alinsky was drawn to criminology and upon graduation, he got a fellowship

with Burgess’s support. He decided to make a study of the Capone gang, if

possible from the inside. Eventually he made contact by hanging around the

gangsters and listening to their stories. 32]] For a while he worked as a crimi-nologist in a state prison. Then, in 1936 he joined the Chicago Area Project

designed to show how delinquency could be addressed socially. The cause

of criminality was not individual feeble-mindedness but neighborhoods

marked by multiple and reinforcing problems of poverty and unemploy-

ment. Burgess set the principles for the organizers. The program should be

for the neighborhood as a whole, with local people autonomous in planning

and operations. This required an emphasis on training and local leadership,

strengthening established neighborhood institutions, and using activities as

a device to create participation. 33 He ar]]gued that local organizers, preferably former delinquents, could help show their own people a way to more acceptable behavior. This approach was controversial. He was directly challenging

paternalistic social work and was accused of tolerating criminality, encouraging populist agitators to stir up local people against those who were trying to help them and had their best interests at heart.

In 1938, Alinsky was assigned to the tough Back of the Yards neighbor-

hood in Chicago, already notorious as the jungle of Upton Sinclair’s 1906

novel. He was a natural in the organizer’s role. Clever, street-wise, and brash, Alinsky had a knack of gaining the confi dence of people who might otherwise feel neglected and marginalized. His approach was more political than

the project allowed, however. Not only did he use the issue of delinquency

to move into virtually all problems facing the neighborhood, but he also put

together a community organization based on representatives of key groups

who had clout because of who they represented and not just as individuals.

Alinsky also drew organized labor into his campaign, well exceeding his brief by getting involved in a struggle against the meatpacking industry. By 1940

he had left the project and struck out on his own.

Over time he became more scathing in his critique of the social sci-

ences as remote from the realities of everyday existence. Quoting a descrip-

tion of the University of Chicago’s sociology department as “an institution

that invests $100,000 on a research program to discover the location of

brothels that any taxi driver could tell them about for nothing,” he added

his own observation that “asking a sociologist to solve a problem is like

e x i s t e n t i a l s t r a t e g y

379

prescribing an enema for diarrhea.” 34 Certainly tendencies in sociology had

moved on since the Park/Burgess era at Chicago. Nonetheless, Alinsky’s

initial trajectory refl ected the preoccupations of the discipline during the interwar years.

In an article published in the _American Journal of Sociology_ in 1941, Alinsky provided a clear account of his approach. He described the wretched lives of

those working in the slaughter houses and packing-houses of the Back of the

Yards area. The neighborhood was a “byword for disease, delinquency, dete-

rioration, dirt, and dependency.” The traditional community organization

would be of little value in such an area because it considered individual problems in isolation from each other and the community in isolation from the

“general social scene.” Instead, by placing each community within its broad

context, its limited ability to “elevate itself by means of its own bootstraps”

could be acknowledged. He identifi ed “two basic social forces which might

serve as the cornerstone of any effective community organization.” These

were the Catholic Church and organized labor: “The same people that com-

prise the membership of a parish also form the membership of a union local.”

He got local organizations to come together to form the Back of the Yards

Neighborhood Council. Membership did not just involve the church and the

unions, but also the local chamber of commerce, the American Legion post,

as well as “the leading businessmen, the social, the nationality, the fraternal, and the athletic organizations.”

Through the council, problems such as unemployment and disease were

shown to be threats to all the people, both labor unions and businesses dependent upon local purchasing power. The various leaders “learned to know one

another as human beings rather than as impersonal symbols of groups which,

in many cases, appeared to be of a hostile nature.” Behind this was a “people’s philosophy” that emphasized rights rather than favors and the need to rely

on an organization “built, owned, and operated by themselves” to get their

rights. 35

This was obviously a completely different philosophy to Hayden’s.

Alinsky went out of his way to draw in local organizations; Hayden was

worried that this kept ordinary people excluded and reinforced local power

structures. At the time, many on the Left would have queried working with

the Catholic Church, which was deeply hostile to the atheistic Communist

Party. Alinsky’s self-defi nition as a radical was refl ected, as his biographer notes, in his “inclinations, convictions and rhetoric, and wishes” but less so

“in his actions, which took a more pragmatic form.” 36]] He was prepared to forge coalitions with whosoever appeared appropriate. His role model was

not so much the communist agitator but the labor organizer.

380

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

This was the heroic age of the American labor movement, led by John Lewis of the United Mineworkers, which had broken away from the sleepy

American Federation of Labor, dominated by elitist craft unions, and formed

the Confederation of Industrial Organizations (CIO). Lewis combined a stri-

dent anti-communism with a belief in a centralized state stabilizing and

planning the economy. He provided dynamic leadership to the burgeoning

labor movement, with his tough and imaginative negotiating style demon-

strated to the full in the sit-down strike at the General Motors Flint plant in 1937. After Flint, other industries were wary of head-on confrontations. He

was able to do a deal with U.S. steel without making direct threats. He chal-

lenged the racial discrimination of southern mineworkers (who argued that

black workers could make do with lower wages to support their more modest

lifestyle). Within two years, the CIO had 3.4 million members. Alinsky met

Lewis in July 1939 when he spoke on behalf of the Chicago packing work-

ers. Lewis’s daughter Kathryn was on the board of Alinsky’s Industrial Areas

Foundation.

Lewis was Alinsky’s role model. He was egocentric, entered confronta-

tions with relish, and led with nerve and panache. Later, Alinsky would write an admiring biography. From Lewis he learned how to provoke and goad

opponents, promote confl ict and then negotiate its resolution, using power

to best advantage at all stages. Alinsky paid attention to the intellectual

justifi cations for action and their rhetorical expression. He was impressed by the way Lewis managed to pursue a program which menaced the establishment by associating the CIO with American ideals of fairness and justice.

“Similarly, Alinsky’s own argumentation sought to place the objectives of

his Industrial Areas Foundation fi rmly within familiar-sounding American

political tradition.” [^37]

In 1946, Alinsky published his fi rst book, _Reveille for Radicals_ , which became a surprising bestseller. The basic idea behind this was that the sort

of techniques that had been used so effectively by the labor unions in the

factories could be used within urban communities—as he put it, “collective

bargaining beyond the present confi nes of the factory gate.” The radical was described as a militant idealist, someone who “believes what he says,” has the common good as the “greatest personal value,” “genuinely and completely

believes in mankind,” takes on every struggle as his own, avoids rationaliza-

tion and superfi ciality, and deals in “fundamental causes rather than cur-

rent manifestations.” His goals were described in terms of a utopia—where

every individual’s worth was recognized and potentiality realized; all would

be truly free politically, economically, and socially; and war, fear, misery, and demoralization would be eradicated. By contrast, liberals attracted Alinsky’s e x i s t e n t i a l s t r a t e g y

381

scorn, for fl aws in temperament and attitude rather than philosophy. They came over as feckless, hesitant, complacent, lacking the stomach for a fi ght, combining “radical minds and conservative hearts,” paralyzed by their insistence on seeing both sides of an issue, and fearful of action and partisanship.

The fundamental difference revolved around the “issue of power.” Radicals

understood, according to Alinsky, that “only through the achievement and

better use of power can people better themselves.” Where liberals protested,

radicals rebelled. 38 Given the heroic concept of community or]]ganization (a

“program is limited only by the horizon of humanity itself”), it was not sur-

prising that Alinsky also had a heroic concept of the organizer. “One could

envision Alinsky’s organizing fl ying high in a Superman cape,” observed his

biographer, “swooping into a forlorn industrial community, ready to fi ght for truth, justice and the American Way!” The organizer would lead the “war

against the social menaces of mankind.” 39

Over the next couple of decades, before his sudden death in 1972, Alinsky’s

acolytes were involved in a number of organizational efforts across the United States. Alinsky himself was particularly associated with two: one in the

Woodlawn District of Chicago and the other in Rochester, New York. Both

involved largely black communities and had as their key demands improved

employment and an end to the discriminatory practice of only hiring blacks

for the most menial jobs. In Rochester, the target was the town’s dominant

corporation, Eastman Kodak. In both cases Alinsky enjoyed a degree of suc-

cess, though this required negotiations rather than the capitulation of the

employers.

Not long before he died, he published another book, _Rules for Radicals_ , which set out his basic philosophy. We shall return later to this book, which is important in terms of how he positioned himself in relationship with the

other radical social movements of the 1960s. For the moment, we can con-

sider the “rules” themselves.

He set down eleven. A number were basic to any underdog strategy. The

fi rst was pure Sun Tzu: persuade the opponent that you were stronger than

was really the case (“If your organization is small, hide your numbers in the dark and raise a din that will make everyone think you have many more people than you do”). The second and third were about staying close to the com-

fort zone of your own people and going outside that of the opponent in order

to “cause confusion, fear, and retreat.” Rule 4 was to use the opponent’s own rulebook against them, and Rule 5 was to use ridicule (“man’s most potent

weapon”) because it was hard to counterattack and infuriated the opposi-

tion. This led to Rule 6, which was that a good tactic was one your people

enjoyed, while a bad tactic was not only not fun but also (Rule 7) dragged on 382

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

and became hard to sustain. This was because (Rule 8) the essence of a good strategy was to keep the pressure on the opponent. “The major premise for

tactics is the development of operations that will maintain a constant pres-

sure upon the opposition. It is this that will cause the opposition to react to your advantage.” Rule 9 was an observation about how threats could be more

terrifying than the reality, and Rule 10 was about the need for a constructive alternative, an answer to the question, “Okay, what would you do?” Lastly,

Rule 11 commanded: “Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, polarize it.

Don’t try to attack abstract corporations or bureaucracies. Identify a responsible individual. Ignore attempts to shift or spread the blame.”

These rules were those of a campaigner and in that respect were different

from a form of strategic thinking that consisted largely of worrying about

how to relate, if at all, to the local power structure and the principles that should govern any action. Alinsky was all about the campaign and the specifi c goals that had been set for it. The rules refl ected Alinsky’s appreciation of the elemental requirements of strategy in terms of endurance, coalitions,

a capacity for surprise, and a need to keep an eye on public perceptions.

The sense of community and confi dence in the organization must grow with

the campaign until it became strong enough to withstand setbacks and was

able to move from one issue to another. One of Alinsky’s admirers, Charles

Silberman, compared his approach to guerrilla warfare. He explained the

need “to avoid a fi xed battle where the forces are arrayed and where the new army’s weakness would become visible, and to concentrate instead on hit-and-run tactics designed to gain small but measurable victories. Hence the

emphasis on such dramatic actions as parades and rent strikes whose main

objective is to create a sense of solidarity and community.” 40 The aim was not]]

just to keep pressure on the targets but also to build up the community and

its organization at the same time. Certainly Alinsky was clear that violence

was a bad idea. This was not a moral issue. He was against actions that almost guaranteed defeat, and resort to arms came into that category.

Some of the tactics for which Alinsky became best known refl ected a sense

of mischief and provocation. One was to unnerve a Chicago department store

that had discriminatory hiring policies by sending thousands of blacks on a

normally busy Saturday for a shopping spree that would lead to very few pur-

chases while deterring normal customers. Another tactic, intended to pres-

sure Chicago’s mayor, was to occupy all the toilets at O’Hare airport so that arriving passengers would be left desperate. The most notorious ploy, though

possibly largely intended to amuse his audiences, was a proposed “fart-in” at the Rochester Philharmonic, sponsored by Eastman Kodak. The effect was to

be achieved by feeding copious quantities of baked beans to young men prior

e x i s t e n t i a l s t r a t e g y

383

to their joining the audience. What is notable about these tactics, apart from their dependence to some extent on white stereotypes of blacks, was that none of them were actually implemented, although Alinsky claimed that getting

word to the targets had a coercive effect. One of his tactical innovations was the use of share proxies to gain a right to speak at shareholder meetings and put companies on the spot, fi rst achieved with Kodak stock in April 1967.

Reports of the meeting suggest little sympathy from other shareholders, but

here was a way to embarrass company boards and put them on the spot in a

way that might be picked up by the media.

Alinsky’s distrust of liberals and tendency to romanticize the poor were

traits he shared with the young radicals who moved into community organiz-

ing in the mid-1960s. But there were important differences. He was results

oriented. He wanted victories, even if small, which meant that he would

form coalitions and cut deals. He knew that his natural constituents were

minorities, and this became even more so as a majority of the American peo-

ple identifi ed with the middle class. He therefore understood the need for

support from those who might otherwise be spectators. He was prepared to

get his funds from rich liberals, and was always looking to his targets’ vulnerabilities on external support as a source of pressure (for example, customers or stockholders or some higher governmental authority). In terms of tactics,

his basic need was to fi nd new ways of sustaining campaigns and keeping

them in the public eye (and here his own notoriety could be an advantage).

He also understood that the degree of organization required, especially when

undertaken by outsiders and professionals, was bound to be an issue in itself.

The establishment was quick to point to the malign presence of outside “agi-

tators” (a label Alinsky happily embraced) to delegitimize campaigns, just

as the young radicals were wary of strong leaders who could easily set them-

selves up as an alternative establishment and leave the people as powerless

as they had been at the start. Just as the young radicals now hoped, Alinsky

had begun assuming that the organizer was drawing out a latent political

consciousness, creating awareness not only of injustice but of the possibility of redress. Communities would be self-reliant and self-sustaining not only

in their organization but in their consciousness, with a local leadership able to give voice to this consciousness and ensure its long-term authenticity.

Alinsky made it a rule, which he only came to question toward the end of

his life, that no more than three years’ support should be provided to a com-

munity organization, after which they were on their own. [^41]

Yet he was working with people with few resources and little self-con-

fi dence, who were almost completely absorbed by coping with the every-

day problems of existence. Alinsky’s colleague, Nicholas von Hoffman, who

384

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

worked with him for a decade before leaving in 1962 to become a journalist, described how the “lumpen proletariat” faced a series of emergencies and a

chain of bad news: “Gas is cut off, electrical service terminated, the landlord is evicting them, a cousin is in jail, the baby has to be rushed to the emergency room, one of the kids sassed a social worker and the family is getting

cut off, the reigning male came home and beat the hell out of the mother,

Wilson stole the food money, Janice is pregnant, Mother missed her appoint-

ment with the vocational counsellor because she was drunk.” As a result,

the poor were “unreliable, not the stuff of organizations which are bound

together by keeping their commitments.” In practice that meant (as the civil

rights movement also discovered) that the pool of credible and capable local

leaders was small; the activist base was narrow. Only a few percent of any

community were involved in Alinsky’s campaigns. His methods, therefore,

came to rely on careful organization and strong leadership. While that did

not fi t with the later fashion for spontaneity and participatory democracy, he judged that he got better results. His pragmatism was also refl ected in his

choice of campaigns. Von Hoffman recalled that Alinsky “had no tolerance

for a defeat that could have been avoided, no patience with moral victories.”

He picked fi ghts that he could win on the grounds that not all injustices

could be righted. 42

_Chávez_

Although the younger Alinsky had been prepared to cast himself in the role

of heroic organizer, the elder Alinsky was more wary of the notion. The peo-

ple who grasped power and its uses were rarely pure in their motives, if only because they enjoyed the rough and tumble of politics. That could make

them devious and cynical, relishing their notoriety, as he certainly did. An

awareness of imperfection was to be preferred to a claim of perfection. In this regard, he worried about Cesar Chávez, a man whose work he supported.

Chávez had been hired in the early 1950s by Fred Ross, who was running the

Alinsky-sponsored Community Service Organization in California to pro-

mote voter registration and workers’ rights among Mexican farm workers.

A decade later, Chávez left to form what became the United Farm Workers

Union (UFW). He was a follower of Gandhi, adopting methods such as fast-

ing and pilgr_resources/books//Strategy_ A History - Lawrence Freedman and insisting on nonviolence. In the spring of 1966 he

led farm workers in a march from Delano to Sacramento, the California state

capital. This was combined with a campaign for a nationwide boycott of

Californian grapes. Alinsky was skeptical, but the boycott gained widespread

e x i s t e n t i a l s t r a t e g y

385

support. It lasted fi ve years and ended in victory: higher wages and rights to organize unions enshrined in law.

Traditional unions were wary of migrant workers, who were presented as

threats to white employment. An earlier attempt by the American Federation

of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) 43]] to organize farm workers failed because the leadership did not understand local conditions or speak Spanish and instead relied on familiar models from old labor

campaigns, despite having to work with a transitory workforce with a high

turnover. Chávez saw the value of rooting the union in local communities,

which offered educational possibilities, access to the church, and added to the tactical repertoire—for example, rent strikes. He could also use the example

of the civil rights movement:

How have negroes won their battles? When everyone expects them to

run . . . they kneel and pray. When they appear beaten, they turn their

defeat into victory. They use only what they have, their bodies and

their courage . . . We farm workers have the same weapons—our bodies

and our courage . . . The day we farm workers apply this lesson with

the same courage as they have shown in Alabama and Mississippi—on

that day, the misery of the farm workers will come to an end. [^44]

Chávez’s strategy put him at the center of his movement. An iconic moment

came in 1968 when his people were wearying of a long strike that appeared

to be going nowhere, and the value of nonviolence was being questioned.

He embarked on a fast to reassert his authority, spiritual more than coercive, and to demonstrate the power of suffering. His penitence was presented as a

response to those in the union who had spoken of violence. Mexican Catholics

appreciated the symbolism and saw him to be suffering on their behalf. With

ministers in attendance, the fast became a religious event. It had a galvanizing effect on the workers, many of whom made their own pilgr_resources/books//Strategy_ A History - Lawrence Freedman to the

site of the fast.

The advantages gained in strengthening union support were further

reinforced when the grape growers, who apparently believed that the fast

was a fraud, decided to issue an injunction against the union’s tactics at this point. This provided a frail Chávez with a perfect opportunity to turn up in

the courtroom, attended by thousands of praying supporters. When he ended

his fast after twenty-fi ve days (one day more than Gandhi’s longest fast) he did so after an ecumenical service with a piece of bread handed to him by

Senator Robert Kennedy (about to declare his candidacy for the presidency).

A minister read Chavez’s speech:

386

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

I am convinced that the truest act of courage, the strongest act of manliness is to sacrifi ce ourselves for others in a totally non-violent

struggle for justice. To be a man is to suffer for others. God help us to

be men. [^45]

Alinsky was wary of piety. He told Chávez that he found the fast “embarrass-

ing.” Nor was he impressed by Chávez’s insistence on living on a low wage,

ensuring an appropriate level of suffering, when he had a family to support.

Eventually Chávez’s insistence that UFW staff all work on a subsistence wage

became a source of discontent. 46

One of those who worked with Chávez, Marshall Ganz, observed the

importance of the initial motivation as a source of strategic creativity. Strategy did not come fi rst but followed the commitment to act, which inspired “concentration, enthusiasm, risk taking, persistence, and learning.” The intense

interest in the problem at hand encouraged critical thinking, challenging

expectations and contexts. 47 Chávez provided the impetus, but he also had a

view of organization that depended on strong leadership, and in which the

people who did the work made the decisions. This was far removed from

participatory democracy, or any sort of democracy, really. Building a move-

ment and running an organization were two different activities. In the latter role Chávez became autocratic and eccentric, eventually leaving the UFW in

disarray. Chávez remained an inspirational fi gure, and many of the alumni

of the UFW went on to play important roles in other social movements.

Nonetheless, he ended up destroying his own creation by purging insuffi -

ciently sycophantic staff. 48

_Imperfect Communities_

The natural imperfections of human beings were refl ected in the rank and fi le as well as the leaders. Perhaps Alinsky’s most bitter lesson was that there was no natural coincidence of views between politically aware outside organizers

and the communities they urged to seize power. After 1945, the collective

efforts of the revitalized Back of the Yards community were devoted to keep-

ing out blacks. As von Hoffman observed, once the area had been rebuilt

and revitalized it became “a stable rock of racial exclusion.” There was now

something to defend. Even people who were not actively racist still believed

that blacks coming into the community “were harbingers of slumifi cation,

crime, bad schools and punishing drops in real estate values.” 49

e x i s t e n t i a l s t r a t e g y

387

In his last interview (where he was described as one “who looks like an accountant and talks like a stevedore”), Alinsky recognized somewhat ruefully the irony of this and a less-than-romantic view of “the people.” When

he arrived at the Back of the Yards in the late 1930s, it was already “a cesspool of hate; the Poles, Slovaks, Germans, Negroes, Mexicans and Lithuanians all

hated each other and all of them hated the Irish, who returned the senti-

ment in spades.” As he diagnosed the problem, it was one of “dreams of a

better world” being replaced by “nightmares of fear—fear of change, fear

of losing their material goods, fear of blacks.” He was thinking “of moving

back into the area and organizing a new movement to overthrow the one

I built 25 years ago.” He still thought it was right to help people escape from

“fi lth and poverty and despair,” even if they now shared the “establishment’s prejudices.” Just because the “have-nots exist in despair, discrimination and deprivation” did “not automatically endow them with any special qualities

of charity, justice, wisdom, mercy or moral purity.” They were just ordinary

people with all the normal weaknesses.

History is like a relay race of revolutions; the torch of idealism is car-

ried by one group of revolutionaries until it too becomes an establish-

ment, and then the torch is snatched up and carried on the next leg of

the race by a new generation of revolutionaries. The cycle goes on and

on, and along the way the values of humanism and social justice the

rebels champion take shape and change and are slowly implanted in

the minds of all men even as their advocates falter and succumb to the

materialistic decadence of the prevailing status quo.

During the 1960s, such sentiments ensured that Alinsky was a popular

speaker on campuses. He argued for radical, though not revolutionary, change

and the redistribution of power. And he did not pretend that it would be easy or straightforward: “Change means movement; movement means friction;

friction means heat; heat means controversy.” Yet he had little affi nity with the leaders of the New Left. In the summer of 1964, a meeting was arranged

between Alinsky and a few of the key fi gures in SDS, including Tom Hayden

and Todd Gitlin. It did not go well. Alinsky was dismissive. Little would be

achieved without leadership and hierarchy, and it was naïve to suppose that

the poor wanted anything other than the lifestyles that these middle class

youngsters were rejecting. [^50] For Alinsky, being the underdog was a liability to be overcome rather than a badge of honor.

Alinsky’s skepticism also extended to Martin Luther King, Jr., although

he admired his achievements and copied some of his tactics. There was an

attempt to get them to join forces when King came to Chicago in 1966,

388

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

but they never met. Alinsky was resistant, wary of such a celebrity entering his home base, especially as he had made a deliberate decision not to try to

campaign in the South, where he suspected he would be neither welcome nor

effective. He was not one to take second place, even to a Nobel Peace Prize

winner, and he also questioned whether a southern preacher could succeed

in this setting. Alinsky appreciated that the civil rights movement’s basic

approach was similar to his own, in terms of using direct action to dramatize key issues. The key to its success, he thought, was the stupidity of the southern establishment and international pressure. “A Bull Connor with his police

dogs and fi re hoses down in Birmingham did more to advance civil rights

than the civil rights fi ghters themselves.” 51 Alinsky had always insisted on]]

proper organization, and his people noticed the difference with King’s entou-

rage. Some were “very talented and some crazy as hoot owls,” but too many

spent time bickering with each other, seeking to get close to King. The lead-

ership never fi red anyone and exercised no control over spending. [^52]

Bayard Rustin had argued vehemently with King about Chicago, warn-

ing him about the harsh, cynical culture of the northern ghettoes and the

complexity of city politics, especially the formidable machine of Mayor

Michael Daley. Life was often tough, but blacks were not excluded from the

political process and local conditions were less simple than the morality play that had been played out in the South. In one row Rustin told King that he

did not know what Chicago was like. “You’re going to be wiped out.” King

ended the argument by saying that he was going to pray and consult with

the Lord. Rustin was furious. “This business of King talking to God and

God talking to King,” he complained was no way to resolve serious strategic

questions. 53 Rustin’]]s misgivings were justifi ed. King received a hostile reception and failed to gather any momentum behind his campaign. Rather than

choosing a single issue around which to mobilize, nothing was precluded and

any issue might be picked up. In other words, the campaign lacked focus.

The aim was to draw a number of potential constituents, from slum dwellers

to the unemployed to students, into activity and then escalate into a mass

movement that could take dramatic action. Financial diffi culties, poor local leadership, distractions in the South, and the complexities of which Rustin

had warned all meant that King’s campaign never acquired momentum.

Alinsky demonstrated what could be done with community organiza-

tion but also the limits of a bottom-up approach. Battles could be won and

lives improved, but the results were bound to be disillusioning if set against romantic notions about what the people might achieve collectively once

mobilized. The people, especially those with tough lives, had their own pri-

orities and ways of coping. Only on occasion did these coincide with those of e x i s t e n t i a l s t r a t e g y

389

activists. Moreover, few campaigns could have the moral clarity of the civil rights movement, which put the establishment on the spot from the start.

It was impossible in a liberal society to argue against the principle of desegregation, so the only issues were about pace and method. Other issues were

more complex, both analytically and ethically. In addition, as Rustin began

to argue forcefully, the changes sought—whether in civil rights or addressing the causes of poverty—required support from central government. Merely

raging against the system resulted in largely unproductive consequences for

the people on whose behalf the activists claimed to be raging.

Black Power and White Anger

_We had fed the heart on fantasies,_

_The heart’s grown brutal from the fare;_

_More Substance in our enmities_

_Than in our love._

—William Butler Yeats, _“The Stare’s Nest by My Window”_

In the absence of perceptible progress, the consequences of the reluc-

tance to accept compromise and forge coalitions lay either in disillusion-

ment and apathy or else anger and more extreme policies. This could be seen

in the swift evolution of the SNCC during the course of the 1960s. SNCC’s

founding statement affi rmed “the philosophical ideal of nonviolence as the

foundation of our purpose, the presumption of our belief, and the manner of

our action.” This affi rmation became strained as the SNCC activists became

impatient, uncertain about what they were achieving for their pains, frus-

trated at the limits of their open and inclusive political style and with the restraint required by a nonviolent philosophy. They were told to play safe to keep the support of white liberals, even as the Democrats refused to disown

racist politicians. They became suspicious, not only of the segregationists and police, but also of the elitism of Martin Luther King.

In the North there was already a more radical aspect to black politics. For

example, Malcolm X, who converted to the Nation of Islam while in jail and

became its most prominent and charismatic fi gure, provided a striking contrast to King’s Christian message of love and peace. Malcolm X proclaimed

black separatism, denounced whites as devils, and refused to reject violence.

Self-defense, he insisted, was not really violence but “intelligence.” He spoke in ways that King could not to the disaffected and frustrated blacks of the

inner cities. The civil rights leaders rebuked him for stirring up racial hatred and playing to white stereotypes of blacks. Eventually he did have a change

of heart. He continued to push for a distinctively black consciousness but left the Nation of Islam in 1964 and moderated his rhetoric. He was murdered

soon after, in February 1965. 1]]

A more distant infl uence with a clearer message was Frantz Fanon. His

views developed through his encounters with French colonialism and cul-

minated in his time in Algeria, where he went as a psychiatrist before join-

ing the National Liberation Front (FLN). His main testament, _Wretched of_

_the Earth_ , was written in 1961 as he was dying from leukemia. It was later argued that the English translation of this book, and Jean-Paul Sartre’s introduction, sharpened the tone, more so than Fanon intended. His insights on

colonial conditions were played down as a result of the stress on violence as

the only strategic language that colonizers recognized. 2]] The psychiatrist in him offered an existentialist take on violence, providing the book’s intensity.

Fanon picked up on Sartre’s claim that it was not the Jewish character that

provoked anti-Semitism but instead “the anti-Semite creates the Jew,” and so

argued that “the settler” had “brought the native into existence and perpetu-

ates his existence.” [^3] Violence was a means of escaping from this psychological as well as physical domination. “At the level of the individuals, violence is a cleansing force. It frees him from his inferiority complex and restores his self-respect . . . the colonized man fi nds his freedom in and through violence.”

Sartre added: “The native cures himself of colonial neurosis by thrusting out the settler through the force of arms. When his rage boils over, he rediscovers his lost innocence and comes to know himself in that he himself creates

himself.” 4 The philosopher Hannah Arendt suspected that most of Fanon’]]s admirers had not gone beyond his fi rst chapter—“Concerning Violence”—for

later he showed awareness of how “unmixed and total brutality” would lead

“to the defeat of the movement within a few weeks.” She was most appalled

by Sartre’s claim to be a Marxist while espousing notions that owed more to

Nechayev and Bakunin, and his excitement over what might be achieved by

“mad fury” and “volcanic outbursts.” 5

Fanon’s anger resonated with young black activists who were concluding

that it was pointless trying to work with white power structures. Jacobs and

Landau, who surveyed the New Left in 1965, observed how “the weary veterans

392

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

of harassment, arrests, beatings, and the psychological torture of living in the South, have begun to re-examine their objectives at the very time they confront the full and often subtle power of the American economic and political

system.” [^6] The idealism was being drained away from SNCC. The “generals,”

infl uenced by Malcolm X and ready to contemplate their own form of guer-

rilla warfare, replaced the “poets.” The dire economic position of blacks in the urban ghettoes and the escalation of the Vietnam War, which disproportionately drafted blacks into the army, added to the grievances. “No Vietcong ever called me a nigger,” observed the boxer Cassius Clay, now Mohammed Ali.

The alarmed reaction of white society to the prospect of black violence and the rioting in the inner cities brought a satisfaction in itself.

One of the pioneering SNCC activists and chairman of the organization

in 1965, Stokely Carmichael, became an advocate of black power. Raised

in Harlem, he spoke the language of the streets more naturally than that of

the Church. He began to toy with ideas for a new SNCC slogan in 1966.

Then after yet another arrest (his twenty-seventh), this time in Greenwood,

Mississippi, he exclaimed to a crowd:

We want black power! That’s right. That’s what we want, black power.

We don’t have to be ashamed of it. We have stayed here. We have

begged the president. We’ve begged the federal government—that’s

all we’ve been doing, begging and begging. It’s time we stand up and

take over. 7]]

He claimed that any white person, even those in the movement, had “con-

cepts in his mind about black people, if only subconsciously. He cannot

escape them, because the whole society has geared his sub-conscious in that

direction.” With racism so ingrained it was meaningless for blacks to talk

about coalition—“there is no one to align ourselves with.” Only once it was

shown that blacks could speak and act for themselves would it perhaps be

possible to work with whites again, but then on equal terms. SNCC would

henceforth be “black-staffed, black-controlled and black-fi nanced.” 8]]

A book coauthored with the academic Charles Hamilton argued for “pride

rather than shame, in blackness, and an attitude of brotherly, communal

responsibility among all black people for one another.” White Americans could afford to “speak softly, tread lightly, employ the soft-sell and put-off” because they “own the society.” It would be ludicrous for black people to “adopt _their_ methods of relieving _our_ oppression.” If they followed this path they would gain “crumbs of co-optation” in return for holding back on condemnation.

The problem was not with the underlying premise. There were many

other examples in American politics of groups organizing politically on the

b l a c k p o w e r a n d w h i t e a n g e r

393

basis of ethnicity, using a shared identity to create an effective bargaining position. “Before a group can enter the open society, it must fi rst close ranks.”

Only when blacks spoke up, not asking for favors but seeking power, could

they expect the system to respond. But Carmichael sought a shared “sense of

people-hood” on the basis of an extremely radical posture. Blacks must not

adopt the values of the middle class that had sanctioned and perpetuated

black oppression, yet if the aim was economic advancement then this would

lead naturally to a black bourgeoisie.

The big question was whether to continue with nonviolence, the stance

which had sustained recent political advances. Carmichael and Stevenson

answered that nonviolence had handicapped blacks by creating an image of

passivity. “From our viewpoint,” they argued, “rampaging white mobs and

white night-riders must be made to understand that their days of free head-

whipping are over. Black people should and must fi ght back.” This was about

self-defense: “Those of us who advocate Black Power are quite clear in our

own minds that a ‘non-violent’ approach to civil rights is an approach black

people cannot afford and a luxury white people do not deserve.” 9

Martin Luther King was appalled by the turn of events. Not only did

he object to the resort to violence, but he found it frustrating that violence became the issue rather than those his movement was trying to highlight.

He insisted that power should be a means to an end—the “creation of a truly

brotherly society”—rather than an end in itself. 10]] In a posthumously published book, he critiqued Black Power, pointing to its self-defeating charac-

ter as blacks were a minority in the United States and defended alliances with whites. In the end, both races needed each other. They were “bound together

in a single garment of destiny.” 11]]

In 1967, whites were expelled from SNCC and the commitment to non-

violence was dropped. The new chairman, H. Rap Brown, described violence

as “American as cherry pie.” Carmichael, who later acknowledged that black

power killed SNCC, joined up with the Black Panthers, a group that had

been set up in Oakland, California, in 1966, and employed a tough, violent

rhetoric from the start. In his autobiographical account of the origins of the Black Panthers, Bobby Seale described the early fi xation with acquiring an

arsenal, paid for by selling at a profi t copies of the “Little Red Book” of

Chinese leader Mao Zedong, compared with the casual way the party’s mani-

festo was put together. 12 The striking imagery and rhetoric associated with]]

the Panthers, and their militarist affectations, gave them an infl uence beyond their actual numbers, probably never more than fi ve thousand.

Carmichael continued with his own advocacy of black separatism. “The

major enemy,” he said in a speech in 1967, “is not your brother, fl esh of your 394

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

fl esh and blood of your blood. The major enemy is the honky and his institutions of racism, that’s the major enemy, that is the major enemy. And when-

ever anyone prepares for revolutionary warfare, you concentrate on the major

enemy. We’re not strong enough to fi ght each other and also fi ght him.” [^13] He fell out even with the Panthers, who were more willing to work with whites

than he was. He decided the only way to get close to the African people was

to move to Africa and adopt an African name, Kwame Ture.

The trend in black politics alarmed Bayard Rustin. He became disen-

chanted as his former friends in SNCC turned to violence and black sep-

aratism. “The minute you had black anger, rage,” he later observed, “you

automatically had to have white fear, because we’re always enumerator to

their denominator . . . These two things have to move with each other.”

A focus on direct action added to the polarization, alienating whites and

“breeding despair and impotence” among blacks. [^14] He agreed with Martin Luther King that poverty and unemployment were signifi cant triggers of

race riots, but that led him to explore how blacks and whites could be united in struggle under the aegis of the labor unions. His conviction that the big

issues were economic, requiring federal programs, meant that it was vital

to support a government prepared to fund a “war on poverty.” This led to

Frames, Paradigms, Discourses,

and Narratives

_I’m no prophet. My job is making windows where there were once walls._

—Attributed to Michel Foucault

The ideas of the counterculture, carried forward by the educated middle

classes, had profound infl uences not only on social choices but also on

the conduct of politics and business, and on intellectual life in general. These ideas did not prompt a leftward shift in American politics—far from it, as

we shall see in the next chapter—but they did have a major impact on the

way that big ideas were discussed. The major insight, which was not at all

new, was that as mental constructs are needed to make sense of the world,

we can never have more than a particular take on reality. Nor was it new to

argue that those who could shape the constructs of others could thereby infl uence their attitudes and behavior. This was the whole point of Lippmann’s

theory of public opinion and Bernay’s approach to the “engineering of con-

sent.” Lippmann and Bernays claimed this could be benign, if undertaken

by enlightened people in the name of sound public policy. The effects of

the state manipulation of the media by Nazi and Communist totalitarian-

ism, demonstrating just how insidious propaganda could be, undermined

any optimism on this score.

The liberal response to totalitarianism was to argue that whatever the nat-

ural limits to human comprehension, the best course was to open up minds

to a range of possibilities and share experiences and experiments. Rather than

the imposition of a single view, however well intentioned and researched, the best hope for humankind lay in diversity and plurality, a marketplace of

ideas. Liberal democracy could be guaranteed by a free, diverse, and argu-

mentative media, combined with the highest standards in the search for

truth. This put the onus on the media—and even more so, the academy—to

seek to the extent possible objectivity in their reporting and analysis. The

exemplary philosopher of the tolerant, open society was Karl Popper, who

grew up in Austria but moved to London to escape the Nazis. He asserted

the need for a rigorous empiricism in all scientifi c endeavors, putting every proposition to the test of falsifi ability, gaining comfort from the wealth of accumulated and tested human knowledge upon which the fl awed constructs

of individuals were founded. 1

The challenge posed by the New Left was to argue that the apparent plural-

ity and diversity of Western liberal democracies was an illusion. Propositions that deserved challenge were taken for granted, while other perspectives

and claims were marginalized. This was standard fare for Marxists and had

been at the heart of Gramsci’s concept of hegemony, which gained increasing

attention during the 1950s. Debates on the left were also infl uenced by the

legatees of the Frankfurt School, such as Herbert Marcuse. Émigré theorists,

gathered at the New School of Social Research in New York, explained how

knowledge was developed and maintained through social interactions, and

introduced the concept of the “social construction of reality.” 2]] Of increasing importance were French theorists, this time not so much the existentialists

but the poststructuralists and postmodernists.

The fi eld research and experimental observations of mainstream social

science might avoid the higher reaches of European theory but regularly

confi rmed the limits of cognition and the importance of interpretative con-

structs. The political issue was whether the interpretative constructs could

be deliberately manipulated from outside. Research suggested that this was

done regularly, not necessarily as part of some organized elite conspiracy but in the way that the issues were moved on and off the political agenda, and

how these issues were posed in the fi rst place, setting the terms for subse-

quent debate.

William James had addressed this question as early as 1869. Instead of

asking whether what we know is real, James had asked, “Under what cir-

cumstances do we think things are real?” Building on James, the sociolo-

gist Erving Goffman explained, “We frame reality in order to negotiate it,

manage it, comprehend it, and choose appropriate repertories of cognition

and action.” Goffman considered how individuals struggled to make sense

of the world around them and their experiences and so needed interpretative

f r a m e s , p a r a d i g m s , d i s c o u r s e s , a n d n a r r a t i v e s 415

schemas or primary frameworks to classify the knowledge. 3]] When there were a number of possible ways of viewing an issue, framing meant that one particular way appeared to be the most natural. This was achieved by highlight-

ing certain features of a situation, stressing likely causes and possible effects, and suggesting the values and norms in play.

_The Whole World Is Watching_

The media was bound to play a major role in creating and sustaining the

background consensus, especially now that TV had supplanted newspapers

and the radio as the main source of information about political affairs. The

possibility that media might play a less than benign role had been considered in the 1940s by Robert Merton, attuned to the question of the social infl uences on knowledge from the 1930s. Although he had been skeptical about

Lasswell’s claims about the effects of propaganda and concerned about how

little was known about the “propagandee,” he was also alarmed as a Jew by

the rise of the Nazis. When he joined Columbia University in 1941, he began

an intensive collaboration with Paul Lazarsfeld, who had some psychological

training and now ran the Bureau of Applied Social Research at Columbia.

Merton believed strongly that empirical research had to be combined with

theory, and this is what he brought to the partnership. 4]]

Their early research noted the limited effects of mass communications

compared to friends and family. They tended to reinforce more than con-

vert. In a joint piece published in 1948 they addressed the question of

media impact on “social action,” by which they meant progressive causes

such as improved race relations or sympathy for the labor unions. They

noted the concerns of high-minded critics that after all the efforts reform-

ers had put into releasing people from wage slavery and constant toil, the

masses now spent their extra leisure immersed in media products marked

by triviality and superfi ciality.

They summed up the media’s political impact in terms of enforcing social

norms, by exposing deviations from these norms in private lives; by acting

as a narcotic, encouraging public apathy and leaving people with only a sec-

ondary exposure to political reality; and lastly by encouraging conformism.

Because they provided “little basis for a critical appraisal the commercially sponsored mass media indirectly but effectively restrain the cogent development of a genuinely critical output.” Any minor tokens of progressive

attitudes would be dropped from TV or radio shows if they went against

the economic interests of the owners. “He who pays the piper generally

416

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

calls the tune.” Were there circumstances in which the media could shape public attitudes in a more progressive direction? This could happen, but

it would require that the media itself was not divided and that preexisting

views could be channeled in the preferred direction (instead of attempting to change basic values). Even then it would be necessary for any movement to

be supplemented by face-to-face contact. 5

By the early 1970s, it had become established that there was a relation-

ship between the importance attributed to issues by a mass audience and the

processes of agenda-setting, referring to how some issues gained prominence

while others were barely noticed, resulting from the coverage given to an

issue and where it was placed—on a page or in a news bulletin. 6]] It was a truism in that if there was nothing in the media about a “topic or event, then

in most cases it simply will not exist in our personal agenda or in our life

space.” [^7] Some issues refl ected the agenda of the media outlets; in many cases, it was the government that was best placed to set the agenda.

The media therefore could encourage people to think about certain issues

to the exclusion of others, but could people be told what to think? In mov-

ing from radical activism to professional sociology, Todd Gitlin refl ected on the divergence between what he considered to be the character and course of

SDS and the way it had come to be portrayed. As we have seen, it had been a

general assumption that one way to get sympathy for a cause was to be beaten

by the police while demonstrating on behalf of that cause. In Chicago, as the police were wading into the activists, they chanted back, “The whole world is watching,” as if this should serve as a warning that their attackers would be subjected to international condemnation. Yet, unlike the civil rights activists of earlier in the decade, the political effects were at best ambiguous. In many media outlets, it was the demonstrators rather than police who were

condemned.

Gitlin sought to demonstrate that the media did not so much hold up a

mirror to reality as shape what people assumed to be reality. “I was still in the grip of a noble, rationalist, post-Sixties prejudice,” he later recalled, “that started with a distaste for bad ideas and proceeded to a sort of retrospective optimism to the effect that if the ideas and _resources/books//Strategy_ A History - Lawrence Freedman had been different,

a thoughtful population would have warmed to the movement instead of

turning a cold shoulder, and the movement would therefore have created a

healthier political climate for the years, even decades to come.” [^8] His book _The Whole World Is Watching_ acknowledged the importance of the media in reporting the movement’s demonstrations, for without a report they might

as well not have happened, but that created a dependence on how they were

interpreted.

Gitlin was aware of Gramscian analyses of hegemony, as shaping popular acceptance of the established order, by uniting persuasion from above with

consent from below. By tracing the history of the movement and how it had

been reported, he was in some respects updating Gramsci in the light of the

modern mass media. He drew on Goffman’s notions of frames in explaining

how the media made choices about what to report and how. “Media frames

are persistent patterns of cognition, interpretation, and presentation, of selection, emphasis, and exclusion.” They were a way of organizing discourse, and

there had to be some way. It was impossible completely to report the world

that exists.

Many things exist. At each moment the world is rife with events. Even

within a given event there is infi nity of noticeable details. Frames are

principles of selection, emphasis, and presentation composed of little

tacit theories about what exists, what happens, and what matters. 9

What concerned him was how the media had undermined SDS by at times

ignoring, trivializing, marginalizing, and disparaging it, as well as by highlighting differences among its members and focusing on its more disrup-

tive behavior rather than addressing the issues being raised. This led him to ruminate on the circumstances in which radicals could make space to challenge hegemony. When elites were unsure of the situations, they could not

defi ne them to suit their interests. The key factor might not be the unity

of the radicals but the unity of the establishment. Also relevant were the

responses of ordinary people, with their own values and norms, which they

saw being challenged by the protests. The issue went beyond establishment

views or media methodology.

_Thomas Kuhn_

The idea that there were loose systems of ideas which could be politically

infl uential despite their limited empirical basis was captured by Kenneth

Galbraith’s notion of the “conventional wisdom.” This term had been around

for some time to refer to commonplace ideas, but Galbraith used it in 1958

for “those ideas which are esteemed at any time for their acceptability.” What was held to be truth, he suggested, was often a refl ection of convenience,

self-esteem, and familiarity as much as relevance. At the simplest level, the conventional wisdom could be seen in the rarity with which the businessman

was denigrated as an economic force before the chamber of commerce. But

it was found even at the “highest levels of social science scholarship.” Minor 418

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

heresies, he noted, may be much cherished, but the vigor of debate surrounding these heresies “makes it possible to exclude as irrelevant, and without

seeming to be unscientifi c or parochial, any challenge to the framework

itself.” Galbraith accepted that the conventional wisdom had value as a check against a facile fl ow of intellectual novelties which could deny any possibility of stability and continuity. The danger lay in avoiding “accommodation to

circumstances until change is dramatically forced upon it.” The enemy of the

conventional wisdom, according to Galbraith, was obsolescence, not “ideas

but the march of events.” 10

Galbraith gave the conventional wisdom a negative connotation. A more

neutral term, which also caught on more, was “paradigm.” Thomas Kuhn

described the dynamic that might be created by the combination of elite

uncertainty and the march of events, while reinforcing the view that struc-

tures of power were dependent on embedded structures of thought, in one of

the most infl uential books of the 1960s. _The Structure of Scientifi c Revolutions_ addressed an area often held up as being separate from politics, propelled forward by the experimental method and the accumulation of evidence. Instead

of scientifi c endeavor representing the progressive revelation of objective

reality, Kuhn argued that it was actually a series of paradigm shifts. A “paradigm” was a set of ideas that could become so embedded within a scientifi c

community that dislodging them became as much a political as an empirical

challenge. When the scientifi c community worked within a prevailing para-

digm this was “normal science.” Its core precepts would be taught to stu-

dents and research encouraged and celebrated which followed its framework

and validated its conclusions. Eventually, challenges would appear as obser-

vations threw up apparently inexplicable anomalies. The cumulative impact

of these anomalies would eventually become overwhelming. This Kuhn

described as a “scientifi c revolution,” when everything scientists thought

they knew would be reassessed, all the prior assumptions and information

reappraised, often against fi erce resistance from the old guard. Eventually

the new paradigm would usurp the old. The classic example of this was the

Copernican Revolution, which overturned the prior assumption that planets

revolved around the earth by showing how they were actually in orbit around

the sun.

Kuhn’s message was that beliefs, even in an area committed to reason

and experimentation, could be infl uenced by factors that were at their root

non-rational. This was an intensely political account, involving a confron-

tation between radicals and defenders of an old order that could no longer

be accommodated within the established institutions of governance. Just as

approved political strategies no longer suffi ced at revolutionary times, so

f r a m e s , p a r a d i g m s , d i s c o u r s e s , a n d n a r r a t i v e s 419

with approved scientifi c methods and reasoning. What made the difference at critical moments were factors extraneous to the scientifi c method, such as force of personality or the scientifi c equivalents of the revolutionary mob and coercive pressure. A new paradigm would acquire a form of collective consent, there would be a consequential circulation of elites, and normal science would continue until the process began again with the accumulation of more

anomalies. 11 As revolutions went, this was more Pareto than Marx.

Kuhn himself stressed the underlying conservatism of his view when dis-

covering to his horror during the student rebellions of the 1960s that he was being cast as a revolutionary for having identifi ed paradigms as instruments of intellectual oppression. “Thank you for telling us about paradigms,” the

students were saying, “now that we know what they are we can get along

without them.” At this point he felt “badly misunderstood,” disliking “what

most people were getting out of the book.” [^12] He was not saying that paradigms were invariably harmful and misleading. They made sense of mate-

rial that would otherwise appear inchoate and confusing. Scientifi c inquiry

would be impossible without _“_ at least some implicit body of intertwined theoretical and methodological belief that permits selection, evaluation,

and criticism.” [^13] Nor was he arguing that it was only scientifi c politics that would allow a paradigm to become entrenched or supplanted. Crises in normal science would develop because of the continuing search for new discover-

ies and impatience with research designed to do no more than reaffi rm what

was already supposed. Kuhn did however insist that the “decision to reject

one paradigm is always simultaneously the decision to accept another, and

the judgment leading to that decision involves the comparison of both para-

digms with nature _and_ with each other.” [^14]

There were many criticisms of Kuhn, not least that his history represented

an oversimplifi cation. While there had clearly been occasions when the pro-

cesses he described had been present, theories also changed signifi cantly during periods of “normal science” and even adherents of old paradigms could

get excited by new breakthroughs. It was also suggested that his focus was

too internal to the scientifi c profession, with insuffi cient attention paid to the broader social context in which scientists operated and the developing impact of professionalism and bureaucratization. Kuhn polished and developed his

ideas after the book’s publication, notably in a 1970 revision. Thereafter, the radicalism of his message was diminished as his intellectual energies became

focused on the more abstruse aspects of the philosophy of science.

By this time, however, whatever meaning he wished to assign to his ideas,

his terminology was already well on its way to being co-opted by people

working in a range of other disciplines. In 1987, Kuhn’s work was reported

420

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

to be the twentieth-century book most frequently cited from 1976 to 1983

in the arts and the humanities. [^15] A “paradigm shift” became a cliché, used in circumstances far removed from a full-blown scientifi c revolution. His

model, at least in a simplifi ed version, appeared as a gift to relativists, suggesting that what mattered with any coherent set of views, including social

philosophies, was not their relationship to any discernible reality but the

political power behind them. An infl uential example of this was Sheldon

Wolin’s use of Kuhn to challenge the claimed objectivity of the “behavior-

ist” tendency in political sciences, which claimed to be following the same

methodological path as the physical sciences. “Up to a certain point,” Wolin

observed, “what matters is not which the truer paradigm is but which is to

be enforced.” 16

From a way of describing explicit, formal scientifi c theories that could be

unsettled by contrary evidence, paradigms started to allow bundles of preju-

dices and preconceptions that were implicit, informal, and often confused,

contradictory and in fl ux, to be treated as if they were embedded, internally coherent, tight and controlled, and in key respects impervious to facts. The

tendency to categorize systems of belief as strong paradigms and then fi t

individuals and groups into them often failed to do justice to the extent to

which individuals and groups were likely to deviate from a paradigm in par-

ticular aspects, interpret paradigms in culturally specifi c ways, tailor them to their political circumstances, or draw from them quite divergent inferences on how to act. If what counted for truth could be the result of political manipulation as much as scientifi c endeavor, then possibilities were opened

up for a range of topics to become politicized.

Consider, for example, the curious case of intelligent design. In 1996, a

Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture, based in California, set itself the objective of replacing “materialism and its destructive cultural legacies with a positive scientifi c alternative.” By 1999 a strategy had been developed. This was known as The Wedge Project. 17 The metaphor was materialis-]]

tic science as “a giant tree,” the trunk of which could nonetheless be split by a small wedge applied at its weakest points. The “thin edge of the wedge” was

represented by a number of books challenging evolutionary theory, begin-

ning in 1991 with Phillip Johnson’s _Darwinism On Trial_ . The alternative to evolutionary theory was intelligent design. This challenged Darwinism by

insisting that the world could not be explained by the randomness of evolu-

tion but must have required a coherent design, although it stopped short of

saying that the God of the scriptures was _the_ intelligent designer. The proponents used Kuhn’s theory to argue that evolutionary biology was no more

than a dominant paradigm upheld by a scientifi c elite willfully dismissive of f r a m e s , p a r a d i g m s , d i s c o u r s e s , a n d n a r r a t i v e s 421

contrary views, denying them publication in peer-reviewed journals. Social pressure discouraged inquisitive young scientists from exploring subversive

notions. [^18]

The wedge was to be broadened by promoting intelligent design as “a

science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions.” The next phase

would involve “publicity and opinion-making.” This work would be widely

communicated into schools and the media, with a particular emphasis on

mobilizing Christian opinion behind this cause. The big challenge would

come with the third phase of “cultural confrontation and renewal,” with

direct challenges in academic conferences, a determined push—backed by

law if possible—into the schools. The challenge would then be directed at

the social sciences and humanities. The long-term aim was not only to make

intelligent design “the dominant perspective in science” but to extend into

“ethics, politics, theology, and philosophy in the humanities, and to see its infl uence in the fi ne arts.”

The proponents were aware of the importance of framing. Johnson

urged: “Get the Bible and the Book of Genesis out of the debate because

you do not want to raise the so-called Bible–science dichotomy.” The need

was to get heard in the secular academy and unify religious dissenters. One

practical reason to avoid creationism was that court rulings prohibited its

teaching as science. The arena for the battle was school textbooks, and the

key demand was that intelligent design be taught in schools. This involved

getting proponents to sit on school boards. As the movement faced diffi culty in getting their views accepted as suitable for textbooks, the demand had

to be watered down to evolution being taught as a contested and contro-

versial theory whose rightness should not be taken for granted, especially

when other compelling theories were available as alternatives. In the end,

the December 2005 _Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District_ court case decided against intelligent design on the grounds that it was insuffi ciently distinctive

from creationism to deserve a place on the science curriculum. 19

The case demonstrates the diffi culty with the “paradigm” paradigm.

Neither evolution nor intelligent design referred to fully coherent world-

views. Among evolutionary biologists there were substantial differences

but no sense of crisis: evolution was accepted as a powerful theory that kept on pointing researchers in fruitful directions. In Kuhn’s terms, within the

dominant matrix there were still a number of exemplary paradigms under

challenge. Nor did intelligent design base its case on anomalous experimen-

tal evidence. Its own paradigm did not stand up to scientifi c scrutiny. As

a design the world is not always intelligent, with many obvious imperfec-

tions and curiosities. There was not even a single creationist theory. Much

422

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

depended on how literally the scriptures were followed. The Bible, for example, referred to the “four corners of the earth,” so extreme literalists could claim that the earth really was fl at. Others still argued with Galileo that the sun was at the center of the solar system. More common was Young Earth

Creationism, following the Bible suffi ciently literally to assert that the earth was six to ten thousand years old, was created in six days, that subsequent

death and decay were the fault of Adam and Eve’s original sin, and that

Noah’s Flood could provide a key to much of the world’s geology. By con-

trast, Old Earth Creationists believed God created the earth but accepted

that it was really ancient. Other versions suggested that the biblical sequence of creation worked so long as it was accepted that each biblical “day” really referred to extremely long periods. Others argued that the record of fossils

could be accepted, but that the emergence of new organisms refl ected delib-

erate acts of God rather than the accidents of evolution. [^20] While creationists would be Christians (or Muslims), there were plenty of Christians (and

Muslims) who had no problem with evolutionary theory. The material world

might be explained by DNA as created by God, leading to a natural evolu-

tionary course, which would still leave the spiritual world and the human

soul to be addressed by religion.

So even within a self-conscious paradigm that had its own label there

were a number of distinctive and contradictory viewpoints. The same was

true among evolutionary biologists, although at least they had the scientifi c method to manage and even resolve disputes. While, as Kuhn observed, the

scientifi c community had its gatekeepers and dogmatists, it could also be

pluralistic and theories of evolution have, for want of a better term, evolved.

Because intelligent design eschewed the methodology of “naturalist” science,

there was no basis for it to cause a paradigm shift. Its only hope was to

develop a suffi ciently strong and vocal constituency to get its paradigm put onto the curriculum and if possible have evolution taken off. This was not at all the sort of struggle Kuhn had in mind, because it was between two very

distinct communities rather than within one.

_Michel Foucault_

Another thinker whose ideas developed over the 1960s and thereafter shaped

the way questions of ideology and power were addressed was the French social

philosopher Michel Foucault. A thinker for whom the interplay between the

personal and the philosophical was unusually intense, his engagement with

the history of both psychiatry and sexuality refl ected his diffi culties with f r a m e s , p a r a d i g m s , d i s c o u r s e s , a n d n a r r a t i v e s 423

his homosexuality and depression. After an early dalliance with the French Communist Party, he appeared to distance himself from Marxism only to

return as an enthusiastic proponent of the “spirit of ’68,” encouraging stu-

dent occupations and leftist scholarship. In turn, he enthused about and then became disillusioned with Mao’s Cultural Revolution and the Ayatollah

Khomeini’s revolution in Iran. He died from an AIDS-related illness in

1984, aged 57, halfway through writing a six-volume work on sexuality. As

with many important thinkers, there were signifi cant shifts in his work over the course of his life, and he refused to accept any label, although he came

to be regularly identifi ed as a leading postmodernist. Interpretations of what Foucault really meant can reach special levels of paradox as arguably, by his own account, he never “really meant” anything at all. His abstract writings,

though not his histories, were dense and hard to follow, so any attempt to

present his ideas in a simplifi ed form (or indeed any form) posed a challenge.

Yet his approach shaped much contemporary social thought, including the

study of strategy and, in some respects, its practice.

There were obvious comparisons with Kuhn. Both men drew attention

to the extent to which claims about truth were contingent and dependent

upon structures of power. Where Kuhn had his paradigms, Foucault had

“epistemes.” He described these as the “apparatus” which made possible “the

separation, not of the true from the false, but of what may from what may not be characterized as scientifi c.” 21 At least in his earlier thought, epistemes were]]

at any time unique, dominant, and exclusive, unable to coexist with others.

There was “always only one _episteme_ that defi nes the conditions of possibility of all knowledge.” [^22] Kuhn always assumed a greater plurality in the social sciences and broader culture in which distinctive schools challenged each others’

foundations. Unlike the natural sciences they did not share the same problem-

solving approach. In addition, his paradigms were quite conscious and delib-

erate frameworks for scientifi c research. Foucault’s epistemes could be and

often were unconscious, setting the terms for thought and action in ways that could be invisible to those affected. While Kuhn acknowledged the importance of empirical observation and that there might be more or less objective tests against which competing paradigms might be judged, Foucault admitted of no such possibility. There was a constant battle for truth, not in order to discover some absolute but to establish the boundaries on action.

This was because all forms of thought were inextricably linked to ques-

tions of power. He described a historical sequence of power systems. In feudal society, power was about sovereignty, with general mechanisms of domination but little attention to detail. The great invention of the next period

with the coming of bourgeois society was the mechanisms that made possible

424

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

“disciplinary domination” with forms of surveillance and incarceration that controlled the activity of individuals, whether in prisons, schools, mental

hospitals, or factories. Thus what interested him about the development of

the mass armies spawned by the French Revolution were the practices they

employed for turning a multitude of individuals into employable armies.

In this way Foucault could show that the conceptualization of bodies was a

refl ection of new forms of power.

By the late eighteenth century, the soldier has become something

that can be made: out of a formless clay, an inapt body, the machine

required can be constructed; posture is gradually corrected; a calcu-

lated constraint runs slowly through each part of the body, master-

ing it, making it pliable, ready at all times, turning silently into the

automatism of habit; in short, one has “got rid of the peasant” and

given him “the air of the soldier.”

This was the basis for the disciplinary power which migrated into civil soci-

ety where comparable forms of control were instituted.

This control did not require violence, as it taught forms of behavior that

constituted a form of self-discipline. 23 In this way]], power and knowledge became one and the same, and Foucault referred to them together as “power/

knowledge.” Such power was not something owned or wielded, but an essen-

tial feature in all spheres of life, including the notionally most personal and intimate. It was diffuse rather than concentrated, discursive as much as coercive, unstable rather than fi xed. There was no real “truth,” so it could neither be repressed nor excluded. Considerations of truth were really about power,

about who was served by what, and the forms of domination and resistance

to which it gave rise.

His approach to power therefore underplayed physical constraint and que-

ried the durability of apparent consent. It was through discourse that the

thought of others was shaped so that actions followed a particular view of the world. “Regimes of truth” set standards for what was true and false and the

procedures by which they might be discerned. These became embedded in

everyday discourses, ensuring that certain matters were taken for granted while others were given prominence. In this way, views of reality could take hold,

reinforcing structures of power without it being realized, resulting in accommodating forms of behavior being adopted without the necessity of enforce-

ment. For Foucault, strategy was inextricably linked with power. While he

discussed strategy in a mainstream sense, referring to “winning choices” in

overt struggles, his concept was much broader. Strategy was “the totality of the means put into operation to implement power effectively or to maintain it.”

f r a m e s , p a r a d i g m s , d i s c o u r s e s , a n d n a r r a t i v e s 425

Foucault’s infl uence on the humanities came to be profound, its value still a matter for intense debate. His infl uence on thinking about strategy was

also signifi cant. First, his view of the ubiquity of power potentially turned all social relationships into arenas of struggle, touching the micro-level of social existence as well as the macro-level of the state. Second, he conveyed a sense of the continuity of struggle without end. There was confrontation, an apparent victory, and a stable period, but then it could all open up again. There

was thus an ever-present possibility of resistance and so reversion. A victory might allow “stable mechanisms” to “replace the free play of antagonistic

reactions,” but it would only be truly embedded when the other was reduced

to impotence. There could then be “domination,” a “strategic situation more

or less taken for granted and consolidated by means of a long-term confronta-

tion between adversaries.” But even periods of apparent stability, sustained

by the dominance of a particular discourse, could turn to struggle, following the opening up of the discourse.

In effect, between a relationship of power and a strategy of struggle

there is a reciprocal appeal, a perpetual linking and a perpetual rever-

sal. At every moment the relationship of power may become a con-

frontation between two adversaries. Equally, the relationship between

adversaries in society may, at every moment, give place to the putting

into operation of mechanisms of power. 24]]

In an inversion of Clausewitz, he presented politics as a continuation of war. 25]]

War was a “permanent social relationship, the ineradicable basis of all rela-

tions and institutions of power.” Social relations were thus orders of battle in which there was “no such thing as a neutral subject” and in which “we are all inevitably someone’s adversary.” Taking sides meant it was “possible to interpret the truth, to denounce the illusions and errors that are being used—by

your adversaries—to make you believe we are living in a world in which

order and peace have been restored.” Therefore as much as the discourses

of power were diffused throughout society, so too could be resistance, with

forms of evasion, subversion, and contestation. In this respect, claims about knowledge were weapons in a struggle over truth. He wrote of “knowledges”

(in the plural) in confl ict “because they are in the possession of enemies, and because they have intrinsic power-effects.” 26]]

Analyses of discourses, by exploring what appeared settled and non-

contentious, could reveal their contingency and relationship to structures of power. This could have a liberating effect, offering the subjugated a way out.

This was not a particularly new thought and was one of the themes of the intellectual currents circulating around the New Left. There was the same notion

426

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

of a form of unspoken warfare throughout society that had yet to manifest itself but might break out once the victims understood their situation. What

was different with Foucault was that rather than focus on questions of class

struggle and revolutionary politics, which he seemed to fi nd passé, he focused instead on the “specifi c struggles against particularized power” of “women,

prisoners, conscripted soldiers, hospital patients and homosexuals.” 27]] When lecturing in 1976, while the spirit of ’68 was still fresh, he was impressed by the “dispersed and discontinuous offensives” within Western societies during the previous decade. The “increasingly autonomous, decentralized, and

anarchistic character of contemporary forms of political struggle” suited his method. He referred to the “antipsychiatry movement” which had “helped in

opening up the space of the asylum for social and political critique.” At this time he was becoming involved in a movement giving voice to prisoners. His

project was about the “desubjugation and liberation of disqualifi ed peoples

and their knowledges.” One of Foucault’s lasting impacts lay in the recogni-

tion that the plight of individuals at the margins of society, often in institutions where they had been placed for their own safety and that of society, were part of power relationships which could and should not be beyond challenge.

Foucault’s theories made it possible to undermine established power

structures without mounting physical challenges, but instead analyzing the

“specifi city of mechanisms of power . . . locate the connections and exten-

sions . . . build little by little a strategic knowledge.” 28]] It could be argued, at least on the evidence of Foucaldian scholarship, that the language by which

discourses were analyzed could obscure as much as illuminate, and be of little practical help to subjugated groups. [^29] Moreover, while this was a way into understanding power relationships, it raised its own diffi culties by bypassing questions of agency and structure, the intent of individuals, and the role of force. So much was loaded on his concept of power, and indeed of strategy,

that these concepts risked losing any precise meaning. When everything,

whether a written communication or a pattern of behavior, could be con-

sidered as strategy, then nothing was worth considering because the term

was losing its meaning. Playing down coercive power might be sensible for

subjugated groups. Seeking a liberating discourse should be safer. But in the end, force could still be an arbiter of struggles.

_Narrative_

The word which came to describe the essential instrument in the battles

over ideas was not _discourse_ but _narrative_ . During the 1990s, this became f r a m e s , p a r a d i g m s , d i s c o u r s e s , a n d n a r r a t i v e s 427

a requirement for any political project: explaining why a political movement or party deserved to be taken seriously and conveying its core mes-

sages. This was based on another set of ideas that could be traced back to the radical intellectual ferment in France of the late 1960s that saw the concept move from being literary and elaborate to elemental and at the heart of all

social interaction. It gained traction from refl ecting evident aspects of human behavior as well as the better understanding of the workings of the brain.

Until the late 1960s, narrative was still largely to be found in literary

theory, referring to works distinguished by a character telling of an event

(rather than a stream of consciousness or some interaction between per-

sonalities). 30 It moved into wider theory under the infl]] uence of the French post-structuralists. They rejected the idea of meaning as a refl ection of the intention of an author but instead insisted that texts could support a range

of meanings, depending on the circumstances in which they were read.

With every reading there could be a new meaning. A key fi gure in this

group, with whom Foucault was linked, was the literary theorist Roland

Barthes. He pushed the idea of the narrative to the fore, moving it away

from purely literary texts into all forms of communication. There were,

he wrote in 1968, “countless forms of narrative,” including “articulated

language, whether oral or written, pictures, still or moving, gestures, and

an ordered mixture of all those substances; narrative is present in myth,

legend, fables, tales, short stories, epics, history, tragedy, drama . . . comedy, pantomime, paintings . . . stained-glass windows, movies, local news, conversation.” It was to be found “at all times, in all places, in all societies.”

There had “never been anywhere, any people without narrative; all classes,

all human groups, have their stories, and very often those stories are enjoyed by men of different and even opposite cultural backgrounds: narrative

remains largely unconcerned with good or bad literature. Like life itself, it is there, international, transhistorical, transcultural.”

Not only were there an “infi nite number of narratives,” they could be

considered from many vantage points, including history, psychology, sociol-

ogy, ethnology, and aesthetics. Barthes believed it possible to identify com-

mon structures through deductive theory. 31 The next year another member]]

of this group, Tzvetan Todorov, introduced “narratology,” which involved

distinguishing the component parts of a narrative and considering the rela-

tionships between them. What was narrated was the story, a sequence of

events with characters, held together by a plot line that gave it structure

and explained causation—why the events occurred when they did. Discourse

described the presentation of the story, what determined its eventual appear-

ance to an audience.

428

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

By the late 1970s, there was talk of a “narrative turn” in social theory.

A recollection of a conference at the University of Chicago in 1979 spoke of

an “aura of intellectual excitement and discovery, the common feeling that

the study of narrative, like the study of other signifi cant human creations, has taken a quantum leap in the modern era.” It was “no longer the province

of literary specialists or folklorists borrowing their terms from psychology

and linguistics but has now become a positive source of insight for all the

branches of human and natural science.” 32]] It was later reported how during the 1980s the social sciences became caught up in a “wave of theorizing

about narratives,” inspired by the belief that analyzing the stories people told

would provide vital insights into how they lived their lives. 33

Narratives were often described as being interchangeable with stories,

and stories could be extremely simple. The argument that anything could

count as a story refl ected their importance in basic human communication.

Mark Turner argued that life would be chaotic without simple stories turning

pieces of information into a coherent pattern. Even babies developed links

between containers, liquid fl ows, mouths, and taste in a story that eventually became entitled “drinking.” With only partial information, these simple stories facilitated imagining the next step or what happened before. Narrative

imagining, argued Turner, was fundamental both to our ability to explain

and our ability to predict. 34]] William Calvin suggested a close relationship between our ability to plan and our construction of narratives. “To some

extent, we do this by talking silently to ourselves, making narratives out of what might happen next and then applying syntax-like rules of combination

to rate a scenario as unlikely, possible or likely.” [^35]

Here was a concept that could explain how meaning was given to lives

and relationships and how the world was understood. It fi t in with theories of cognition and accounts of culture. The narrative turn therefore captured the

uncertain confi dence about what was actually known, the fascination with

the variety of interpretations that could be attached to the same event, and

the awareness of the choices made when constructing identity. It highlighted

the importance of human imagination and empathy while challenging the

idea of a perfect knowledge of an external reality.

Soon the academic interest in narrative found its way into the public

domain. Psychologists used narratives as forms of therapy, lawyers employed

them in their efforts to move juries, and claimants needed them when seeking

redress. Over time, the self-conscious use of narratives extended to all types of political actors. Initially the major interest appears to have been among

radical groups and others who were seeking to compensate for a lack of mate-

rial resources. It was another way the weak could take on the strong: less

f r a m e s , p a r a d i g m s , d i s c o u r s e s , a n d n a r r a t i v e s 429

muscle but better stories. A battle of narratives was to be preferred to a real battle. Eventually any political project, from whatever part of the spectrum, demanded its very own narrative.

The narratives could have a number of functions: means by which support

could be mobilized and directed, solidarity sustained and dissidents kept

in line, strategies formulated and disseminated. Their role, not always par-

ticularly deliberate, could be detected in the movements coming out of the

counterculture, such as those demanding rights for women and gays and

other marginalized groups. Their use gained credence from Foucauldian type

analysis, using stories of victimhood, humiliation, and resistance to let people in similar situations gain strength from being part of a wider movement,

linking their private frustrations with a public cause.

They would challenge stories fi rmly embedded in the culture, casting

doubt on their veracity and fairness. As early as the 1950s, for example,

Native Americans began to object to the classic westerns, which pitched

brave cowboys against savage Indians. Italian Americans complained about

their image being dominated by mobster movies. The civil rights move-

ment depended on the contrast between the comfortable presentations of the

American dream and the black experience. The black singer Paul Robeson

deliberately changed the lyrics of “Ol’ Man River” from “I gets weary and sick of trying, I’m tired of living and scared of dying” to “I keep trying instead of crying, I must keep fi ghting or else I’m dying.” 36 In this case there was an]]

established sense of oppression, and the question was whether much could be

done about it. Many of the movements of the late 1960s began with far less

clarity about whether personal feelings of frustration could be translated into political action. Here autobiographical stories could help otherwise disparate individuals fi nd common cause through their shared experiences. In 1972

in the fi rst issue of _Ms._ , a magazine for the women’s movement, an article by Jane O’Reilly described the immediate understanding a group of women

had to another’s story. This was the “click,” a moment of recognition, “that

parenthesis of truth around a little thing that completes the puzzle of reality in women’s minds—the moment that brings a gleam our eyes and means the

revolution has begun.” Soon “click” had become a “feminist term of art,” a

way of referring to a shared understanding of the deeper meaning of an appar-

ently banal comment. 37

Narratives describing social situations from the perspectives of those who

in the past might have been belittled or marginalized found their way into

more established literary forms, such as novels, movies, and even situation

comedies. Black and gay characters were shown in positive lights, women

were expected to be more assertive, and male assertiveness and insensitivity

430

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

was often derided. Especially on TV, the story-telling might be controlled, with the progressive themes sanitized so as to render the new characters safe and unthreatening. There was no single, approved narrative of what it meant

to be a “liberated” woman or a gay man operating among “straights.” It was

easier to confront white prejudice when the victims epitomized goodness,

for example, a fi gure such as Sidney Poitier as the idealistic physician in the 1967 movie _Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner_ . It took some time before the full complexity of black experience and its encounters with white society could

be portrayed. Change of this sort was only barely politically directed or controlled, although political leaders were obliged to give their views on where it all might be leading. So the process was nothing so simple as one paradigm or narrative being changed for another. The diversity of the contributions and their cumulative effects altered the terms of the debate, but this was not the result of any deliberate strategy.

According to David Ronfeldt and John Arquilla, who were at the fore

in exploring the new forms of politics made possible in the information

age, stories could express “a sense of identity and belonging” and commu-

nicate “a sense of cause, purpose, and mission.” This would help a dispersed

group cohere and guide their strategy. They knew the sort of action expected

of them and the message to be conveyed. 38 W]]ithin a movement, inspirational stories might be told to enthuse activists, exemplary ones to reinforce approved norms, and cautionary tales to warn of the danger of rash moves or

deviations from the agreed line. In developing support, stories could be told to illustrate the core message and to undermine the claims of opponents.

This also meant that internal arguments about strategy could take the form

of debates over narratives. Those nervous about strategic departures might

offer warnings based on reminiscences about how campaigns were waged in

the past and how well they fared.

The greatest challenges came with attempts to infl uence those who were

not natural supporters. As the concept moved into the political mainstream,

there was talk of grand narratives as setting the basic terms in which a political group would wish to be identifi ed, its aims and values, and its relationship to the issues of the day. Once this narrative was set, then individual

episodes might be “spun” by specialist communicators known as “spin doc-

tors,” who understood the media and made it their business to infl uence

the daily news agenda and frame events. 39 Convincing the public that the]]

economy was really doing well when the latest data suggested the opposite,

or that the murky past of a candidate for high offi ce was irrelevant, required a keen sense of media methods and schedules, including how to time news

announcements and brief key journalists. Such narratives were not necessarily f r a m e s , p a r a d i g m s , d i s c o u r s e s , a n d n a r r a t i v e s 431

analytical and, when not grounded in evidence or experience, could rely on appeals to emotion or suspect metaphors and dubious historical analogies.

A successful narrative would link certain events while disentangling others,

distinguish good news from bid tidings, and explain who was winning and

losing.

The impact of these ideas, whether framing paradigms or discourses—or

propaganda, consciousness, hegemony, belief-systems, _resources/books//Strategy_ A History - Lawrence Freedman, constructs,

and mind-sets for that matter—was to encourage the view that a struggle for

power was at root a struggle to shape widely accepted views of the world. In

the past, a similar understanding had led socialists to prepare for long cam-

paigns of political education, conducted by means of pamphlets and lectures.

This was now a media age and the opportunities to shape and disseminate

opinions and presentations of the truth were now many and various. The

techniques pioneered by Bernays, with his intuitive grasp of the importance

of framing, now promised an even greater impact. The struggle over _resources/books//Strategy_ A History - Lawrence Freedman

and ideas did not become one between radicals and resisters but between

mainstream political activists, with the benefi ciaries in the fi rst instance turning out to be the Right rather than the Left.

Race, Religion, and Elections

_Don’t you see that the whole aim of newspeak is to narrow the range of_

_thought?_

—George Orwell, _1984_

In the aftermath of President Bush’s victory over Senator John Kerry

in November 2004, an election Democrats thought they could and should

have won, early postmortems stressed the lack of a narrative. Kerry’s pollster, Stanley Greenberg, observed that the Republicans had “a _narrative_ that motivated their voters.” Robert Shrum, another member of Kerry’s team regret-

ted: “We had a _narrative_ , but in the end, I don’t think it came through.”

Top Democrat consultant, James Carville, was harsher. “They say, ‘I’m going

to protect you from the terrorists in Tehran and the homos in Hollywood.’

We say, ‘We’re for clean air, better schools, more health care.’ And so there’s a Republican _narrative_ , a story, and there’s a Democratic litany.” William Safi re, a columnist with a keen eye for shifts in political language, reported the views of Jim Phelan, editor of a journal on narrative studies, that all this sounded like the development of a new Democrat narrative. “That is, they

are selecting events from the campaign and abstracting from them in order to

supply a coherent _narrative_ of why Kerry lost. Their coherent _narrative_ is that he had no coherent _narrative_ .” He suggested that if Kerry had won he would

be being congratulated for the coherence of his narrative. 1

It was the case that Republicans had been paying attention for some time to the use of language to sharpen their political message. In this the key

event had been the collaboration between Representative Newt Gingrich

and consultant Frank Lutz to take Congress for the Republicans in the 1994

midterm elections. The centerpiece of the campaign was the “Contract with

America.” According to Lutz, the word _contract_ was chosen because plan sounded insuffi ciently binding, promises were made to be broken, pledges

went unfulfi lled, platforms were too political, oaths too legal, and covenants too religious. The adjective “Republican” was left off to encourage indepen-

dents to keep an open mind. 2 In the actual document, a lot of effort went

into talking about personal responsibility, family reinforcement, and tax cuts (“American Dream Reinforcement”). In 1995, the two men combined on

a memo for the new Republican Congressmen entitled “Language: A Key

Mechanism of Control,” which urged that they talk of themselves using such

words as “opportunity, truth, moral, courage, reform, prosperity” and portray their opponents in term of such words as “crisis, destructive, sick, pathetic, lie, liberal, betray.” 3]]

Even before the 2004 presidential election, anxious Democrats who spe-

cialized in language, notably the linguist George Lakoff, had been urging

that attention be paid to the clever way that issues were being framed to put Democrats on the defensive (for example, talking about the “inheritance tax”

as the “death tax”). Once the confl ict was being fought in the enemy’s lan-

guage, too much had been conceded. To Lakoff the great challenge was to turn

these frames around so that Americans came to see the issues with new ideas.

“Reframing is social change.” [^4] After the election, he pressed home his point, insisting that big philosophical debates were arguments over metaphors, and

that impact of facts depended on the frames with which they were under-

stood. 5 Drew W]]esten, a clinical psychologist and active Democrat, expressed his frustration by writing a book urging his party to learn to appeal to voters’ emotions. It was enthusiastically endorsed by Bill Clinton and Westen

appears to have been read carefully and consulted by the Democratic fi eld

during the 2008 campaign.

The problem, Westen suggested, was that Democrats wanted to believe

that campaigns were about issues and that it would be possible to appeal to

the rationality and better nature of voters. Unfortunately, human beings are

barely rational creatures. Instead, they respond to messages which tug on

their emotions and are prone to feel as much as see the world. “Most of the

time, this battle for control of our minds occurs outside of awareness, leav-

ing us as blind spectators to our own psychodrama, prisoners of the _resources/books//Strategy_ A History - Lawrence Freedman

cast on the wall of our skulls.” Republicans understood this and developed a

434

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

narrative of themselves as on the side of patriotism and God. Democrats were soft and fuzzy, inattentive on crime and limp in facing the nation’s enemies, stuck with rhetoric about fi ghting for the working people of America as if

the country was still facing the challenges of the 1930s. When persuading

voters to back them, Republicans had no compunction about resorting to

negativity, while Democrats continued to act as if they could rise above such aggression, dismissing the negativity as irrelevant and a turn-off for voters.

To remedy the situation, Democrats had to learn to frame issues to their

advantage and go on the attack, fi nding ways of convincing voters that their candidate was in tune with voters’ interests and values, defi ning the party

and its principles in ways that were emotionally compelling. This involved

developing a grand narrative that was coherent, using policy positions to

illustrate principles and not the other way around. Such a narrative would be simple, coherent, and accessible, not depend on too many leaps of inference

or imagination. It could be understood and then told and retold. “It should

have a moral, be vivid and memorable, and be moving. Its central elements

should be easy to visualize, to maximize its memorability and emotional

impact.” It was best to act fi rst, before views had been fully formed, when

there might be opportunities to “inoculate” against the opponent’s negativ-

ity by acknowledging minor weaknesses. Westen’s basic claim was that elec-

tions were “won and lost not primarily on the issues but on the values and

emotions of the electorate including the gut feelings that summarize much

of what voters think and feel about a candidate and a party.” 6]]

Westen’s proposals, and those of Lakoff, indicated a considerable faith

in the power of words and _resources/books//Strategy_ A History - Lawrence Freedman, encouraging a belief that even the most

liberal platform could be embraced by a majority of the electorate if only

it was put together with suffi cient emotional intelligence and professional

media skills. It refl ected in its own way a rather dismal view of public opinion as malleable and manipulable, tugged in one direction or another by the

quality of rival narratives. The psychologist Stephen Pinker warned that this approach exaggerated the importance of metaphors, which were often used

without much sense of the origins or implications, and of the role of frames.

The idea that better metaphors and frames could be pounded into voters’

brains risked turning into a retreat from reason, caricaturing opposing beliefs

and underestimating opponents. 7]] Lutz’s own guide to the use of language acknowledged the importance of framing issues, but his stress was on more

basic rules of communication. He aimed for simplicity and brevity; short

words and short sentences; attention to consistency, imagery, sound, and tex-

ture; and language that was aspirational and offered novelty. Only toward

the end of his list did he point to the need to “provide context and explain

r a c e , r e l i g i o n , a n d e l e c t i o n s

435

relevance.” Credibility, he noted, was as important as philosophy. Explicitly addressing Lakoff, he observed that “language alone cannot achieve miracles.

Actual policy counts at least as much as how something is framed.” [^8]

Studies of the infl uence of mass communications gave little encourage-

ment to suggestions that it was easy to shift public opinion in a direction

it was not prepared to go. Partisans might be engaged, but the bulk of

the target audience tended to be inattentive and distracted, so key mes-

sages did not reach many people. People could remain indifferent to issues

in which they had little interest and resistant to views which contradicted

those already held. Either they deliberately avoided such views or saw them

as weak and riddled with error when they did confront them. One account

of the relevant research recorded as a core fi nding that personal infl uence was more important than mass communication: “Political persuasion is contingent on circumstance. Persuasion grows more likely when campaigns face

little opposition, when resistance is diminished, when well-placed sources

provide simple and decisive cues, and when history intrudes on attentive

citizens.” [^9]

_The New Politics_

The issue of the political use of language emerged out of the “new politics” of the 1960s. The events of 1968 turned out to serve the American Right more

than the Left. This was in part because the upheavals on the campuses and

the inner cities created a strong negative reaction that Republicans were able to exploit thereafter, and they were still trying to do so four decades later.

Norman Mailer observed that year, while waiting for a civil rights leader

to turn up for a press conference for which he was already forty minutes

late, of how he had experienced a “very unpleasant emotion: ‘he was get-

ting tired of Negroes and their rights.’ ” 10]] This led him to refl ect that if he felt “even a hint this way, then what immeasurable tides of rage must be

loose in America?” The “backlash” was already underway, directed not only

at blacks but also at unpatriotic radicals, drug-taking hippies, and protest-

ing students. One benefi ciary was Richard Nixon, who regained the White

House for the Republicans. If a new politics was making an appearance, it

depended less on the rejection of professional politicians as a barrier to the authentic expression of popular feelings and more on the cultivation of more

professional political forms, as a way of maximizing voter turnout. The New

Left’s despairing attitude to electoral politics had left the fi eld open to the New Right.

436

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

Successful politicians always had campaign managers. By and large these were close associates of the candidates with a feel for popular moods and the sort of ruthless streak that left them with little compunction when it came

to blackening the names of their opponents. By the late 1960s, the role was

becoming much more professional. A series of advances in polling, advertis-

ing methods, and tactical analysis were coming together. The possibilities

for shaping opinion opened up by the mass media reached a new level when

television was added to newspapers and radio. The ability to disseminate a

message to extraordinary numbers of potential voters was coupled with pos-

sibilities for tailoring that message to the interests and views of particular constituencies. Sophisticated forms of polling based on demographic sampling, pioneered by George Gallup in the 1930s, made it possible to monitor

developing trends in opinion and identify issues of high salience.

In 1933, the campaigning socialist journalist Upton Sinclair, author

of _The Jungle_ , wrote a short book entitled _I, Governor of California and How_ _I Ended Poverty_ . It was a bestseller, a history of the future. Sinclair claimed it was a unique attempt by a historian “to make his history true.” California was then a one-party Republican state, but also had 29 percent unemployment. Sinclair decided to run as a Democrat on a promise to end poverty

through cooperative factories and farms and higher taxes. The fi rst part

of his story became a reality. He did get the nomination for governor and

generated great national excitement. Unfortunately for him, the possibil-

ity that the script set out in his book might be followed alarmed California

Republicans. Clem Whitaker and Leone Baxter, publicists for the “California

League against Sinclairism,” adopted a simple method to head off this threat.

They immersed themselves in everything he had written and found a stream

of deadly quotes—for example, statements doubting the sanctity of mar-

riage—without worrying about context or whether these were attributed to

characters in his novels. They appeared on a regular basis in the _Los Angeles_ _Times_ . Sinclair’s nonfi ction sequel was “How I Got Licked.”

Whitaker and Baxter ran Campaigns Inc., the fi rst political consultancy

to offer their services at a price. They took advantage of reforms which had

been initiated by the Progressives in order to break the hold of local party

bosses over state politics. These prevented parties from endorsing candidates who therefore had to engage more directly with the electorate. Whitaker

and Baxter claimed that in their fi rst two decades, they had won seventy out of the seventy-fi ve contests in which they were involved. They only worked

for Republicans, which was often the case for the fi rst generation of consultants. They also ran campaigns against health care reforms, fi rst in California and then nationally, helping create the bogey of socialized medicine. They

r a c e , r e l i g i o n , a n d e l e c t i o n s

437

pioneered techniques to infl uence public opinion that continue to be employed: sending rural newspapers press releases dressed up as ready-made

editorials and features, focusing on personalities rather than issues, always attacking (“You can’t wage a defensive campaign and win”), taking the

opponent seriously and anticipating their moves, and keeping the campaign

theme simple. Subtlety was bad; repetition was good. According to Baxter,

“Words that lean on the mind are no good. They must dent it.” 11]] Their services did not come cheap, but their clients were big businesses and the

Republicans, the party of business. Republican senator Mark Hanna of Ohio,

an accomplished campaign manager, remarked early in the century that “the

three most important things in American politics are money, money and

I forget what the other one is.” Over time, fundraising became so important

that it became yet another task for which consultants were needed. 12

The party bosses were undermined by the increased role of primary elec-

tions in the nominating process, which after 1968 involved the majority of

the states. The complexity of the American political system, with regular

timetabled elections for numerous positions at all levels of government, pro-

vided plenty of business for consultancies with credible track records of getting their people elected. One estimate in 2001 suggested that if all elected posts were included, some quite lowly, there were over fi ve hundred thousand elected offi cials in the United States with about a million elections over a four-year cycle. 13 This was one reason why James Thurber described cam-]]

paign consultants in 2000 as being at “the core of the electoral process in the United States and in many other states.” [^14] As early as 1970 it was claimed that campaigns were less between candidates than between “titans of the

campaign industry working on behalf of those personalities.” [^15]

When the journalist James Perry wrote _The New Politics_ in 1968, it was therefore not about how protests, demonstrations, civil disobedience, and

community organizations might be shaking up the old elite, but about how

polling and marketing were becoming more sophisticated. He even drew

attention to the potential uses of computers. 16]] Yet these techniques, no more than the efforts of the New Left, did not guarantee success. Much of Perry’s

book described how the moderate George Romney was taking advantage of

these techniques in the race for the 1968 Republican presidential nomina-

tion. By the time the book was published, Romney’s campaign had collapsed,

having failed to connect with voters—a problem aggravated by Romney’s

disastrous claim that his past support for the Vietnam War was the result of

“brainwashing” by the Pentagon.

The importance of television had been underlined in different ways in

the previous two elections. John Kennedy had famously gained an advantage

438

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

over Nixon in the televised presidential debate in 1960, and then the possibilities of negative advertising had been underlined by one used by the

Democrats against the hawkish Barry Goldwater in 1964. This showed a

small girl counting daisies as a missile countdown began leading toward a

nuclear explosion, with President Johnson in the background urging peace.

This became identifi ed as a turning point in technique. It played on an established image of Goldwater’s recklessness. The appeal of the ad was emotional.

It contained no facts and Goldwater’s name was not mentioned. 17]]

On the basis of his 1960 experience, Nixon’s attitude toward television

was one of deep suspicion, but he was persuaded by television producer

Roger Ailes that it could work to his advantage. His efforts in that regard

were recorded by a journalist friend of Ailes, Joe McGinnis. The title of his book, _Selling of the President_ , captured the idea that someone so unprepos-sessing could be turned into a marketable political product. In contrast to

the later focus on negative advertising, the aim at this stage was positive.

The intention was to create a Nixon image independent of his words. As

McGinnis explained:

Nixon would say his same old tiresome things but no one would have

to listen. The words would become Muzak. Something pleasant and

lulling in the background. The fl ashing pictures would be carefully

selected to create the impression that somehow Nixon represented

competence, respect for tradition, serenity, faith that the American

people were better than people anywhere else, and that all these prob-

lems others shouted about meant nothing in a land blessed with the

tallest buildings, strongest armies, biggest factories, cutest children

and rosiest sunsets in the world. Even better: through association with

the pictures Richard Nixon could become these very things. 18

Ailes was probably happier with the book’s message than Nixon.

The aim of the media campaign was to demonstrate that Nixon was more

likable than supposed and could be found safely in the center ground of poli-

tics. In this respect it fi t in with what was in practice a rather “old politics”

campaign. This was the last Republican nomination in which the majority

of delegates were chosen by the party organization rather than primaries, so

Nixon was able to follow a traditional route through deals with party insid-

ers rather than demonstrating broad appeal. His basic strategy was standard

for a candidate whose core support did not command a majority: he moved

to the center and sought to soften his own right-wing image. Positions were

carefully formulated to draw in the maximum amount of support, even if few

were left excited. His former speech writer described Nixon’s “centrism” as

r a c e , r e l i g i o n , a n d e l e c t i o n s

439

based on the “pragmatic splitting of differences along a line drawn through the middle of the electorate.” The aim was to fi nd the “least assailable middle ground.” Instead of the “grand theme,” his interest was in the “small

adjustment, which might provide an avenue of escape.” [^19] Moreover, however expertly Nixon was marketed, his cautious approach to the campaign meant

that his early lead was whittled down and he became president on a surpris-

ingly narrow margin.

_The New Conservative Majority_

To one commentator, who worked for Nixon in 1968, the candidate’s fail-

ure was in not recognizing the true opportunities created by the turmoil of

the 1960s. Kevin Phillips, a young lawyer with an interest in ethnography,

wrote a book in 1967 entitled _The Emerging Republican Majority_ . Because the publisher had held it back to see whether it was validated in the 1968

presidential election, it was not actually published until 1969. The book

was long and analytical, with 143 charts and 47 maps, but the underlying

message was straightforward. The country had been dominated by a lib-

eral establishment that was now old and out of touch, “a privileged elite,

blind to the needs and interests of the large national majority,” a position

of course also taken by the New Left. The elite had created “a gap between

words and deeds which helped to drive racial and youthful minorities into

open revolt.”

Phillips saw in the developing racial politics an opportunity for

Republicans, because they could mobilize whites even as the Democrats

attracted new black voters. Against the New Left’s idealism and the old pro-

gressive hope that ethnic differences could be transcended, Philips asserted

that these identities were strong and enduring. While Jews and blacks might

go with the Democrats, the minorities with a more Catholic background—

Poles, Germans, Italians—were lining up against the liberals. Though

immigrant communities once saw the Democrats as a defense against the

Protestant Republican establishment in the North, now their children saw

the Democrats as hostile. In New York, Phillips charted the movement of

working-class Catholics to the right, mapping it by district and showing that it was safe for Republicans to oppose the urban liberal agenda of rent subsidies, equal opportunity, and community action. This agenda, he argued, was

pushing whites away from the inner cities to suburbia, and this was part of a wider movement from the decaying North to the “sunbelt” of the South and

West. Phillips was not arguing that the new confi guration was inevitable.

It required Republicans to seize the opportunity. He argued that Richard Nixon’s majority in 1968 was so thin precisely because Republicans did not

follow his ideas and tried to pretend that the candidate was something milder than was actually the case.

One objection to Phillips’s thesis was with his “grim satisfaction” in the

“incorrigible meanness of the American voter” and his “undisguised scorn”

for “sentimentalists” who resisted his fi ndings. 20 The fact that politics could]]

play on human difference was anathema to many. Against this it could be

argued that he was only making explicit what had long been a feature of

American politics. Roosevelt’s New Deal coalition had worked precisely

because he found a way of keeping in the same party racists and blacks, anti-

labor and pro-labor groups, ardent reformers and corrupt party machines.

The Depression made it possible to subsume ethnic identities under shared

economic interests, but few working in city politics believed that they had

gone away. [^21]

A second objection was that it was poor political science because it

required Republican Party politics to follow a path many Republicans would

resist. [^22] There were limits to the southern strategy Nixon could follow in 1968. Governor George Wallace of Alabama was running as a third-party

candidate on a segregationist platform and eventually took fi ve southern

states. Nixon’s main nod in the direction of the new political confi guration was to snub the Republican Party’s liberal wing in his choice of vice president. New York governor Nelson Rockefeller had fought a poor campaign,

and so Nixon felt able to ignore him as a possible running mate and opt

instead for the relatively unknown Maryland governor Spiro Agnew, who had

a moderate past but was moving to the right. As vice president he made his

name by attacking the liberal elite with some memorable alliteration (“pusil-

lanimous pussyfooters,” “nattering nabobs of negativism”).

In 1970, Phillips’s message was repeated in a more careful form by two

moderate Democrat pollsters, Richard Scammon and Ben Wattenberg. The

Republican majority was not yet in place but, they warned, it could be

if the Democrats did not acknowledge anxiety among their natural con-

stituents about crime and permissiveness. 23]] Instead, the Democrats moved to the left, with young activists pushing those issues that alarmed centrist voters, thus marginalizing the party’s former establishment. The

Democratic nominee in 1972, the liberal and antiwar George McGovern,

was trounced by Nixon. The administration was then rocked by scandal

as fi rst Agnew was forced to resign because of corruption and then Nixon

because he was being impeached for dirty tricks during the 1972 campaign

and an attempted cover-up. The accidental president Gerald Ford and his

r a c e , r e l i g i o n , a n d e l e c t i o n s

441

vice president Nelson Rockefeller, neither of whom had been on the ticket in 1972, lost in 1976. The conservative theme was then picked up with a

vengeance by Ronald Reagan.

_Ronald Reagan_

After his Hollywood career came to an end, Ronald Reagan had made his

political name as a right-wing speaker. In 1954, he was hired as offi cial public spokesman for General Electric Corporation—which meant he spoke at GE

plants around the country, lauding the virtues of free enterprise and warning of the dangers of big government and communism. Reagan was telegenic

with an easy, affable style that helped him link with people who might oth-

erwise recoil from his politics. Reagan also had an ability to drift in and out of the fi ctional and nonfi ctional worlds which he inhabited, which made his claims credible even when they were fanciful. His biographer described a

mind occupied by “stories, a make-believe world in which heroic deeds had

the capacity to transform reality.” The make-believe and real worlds coalesced in his mind. He always sounded sincere because he said what he believed,

even if it did not correspond to the facts. In any confl ict between feelings

and fact, feelings won. “He believed in the power of stories, sincerely told.” 24

When he ran for governor of California in 1966, he followed the tradi-

tional route by edging suffi ciently to the center to ensure that voters were not put off by his reputation. He avoided replying to attacks that he was right

wing and inexperienced, toned down his speeches, and put together sup-

porting committees which included known moderates. One of his managers

later explained that they dealt with the inexperience charge by agreeing that

“Reagan was not a professional politician. He was citizen politician. There,

we had an automatic defense. He didn’t have to have the experience. A citi-

zen’s politician’s not expected to know all the answers to all of the issues.”

It even put his opponent, long-time governor Pat Brown, on the defensive

for being a professional. This became a theme in many American elections

thereafter. Reagan’s team relied on question and answer sessions to address

the charge that he was no more than an actor who knew how to memorize

and deliver a good speech. While the campaign managers had not intended

to dwell on the unrest of the Berkeley campus, they also noted that it worked in their favor. [^25]

Once elected as governor, Reagan was seen as a potential conservative can-

didate for the presidency. His hat was tentatively in the ring in 1968 but his real preparation did not begin until after he had fi nished his second term as 442

s t r a t e g y f r o m b e l o w

governor in 1974. He used a nationally syndicated column and radio program to keep himself in the public eye and also as a means of refi ning his messages, identifying the words and themes that got the best response from his audiences. By this time, more than twice as many Americans (38%) described

themselves as conservative rather than liberal (15%). This still left a majority

describing themselves as middle of the road (43%). 26 In 1976, Reagan’]]s bid for the Republican nomination against Ford made suffi cient headway to set

him up for a successful campaign in 1980. In this he was helped by Jimmy

Carter’s doleful presidency as he struggled to cope with the economic and

international crises of the late 1970s. Reagan’s message began by noting the

distinction between the social conservatism associated with the Democratic

Party and the economic conservatism, opposed to defi cit spending and big

government, associated with the Republican Party. He then insisted that

“the old lines that once clearly divided these two kinds of conservatism are

disappearing.” He envisioned “not simply a melding together of the two

branches of American conservatism into a temporary uneasy alliance, but the

creation of a new lasting majority.” 27]] The second strand was to claim that not only could these two traditions be combined, but that this would lead to a

bountiful future. In this respect he offered a traditional politician’s prom-

ise of more of everything, an America both stronger and wealthier, a sunny

optimism in sharp contrast to Carter’s melancholy. When he debated Carter

as the Republican nominee, Reagan sought to present himself as the main-

stream and sealed his bid by asking the pointed question of whether people

were better off than they were four years earlier.

In two areas Reagan demonstrated the importance of getting messages

across that cemented his support among groups that were essential to his

new Republican majority. One part of this was his appeal to Southern voters,

who had to be weaned away from Jimmy Carter—one of their own. While

carefully avoiding overt racism, Reagan began his campaign in Philadelphia,

Mississippi, a town notorious for the murder of three civil rights workers in the 1960s. Standing beside a known segregationist, Reagan stressed his belief in “states’ rights,” an evident code for the obstruction of black advances. The second area in which Reagan made a defi nite appeal for a particular constituency was in his pitch to the religious right.

Reagan, who was not known to be a regular churchgoer, concluded his

acceptance speech in 1980 with a moment that was apparently spontane-

ous although actually carefully prepared. He had been wondering, he said,[pa r t i v](index_split_000.html#p9)

Strategy from Above

[c h a p t e r 2 8](index_split_000.html#p9)

The Rise of the Management Class

_Imagine the consequences of that comprehensive bureaucratization and_ _rationalization which already today we see approaching. Already now,_

_throughout private enterprise in wholesale manufacture, as well as in all_ _other economic enterprises run on modern lines . . . rational calculation is_ _manifest at every stage. By it, the performance of each individual worker_ _is mathematically measured, each man becomes a little cog in the machine,_ _and, aware of this, his one preoccupation is to become a bigger cog._

—Max Weber, _1909_

The previous section was concerned with strategy from below, that

is, how those who lacked power sought to acquire it for the people they

claimed to represent. This section is concerned with those who already had

power, in the sense of being in a position to take authoritative decisions,

but had to work out what to do with it. The focus is largely on business,

but much of the discussion is as relevant to those at the top of any large

organization, including in the public sector. This group, which we will call

the managers, has been the recipient of more strategic advice than any other

group, including generals. The provision of advice to the top of organi-

zations and then to subunits explains why the idea of strategy became so

ubiquitous.

Strategy was necessary because relationships were complicated. Executives in a major corporation, for example, would have to deal at the same time,

inter alia, with owners, unit heads, suppliers, competitors, governments, and customers. Each relationship was likely to involve a mixture of cooperation

and confl ict, often in ways that were not quite captured in the offi cial rhetoric of partnership and collegiality internally and cutthroat competition externally. The challenges of managing down the vertical axis of the organizational hierarchy would be quite different to doing so across the horizontal axis of

competitors and regulatory bodies, and thus generated different types of strategic literature. Because the advice in this literature was largely generic and often not geared to any particular scenario, it discussed relationships in broad terms, more about how to relate over time to the internal and external operating environments than how to mount specifi c campaigns. It was more about

the impact of changes in administrative practice or available technology than how to address the power of others. The diversity of relationships, activities, and structures meant that management strategy struggled more with theory

than did the military and political spheres. There developed a relationship

with the social sciences as intense as it was unsatisfactory. The interactions with economics, largely in the form of game theory, and sociology, largely in the form of organization theory, demonstrated both the possibilities and the

limitations of the social sciences.

In this section, therefore, we will take forward issues of contemporary

social theory, which began in the last section with consideration of notions

of paradigms and narratives. Just as the rise of the managers represented the logic of bureaucratization and rationalism, so too was the rise of the social sciences. They developed as refl ections on and studies of modern industrial

societies, with all their upheavals and confl icts, and then came to offer remedies to the troubles they described. Yet the processes of professionalization took them into forms of specialist analysis and presentation that left them

detached from those who might have been expected to fi nd their work the

most valuable. Theory and action struggled to relate to each other.

_The Managers_

The derivation of the verb “to manage” is found in late thirteenth-century

Italian. _Maneggiare_ referred to the ability to handle a horse, drawn from _manus_ , the Latin for “hand.” It was used in the sixteenth century in this way and eventually moved over to the conduct of any affairs, from war to marriage, from the plot of a novel to personal fi nances. It suggested something 460

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

more than administration but less than total control, requiring persuasive or manipulative as well as coercive skills, a fl air for extracting more from a person, organization, or situation than might have otherwise been expected.

The sense of less than total control remained important. Managing implied

coping, dealing with a state of affairs that could never fully be controlled.

The profession of management referred to people employed for their

administrative and supervisory skills in handling complex affairs, such as

those of an estate or business. For this reason, the role of the manager could be expected to stop short of strategy. Ultimate control, and therefore strategy, would stay in the hands of the owner. This remained the case in standard

forms of business governance. Managers reported to a board appointed by the

shareholders, responsible for approving budgets and making big decisions.

The more complex the organization to be managed, however, the greater

the dependence on the managers, and so whatever the organizational charts

might say, effective power began to rest with those who actually understood

the issues. Full-time managers could soon learn how to frame an issue so that their preferred outcome was the obvious one for a board to take.

As business enterprises grew into massive corporations, the managers

appeared to be effectively in charge, with their own preferred candidates

appointed to the boards that were notionally supervising them. Nonetheless,

management still involved less than control. Managers were employees who

could be—and often were—fi red when affairs were badly handled. Their suc-

cess would depend on an ability to get the best out of those beneath them in

the hierarchy, but unlike the military chain of command (with which com-

parisons were natural), there was likely to be a greater range of functions to be coordinated and less reliance on unquestioning obedience.

The notion that management was a new profession of increasing impor-

tance, essential to the performance of modern businesses, was recognized

in the establishment of business schools. The fi rst was the Wharton School

at Pennsylvania, founded in 1881. The management in question, however,

was of potentially unruly workforces as much as complex business processes.

The “labor issue” was a major preoccupation. Joseph Wharton wished the

school to teach “the nature and prevention of strikes” as well as “the neces-

sity for modern industry of organizing under single leaders or employers

great amounts of capital and great numbers of laborers, and of maintain-

ing discipline among the latter.” [^1] A quarter of a century passed before the Harvard Business School opened in 1908. It followed an endowment to promote an “applied science,” initially assumed to be engineering. Eventually

the university opted for business, raising at once the tension between what

many supposed to be vocational training and the university’s true purpose of

r i s e o f m a n a g e m e n t c l a s s

461

disinterested scholarship. As the fi rst dean, Edwin Gay, searched for a way to resolve this tension he came across the ideas of Frederick Winslow Taylor.

Taylor himself was skeptical, to say the least, about the value of a university education. He declined to join the faculty, but he did give regular lectures

to the new school, and more importantly, his philosophy permeated the early

curriculum.

_Taylorism_

Taylor had begun work as an engineer in the steel industry where he started

to address the question of how the workforce could be used more effi ciently.

He claimed that he had hit upon a form of management that was “a true sci-

ence, resting upon clearly defi ned laws.” So the attraction of Taylor was that he offered a way to bring together a business culture, inclined to the practical and suspicious of unnecessary erudition, with an academic culture prone

to disparage the merely technical. Dean Harlow Person of the Dartmouth

Business School, which had been founded in 1900, described Taylorism as

the “only system of management which was coherent and logical, and there-

fore was teachable.” In 1911, Person organized the fi rst international conference on scientifi c management. 2 For the new managers this was an important]]

development: their expertise and professionalism could now be recognized

with proper qualifi cations and cloaked in academic respectability.

The starting point for Taylor’s method was the belief that for each ele-

mental task of an organization there should be “one best way” found through

careful analysis and measurement. Those who analyzed and measured, and

acted upon the fi ndings, would become a new profession. Here he posited an

extremely sharp distinction between planning and doing. The fi rst required

very clever people; for the second it did not matter if people were stupid.

A doer, he remarked, would not be able to “understand the principles of this

science,” because of either a “lack of education or insuffi cient mental capacity,” and so would have to be guided at all times by the educated. 3]] It required people to work smarter but not by being smart themselves.

The more a worker could be treated as an unthinking machine the better,

because without the complication of independent thought it would be possi-

ble to calculate how best to extract optimal performance. Part of the pretence of science was the presence of quantifi cation and mathematics in establishing the most effi cient way to work with given tools when accomplishing defi ned

tasks. Work tasks would be broken down into constituent elements and then

standardized in a form that simple workers could follow. “Time-and-motion”

462

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

studies used stopwatches to time each element so a rate could be set for its completion. Once the scientifi c basis of work could be demonstrated, there

should be no argument about how it should be done. Thus this would also

represent progress in solving the “labor problem.” Taylor wrote about work-

ers as natural “loafers,” who failed to work as hard as they could. Their managers let them get away with this because they did not know any better. They

evaluated performance by rules of thumb and looked to the workers to use

their “initiative,” which to Taylor meant only that they persisted with traditional, ineffi cient ways of working. Moreover, without greater effi ciency, the management would have to reward the workers with means other than pay,

and Taylor clearly thought that pay was the best motivation of all.

Taylor’s claims about the effi ciency improvements he had achieved in the

steel industry were exaggerated. Those for which he took credit could often

be attributed to other sources. The limits of his actual achievements were

established long after his death, and after his path-breaking work had been

described to generations of management students. His basic story was about

a worker called Schmidt at Bethlehem Steel (one quarter of this company was

owned by Joseph Wharton). Schmidt was presented as an exemplary worker,

none too bright but ready to work harder for better pay, who met the target

of quadrupling the amount of pig iron loaded. Charles Wrege and Amadeo

Perroni, who discovered just how fl awed Taylor’s research had been, regretted that he had not been scrutinized early enough, before this idol with “feet of

clay” had been “hoisted onto a pedestal.” 4]] Jill Hough and Margaret White later came to Taylor’s defense, arguing that his purpose was to argue for a

new approach, that the discrepancies between his account and the evidence

were not that great, and that others successfully replicated his results. The original story must have been embellished, but this was still a compelling

way to illustrate his arguments about industrial effi ciency. The stories were part of Taylor’s strategy: acts of communication rather than research reports.

He should therefore be viewed “with an artistic appreciation for his story telling style” and recognition that his principles have served as a building block for later theorists addressing issues such as how to select and train workers, especially for standardized procedures. The basic lesson remained: “Even the

most basic processes can be substantially improved while providing benefi t

to both employer and employee.” 5

Certainly Taylor packaged his ideas in a systematic and coherent man-

ner. By this means he was able to turn himself into the fi rst management

“guru” providing seminars to business leaders and with a bestselling and

infl uential book, _The Principles of Scientifi c Management_ . After he died in 1915, described on his gravestone as “The Father of Scientifi c Management,” his

r i s e o f m a n a g e m e n t c l a s s

463

followers—such as Henry Gantt and Frank and Lillian Gilbreth—continued to develop and spread his ideas. [^6] They promoted a form of “aggressive rationality,” with science sweeping away custom and superstition for the benefi t

of all. [^7] This involved, as Taylor put it, a “mental revolution,” required of both the workers and the management. Instead of arguing about the division

of the current profi t they should work together to increase the size of the

profi t to mutual benefi t. Here was the key to another part of Taylor’s appeal.

He was offering a great compromise between management and labor, made

possible by a new caste of “effi ciency engineers.” Peter Drucker, who three

decades later saw himself picking up where Taylor had left off, suggested that scientifi c management

may well be the most powerful as well as the most lasting contribution

America has made to Western thought since the Federalist Papers. As

long as industrial society endures, we shall never lose again the insight

that human work can be studied systematically, can be analyzed, can

be improved by work on its elementary parts. 8

This philosophy was in tune with the temper of the times. Taylor opened

his book by urging effi ciency as a great national goal rather than just one for companies. He hoped the principles could be applied to all social activities, from the management of homes to churches, universities, and government

departments.

The idea that this was a “science,” which raised the standing of Taylor’s

claims, came from progressive lawyer Louis Brandeis, who eventually became

a member of the Supreme Court. During a court case in 1910, Brandeis

challenged a rise in freight rates on the railroads and sought to show how

the railroads could save money by introducing new techniques (described

as “scientifi c management”) rather than by charging more. Brandeis’s advo-

cacy went well beyond the courtroom. He linked scientifi c management with

a wider social goal of “universal preparedness.” Planning in the form of a

predetermined schedule, clear instructions, and constant supervision would

bring great rewards: “Errors are prevented instead of being corrected. The

terrible waste of delays and accidents is avoided. Calculation is substituted

for guess; demonstration for opinion.” 9]] Brandeis was by no means the only fi gure in the progressive movement to see Taylor as the answer to a rationalist’s dream. The investigative journalist Ida Tarbell praised Taylor as one of the creative geniuses of the time, contributing to “genuine cooperation and

juster human relations.” 10 Science offered a way to circumvent the powerful

confl icts that threatened to tear industrial society apart and a way to promote the general good out of the tangle of clashing sectional interests.

464

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

The progressives were particularly interested in Taylor because they were perplexed by the large organizations that were now essential to economic

growth but challenged both liberal economic and democratic theory. Thus far

they had gone for legal solutions, trying to cut the large corporations down

to size. Scientifi c management suggested a possible administrative solution.

“Effi ciency” fi t in with the progressive conviction that science rather than intuition could provide a neutral and objective basis for evaluating policies and reorganizing society to serve the needs of the majority rather than the

self-interest of the few. Brandeis urged the labor unions to embrace it, tak-

ing the chance to become actively involved in running the enterprises which

employed them. To the dismay, even bewilderment, of the progressives, the

unions bitterly resisted Taylorism. They had no interest in blurring the line between capital and labor and understood that at root scientifi c management

was not about partnership but centralized control based on strict hierarchy.

Providing management with insights into core tasks undermined workers’

control over the shop fl oor and treated them in a patronizing and dehuman-

izing manner. They saw Taylor’s methods as means by which more could be

extracted from workers without commensurate reward.

The hostility to Taylorism in the labor movement makes its adoption by

the Soviet Union even more signifi cant. Before the revolution, Lenin studied Taylor and pronounced his methods exploitative—at least so long as they

were being applied within capitalism. A fourfold increase in productivity

would not lead to a commensurate increase in wages. Yet the ideas continued

to intrigue him and once in power, facing a desperate economic situation,

he urged their careful study. In May 1918, he advised that this “last word in capitalism” be adapted for socialist purposes. “We must introduce in Russia

the study and teaching of the new Taylor System and its systematic trial

and adaptation.” He recognized that this would mean drawing on bourgeois

experts in a system that the unions had bitterly opposed. But this would

be different, Lenin insisted, for now the “workers’ commissars” could watch

management’s “every step.” 11]] It was Trotsky, charged as commissar of war, who followed this up with enthusiasm, against the objections of the so-called left-communists who saw this as another example of the new regime’s move

away from true socialism.

Lenin and Trotsky had little trouble with a system dependent on an

enlightened elite and docile followers. For Trotsky, this was about the “wise expenditure of human strength participating in production.” The work of

Taylor and his acolytes was published and applied, and a number of theorists

were invited to the Soviet Union as advisors. The urgency came because of

the struggle to cope with a country whose infrastructure was in a mess and

r i s e o f m a n a g e m e n t c l a s s

465

where a civil war was raging. Discipline and productivity were essential. For the same reasons, the Bolsheviks welcomed returning tsarist administrators,

engineers, and offi cers with vital practical knowledge. Part of this package was piecework for workers and bonuses for specialists. Unions were abolished

on the grounds that in a socialist society they were no longer necessary.

In the short term, all this effort did help raise productivity and sort out

the infrastructure. In the longer term, it helped set the framework for the

Soviet system of industrial organization, based on centralized planning and

detailed instructions to workers who had little choice but to obey as well as they could, more out of fear of punishment than expectation of reward. The

system as it evolved during the1920s, including the abolition of the unions

and the militarization of industry, has been described as “Taylorism with

teeth.” 12 This is not to hold T]]aylorism responsible for everything that befell the Soviet Union. In the circumstances of the time, there were many reasons why Lenin and Trotsky—and then Stalin—would have been inclined to

regiment the Soviet workforce. It fi t in with their ideological predispositions and authoritarian leadership. Nor were they applying Taylor as his followers, who tended to be less bombastic in their claims, intended. But the grotesque

version of scientifi c management that emerged in the Soviet Union, discon-

necting planning from doing, relying on instructions from the center to a

disciplined workforce, and persistent insistence on “one best way,” in the end illustrated the limits of the approach when followed to its logical conclusion.

_Mary Parker Follett_

In some respects, it became far easier to push Taylorism in the Soviet Union, where resistance was crushed, than in the United States, where resistance

remained active and labor unrest high. This led to a search for a business

strategy that went beyond extracting greater effi ciency out of the workforce but also addressed the broader “labor problem.” The management theorists

of this time claimed a way forward to harmony through better management.

Mary Parker Follett was as much a philosopher as a social scientist, with

an impressive background in social work and education rather than business.

She was following in the same line as Jane Addams, that of a “social feminist.”

This built on a traditional woman’s role but broadened it to include “city

housekeeping,” which suffered—according to Addams—because women,

who understood such things, had not been properly consulted. Follett fol-

lowed Addams into community work and progressive politics. Like Addams

she challenged the popular dichotomies of the time, whether elite/mass or

466

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

capital/labor, as imposing divisions instead of creating an integrated community. The crude elitist view that some were better than others seemed

to her to be a recipe for disharmony and discord. In particular, she objected to the word _masses_ and she challenged Le Bon’s corrupting “conception of people as a crowd,” susceptible to “the spread of similarities by suggestion

and imitation.”

Her aim was to fi nd means of bringing the community together as an

integrated whole. [^13] Follett objected to the idea of power (“the ability to make things happen”) when it was a domineering “power over.” Exercising power

in this way left the dominated resentful and reluctant to change their prior

positions, which would be reasserted as soon as an opportunity arose. Better

to have “power with,” because all energies—not just those of elites—would

then be mobilized in the same direction toward shared goals. This faith in

humanity led her to view democracy in terms of the evolving views of indi-

viduals coming together in groups. There was so much going on within

any group, with ideas interweaving, modifying, and reinforcing each other;

returning in new forms; and focusing on shared problems. Crude assertions

of interest would be undermined and prejudices challenged. The outcome

would represent integration, her key goal. There would neither be individu-

als nor society but “only the group and the group-unit—the social individ-

ual.” In this context, consent should be positive and not grudging, a result of participation in decisions and a sense of shared responsibility and ownership.

She was not after partnerships between previously antagonistic entities, such as negotiated agreements between management and unions, for these were

inherently non-creative. The integrated outcomes she sought would be far

more valuable. In this way (and following Dewey), democracy was a process

as much as an attainment, informed by the interplay of individual interven-

tions. Authority would come not from specifi c individuals but from “the

law of the situation” which required all to accept and address the problem as framed. If anything, therefore, her approach was anti-strategic, creating situations which it would be diffi cult for individuals to manipulate.

Although her views developed as she addressed the larger issues of demo-

cratic theory, her stress on the importance of group processes, and her determination to turn confl ict into a creative rather than a destructive factor, led her naturally into the study of organizations. From 1926, she began to challenge business groups about the need to view their enterprises within the

wider social context. She urged them to reassess their reliance on delegation and take advantage of the social bonds forged within groups, 14]] arguing the need for more bottom-up approaches to management and innovation. Follett

now appears ahead of her time with her strictures against micromanagement

r i s e o f m a n a g e m e n t c l a s s

467

(“bossiness”), in favor of fl atter management structures and participatory approaches. She argued the importance of the more informal aspects of

business organization, noting how social interactions contributed to over-

all performance. At the same time she did not challenge Taylorism directly,

accepting the expanded role for management and the advantages of authority

being vested in those with technical expertise and access to knowledge. This

did not remove hierarchy, but at least it was not based on social position nor exercised arbitrarily. The problem went back to consent, and was refl ected

in her defi nition of management as “the art of getting things done through

people.” [^15]

Follett was infl uential in her time more as a social philosopher than as a

management theorist, although she did have practical experience in Boston

on management-union relations and the development of personnel poli-

cies. Her mission can be discerned from the title of her 1918 book: _The_ _New State: Group Organization—The Solution of Popular Government_ . Here she observed, “Our political life is stagnating, capital and labor are virtually at war, the nations of Europe are at one another’s throats because we have not

yet learned how to live together.” 16 Her remedy]], however, only worked when the conditions were already in place, when there was a prior willingness to

work together on shared problems. Beyond that, there was little more than

an injunction to put differences aside and think about power relations dif-

ferently. The method required that people did not think strategically for

themselves but only on behalf of the group. This did not of course mean that

the integrated outcome would be wise or appropriate, noted much later in

reference to “groupthink” when individuals reinforced each others’ wrong

assumptions. 17]] Furthermore, as representatives of groups met with each other in a higher group, were they supposed to disregard the views of the lower

group in pursuit of a higher integration? If each group was responding to

the laws of its own situation, then at some point the variations in group

situations would matter, and there would still be confl ict to be resolved by hard bargaining or else a tough fi ght. Follett’s shrewd observations on group dynamics illustrated the organizational benefi ts of enlightened self-interest, but they provided no answer to the problems of confl ict, the point at which

strategy would be most needed.

_The Human Relations School_

Follett overlapped with another group of management theorists, with whom

she is often associated and almost certainly infl uenced, the so-called human 468

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

relations school. These other theorists had a harder edge to their philosophy and were more clearly part of the elitist school, although they also stressed the importance of social networks in making organizations work. A key fi gure here was Elton Mayo, an Australian who managed to get himself attached

to Harvard Business School in 1926 and whose name has come to be linked

to the fi rst sociological studies of industrial practice at Western Electric’s Hawthorne plant near Chicago. Before considering how he got to Harvard

and the Hawthorne studies, it is worth noting his general views.

Mayo did not present himself as a fan of Western civilization, individual-

ism, or democracy. In his view, democracy took advantage of voter emotions

and irrationality, left little room for reason, encouraged class war, and favored

“collective mediocrity” rather than the sovereignty of the “highest skill.” The idea of workplace democracy, which appealed to Follett, was anathema to

Mayo, for it would hand over control to people who had no real understand-

ing of business issues. His knowledge of psychological theory encouraged

him in his belief that economics could not grasp the human factor because it

ignored the extent to which feeling and irrationality shaped motives. It also suggested how to deal with confl ict without addressing what were claimed

to be the underlying issues. Radical movements and industrial unrest were

not responses to genuine grievances but more the expression of the “hidden

fi res of mental uncontrol.” If agitators were essentially neurotic, “prone to conspiratorial delusions, with minds obsessed with rage and the savage lust

of destruction,” then democratic processes could do little to help. In fact they made matters worse, dividing society into two hostile camps and leading

workers, unaware of the real sources of their discontent, to pursue “will-o-

the-wisp phantasies with all the energy of his starving intellect and will.”

Mayo’s remedy was to treat not the material conditions of the working class

but the psychopathological tendencies of democracy, refl ected in disoriented

lives, disintegrated personalities, and disordered values. 18

Mayo’s views were well known when the dean of the Harvard Business

School, Wallace Donham, approached him about joining the faculty. Donham

was a banker who had trained at Harvard Law School. After being appointed

in 1919, he stayed until the early 1940s. He saw his task as raising the

academic standards of the school while also improving links with business.

This was essential for fundraising, but Donham also had to contend with

the university’s reputation for harboring radicals and socialists. Funding for Mayo eventually came directly from industry rather than the university. The

attraction of Mayo lay in his underlying views, which Donham shared, and

in his claimed expertise in psychology. The gap to be fi lled was explained

in a letter to the university’s president in 1927: “I see no really promising r i s e o f m a n a g e m e n t c l a s s

469

hope of lessening the critical nature of the Labor Problem in Industry except through a scientifi c study of Industrial Physiology including Psychology.” As O’Connor observed, “Mayo’s research spoke directly to the core of executive

concerns: it revolved around how to calm the worker’s irrational, agitation-

prone mind and how to develop a curriculum to train managers and execu-

tives to do so.” In 1933, Mayo reinforced the point. The problem was not the

lack of an “able administrative elite,” but the elite’s lack of understanding of the “biological and social facts involved in social organization and control.”

Donham saw training this elite as an essential task for the business school. 19

Complementing the effi cient physical engineering of the ordinary worker

by Taylor, Mayo offered a psychological revival. Like Taylor, Mayo also had a story about how he realized this could be done, this time based on a fl ash of inspiration as he pondered the meaning of experiments with a small group

of workers at Western Electric’s Hawthorne plant. The research, which had

begun well before Mayo joined, was designed to see whether changes in phys-

ical conditions, such as better illumination, made much difference to produc-

tivity. In this regard, the most important stage in the experiments involved

a group of six women working on relay assembly. The aim was to ascertain

the impact of rest periods and hours of work. Eventually it was decided to

consider them on a group rather than an individual, so that there was a shared bonus for higher productivity. The researchers found a 30 percent increase of productivity over two and a half years, along with greater work satisfaction.

Explanations of exactly why this had happened were uncertain until, as

Mayo reported, he had his “great éclaircissement” and realized what made the

difference was that the researchers were actually showing interest in them.

His large conclusion was that psychological conditions were more important

than the physical and that workers responded to their own group dynam-

ics and informal social networks. Motivations went beyond self-interest into

seeking recognition and security. The recommendation was that manage-

ment should seek a good working relationship with their staff, and that

happy workers would be more productive. As with Taylor, the original story

was embellished and interpreted within Mayo’s own preconceived notions.

Once again a simple explanation was offered to make sense of a complex set

of facts. In retrospect, the best explanation for the improvements in produc-

tivity was a combination of pay incentives (in a non-unionized plant and

against the background of the depression) and the attitudes of individual

workers. The replacement of two women who had not joined in the spirit of

the experiment by two who did was a turning point. 20]] Mayo’s conclusion was not in itself preposterous. It fi t in with the theories of Follett in encouraging managers to view their workers in more rounded, softer, human terms and

470

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

was widely considered to have encouraged a turn for the better in management practice.

In this way the so-called human relations school was founded, attending

to the informal aspects of the organization and the social conditions of the

workplace. Mayo’s place was assured in the history of industrial sociology,

though were it not for the Hawthorne experiments he would by now be for-

gotten. He had exaggerated his own qualifi cations, including his psychiatric training, and was considered by colleagues to be snobbish, lazy, and uninterested in teaching, with only the occasional publication to his name. As

we have seen, Mayo’s underlying philosophy was deeply conservative, seeing

confl ict as in effect a “social disease” to be remedied by healthy cooperation

across the supposed divides. 21]] By the same token, cooperation among workers for their own ends was unhealthy. Because he saw politics as aggravating

the problem, and was generally reluctant to consider the problem of power,

any solution was the responsibility of the administrative elite, who must be

trained to develop social competence to match their technical competence.

In the Hawthorne Studies, the claimed positive response had been to

inadvertently enlightened researchers rather than truly enlightened man-

agers. In the mid-1930s, Mayo made acquaintance with Chester Barnard,

president of New Jersey Bell, a cerebral man and a voracious reader with hard experience in industry and practical administration. By 1938 he was giving

lectures at Harvard. With some rewriting, these were turned into what is

now considered to be a seminal text on management thought, _The Functions_

_of the Executive_ . Barnard forged an extraordinary bond with the physiologist Lawrence Henderson, a leading fi gure in the university and a colleague of

Mayo’s. This was based on their shared interest in the Italian sociologist and notable elitist Vilfredo Pareto.

Having discovered Pareto in the mid-1920s, Henderson became some-

thing of an evangelist in the 1930s, establishing what became known as the

“Pareto Circle” at Harvard. To Henderson’s scientifi c mind, Pareto’s notions of social equilibrium struck a chord as well as matched his own conservative

inclinations. Although he dominated the circle, with a seminar technique

that was said to be “only feebly imitated by a pile-driver,” the group did

include people such as Talcott Parsons and George Homans among the most

infl uential of their generation of sociologists. 22]] It was also a refuge for conservative academics seeking an alternative to Marx and attracted by the under-

lying treatment of society as an interdependent and largely self-correcting

system. Henderson was impressed by Barnard as a man who not only had

read Pareto originally in French but had sought to apply his ideas in the

real world.

r i s e o f m a n a g e m e n t c l a s s

471

Pareto’s infl uence can certainly be detected in Barnard. This was evident in his stress on nonlogical factors in human decision and action, on how

choice was shaped by the logic of situations, and on the circulation of elites.

Pareto is there in the idea of organizations as social systems analogous to

human bodies seeking some sort of equilibrium. To achieve equilibrium,

the organization needed to achieve both effectiveness and effi ciency, and he emphasized how many declined because they failed both tests. By effi ciency

he meant the ability to satisfy the individuals who made up the organization; effectiveness involved the ability to meet goals. Management must formulate

the organizational goals and decide how to meet them, but it must do so

in a way that kept all members involved, not least through forms of direct

and accessible communications. He emphasized the importance of respect

and cooperation, suggesting—in line with Mayo—that the former was more

important than material incentives and that the latter was put at risk by

divisive ideologies and forms of political action. In both these aspects, the workforce was prone to mistaken notions about their interests and therein lay

the special leadership role of management. 23

In addition to their technical and social skills, managers should work

actively to create a cooperative organization underpinned by appropriate

values. Otherwise the organization would fail. 24]] It was therefore important

“to educate and to propagandize” people to “inculcate” appropriate motives

and perceptions. The executive must not only conform to a moral code but

also create moral codes for others which would be refl ected in high morale.

To this end, “points of view, fundamental attitudes, loyalties to the orga-

nization or cooperative system, and to the system of objective authority”

must be inculcated to encourage the subordination of “individual interest

and the minor dictates of personal codes to the good of the cooperative

whole.” [^25]

Barnard also had a story to illustrate his point. In a popular lecture he

referred to an episode involving a riotous situation at New Jersey in 1935

when he was director of the New Jersey Emergency Relief Administration.

He claimed that he defused the situation by respecting the dignity of the

rioters. 26 According to Barnard’]]s account, a meeting with representatives of Trenton’s unemployed in his offi ce had to be adjourned when some two

thousand unemployed demonstrators, who had been urged on by New York

radicals, clashed with the police in the street outside, leading to a number

being arrested and some taking a beating. Barnard saw that publicity such as

this could harm the cause of the unemployed by increasing taxpayer animos-

ity to the relief program. This was the point he made when the delegation

returned, after he had fi rst carefully listened to a litany of their grievances, 472

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

and a degree of harmony was restored. According to Barnard’s account, picked up enthusiastically by his friends at Harvard, the problem was solved

through human relations rather than by economics. Dignity was important

to the unemployed, even more than food for themselves or their families.

It may well be that Barnard’s sensitivity and tact did make a difference,

but once his account was checked against contemporary reports of the epi-

sode it became evident that this was only part of the story. 27]] There was in fact a strong economic dimension: the unemployed were demanding a substantial

increase in food allowances and Barnard had promised to help. Nonetheless,

Barnard’s argument that more mayhem would put the whole program at risk

was a serious political point. This refl ects the observation made earlier about Follett’s promotion of group dynamics. There are groups within groups, and

Barnard’s strategy in this case was to make common cause with the unem-

ployed in support of the relief program against those who resented the sub-

sidies when their own economic circumstances were so tight. Talking about

groups rather than classes or parties or states did not remove the problem

of confl ict. Unless society could be reshaped as one big amorphous group,

individuals were going to identify with some groups against others, and the

interests of these groups were going to clash. The more inter-group concili-

ation became necessary, the more intra-group harmony was likely to be put

under strain.

The original role of managers was to manage the workforce. Their under-

standing of what this required was shaped by the social theories of the time, many of which encouraged unfl attering views of ordinary people as essentially simple-minded, suggestible, and manipulable. At best, they could be

encouraged to be effi cient cogs in the machine by more pay, tempered by

threats of dismissal. At worst they could be swayed by agitators, drawing

on the psychology of crowds. As the century progressed, the possibilities

of maintaining a docile, regimented workforce receded with the growing

strength of labor unions and the increasingly demanding and specialist

nature of much work. Moreover, while the original inspiration for the human

relations school might have been to draw workers away from socialism and

unions, it encouraged managers to recognize that their organizations were

complex social structures rather than simple hierarchies and that their work-

ers might respond positively to being treated as rounded human beings. The

approach risked replacing autocracy with paternalism as it struggled to work

out what these developing views of organizational life meant in terms of

structures of power. The more these structures had to be addressed, and the

more they had to be related to the wider social and economic changes under-

way, the more managers would need a strategy.

The Business of Business

_The business of business is business._

—Alfred P. Sloan

Before we consider how the next generation of management theo-

rists discovered strategy, we need fi rst to explore the issues of power

being faced by business over this period. The important developments in

theorizing about business strategy after the Second World War refl ected

the forms taken by large industrial corporations in the United States, at

a point when the tensions between capital and labor were subdued if not

eliminated. The origins of these corporations, however, were to be found

in a much more turbulent period in the country’s industrial development,

marked by labor unrest and arguments over the excessive power of the

large trusts.

Against the expectations of Marx, capitalism transformed itself as the

nineteenth century turned into the twentieth. Capitalists found means of

coping with the volatility of the system that produced cycles of growth fol-

lowed by recession. One of the most important coping mechanisms appeared

to be size. Very large companies were capable of surviving sudden changes in

economic conditions. In this effort they were increasingly supported by lay-

ers of management. The process which led to those changes began at about

the same time as Marx was arguing with Bakunin over how to prepare for

revolution and then what to make of the Paris Commune.

_John D. Rockefeller_

The story of John D. Rockefeller and Standard Oil is well known. 1]] In 1865

as an ambitious 26-year-old in Cleveland, Ohio, Rockefeller bought out his

partner in the town’s largest oil refi nery. Taking advantage of the economic expansion that began with the end of the Civil War, he added to his refi neries and the profi ts rolled in. Unfortunately, others had the same idea and soon

refi nery capacity far outstripped demand for kerosene and other oil prod-

ucts. To survive, Rockefeller determined to be the most effi cient producer,

improving quality while keeping costs down and then, more imaginatively,

by integrating the business, controlling both supply and distribution. In

addition, he made sure that he had enough cash so he would not be caught

short by sudden market fl uctuations. He then strengthened his position by

controversial links with the railroads, gaining discounted rates in return for shipping a guaranteed number of carloads a day.

Rockefeller did not accept for one second that it was improper to tamper

with market forces. He was convinced that it was too easy to open a refi n-

ery resulting in an overcrowded industry and a chaotic, chronically unstable

market. Instead of living by the market’s capricious disciplines, Rockefeller decided to exert control. “The oil business was in confusion and daily growing worse.” As each refi ner “struggled hard to get all of the business . . . he brought to himself and the competitors nothing but disasters.” [^2] Supply and demand might never reach equilibrium. Rockefeller’s strategy was one which

in other circumstances would have seemed wholly appropriate: he sought

cooperation as a sensible alternative to a wasteful and disruptive competition.

Given the state of the oil industry, Rockefeller may well have been cor-

rect in his assumption. 3 This was nonetheless a challenge to the prevailing

ideology of free markets. In the case of Rockefeller, the challenge was aggravated by his methods. He normally offered prospective partners reasonable

terms and at times helped his erstwhile competitors out of a desperate posi-

tion. Those who did not wish to combine, however, would often be harried

into submission, their position worsened by means of aggressive price cuts

by Standard Oil. In 1870, when it incorporated, Standard Oil controlled a

tenth of America’s refi ning capacity; by the end of the decade, the fi gure was 90 percent.

When independent companies made a last daring move by building a

long-distance pipeline, even managing to catch Standard Oil by surprise,

there was no real threat to the company’s position. There was time and the

fi nancial muscle to respond. Standard Oil built its own pipelines and soon

controlled the whole network connecting the Pennsylvanian oil regions with

t h e b u s i n e s s o f b u s i n e s s

475

the rest of America. The only exception was the original line, and even here Standard Oil acquired a minority stake. When the remaining independent

refi ners demanded legal remedies to restrain Standard Oil, the court cases

lifted the veil on the sort of techniques the company employed in its drive

to a near monopoly. In 1882, Rockefeller found a way to bring the veil down

again, using a legal device that was normally used for people who could

not look after their own fi nances. The companies in which Rockefeller held

stock came together by means of a secret agreement. The stockholders con-

veyed their shares “in trust” to nine trustees, including John and his brother, William. That meant that, strictly speaking and whatever the appearances,

Standard Oil did not own other companies. It was only the trust, owned by

the company’s stockholders, which could appoint directors and offi cers and

set up administrative offi ces in individual states.

Standard Oil had a virtual monopoly. All that was missing was any actual

production of oil. Potentially that was a great vulnerability, especially if the oil ran out. But by the end of the 1880s, new oil fi elds were being found

around the country and U.S. production was no longer dependent on the

Pennsylvania fi elds. Rockefeller saw the opportunity for further integration and reduced dependency on suppliers. Energetic acquisition began. Soon

Standard Oil was pumping a third of America’s crude oil as well as marketing

84 percent of all petroleum products sold. As both producer and consumer,

Standard Oil could set the prices. Without quite squeezing out all the com-

petition, it was in effective control of the U.S. oil industry and was developing substantial interests overseas. Things also turned out well for Rockefeller on the demand side: kerosene was replaced by electricity as the major source

of illumination, but the arrival of automobiles and gasoline-powered engines

transformed the market again. Gasoline suddenly moved from a minor prod-

uct to the major output of refi neries.

By the turn of the century, Standard Oil had reached the peak of its infl u-

ence. The size of the international market, which already included signifi cant competitors, meant that its relative position was bound to decline. The process was accelerated, however, as a result of the trust’s substantial political liabilities. Rockefeller was blamed for using dubious practices to gain vast

wealth. Grudges were held by the small independent producers who had

been gobbled up, broken, or marginalized during Rockefeller’s inexorable

rise. They could appeal to American values and the image of the virtuous

little man struggling against concentrated, corrupt power and great wealth.

Rockefeller was by no means the only “Robber Baron”—Andrew Carnegie,

Cornelius Vanderbilt, and J. P. Morgan were similarly denounced. Nor was

Standard Oil the only entity using the trust as a way of controlling markets

476

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

and rebuffi ng competition. It was, however, the largest and most notorious.

While Rockefeller believed combination to be a better way of guarantee-

ing effi ciency and stability, the practice tended toward monopoly. The 1890

Sherman Antitrust Act gave the federal government power to investigate and

pursue the trusts. Rockefeller acquired the best lawyers to take on the courts and develop elaborate arrangements to beat legislation. He used donations

to buy political support and plant friendly stories in newspapers. New com-

panies were established, proclaiming their independence, though they were

in practice controlled by the trust. Meanwhile, with remarkable attention to

detail, using superior intelligence and communications, and keeping track of

markets and competitors on an increasingly global scale, Standard Oil kept

its prices down and its hold on the market secure. Through all this it “treated the federal government as a meddlesome, inferior power.” 4]]

In the end, Rockefeller’s nemesis proved to be a writer called Ida Tarbell,

whom we met in the previous chapter as a champion of Frederick Taylor.

As it happened, her father had struggled in the early oil business against

Standard Oil and suffered as a result. This gave an edge to her reporting.

The opportunity came because she was on the staff of _McClure’s Magazine_ , a progressive “muckraking” journal, which had decided to make the trusts its

main target. 5 T]]arbell got a break with an introduction to one of Rockefeller’s lieutenants, who became a key source of information. In 1902, a monthly

serial began which lasted for two years, telling the Standard Oil story in compelling detail, arousing great indignation as it exposed underhanded business methods. Tarbell insisted that she did not object to the company’s size and

wealth but rather its methods. “But they had never played fair, and that

ruined their greatness for me.” 6

The exposure was timely. The antitrust cause had been taken up by the

progressive president, Theodore Roosevelt. He argued that corporate power

had to be brought under control, using legislation where the abuse was great-

est. He launched investigations into Standard Oil, and in 1906 a suit was

brought accusing it of restraint of trade under the Sherman Act. Standard

Oil’s legal defense was strong, but the evidence was damning. After an ini-

tial verdict ordering the trust’s dissolution in 1909, it was confi rmed by the Supreme Court in 1911. The “very genius for commercial development and

organization,” the chief justice concluded, “soon begat an intent and purpose

to exclude others.” 7]] Standard Oil was dismantled, giving birth to thirty-four new entities, including what became Exxon.

At the time it seemed like a defeat, but Roosevelt had done Rockefeller

a favor. It was increasingly beyond the capacity of a single company to con-

trol a developing market of such size and complexity. The ability of smaller

t h e b u s i n e s s o f b u s i n e s s

477

units to respond fl exibly to new conditions eventually made for a stronger and more profi table industry. Rockefeller, now retired, held stock in the new and largely successful companies. He lived until he was almost 100. A great

philanthropic trust bore his name and soon came to affect the way that eco-

nomics and management was studied in the United States. His descendents

continued to have a major infl uence on business and politics. So this story

hardly counts as a tragedy.

Rockefeller was undoubtedly a master strategist. He could take a view of

the system as a whole and assess the position of the individual parts. Yergin describes Rockefeller as “both strategist and supreme commander, directing

his lieutenants to move with stealth and speed and with expert execution.”

He was not averse to military metaphors, for example, justifying his secre-

tive methods by wondering “what general of the Allies ever sends out a brass

band in advance with orders to notify the enemy that on a certain day he will begin an attack.” [^8] Chernow describes him brooding over problems. Plans were “quietly matured plans over extended periods. Once he had made up his

mind, however, he was no longer troubled by doubts and pursued his vision

was undeviating faith.” 9 But because his strategic success was the result of

objectionable methods and in pursuit of retrograde aims, he could hardly be

presented as the model for an aspiring businessman.

_Henry Ford_

By contrast, at least for a time, Henry Ford was presented as an exemplary

and forward-looking businessman. Ford’s vision for the automobile industry

was developed while he tinkered with machinery as a young man on his

father’s farm in Michigan. He wondered about horseless carriages and how

they could take some of the worst drudgery out of rural life. Steam engines

were too big, heavy, and dangerous. Perhaps gas-powered internal combus-

tion engines might be a way forward. In the mid-1880s, he got a chance to

work with one of these engines, understand its principles, and then experi-

ment on his own.

There was at the time no mass market for cars. They were considered

expensive toys for racers, with speed more important than reliability. As good money could be made by selling individual cars to order at high prices, there was no incentive to go for a volume. Ford’s genius was to see how to develop

an affordable car for a mass market, anticipating both a public demand and a

means of production that did not yet exist. He got no support from indepen-

dent investors and banks. This left him with an enduring disdain for those

478

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

who put money ahead of work, feared competition, and were uninterested in consumers. He sought to liberate himself from dependence on creditors

and shareholders. Although when he founded the Ford Motor Company he

did not at fi rst have the controlling share, by 1906 he owned more than half the stock.

He also had to take on a cartel. The Association of Licensed Automobile

Manufacturers (ALAM) used a dubious patent to control the entry into the

industry of new manufacturers. In 1903, they refused entry to Ford. In the

context of the antitrust campaigns of the time, Ford realized that ALAM

could readily be castigated for its greed and the use of specious claims to

exclude proper competition. He was in the opposite position to Rockefeller,

on the side of the people versus the trusts, the underdog, “an industrial

David standing alone against a powerful, monopolistic Goliath.” He was,

he claimed, infused with “that instinct of American freedom to cause us to

rebel against oppression or unfair competition.” It went against the grain to be “coerced, or bluffed, or sandbagged.” 10 In 1909, after a long legal battle,]]

Ford won—to general acclaim.

In the company’s fi rst advert, he explained the wish to “construct and mar-

ket an automobile specially designed for everyday wear and tear,” a machine

to be admired for its “compactness, its simplicity, its safety, its all-around convenience, and—last but not least—its exceedingly reasonable price.” To

get the price down he needed the volume of a mass market, and that required

new forms of assembly. The prevailing model was the bicycle industry, which

offered customers a range of models, a new one coming out each year. To Ford

this was the wrong philosophy, based on the “same idea that women submit

to in their clothing and hats.” He wanted to build to last, like the watches

that had fi rst kindled his fascination with machinery. His view was that price was the key. That meant fewer models and more focus on simplicity and

reliability.

Out of this came the idea of the “universal car,” built with high quality

materials and simple to operate. He settled on a design that became famous

as the Model T and then concentrated on manufacturing this one model in

large numbers. When his salesmen worried about the lack of different mod-

els to appeal to distinctive customers, he remarked that: “Any customer can

have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black.” This car

was not to be a luxury item for a few but one for “the great multitude.” The

assembly line, fi rst introduced in 1913, had tools and men placed in sequence as each component moved along until the car was fi nished. This reduced

“the necessity for thought on the part of the worker and . . . his movements

to a minimum.” When in 1914 Ford started to have diffi culty maintaining

t h e b u s i n e s s o f b u s i n e s s

479

a stable workforce because of the dreary and routine nature of assembly-line work, he announced that his workers would be paid fi ve dollars a day. This he described as one of the “fi nest cost-cutting moves we ever made.”

Ford understood better than any other manufacturer at the time what

might happen if ordinary people were treated as consumers and how their

growing aspirations might be met. He worked single-mindedly to realize

his vision, exploring better materials and methods. At this stage he also had the advantage of no real competition, as the other manufacturers were tardy

in appreciating that Ford represented the future. This was a new and rapidly

expanding market without obvious bounds. Once Ford hit upon his success-

ful formula he was made.

Ford claimed a breakthrough not only in car manufacturing but in the

development of industrial society, offering an alternative course between

socialism and crude capitalism. He had given a decisive impetus to two criti-

cal and related developments: the techniques of mass production which in

turn fed the desires of mass consumption. The fi ve-dollar pay offer bought

stability in the workforce and turned the workers into consumers. He sought

to show how his own ordinariness and simple tastes, his readiness to bridge

the gap between rich and poor, and the civic action programs around his fac-

tory all made him close to ordinary people. This was part marketing, part

genuine. It soon became wrapped up in populist rhetoric, turning Ford into

a special sort of businessman. Not only had he not forgotten his roots but he understood that looking after people was good business, a source of loyalty,

productivity, and customers.

This addressed a wider political agenda. His close associate James

Couzens, as much responsible for the underlying philosophy as Ford, put it

clearly: “The follies of socialism and the terrors of anarchy will fade away in an industrial system that guarantees to every man, rich or poor, a fair fi eld

and a square deal.” 11 An answer had been found to the constant unrest that

had marred the process of industrialization, as workers fought to improve

their wages and conditions. The fi ve-dollars-a-day move enthused many

on the left as it appalled other industrialists who saw expectations created

among their workforces that they could not afford to meet. Progressives saw

a man of wealth who understood his debt to labor. Some socialists argued that it made more sense to look at the practice of Ford rather than the theories of Marx. A cult of personality developed around Ford as one who made good

on his promises and guaranteed service, not only a master car builder but a

mechanical genius and democratic hero.

Inevitably, the political implications of Fordism soon turned out to be

more complex than a historic bringing together of the hitherto opposing

480

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

demands of capital and labor. His approach was intensely paternalistic.

Factories were organized to do everything possible to reduce the scope for

individual initiative, as if a universal worker could be one of the universal parts in a universal machine to produce the universal car. In such an interconnected system, where if some went slow the whole line slowed down, there

was need for discipline and no scope for initiative. “We expect the men,” Ford insisted, “to do what they are told.” He assumed an “unevenness in human

mental equipments” that meant many men were content with tedious work.

A “sociological department” was established at his main plant to ensure that

newly enriched workers did not lose their sobriety or industriousness. Their

private lives were monitored and regulated to an extraordinary extent.

Beyond industrial matters, he campaigned actively against war. He toyed

with politics and was touted as presidential material in 1916, until he even-

tually threw his considerable weight behind Woodrow Wilson. In 1918, he

ran to become a senator for Michigan. He refused to actually campaign but

still only lost by a narrow margin. His loss was largely due to his past paci-fi sm and anti-militarism now that the country was at war. Over time, his

attitudes began to appear idiosyncratic and, in the case of his virulent anti-Semitism, downright dangerous.

Ford was an autocrat, encouraging sycophancy and unable to grasp the

major changes in the social and political context in which he was operating.

When he was riding high he used his dominance to prevent any interference

in the development of company policy, whether from partners, stockholders,

or independent-minded managers. He sought personal control and oversight

over what had become a massive company, with hundreds of thousands of

employees and sales in the millions, yet ran it “as if it were a mom and pop

shop.” [^12]

The company reached its peak in 1923, when it produced two million

cars as well as many tractors and trucks. But by then competition was devel-

oping from General Motors and Chrysler. While Ford stuck with the Model

T, the others set the pace with a greater range of new cars. By 1926, Ford’s

production barely reached 1.5 million vehicles. The competitors also offered

new forms of payment, accepting credit and installments. With his horror

of debt, Ford was unwilling to offer similar terms. Convinced that price was

all that mattered, he put pressure on his workforce to increase productiv-

ity and on his dealers to accept the risk of unsold cars. His reputation as an enlightened man of the people became tarnished. He did not even appreciate

how consumers, whose aspirations he had championed, were becoming more

demanding about products, fi ckle in their tastes, interested in style, and self-indulgent in their spending. He assumed that low prices would continue to

t h e b u s i n e s s o f b u s i n e s s

481

persuade customers to forego the novelties and gadgets offered by his competitors. He even fought with his son Edsel, who argued the case for mod-

ernization of both products and practices. Henry considered Edsel to be weak

and prone to panic. It was only as evidence of falling sales became impossible to ignore that he accepted the need for a replacement for the Model T. By the time the production run ended in 1927, some fi fteen million had been sold.

The price had come down from $825 in 1908 to $290.

By 1933, with the Great Depression taking hold, Ford was selling only

325,000 cars, less than Chrysler’s 400,000 and half of the 650,000 produced

by General Motors. Now an elderly man, Ford appeared distracted. Moreover,

with the arrival of the Roosevelt administration and the New Deal, the days

of a lax and benevolent attitude of government to big business were over. The accent was now on reform and regulation, including support for labor unions.

Ford became a bitter opponent of the New Deal. He saw it as promoting col-

lectivism, sapping energy and enterprise from the economy, and motivated

by an urge to redistribute wealth rather than support its creation.

Ford had long been hostile to the unions, along with the notions of class

antagonism they supposedly fostered. Their aim, he believed, was to claim

for themselves the benefi ts of mass production rather than pass them on to

the consumer. They were in the same parasitical category as fi nanciers. Ford paid good wages in the early 1920s, but as the company struggled in the

1930s, the demands on workers had become excessive. In 1925, 160 men

produced 3,000 units; by 1931, the same number were expected to produce

7,697 units. The productivity was maintained through worsening conditions

policed by a security force, often likened to mafi a enforcers. Workers could be dismissed for minor infractions.

Ford was prepared to use physical force to keep the unions out. This

became apparent in March 1932 when there was a battle between some 2,500

unemployed workers, urged on by communist activists, and the police. The

skirmish involved stones on one side and tear gas and water hoses—and

eventually guns—on the other. It ended with four men dead. For a while

the intimidation worked, helped also by the divisions within the union

movement. By May 1937, unionism had received a political boost through

President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal and the 1935 Wagner Act, which

tilted the law more in favor of the unions. After a wave of sit-down strikes, General Motors and Chrysler had both given in to demands to allow the

United Auto Workers sole rights to represent their workers. When union

leaders tried to do the same with Ford, they were set upon and beaten up

by security men. The result was more dire publicity for the company. And

although Ford continued to resist, his position became more isolated. When

482

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

the state ordered a poll of workers it turned out that 70 percent favored unionization. Ford’s subordinates wanted to accept the result. Ford appeared

ready to resist whatever the consequences until his wife, fearing bloodshed,

persuaded him to relent.

Though a great innovator, Ford was a terrible strategist. He was absolutely

sure in his own views and put himself beyond challenge in the running of his

company. So long as others agreed then all was fi ne, but he expected business to be undertaken on his terms and showed no fl exibility when he faced resistance, whether from his own executives, workers, the government, or even

consumers. He saw no need for advice from anybody else. “When you have

to solve a problem that nobody has yet thought about, how can you learn the

solution from a book?” 13 In his memoir]], _My Life and Work_ , he was contemptuous of “experts,” associating them with a state of mind where everything

was already known and therefore new methods were deemed impossible. “If

ever I wanted to kill opposition by unfair means I would endow the opposi-

tion with experts.” There was an obvious connection with Taylor, with whom

Ford was often twinned. Ford’s own ideas were infused with the same spirit

of rationalizing the labor system, and the dangers of a thinking workforce. It is unlikely he had read Taylor. He reached his conclusions through his own

experience, and much of his push for higher productivity came from innova-

tions in techniques and materials. Nonetheless, many of those around Ford

were well aware of Taylor’s approach and considered that they were working

in the same spirit. Certainly Ford’s success could be taken as further validation of the approach. Both “Taylorism” and “Fordism” became bywords for

advanced manufacturing methods.

His early paternalism might have been embraced by the human relations

school, who would have endorsed his determination to transcend the capital-

labor divide, but his treatment of his workforce became increasingly harsh

and suspicious, and the result was the surge of industrial unrest which con-

cluded when he had to give ground to the unions. The administration of

Franklin Roosevelt gave no support to those who thought that labor unions

represented outdated thinking based on confl ict. By the 1930s, almost sub-

merged by competition and defeated by the unions, Ford was also a poor

model for the aspiring business strategist.

_Alfred P. Sloan_

The man who came to fi t this bill was Alfred P. Sloan, the presiding genius

of General Motors for some thirty-six years, fi rst in charge of operations, then t h e b u s i n e s s o f b u s i n e s s

483

president, chief executive, and eventually chairman, until he retired in 1956.

The company, also based in Michigan, was founded in 1908 by William

C. Durant. While Ford was aiming for his universal car, General Motors grew

through the acquisition of small companies until it got into so much debt

that it was taken over by a bankers’ trust and Durant lost control. Sloan, who had studied electrical engineering at MIT and then become president of a

subordinate company, was put in charge of operations at General Motors in

1920. He became president in 1923, when the industry faced a slump. From

the start he set about transforming the company’s structures and products in

ways that were widely copied in corporate America.

Sloan’s position was different from Ford’s in three key respects. First,

and most obviously, Ford led the pack. Second, Sloan had a range of cars

to sell, produced by the companies that had been brought together under

the General Motors umbrella, rather than just one “universal car.” Third,

Sloan had to take account of his major stockholders, the DuPont family. It

was the DuPonts, alarmed at the reckless way the company was being run,

that bought Durant out. At fi rst Sloan was reporting to Pierre DuPont, who

was chairman and chief executive. This meant that, unlike Ford, Sloan had

to have an internal strategy as well as one to deal with the competition. He

had to debate company policy with colleagues and take care of a range of

distinctive and possibly confl icting interests. For example, DuPont backed

a bold scheme to challenge Ford by developing a new type of copper-cooled

engine. If the scheme failed, as Sloan suspected it might, the result would be disastrous. Sloan was careful not to fi ght the project: he just made sure that there was a fallback position based on a safer, water-cooled engine, if it failed, which it did.

Over the 1920–1921 period, Sloan came up with two related sets of ideas

that reshaped the modern corporation as well as the automobile industry.

The fi rst was a set of proposals about getting the best out of General Motors’

complex structure while still providing a central lead. His plans were set out in a 1920 document known as the “organization study,” later described as

having a “canonic quality” and as a “touchstone for management theory and

practice.” 14]] Sloan presented this study as a result of his scientifi c approach, as a man “who followed the factual approach to business judgment.” He drew

solely on his own business experience. He had not been in the military and

was not a book reader. Had he been, he noted, “I would not have found much

in that line in those days to help.” The plan was adopted because it met the

needs of a board that “desired a highly rational and objective mode of opera-

tion.” It depended on two propositions that apparently contradicted each

other. The fi rst was that the company should be split up into divisions, each 484

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

with its own chief executive with a responsibility for its operation that “shall in no way be limited.” The second proposition was that certain “central organization functions are absolutely essential” to the Corporation’s development and control. Sloan saw the contradiction between the two as “the crux of the

matter.” [^15] One was about the ability to get on with the business without constant interference from the center; the second was about doing so within

clear fi nancial and policy guidelines. The intellectual breakthrough was to

recognize that there was a tension and that this presented the core challenge for management. It introduced what Sloan’s biographer described as “a new

kind of corporate music, a symphony of controlled, decentralized production,

operation, and administration in which there is a reward for the virtuoso performer and regard for the conductor.” 16]]

The key question of strategy was what to do about Ford, which at the start

of the decade accounted for some 60 percent of all cars sold in the United

States. Against the legendary Model T, General Motors had ten models pro-

duced by a number of divisions, some at the luxury end of the market and

others more basic. In principle, the product range catered to all sections of the market, but in practice the company’s cars were competing against each

other in some areas. As things turned out, Ford was the ideal adversary, com-

placent and stubborn. But even if Sloan suspected this he could not rely upon Ford failing to respond to the challenge he intended to pose. His script for

General Motors dared not assume complete stupidity on Ford’s part. Sloan

could, however, assume that he had some time. Ford was under no pressure

in 1921 to abandon the Model T when it had served him so handsomely.

Moreover, Ford’s eventual likely response was also predictable, as he had the fi nancial clout to push the price of the Model T lower to see off any direct competition.

Through the summer of 1921, Sloan headed a task force charged to

address this conundrum. According to Sloan:

We said fi rst that the corporation should produce a line of cars in each

price area, from the lowest price up to one for a strictly high grade,

quantity production car, but we should not get into the fancy price

fi eld with small production; second that the price steps should not be

such as to leave wide gaps in the line, and yet should be great enough

to keep their number within reason, so that the greatest advantage of

quantity production could be secured; and third that there should be

no duplication by the corporation in the price fi eld or steps. 17]]

The genius of this formulation was that these classes did not refl ect any

existing market reality. They represented a new way of thinking about the

t h e b u s i n e s s o f b u s i n e s s

485

market, about how customers might respond to variations in price and quality. If Sloan was right, then the market could be shaped to suit the company

as it rationalized and marketed its range, under the slogan a car “for every

purse and purpose.” He was not so much relating to the external environ-

ment; he was completely reshaping it.

The test of the approach would be at the lower end of the market where

a revamped Chevrolet, then with barely 4 percent of the market, would be

pitched against the mighty Model T. Sloan saw this competition taking place

within the price category of $450–$600. Ford took pride in the position of

the Model T at the bottom end of this price range. Sloan judged it “suicidal”

to compete with Ford head on. “The strategy we devised,” he later explained,

“was to take a bite from the top of his position, conceived as a price class, and in this way build up Chevrolet volume on a profi table basis.” 18]] This meant aiming for higher quality in order to justify a higher price. The intention was to get sales from those prepared to pay a bit more, but also to pick up sales from those looking at the next class up who might prefer to pay a bit less.

Ford was left the low-class slot in the knowledge that he would be inclined

to stick with his existing strategy and ignore the insurgency. Once Chevrolet was profi table it would have a secure basis from which to mount further and

progressively more damaging inroads into Ford’s space.

What were Ford’s options? Essentially, he needed to prevent Chevrolet

from reaching profi tability. But in the short term all he could do was respond by further lowering the price of the Model T, perhaps hoping that the slump

in car sales that marked the start of the decade would continue, and then

counterattack with a new model designed to challenge the Chevrolet’s supe-

rior design features directly. But as Ford relied on one model, it would take time to develop a new car (although he could have bought another manufacturer to provide a ready-made product). Any new car would also potentially

take volume from the Model T. The market picked up, Ford’s sales soared,

and so he had no immediate incentive to deal with the Chevrolet threat. But

while Ford had no price class below the one he was presently occupying from

which to draw new consumers, Chevrolet could make the higher range its

own and draw customers from the class above as well as from Ford. When

its sales grew, there was no need for Chevrolet to match Ford’s price cuts. As Sloan observed, “The old master had failed to master change.” Ford had not

understood “how completely his market had changed from the one in which

had made his name and to which he was accustomed.” 19]] Within six years, General Motors led the market, selling 1.8 million vehicles in 1927.

In one respect Sloan was of the same mind as Ford. He deeply objected

to the Roosevelt administration’s readiness to interfere with business and

486

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

campaigned vigorously against the president. This included sponsoring the virulently anti-New Deal Liberty League and campaigning for Roosevelt’s

defeat in the 1936 election. In the end, as a result of the backlash against

Roosevelt followed by the war, the two came to terms. In the short term, it

created extra challenges for the company. The most important was the rela-

tionship with the unions. Unlike Ford, Sloan never claimed to have answers to all the problems of industrial society and showed little interest in shop fl oor conditions. His attitude to unions was that they represented an alternative

source of authority for the workers on matters of pay, rules, and conditions

which the company could well do without. Instead of trying to create a larger and therefore more profi table cake from which all could benefi t, the unions just wanted to carve the existing cake, whatever the damage to profi tability.

To prevent the workforce being unionized, the company hired spies to

inform on any subversive activities. Anybody attempting to organize on

the shop fl oor could be fi red and those taking an interest warned off. The

knowledge that spies were around also served to create uncertainty and sus-

picion among the workers and made them harder to organize. This went on

despite the passage of laws designed to protect organizers from harassment.

By the summer of 1936, only about fi fteen hundred of the company’s forty-

two thousand strong workforce belonged to the United Autoworkers Union.

Once Roosevelt had been reelected in November 1936, and with Michigan’s

governor sympathetic, the situation changed abruptly and dramatically.

Under the miners’ leader, John Lewis, the newly formed umbrella organiza-

tion, the Congress for Industrial Organization (CIO), decided to target the

automobile industry. Local militants also decided that this was an opportune

moment to attack the company. As General Motors struggled to get out of

the recession, the workers complained that they were being asked to work

harder for less. Jobs had been cut while productivity targets remained the

same. Managers relied on the fear of unemployment to discipline workers

and keep wages down. All this erupted in November 1936, resulting in one

of the most consequential strikes of the decade, critical to the future course of unions in the United States and also to the automobile industry.

By December, sit-down strikes had spread to a number of plants includ-

ing the crucial Fisher body plant at Flint. To Sloan, this represented a direct challenge. “The real issue,” he told his workers, was “will a labor organization run the plants of General Motors Corporation or will the management

continue to do so?” 20 This all confi]] rmed his fears about the New Deal, as good economic order was being sacrifi ced to misguided, collectivist notions.

Now workers were engaged in an illegal occupation of company property

and should be removed. But how? Under the law, force could be used but

t h e b u s i n e s s o f b u s i n e s s

487

what if there was resistance? Was the company prepared to sanction serious violence? Moreover, it was apparent that at the state and federal level, the

pressure was to fi nd a negotiated way out of the situation. Though Roosevelt could not condone the workers’ actions, there was no doubt where his private

sympathies lay. Sloan had not exactly gone out of his way to curry favor with the President.

For the unions, the vital thing was to maintain their position. So long

as they stopped the plants operating properly General Motors was hurting.

This required not only repelling anybody trying to expel them by force but

also ensuring that they had heat and food. In practice, the plants were often occupied by very few men, because the union initially did not have many

members to call on and also had to make supplies last. In one of the key

plants which employed around seven thousand workers, there were at times

no more than ninety in occupation, not all of which were General Motors

employees. So in January, when the company fi rst tried to turn the heat off

and prevent food being delivered, the “sit-downers” took the offensive to

capture the plant gates so they could ensure the supplies kept coming. The

crisis escalated as the men fought back against the police’s gas canisters with stones and fi re hoses. The next round involved guns leading to injuries but

not deaths. The union added to the pressure by going after Chevrolet produc-

tion. A decoy sit-down was staged in a secondary plant diverting the atten-

tion of the company police, making it possible to seize a far more important

plant where the engines were made. 21

The company obtained an injunction confi rming the illegality of the tres-

pass, but the strikers refused to leave. Attempts were made to get nego-

tiations going, but the company baulked at the union’s key demand of sole

collective bargaining rights for the United Auto Workers (UAW). Sloan

claimed to be prepared to consider this but only after the sit-ins had ended.

Lewis had no intention of losing his leverage or agreeing to a compromise.

Before the strike, General Motors had been producing some 50,000 vehicles

per month; by February, this was down to only 125. Politically, Sloan was

becoming isolated, the Roosevelt administration was accusing him of going

back on his word, and commentators were describing him as out of touch

with the times.

The responsibility for the use of force to dislodge the strikers lay with new Michigan governor Richard Murphy. He took the lead in trying to broker a

dispute. He was conscious that he had to uphold the law yet was horrifi ed

about the possibility of violence and major loss of life and then going down

in history as “Bloody Murphy.” If he needed to step up the pressure on the

union he was more likely to tighten the cordon already ordered when the

488

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

Chevrolet engine plant was seized than to order in the National Guard to evacuate the buildings. Such a strategy would require patience, easier for him than for General Motors, which was losing serious money. Even the company

was wary about possible violence. They could see how they would be blamed

for substantial loss of life when a conciliatory move on union recognition

might have brought the dispute to a close.

Toward the end of the confrontation, Murphy issued a formal warning

to Lewis about how the law must be enforced. This was followed by some

grandstanding by Lewis, who told the governor that he would go into the

plants and prepare to be shot with the others. In language that captured

exactly Engels’s hopes for such a standoff, when there was no doubt about

the superior physical force of the authorities but real doubt about whether

it could be used, Lewis taunted Murphy. Without a settlement he was not

going to withdraw the strikers. “What are you going to do?” he asked.

You can get them out in just one way, by bayonets. You have the

bayonets. What kind do you prefer to use—the broad double blade or

the four-sided French style? I believe the square style makes a bigger

hole and you can turn it around inside a man. What kind of bayonets,

Governor Murphy, are you going to turn around inside our boys?

In fact, by this time a settlement was close. It was negotiated by one of

Sloan’s lieutenants who agreed to direct talks with Lewis, using the request

of the president to sort out the confl ict as an excuse for going back on the company’s previous position. On February 11, 1937, General Motors signed

an agreement ending the sit-down strikes. UAW got exclusive collective bar-

gaining and had four hundred thousand members by October.

The administration was not yet fi nished with the company. In 1938,

the Department of Justice secured an antitrust criminal indictment against

General Motors, as well as against Ford and Chrysler. The charge, which

did not stick, was that the manufacturers had illegally restrained trade by

requiring their respective dealers to only use the company-associated fi nance company. Unlike Chrysler and Ford, Sloan decided to fi ght, not only because

he considered this to be unwarranted interference in business matters, but

because he sensed a larger vulnerability—the company was moving toward

a 50 percent share in the car market. “Our bogie,” he observed in late 1938,

“is 45 per cent of each price class . . . We don’t want any more than that.”

This meant that—against all corporate instincts—he had to keep market

share down.

One of the New Deal fi gures with whom Sloan was tangling was Adolf

Berle, who had been a professor at Columbia Law School but was also a key

t h e b u s i n e s s o f b u s i n e s s

489

member of Roosevelt’s Brain Trust before the 1932 election and a regular adviser to him in government. In 1932, he published a landmark book with

Gardiner Means, entitled _The Modern Corporation and Private Property_ , demonstrating the divergence between the ownership and control of large cor-

porations, with the result that the management conducted affairs with little

shareholder scrutiny. They also showed how the means of production in the

United States had become concentrated in some two hundred large corpora-

tions, of which General Motors was a prominent example. Economic power

was being concentrated in the hands of a few people who controlled these

giant corporations. This was power that could “harm or benefi t a multitude

of individuals, affect whole districts, shift the currents of trade, bring ruin to one community and prosperity to another.” With a social role far beyond anything implied by the term “private enterprise,” this was an economic power

that could compete on its own terms with the political power of the state.

A new form of struggle was developing: “The state seeks in some aspects

to regulate the corporation, while the corporation, steadily becoming more

powerful, makes every effort to avoid such regulation.” 22

In the run-up to the Second World War, the sure touch which Sloan had

showed in his handling of the competition with Ford and the internal struc-

ture of General Motors had deserted him when dealing with the government

and the unions. In key respects, these were the big strategic issues facing

large corporations during the 1930s and there was no reason to suppose that

they would subside in the future. It was, however, the areas in which Sloan

had been successful, rather than those in which he had failed, that led him

and his company to provide the vital raw material for the next generation of

management theorists.

Management Strategy

_Most of what we call management consists of making it diffi cult for_

_people to get their work done._

—Peter Drucker

Disaffected Marxists became an important source of management

theory as they updated their concepts of class struggle to take account

both of their distress at Soviet totalitarianism and new developments in

industrial society. The previous section mentioned Burnham’s _The Managerial_ _Revolution_ , regularly cited because of its title rather than its content, as the neatest description of how emerging structures of power were confound-ing the expectations of communists and free-marketeers alike. A surprising

number of former Trotskyists, including Herbert Solow and John McDonald,

joined the business-oriented _Fortune Magazine_ . McDonald retained a fascination with confl ict and strategy. We have already met him as an important

writer on game theory. 1 Another member of the]] _Fortune_ editorial team was William Whyte, author of the _Organization Man_ , refl ecting the magazine’s critical edge at this time. Yet another was liberal economist John Kenneth

Galbraith, who observed that the magazine’s right-wing owner, Henry Luce,

had discovered that “with rare exception, good writers on business were

either liberals or socialists.” 2

Galbraith also became associated with the thesis that power in society now rested with the management class. This challenged neoclassical economics (which assumed highly competitive markets) as much as socialism.

Instead of individual fi rms being small in relation to the total market, and therefore limited in their individual infl uence, in the most important sectors a few fi rms enjoyed commanding positions. Instead of being caught between

the confl icting interests of owners and customers, the managers had been able to restructure the relationships so that, if anything, owners and customers

found themselves geared to managerial interests. They also had discovered

ways of preventing potential competitors from mounting effective challenges

and of bargaining on almost equal terms with the state. Business success and

failure depended less on market conditions and more on the organizational

capacity of the large corporations. Arthur Chandler captured the claim neatly when he wrote of the role of management as the “visible hand” as a contrast with Adam Smith’s “invisible hand.” 3 There was perhaps also another]]

thought, which had been around since Plato, that there was something to be

said for bright, educated people running things.

The most mature formulation of the thesis came in 1967 with Galbraith’s

_The New Industrial State_ , at almost the last point when it could carry conviction. He had been infl uenced by Berle and Means and, as acknowledged in

later editions of the book, Burnham. Galbraith reported on the declining

infl uence of stockholders and the growing infl uence of the experts in development, production, and management—which he labeled the “technostruc-

ture.” Power no longer resided with “anonymous shareholders or in a board

of directors that is now largely subservient to senior management.” It resided with “the association of men of diverse technical knowledge, experience or

other talent which modern industrial technology and planning require. It

extends from the leadership of the modern industrial enterprise down to just

short of the labor force and embraces a large number of people and a large

variety of talent.” Yet only a small segment of this new class actually wielded power at the commanding heights of organizations. In doing so they might

refl ect broader interests and attitudes, but their basic responsibility was to the interests of the organization upon which they depended for their livelihood. The key texts were not always clear on this point. Galbraith’s tech-

nostructure covered a large number of people. Burnham seemed to point

to chief executives, but his analysis risked tautology as managers became

defi ned essentially as those who wielded power.

In this scheme, planning played a decisive role. It was the means to over-

come the laws of supply and demand. Despite suffering through associa-

tion with Soviet economic organization, the necessity for a forward look and

492

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

preparation for coming problems and opportunities was accepted by Western governments and companies. Only by planning could priorities be set and

functions coordinated. Size and planning were now essential to ensure con-

tinual technological advances. “It is a feature of all planning that, unlike

the market, it incorporates within itself no mechanism by which demand is

accommodated to supply and vice versa. This must be deliberately accom-

plished by human agency.” 4]] This was a time of fear of unconstrained market forces and optimism about the rational exercise of control over human affairs, informed by the miserable experience of the 1930s.

One of the fi rst academics to explore what it meant to manage a modern

corporation was Peter Drucker. His background was cosmopolitan. Born in

Austria, he arrived in the United States in 1937, via England, to get away

from the Nazis. A 1942 book on _The Future of Industrial Man_ , which inclined to managerialism, was noticed by General Motors, and Drucker was invited

to undertake what was described as a “political audit” of the company. He

Business as War

_Managers have always fancied themselves in the offi cer class. Strategy is_ _what separates them from the sergeants._

—John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge

As had happened with the military, the reaction against the business

planning models of the 1950s and 1960s led to attempts to rediscover

the essence of strategy as practiced. Just as the experiences of Vietnam and

a sense of developing Soviet strength encouraged defense reformers in the

United States to return to the classics of military thought and insist on

addressing the harsh realities of war and battle, a harsher competitive envi-

ronment also encouraged businesses to think more in terms of victory and

defeat, and the need to infuse their strategies with the mental toughness

and passion required in battle. Chief executives might imagine themselves

as generals, leading their troops into battle, with an appropriate blend of

cunning, charisma, and calculation. The resemblances between intense cor-

porate tussles and war were a regular theme in management books, and the

language of campaigns, attacks, and maneuvers could seem quite natural.

At the popular end of this tendency were the regular suggestions that

lessons for the boardroom could be drawn from the battlefi eld exploits of

such fi gures as Alexander the Great or Napoleon. Military fi gures, even some with mixed reputations, were turned into business models from which relevant leadership tips might be taken. In addition to the obvious candidates

(Alexander, Caesar, Napoleon), Albert Madansky has identifi ed books drawing on the strategic wisdom of Attila the Hun, Sitting Bull, Robert E. Lee,

Ulysses S. Grant, and George Patton. [^1] The bestselling _Leadership Secrets of_ _Attila the Hun_ by Wess Roberts, for example, while not quite offering Attila as a role model hailed him as an exemplar of leadership, for he “accomplished diffi cult tasks and performed challenging feats against ‘seemingly’ insurmountable odds.” This implied for Attila and his Huns “a slightly more posi-

tive image than can perhaps be found elsewhere.” Great chieftains adapted

rather than compromised, dealt with adversity, learned from mistakes, did

not ask questions for which they did not want to hear answers, only engaged

in wars they could win, preferred victory to stalemate, and they had tried

their best even if they lost. And so on. There was only a vague hint of the

sinister when reference was made to the importance of loyalty and how it

might be enforced. In general, the chieftains emerged as enlightened and

inspirational leaders—taking seriously their responsibility for the welfare of Huns, explaining to them what they were doing and why. 2]]

When examples were picked selectively, and carefully extracted out of their

context, historical events and fi gures could be used to illustrate a variety of business theories. In such books strategy became collections of aphorisms and analogies, often contradictory, trite, and at most pithy restatements of best practice—exactly what the social scientists with their careful methodologies sought to avoid. They were unlikely to lead to much behavioral change among

their readership or affect corporate performance and plans. In the back of one such book, for example, there was a list of maxims and quotes. What was

the business manager supposed to make of “War is cruelty and you cannot

refi ne it” (General W. T. Sherman), or “Shoot them in the belly and cut out

their living guts” (General George C. Patton), or “War, by defi nition, means a suspension of rules, laws and civilized behavior” (General Robert E. Lee)? This author dismissed “smiley-face, win-win, love-thine-enemy kinds of business

thinking.” Business, he insisted, “like war, is basically a zero-sum adversarial game with economic and professional stakes of the highest order.” 3]] Similarly Douglas Ramsey described modern business as a “brutal battlefi eld,” sharing

the goal of “victory.” His aim was to show how some of the key principles of

warfare, such as clarity of objective, unity of command, economy of force, and concentration of strength could be as relevant for chief executives as for generals. He did note that when it came to their strategic decisions, few business leaders drew on wartime analogies. There was, however, a clear inference that

they might be better off if they did so. 4

The infl uence of most books in this genre was limited, more of an enjoy-

able read than a manual to be kept at hand. There were occasions when

506

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

business rivalry took on the appearance of a fi ght to the fi nish, but as often as not the competition was continuous, ebbing and fl owing, with many participants. Moments of decisive victory would be few and far between. In fact, the elements of military experience, captured by the concept of “friction” or by examples of stunning incompetence, warned about how campaign plans

could go very wrong. In a declining or stagnant market, where the spoils

would go to the last fi rm left standing, a fi ght to the fi nish employing ruthless strategies might be encouraged. But in growing markets competition

might be less intense, and in those marked by complexity there were oppor-

tunities for cooperation and even collusion as well as confl ict. The military metaphor, if taken too seriously, could lead to inappropriate and unethical

behavior. An enthusiasm for a fi ght and a reputational fear of losing might

lead to “price wars” or “takeover battles” being pursued well beyond the

point of possible gain and possibly into substantial losses. As with all metaphors, warfare could be illuminating for business so long as it was not mis-

taken for the real thing. [^5]

Yet some of the standard tropes of military strategy could appear perti-

nent. As early as the 1960s, in his more conceptual musings about strategy,

Bruce Henderson of the Boston Consulting Group 6 drew explicitly on Liddell

Hart, emphasizing concentrating strength against a competitor’s weaknesses.

He sensed the drama of competition, which was lost when it was presented as

“some kind of impersonal, objective, colorless affair,” and discussed the trickery that might be employed to divert competitors. Strategy would be about

exploiting differences in management style, as well as matters such as “over-

head rate, distribution channels, market image, or fl exibility.” He noted how competitors might become friends when a system needed stabilizing. The

fundamental strategic rule was: “Induce your competitors not to invest in

those products, markets, and services where you expect to invest the most.” 7

In a seminal 1981 article, Kotler and Singh argued that the need of

businesses “to develop competitor-centered strategies to win market share

will lead managers to turn increasingly to the subject of military science.” 8

_Marketing Warfare_ , published by Al Ries and Jack Trout in 1986, 9]] used Clausewitz for inspiration. Marketing strategy was distinct from military

strategy because at stake was the mind of the consumer rather than territory

(although few military strategists doubted the importance of psychology).

Just like the strongest armies, the strongest companies should be able to use their power to stay on top. A company dominating the market had more

resources to devote to keep prices down and develop products. Therefore, to

have a chance, small companies, like weaker armies, must employ guile and

not brute force. Better people, products, or even productivity would not be

b u s i n e s s a s w a r

507

enough. A well-entrenched defensive position could only be overwhelmed by a much larger force. Nor, following Clausewitz, was surprise likely to compensate for weaker numbers.

Ries and Trout offered four strategies for a marketing war—defensive,

offensive, fl anking, and guerrilla—with market share determining which

was appropriate. Those with the greatest share were interested in market

domination, while those with the smallest could concentrate on survival. In

the face of a serious challenge the strongest had to respond: if they failed to do so they would progressively lose market share until their dominant position was threatened. The second in the market could mount an offensive to

gain some market share from number one, but this would best be done on a

narrow front against a critical weakness in the leader’s position. The weakness must be chosen carefully: if it was simply high prices, for example, a fi rm

with suffi cient resources would be able to respond by cutting prices. If an

offense was too risky, a fl anking attack could be mounted with a clearly differentiated product. The risks here involved unfamiliar territory and insuf-

fi cient signaling to competitors. Small fi rms were best advised to adopt a

guerrilla strategy, in a market segment all of their own, avoiding any serious competition with larger fi rms and staying nimble, ready to move in and out

of an area as circumstances changed. Approaching the enemy indirectly à la

Liddell Hart, and then attacking in strength at the enemy’s weakest point,

à la Clausewitz, were the key principles imported from military theory. The

core advice was to avoid a frontal assault against well-established positions.

During the 1980s, there was a shift toward Sun Tzu. [^10] Sun Tzu’s infl uence was attested to by two references in popular culture. In the movie _Wall_ _Street_ , the villainous Gordon Gekko advises Bud Fox: “I don’t throw darts at a board. I bet on sure things. Read Sun Tzu, THE ART OF WAR. Every

battle is won before it is ever fought.” Fox later used Sun Tzu to prevail

over Gekko: “If your enemy is superior, evade him. If angry, irritate him.

If equally matched, fi ght, and if not, split and re-evaluate.” _Wall Street_ was a morality tale involving junior stockbroker Bud Fox caught between his

blue-collar father, a foreman and trade unionist who represented the virtues

of hard and honest labor, and the ruthless, cynical Gordon Gekko, a corporate raider whose motto was “greed is good.” Bud became wealthy by following

Gekko’s methods until he realized that a plan to buy the airline where his

father worked was all about asset-stripping. The movie appeared in 1987, the

year of a Wall Street crash, and seemed to capture the fi nancial mindset that had created both fi nancial mayhem and a loss of moral bearings.

Another villain, Tony Soprano, the eponymous mob boss in _The Sopranos_ , was told, somewhat sarcastically, by his psychiatrist Dr. Malfi : “You want to 508

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

be a better mob boss, read _The Art of War._ ” [^11] Later Soprano reported back to her: “Been reading that—that book you told me about. You know, The Art of

War by Sun Tzu. I mean here’s this guy, a Chinese general, wrote this thing

2400 years ago, and most of it still applies today! Balk the enemy’s power.

Force him to reveal himself.” Soprano clearly felt that his introduction to Sun Tzu had given him a competitive advantage; “Most of the guys that I know,

they read Prince Machiavelli.” Soprano claims to have found Machiavelli,

whom he read in a study guide, no more than “okay.” Sun Tzu, however, “is

much better about strategy.” 12 As a result of T]]ony Soprano’s endorsement, Sun Tzu became Amazon’s bestseller in New Jersey.

Sun Tzu’s discovery by business strategists generated a whole library

offering insights from the master. Mark McNeilly in _Sun Tzu and the Art of_ _Business_ promised explanations of “how to gain market share without inciting competitive retaliation, how to attack a competitor’s weak points, and how

to maximize the power of market information for competitive advantage.” 13

The value of Sun Tzu was seen to spread wider. One book suggested that

careful study of _The Art of War_ would help “preserve your marriage vows, and attain the marital bliss that you and your partner deserve to help with mar-

riage.” 14]] Following _The Art of War_ elevated the strategist. Instead of encouraging managers to be mini-Napoleons, it urged them to use their wit and

outthink their opponents. It was also far less dependent on the Clausewitzian

“business-is-battle” metaphor.

Sun Tzu and Liddell Hart appealed to business strategists for the same

reason they appealed to military strategists. They required intelligence,

imagination, and nerve. There was no skill in outspending a weak opponent,

other than possibly getting round anticompetitive regulation. The real skill

was in creating new products and developing new services—even new mar-

kets that the most likely competitors had missed. Sun Tzu added a degree of

moral complexity, illustrated by his supposed attraction to the fi ctional rogue trader who used insider information to get rich, and the gangster who got

rich through extortion and intimidation. As with the tricksters of classical

times, this could prompt admiration about their cunning but a deep unease

about how this was used to better those who led more virtuous lives. The

ability to deceive and outwit an external foe might be celebrated, but there

was still something inappropriate about using these tactics at home to gain

an unfair advantage.

Another reason for the fascination with Sun Tzu was that it might provide

a clue to Asian thinking. Japan, the country defeated so decisively in the

Pacifi c War, had gained a remorseless competitive advantage by adopting

business methods that Americans might once have known but appeared to

b u s i n e s s a s w a r

509

have forgotten. _The Art of War_ suggested a distinctive philosophical outlook, a reliance on patience and intelligence, gaining advantage through

a superior grasp of dynamic situations and an ability to conceal one’s own

capabilities and intentions while seeing through those of the opponent. By

comparison, American managers had become myopic, fi xated on fi nance and

the short term, while their opponents thought long term and focused on

products. Miyamoto Musashi, a swordsman of the seventeenth century, was a

key Japanese fi gure. When close to death he set down his philosophy for his

disciples in _The Book of Five Rings_ ( _Go Rin No Sho_ ). Although he did participate in a variety of battles, his main skill was in dueling, an art he practiced constantly after opening his account at the age of 13. Musashi’s approach to

dueling allowed for a degree of trickery (for example, arriving late to unnerve his opponent or early to catch him by surprise), but there was no doubting

his strength and skill. He could fi ght with a sword in each hand and was still able to throw his short sword. During his life he is said to have fought at least sixty duels without defeat. Although Musashi claimed that his philosophy

was relevant to all forms of combat, the duel provided a distinctive perspec-

tive, especially when it came to its objective, which was simply to cut down

the opponent.

In terms of an overall approach, there was a lot in common with _The Art of_ _War_ , which Musashi almost certainly had read. 15]] Musashi described strategy as “the craft of the warrior,” to be enacted by commanders. He explained the

importance of his insights by noting that “there is no warrior in the world

today who really understands the Way of Strategy.” He urged the develop-

ment of the sort of intuitive wisdom that comes from hard study of every-

thing that could possibly be relevant (“Know the smallest things and the

biggest things, the shallowest things and the deepest things”), stressed staying calm in all circumstances, urged fl exibility and a change in tactics (as an evident pattern would enable the opponent to identify vulnerabilities),

and was wary of head-on clashes. In order to strike when the enemy was not

properly focused, he urged getting to the high ground, checking whether

the opponent was left- or right-handed, and trying to push him into diffi cult terrain. Timing was important, which meant varying pace and staying alert.

His preference was to attack fi rst, but attention had to be paid to whether the enemy’s strength was waxing or waning.

Whether, as some claimed, a winning Japanese business strategy could be

adduced from all of this was less clear. _The Book of Five Rings_ was not intended for a general reader but for those being trained in a particular martial arts style and attuned to its distinctive spiritual foundations. One authority described it as being “terse to the point of incomprehensibility” and suggested that

510

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

its “unintelligibility” allowed “the text to function as Rorschach inkblots within which modern readers (businessmen, perhaps) can discover many possible meanings.” [^16] To the extent that Musashi was taken seriously in Japan it was as likely to be less as a source of strategic insight and more as something of a role model, as a Samurai hero celebrated for his humility, inner peace,

courage, strength, and ruthlessness.

George Stalk, who was sent by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) to

work in Japan in the late 1970s, was less interested in the softer side of

Japanese strategy than in its harder, tougher side. He developed his ideas

in a 1988 _Harvard Business Review_ article and then a book. 17]] This focused on the importance of time as a source of competitive advantage. He picked up

on the similarity between his views, which stressed making decisions and

implementing them faster than competitors, and those of John Boyd and his

OODA loop, encouraging getting inside the decision cycle. [^18] This led to a line of argument (and language) familiar to anyone who had been following

the military reform debate in the United States. In a competitive situation,

he noted, strategic choice was limited to three options: seek peaceful coex-

istence with competitors, which was unlikely to lead to stability; retreat,

which meant getting out of markets or limiting exposure through consoli-

dation and focus; or attack, which was the only option that offered growth.

But a direct attack through cutting prices and expanding capacity carried

high risk, so the best option would be “indirect attack,” involving surprise, leaving competitors caught by the speed of the attack or by their inability

to respond. He described how the Japanese did this by tightening up their

“planning loops,” from the start of the development of a new product to get-

ting it to the customer. This not only saved money but also left competitors

struggling to catch up. 19

The serious question underlying the “business-as-war” literature was

whether the two activities were suffi ciently similar for military strategy to work in a business context. In some areas, where companies were competing

hard for market share, trying to protect themselves from acquisitive preda-

tors, repulsing sneaky insurgents, or going on the offensive against a vulnerable establishment, the similarities could appear compelling. By and large,

the case studies in this literature involved companies competing head-on

(Coca-Cola versus Pepsi-Cola was a classic). Once companies could be rep-

resented as armies in battle they could be subjected to the same principles.

American military strategists in the 1970s and 1980s began to explore the

relevance of Sun Tzu and Liddell Hart, and contrast the virtues of maneuver

warfare with unimaginative and costly attrition. Encouraged by John Boyd,

they considered how to get inside the decision cycles of opponents to leave

b u s i n e s s a s w a r

511

them disoriented and confused. With a certain lag, these themes were also picked up by business strategists. A number were certainly well aware of

Boyd’s work.

Military strategies were tested only occasionally in one-off encounters that

might not always be as decisive as hoped but could be expected to change

the terms of any future encounters. Business strategies were tested daily but did include opportunities that could be quite unique to one company and

once exploited could create a durable advantage. It was not true that military strategy only involved states as fi xed and unchanging entities. Though rare, states could disappear through takeovers and new ones come into existence

through fragmentation. With business this was, however, far more normal

and possibly its most important distinguishing feature. Companies could

break up, be taken over, or simply go out of existence as new ones formed.

This made the interaction of internal organization and external environment

much more complex. The strategic literature, however, paid surprisingly

little attention to this interaction. Arguably, the disciplinary divisions in the social sciences did not help. By and large, economics addressed questions of the relationship of fi rms to their markets. Its eventual forays into organizational structures were infl uential but generally disastrous. To understand organizations, sociology was much more helpful but provided few tools (and

a disciplinary lack of interest) for analyzing relationships to operating environments. The division in the literature means that our account must follow

the fi rst of these strands, led by economics, before it can return to the second, led by sociology.

The Rise of Economics

_The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are_

_right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly_

_understood. Indeed the world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who_

_believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual infl uence, are_ _usually the slaves of some defunct economist._

—John Maynard Keynes

Economics came to acquire an almost hegemonic position in strategic

management. This was not because it was uniquely fi tted for this intel-

lectual purpose but because of deliberate decisions to adopt it as the foundation of a new science of decision-making and the active promotion of this new science by bodies such as the RAND Corporation and the Ford Foundation,

both of which encouraged its embrace by business schools. As with Plato’s

philosophy, a new discipline that offered eternal truths was created in part by disparaging and caricaturing what had gone before for its lack of rigor.

The best place to start this story is with the RAND Corporation, which

we identifi ed in the last section as the home of game theory and the belief

that a formal science of decision could be developed. This effort gained credibility because of the very special issues posed by nuclear weapons. The effort transformed thinking about not only strategy but also economics because it

demonstrated the possibilities opened up by powerful computing capabilities

for modeling all forms of human activity. Philip Mirowski has written of the

“Cyborg sciences,” which developed along with computing, refl ecting novel

interactions between men and machines. They broke down the distinctions

between nature and society, as models of one began to resemble the other, and between “reality” and simulacra. The Monte Carlo simulations adopted during the wartime atomic bomb project for dealing with uncertainty in data,

for example, opened up a range of possible experiments to explore the logic

of complex systems, discerning ways through uncertainty and forms of order

in chaos. 1]] RAND analysts saw them as supplanting rather than supplementing traditional patterns of thought. Simple forms of cause and effect could be left behind as it became possible to explore the character of dynamic systems, with the constantly changing interaction between components parts. The

models of systems, more or less orderly and stable, that had started to become fashionable before the war could take on new meanings. And even in areas

where intense computation was not required there was a growing comfort

in scientifi c circles, both natural and social, with models that were formal and abstract, not based just on direct observations of a narrow segment of

accessible reality but also on explorations of something that approximated to a much larger and otherwise inaccessible reality. They could be analyzed in

ways which the human mind, left on its own, could not begin to manage. As

one of the fi rst textbooks on operations research noted, this work required an

“impersonal curiosity concerning new subjects,” rejection of “unsupported

statements,” and a desire to rest “decisions on some quantitative basis, even if the basis is only a rough estimate.”

In their landmark book of 1957, which gave the fi eld renewed vigor,

Duncan Luce and Howard Raiffa noted prematurely the decline of the “naive

bandwagon-feeling that game theory solved innumerable problems of soci-

ology and economics, or at the least, that it made their solution a practical

matter of a few years’ work.” 2 They ur]]ged social scientists to recognize that game theory was not descriptive. Instead it was “rather (conditionally) normative. It states neither how people do behave nor how they should behave in

an absolute sense, but how they should behave if they wish to achieve certain ends.” 3 Their injunction was ignored and game theory came to be adopted as]]

more of a descriptive than normative tool.

One reason for this was the development of the Nash equilibrium, named

after the mathematician John Nash (whose struggle with mental illness

became the subject of a book and a movie). 4 This was an approach to non-

zero-sum games. The idea was to fi nd a point of equilibrium, comparable to

those in physics when forces balance one another. In this case, players sought the optimum way to reach their goals. The equilibrium point was reached

514

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

when the players adopted a set of strategies that created no incentive for any individual player to change strategy so long as the others stayed unchanged. [^5]

Nash’s contribution came to be celebrated within economics as “one of the

outstanding intellectual advances of the twentieth century.” 6]] But its value to strategy was limited. On the one hand, a lack of points of equilibrium led

to chaos; on the other, too many points resulted in an indeterminate situa-

tion. As a contrast, Tom Schelling demonstrated the possibilities of using

abstract forms of reasoning to illuminate real issues faced by states, organizations, and individuals. He encouraged people to think of strategy as an aid

to bargaining, and he explored with great insight the awful paradoxes of the

nuclear age. But he explicitly eschewed mathematical solutions and drew

on a range of disciplines, thus abandoning any attempt to develop a pure,

general theory. Mirowski found Nash’s non-cooperative rationalism wanting

but also found Schelling’s more playful, allusive mode of analysis exasperat-

ing because of its lack of rigor. Schelling avoided the restrictive forms of

game theory and the challenging mathematics of Nash in order to make

paradoxical points about communication without communication and ratio-

nality without rationality. 7]] Mirowski understated Schelling’s importance as a conceptualizer and his recognition of the limits of formal theories when it came to modeling behavior and expectations. “One cannot, without empirical evidence,” Schelling observed, “deduce whatever understandings can be

perceived in a non-zero-sum game of maneuver any more than one can prove,

by purely formal deduction, that a particular joke is bound to be funny.” 8]]

Schelling, however, had many more admirers than imitators. In economics

Nash became part of the mainstream.

The extraordinary boost from RAND’s budget and advances in computing

put social science on a new footing. The effect was particularly striking with economics. Orthodox economics had faced a crisis during the great depression of the 1930s. This led to greater empirical rigor backed by improved

statistical analysis. Many key fi gures had learned the analytical techniques in wartime operational research. Even where there were important differences

in emphasis and approach, as for example between the Chicago School and

the Cowles Commission (which had been set up in 1932 to improve the col-

lection and statistical analysis of economic data), they had much in common.

Notably, they were rooted in the neoclassical tradition, going back to Walras and Pareto, and assumed that the safest assumption was of individual rationality. As Milton Friedman, the most prominent Chicago economist, put

it: “We shall suppose that the individual in making these decisions acts as if

he were pursuing and attempting to maximize a single end.” 9]] Friedman considered the debate about whether people really acted so rationally, following t h e r i s e o f e c o n o m i c s

515

complex statistical rules, irrelevant. It was an approximation that was productive for theory, leading to propositions that could then be tested against the evidence.

Friedman and his colleagues were methodologically pragmatic, although

dogmatic in their conviction that the market worked best when left alone by

government. In this they were infl uenced by Friedrich Hayek, an Austrian

who had acquired British citizenship in 1938 and had been teaching at the

London School of Economics until he was recruited to Chicago, though not

by the economics department, in 1950. His most famous book, _The Road_

_to Serfdom_ , was published during the war and warned against the inclination to central planning that was gathering momentum under the combined

infl uence of socialism and the wartime experience. Meanwhile, the Cowles

Commission, infl uenced by John von Neumann and sponsored by RAND,

was up for new methodological challenges and was more inclined to believe

that robust models could support enlightened policy. Either way the assump-

tions and methods associated with game theory became part of a wider proj-

ect to develop new forms of social science.

_Economics into Business_

The Ford Foundation was at the fore in exploring how management within

big government and big business could become vital instruments of effi ciency and progress. In the late 1940s, the Foundation moved from addressing the

needs of the Ford Company’s own operations around Detroit to meeting a

broader agenda. The deaths of both Henry and Edsel Ford led to a surge of

money into the Foundation. The man chosen to head a study committee to

set the objectives for the future was H. Rowan Gaither, then chairman of

RAND and later to become the Foundation’s president. He was convinced

that social science could and should be mobilized to serve the nation, and

that this required managers who understood this science and could appreci-

ate the possibilities for its application. He spoke to the Stanford Business

School in 1958 about how “the Soviet challenge requires that we seek out and

utilize the best intelligence of American management—and in turn put on

management a national responsibility of unparalleled dimensions.” 10

A report for the Foundation in 1959 deplored an “embarrassingly low”

standard of acceptability among business schools, one which many schools

did not actually meet. The point was illustrated by citing multiple study

options on the “principles of baking” at one southern school. At the same time there was optimism that the situation could be rectifi ed by a “management

516

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

science” being transmitted to students as a methodology for decision-making. Instead of being taught to rely on judgment (which had been the basis

of the Harvard curriculum), students could develop a more analytical compe-

tence by being immersed in quantitative methods and decision theory. Under

Gaither’s infl uence, Ford directed vast sums into the top business schools to create centers of excellence, raising the intellectual caliber and professionalism of the coming generations of managers and their teachers. Over two

decades, the numbers of business schools in the United States tripled and

the production of MBAs went up accordingly. By 1980, fi fty-seven thousand

MBAs were graduating from six hundred programs, accounting for 20 per-

cent of the total number of master’s degrees granted. At the same time, there was an equivalent expansion in the number of scholarly academic business

journals, from about twenty at the end of the 1950s to two hundred two

decades later. [^11]

Harvard was the major benefi ciary and the Hawthorne studies held as

exemplars of the benefi ts of serious research, though it was the new Carnegie Institute of Technology’s Graduate School of Industrial Organization that led the way in drawing upon the social sciences as a source of intellectual energy.

Lee Bach, who led the Carnegie effort, was convinced that the best deci-

sions must emerge out of the best reasoning process. He predicted a change

that would involve clarifying and bringing to the surface “the variables and

logical models our minds must be using now in decision-making and of per-

sistently improving the logic of these models.” 12]] One of those he recruited, political-scientist-cum-economist Herbert Simon, recalled a determination

to transform business education from a “wasteland of vocationalism” into a

“science-based professionalism.” By 1965, Ford was reporting “an increased

use of quantitative analysis and model building” and more publications in

disciplinary journals in economics, psychology, and statistics.

Its original concept had been to integrate the case study method as taught

at Harvard with economics, sharpening the case studies while tempering eco-

nomic theory with a dose of realism. The balance was to be shifted to more

research with less description, more theory and less practice. Little balance was found. In what was later admitted to be a “tactical error,” Ford’s push

for academic excellence in the business schools came to be dominated by

economists who showed little interest either in adapting to other disciplines or even worrying unduly about real-world applications. In the early 1960s,

however, they seemed like a breath of fresh air. The determination to stress

the practical and avoid the theoretical had led to an absence of any sort of

theory, which left everything to common sense and judgment. In remedying

this defi ciency, economics had clear advantages over the other, softer social t h e r i s e o f e c o n o m i c s

517

sciences. It encouraged parsimonious models, simplifying the complex issues of management by focusing on core principles and assuming rational actors

(which is just how managers liked to imagine themselves). The clarity of

the assumptions would be refl ected in the sharpness and testability of the

hypotheses. The challenge for management was to achieve the best for their

organization. It made sense to look at a theory that assumed that to be the

aim of all individuals and organizations.

The change was refl ected in Harvard. The business policy course, which

treated corporate strategy in the “genteel tradition of those days, not as a set of formulas but as the mission of the company, its distinctive competence,

refl ecting the values of its managers,” and was not particularly popular, was replaced by one entitled “Competition and Strategy,” from which the mate-

rial on the general manager and the values of society had been removed. 13

_Competition_

It was not just the push on the supply side that created the interest in eco-

nomic theories of decision-making but also changes in the demands posed

by the business environment. The emphasis on planning processes had

refl ected the supposed interests of a limited number of very large corpora-

tions with huge fi nancial and political clout, offering a range of product lines in a steadily growing economy. While for these behemoths internal organization was a major issue, precisely because of their size and strength and

the restraint of antitrust legislation, competition was not so important. The word does not even appear in the index of Chandler’s _Strategy and Structure_ or Drucker’s _The Practice of Management._

For smaller fi rms in new or dying markets with much simpler structures,

the challenges were always quite different, and new challenges began to

develop even for the big corporations. The large as well as the small became

subject to increasing foreign competition, notably from insurgent Japanese

corporations with a better eye for new consumer technologies and lower

costs. Basic structural shifts were occurring: the move from manufacturing to services, new technologies that were creating new forms of enterprise as well as new types of goods, plus the development of increasingly esoteric fi nancial instruments. Then there were temporary factors with severe effects, such as

the hike in oil prices in 1974 and the subsequent combination of stagnation

and infl ation.

In this fi rst instance, this challenge was picked up not by the business

schools but by consultants, who by necessity were tuned to the stresses and

518

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

strains of changes in the business environment. The Boston Consulting Group (BCG), founded by Bruce Henderson in 1964, saw strategy as being

about making direct comparisons with competitors, especially in relation

to cost structures. While the business schools still encouraged the analy-

sis of specifi c and unique situations, Henderson sought strong theories that would guide the consultant when considering the circumstances of new clients. His approach was more deductive than inductive. The aim was to fi nd

a “meaningful, quantitative relationship” between a company and its chosen

markets. 14

Like so many fi gures in business strategy, Henderson’s background was

in engineering. He was therefore attracted by the idea of systems tending

to equilibrium, with the aim of strategy in a system including competitors

to be one of fi rst upsetting the equilibrium and then reestablishing it on a more favorable basis. The challenge was to develop the necessary thinking in

terms suffi ciently explicit to be “executed in a coordinated fashion in com-

plex organizations.”

His approach, in stark contrast to the complexity of Ansoff, was to apply

micro-economic methodology, to develop what he called “powerful oversim-

plifi cations,” which BCG then sold to companies. 15]] The oversimplifi cation that established his reputation was the “experience curve.” Based on early

studies of the aircraft industry, the core idea was that the more units pro-

duced, the lower the costs and the higher the profi ts. When plotted on a

curve this could show the state of a competitive relationship. The presump-

tion was that for companies making the same product, variations in costs

were largely related to market share. Thus the effects of an increased share

were calculable. Businesses should expect costs to decline systematically and predictably as a result of their superior productive experience. While the

methodology encouraged companies to look at their total costs and recognize

economies of scale, it could also be seriously misleading. In a mature industry the experience curve would fl atten out. It could also encourage a race to the bottom, as prices were cut in the expectation of higher volumes which might

not materialize, and then leave little scope for investment. As Ford’s Model T

experience demonstrated, even the master of a product with costs kept down

to a minimum can still be caught out by a better product.

BCG’s second powerful oversimplifi cation was the growth-share matrix.

A matrix was drawn with the growth in the market on one axis and share of

the market on the other. Companies could then locate their various activities on the matrix. It was best to have a high share of a growing market (the stars) and worst to have a low share of a static or declining market (the dogs). The other two categories were “cash cows” and “question marks.” The _resources/books//Strategy_ A History - Lawrence Freedman

were powerful and the logic compelling. The cows had to be looked after and the stars backed, while the dogs were candidates for divestment. Once

that was sorted, only the question marks required serious thoughts. Again

the imagery had a capacity to mislead. As one critic, John Seeger, noted,

“The dogs may be friendly, the cows may need a bull now and then to remain

productive, and the stars may have burned themselves out.” Seeger warned of

the dangers of allowing management models to “substitute for analysis and

common sense.” Just because a theory had elegance and simplicity did not

“guarantee sanity in its use.” 16

It took until 1980 before a major breakthrough in business strategy came

out of a business school. Michael Porter, who had the requisite engineering

background and an enthusiasm for competitive sports, entered the Harvard

MBA program, where he was taught the holistic, multidimensional “busi-

ness policy” philosophy. Unusually, he then enrolled for a Ph.D. in busi-

ness economics. One of the courses he took was on industrial organization.

This was the area of economics most conducive to business strategy because

it studied situations of imperfect competition. In perfect competition, the

postulate through which economic theory largely developed, the choices

available to buyers and sellers created the potential for equilibrium around

a specifi c price. By defi nition, perfect competition allowed no scope for an individual unit to have a special and successful strategy. The most imperfect competition would be a complete monopoly where a single supplier

could set the price, also leaving little scope for strategy. The oligopolist had options, neither fully constrained by the market but affected by the moves of its competitors. The oligopolist had to be strategic, because he must anticipate these moves. There was no law to govern this situation, which is why

Simon declared oligopoly to be “the permanent and ineradicable scandal of

economic theory.” [^17]

For economists, the question raised was why certain markets deviated

from standard models of perfect competition. Profi ts should be more than

suffi cient to animate the company, but certain industries were extremely

profi table. That was because of a lack of competitive pressure, which was the result of the “barriers to entry”—the diffi culty faced when trying to establish a new position in a market. The thrust of the economics approach to

industrial organization was to fi nd ways to reduce these barriers to make

the markets more competitive. With his business school background, Porter

saw an opportunity to turn the theory on its head. This was a natural stance

for a student of strategy, taking the point of view of the company within

the industry rather than the industry as a whole. Instead of asking how the

system could be made more competitive, he asked how the unit within the

520

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

system could exploit and even intensify uncompetitive elements to gain strategic advantage.

Following Ansoff in defi ning strategy in terms of “relating a company to

its environment,” Porter devised a framework to help companies examine

their competitive situation. The focus was still on providing a guide to a

deliberative process for a large business, but he was more ambitious than

Andrews, more focused than Ansoff, and less formulaic than Henderson. 18

Porter identifi ed two key issues. The fi rst was seller concentration (what percentage of the market was controlled by the top four fi rms) and barriers to

entry. Out of this came the “fi ve forces framework” for analyzing an indus-

try. The forces were competitive rivalry between fi rms, bargaining power

of suppliers and of buyers, threats of new entrants and of substitute offer-

ings. A number of factors were connected with each. The presentation was

methodical and rigorous, offering basic principles and some specifi c tactics about how to maintain and improve a competitive position. To the critics

who claimed that his analysis was too static, Porter replied that the fi ve forces all needed to be watched precisely because they changed.

For Porter, strategy was all about positioning. The menu of strategies was

small and the choice would depend on the nature of the competitive envi-

ronment, with the aim of fi nding a position that could be defended against

existing competitors and those trying to enter the market. Porter offered

three generic strategies: staying market leader by keeping costs down, hav-

ing a product that was suffi ciently different that it could not be challenged by other competitors (differentiation), and identifying a particular part of the market where there were few challengers (market specialization). He argued

that it was important to pick one of these strategies, stick to it, and never get

“stuck in the middle,” because that would almost “guarantee low profi tabil-

ity.” Since the best position would be extremely profi table, there would then be suffi cient resources to improve the position. The key thing was to fi nd and exploit the imperfections in the market. In terms of the SWOT framework,

this was about addressing opportunities and threats rather than strengths and weaknesses. There was very little interest in internal organization and the

actual implementation of a strategy.

Porter’s method could be criticized for being deductive. He had plenty

of examples of tactics used by companies seeking product differentiation or

raising barriers, but these were illustrations of propositions derived from his theory. Some of his central claims about the generic strategies and the greater value to be gained by concentrating on market position as against operational effi ciency did not seem to fi t the evidence. As with all structural theorists the tendency was to assume that structure had “a strong infl uence in determining t h e r i s e o f e c o n o m i c s

521

the competitive rules of the game as well as the strategies potentially available to the fi rm.” [^19] In practice the system was less rigid and certain than the theory assumed, and more susceptible to being transformed by truly imaginative strategies.

One striking feature of Porter’s approach lay in its political implications.

This was not something he dealt with explicitly, but as Mitzberg noted: “If

profi t really does lie in market power, then there are clearly more than eco-

nomic ways to generate it.” 20 The closest Porter came to making the link

between competitive position and government assistance was in noting how

governments “can limit or even foreclose entry into industries with such con-

trols as licensing requirements and limits on access to raw materials.” The

key arena here was that affected by antitrust legislation. Porter was well aware of the issue, noting that companies under antitrust restraints might not feel able to respond to competitors attempting to take a small market share, or

how large companies may use a private antitrust suit to harass small competi-

tors. [^21] He warmed to the theme in his second book, _Competitive Advantage_ , noting how these suits could put fi nancial pressure on competitors. Here he

also discussed how barriers to entry could be raised higher than would natu-

rally occur, by such methods as forming exclusive agreements with outlets

to freeze out competitors, tying up suppliers, and even working in coalition

with other established fi rms. 22]] A number of the activities, he noted, were frowned upon by antitrust law and were the subject of successful suits. Porter

insisted that he supported antitrust legislation, 23 and it was also the case that

there was a degree of uncertainty surrounding this legislation in terms of the vigor with which it was applied at any time, often depending on economic

circumstances. This uncertainty was a major problem for the strategist, as

what might seem acceptable behavior at one moment became unacceptable

the next.

In the mid-1980s, Porter advised the National Football League (NFL) in

its dispute with the United States Football League (USFL). He characterized

the dispute as “guerrilla warfare” and suggested aggressive strategies, such

as persuading broadcasters to break their contract with the USFL, poaching

the USFL’s best players while encouraging the NFL’s worst to go the other

way, and co-opting the most powerful USFL owners while bankrupting the

weakest USFL teams. This was cited in evidence when the USFL sought

damages from the NFL for its anticompetitive practices. Ultimately, it was

agreed that the NFL had violated the law, although only derisory damages

were awarded. Porter’s assistant acknowledged that legal issues had not been

considered in offering advice; the NFL’s defense was that it had ignored the

advice. 24

522

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

A similar problem emerged with Barry Nalebuff and Adam Brandenburger’s _Co-Opetition_ , an attempt to capture the insights of game theory for a popular audience. The title neatly captured the mixture of cooperation and competition that game theory addressed, [^25] although the neologism was not actually new. 26 Their idea was that it would make sense to cooperate with other play-]]

ers in the industry to expand the business pie while competing over how it

was divided up. They noted the complexity of relationships, not only with

customers, suppliers, and competitors, but also complements—that is, other

players with whom there was a natural cooperative and mutually dependent

relationship (for example, hardware and software fi rms in computing). They

discussed the advantages that could be gained by changing the rules of the

game or by using tactics to shift perceptions of a position within the game.

The infl uence of game theory was evident, but this was hardly a theoretical

work. As with other practical work in the fi eld it took some basic factors and reworked them in a variety of cases, offering readers some insight on how

they might approach similar types of problems.

The more explicit recognition of the potential of cooperation, which

would be natural in any other area of strategy, always risked appearing anti-

competitive and falling foul of antitrust law. Nalebuff and Brandenburger

thus celebrated Nintendo’s achievements in gaining a competitive advan-

tage in the computer games market, which allowed them to overcharge their

customers (eventually requiring them to settle in the face of a suit from the Federal Trade Commission). The way the analysis was structured led the

authors to naturally favor the company over the consumer. Stewart sharply

commented that they “praise one company after another for cornering mar-

kets and duping customers” before acknowledging antitrust concerns. He

accused them of developing an approach to strategy which was about “how

to arrange a cartel without having to enter a smoke-fi lled backroom, how to

organize a monopoly without going to the trouble of bribing government

offi cials, and, in general, how to make extraordinary profi ts without having to make extraordinary products.” As he noted, while they praised General

Motors for its credit card strategy, which offered discounts to those who used it, Toyota, which did not bother with a credit card, was building better cars

and eating into the market share of General Motors. 27

John Rockefeller did not appear in the index to Porter’s

_Competitive_

_Strategy_ . He might have found the language and concepts unfamiliar but as one ready to try every trick in the book to position Standard Oil, the

broad thrust of the argument would have been well understood. The manage-

ment strategists of the late twentieth century were operating in an environ-

ment shaped signifi cantly by the great trusts of the nineteenth century and

t h e r i s e o f e c o n o m i c s

523

the progressive movement’s attempts to deal with them. The logic of any attempt to tame markets was to make life diffi cult for at least some competitors. While the fi rst wave of management strategists ignored this issue, because they were dealing with fi rms that were in secure positions or close to the limits of their legal growth, this was not the case with the second wave, which—as exemplifi ed by Porter—did not so much embrace competition as

seek ways to subdue and circumvent it. The third wave embraced competi-

tion with enthusiasm.

Red Queens and Blue Oceans

_Here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same_

_place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice_

_as fast._

—The Red Queen in Alice Through the Looking Glass

Against the backdrop of intense competitive pressures, the role of the

manager was increasingly thrown into relief. The rewards they could

make at the top of major companies grew, but so did the risks of being fi red.

Their performance was being judged against ever more demanding stan-

dards, but short-term profi tability of the sort that would impress investors increasingly became the most important objective by far. Investing for the

long term appeared less attractive than selling off weaker units or taking

aggressive action against all perceived ineffi ciencies.

The challenge to the role of the managers was posed by agency theory,

derived from transaction cost economics. It directly addressed the issue of

cooperating parties that still had distinctive interests. In particular, it considered situations in which one party, the principal, delegated work to another, the agent. The principal could be in a quandary by not knowing exactly

what the agent was up to, and whether their views of risk were truly aligned.

This issue went to the heart of relationships between owners and managers.

The rise of managerialism refl ected the view that the agents were the key

people. In business and politics, the notional principals—the stockholders/

board members and the electorate/politicians—were transitory and amateur-

ish compared with the fi xed, professional elite. The progressive separation of ownership and control had been charted by Berle and Means in the 1930s.

The question posed now was whether and how the principals could reassert

control over their agents. 1]] If the agents did not wish to be so controlled, they had to take the initiative in demonstrating their value to shareholders or else fi nd ways of releasing themselves from this constraint by becoming the owners as well as the managers.

_Agency Theory_

Michael Jensen, a Chicago-trained economist at Rochester, was impressed

by a 1970 article in the _New York Times_ by Milton Friedman that announced his arrival as an outspoken advocate of free-market economics. Friedman’s

target was activist Ralph Nader’s campaign to get three representatives of

the “public interest” on the board of General Motors. Friedman countered

that the only responsibility of the corporation was to make profi ts so long as it engaged in “open and free competition without deception or fraud.” His

arguments challenged the managerialism of the past two decades directly: the

leaders of the big corporations should neither expect to act as agents of the state nor expect the state to shield them from competition. This led Jensen

and a colleague, William Meckling, to try to turn Friedman’s plain speak-

ing into economic theory. They found little to work with. They then made a

big leap, taking what had become a contentious hypothesis when applied to

fi nance—that markets were suffi ciently effi cient to provide a better guide to value than individuals, notably fund managers—and applying it to management. In this way, Justin Fox remarked, “the rational market idea” moved

from “theoretical economics into the empirical subdivision of fi nance.” There it “lost in nuance and gained in intensity.” It was now seeking to use the

“stock market’s collective judgment to resolve confl icts of interest that had

plagued scholars, executives, and shareholders for generations.” 2]] By assuming perfect labor markets, so that employees cost no more than what they

were worth to the company and if necessary could move without cost to an

alternative job, their analysis concluded that the most important risks were

those carried by shareholders. [^3]

By 1983, because of the growing interest shown by economists, Jensen felt

able to claim that a “revolution would take place” over the coming decades

“in our knowledge about organizations.” Though organization science was in

526

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

its infancy, the foundation for a powerful theory was in place. This involved departing from the economists’ view of the fi rm as “little more than a black box that behaves in a value- or profi t-maximizing way” in an environment in

which “all contracts are perfectly and costlessly enforced.” Instead he argued that fi rms could be understood in terms of systems geared to performance

evaluation, rewards, and the assignment of decision rights. Relationships

within an organization, including those between suppliers and customers,

could be understood as contracts. Taken together they formed a complex

system made up of maximizing agents with diverse objectives. This system

would reach its own equilibrium. “In this sense, the behavior of the organization is like the equilibrium behavior of a market.” This insight, he argued,

was relevant to all types of organizations. It led to cooperative behavior being viewed “as a contracting problem among self-interested individuals with

divergent interests.” [^4]

The prescriptive implication of this approach was that the owners had

every reason to worry that their managers were getting distracted. Getting

the interests of owners and managers back into alignment through moni-

toring and incentives required challenging the claims of managerialism.

Deregulated markets were favored because they put at risk the positions of

managers who were not delivering value for shareholders. Contrary to the

pejorative connotations of hostile takeovers, the argument of Jensen and his

colleagues was that these could increase the effi ciency of the market. Managers dare not get sidetracked by loose and fashionable talk of multiple “stakehold-ers” but must keep their focus on the needs of the “shareholders” for profi t maximization. While managers might complain about takeovers, they were

a way of increasing value, redeploying assets, and protecting companies from

mismanagement. “Scientifi c evidence indicates that the market for corpo-

rate control almost uniformly increases effi ciency and shareholders’ wealth.” 5]]

Companies were viewed as a bundle of assets, formed and reformed according

to the demands of the market. The market was all-knowing, while managers

were inclined to myopia. By 1993 _Fortune_ could declare: “The Imperial CEO

has had his day—long live the shareholders.” 6

Adopting this view reduced the need for strategy and management.

Once free-market determinism was adopted, then it was possible to “assume

a management” as all other factors might also be assumed. It became just

another “substitutable” commodity or, even worse, an opportunistic actor

“in need of market discipline.” 7 The manager’]]s obligations were not inward-looking but only outward-looking, toward the shareholders. This was despite

the fact that shareholders might be transitory and incoherent as a group and

short term in perspective, or that effi cient organizations had to be formed and r e d q u e e n s a n d b l u e o c e a n s

527

nurtured if the moves the market demanded were to be implemented. The implications for the standing and vocations of managers were profound. The

theory suggested that an organization’s history and culture were irrelevant,

staffed by people who might as well be strangers to each other. Managers

being trained in this theory would offer no loyalty and expect none in return.

Their task was to interpret the markets and respond to incentives. Little

scope was left for the exercise of judgment and responsibility.

_Management: A Dangerous Profession_

In the early 1980s, warnings were fi rst heard about the potential conse-

quences of such logic for the running of businesses. The malaise was identi-

fi ed in 1980 by Robert Hayes and William Abernathy, both professors at

the Harvard Business School. American managers, they complained, had

“abdicated their strategic responsibilities.” Increasingly from marketing,

fi nance, and law rather than production, they sought short-term gains rather than long-term innovation. Particularly pointed, especially in the leading

business school journal, was the assertion that the problem lay in an increasing managerial reliance on “principles that prize analytical detachment and

methodological elegance over insight, based on experience, into the sub-

tleties and complexities of strategic decisions.” Within both the business

community and academia, a “false and shallow concept of the professional

manager” had developed. Such people were “pseudoprofessionals” who

had no special expertise in any particular industry or technology but were

believed to be able to “step into an unfamiliar company and run it success-

fully through strict application of fi nancial controls, portfolio concepts, and a market-driven strategy.” It had become a form of corporate religion, with

its core doctrine that “neither industry experience nor hands-on technologi-

cal expertise counts for very much,” which helped to salve the conscience of

those that lacked these qualities but also led to decisions about technologi-

cal matters being taken as if they were “adjuncts to fi nance or marketing

decisions” and could therefore be expressed in simplifi ed, quantifi ed forms. 8]]

At the end of the decade, an unimpressed Franklin Fisher observed,

“Bright young theorists tend to think of every problem in game-theoretic

terms, including problems that are easier to think of in other forms.” [^9] Even in oligopoly theory, to which game theory seemed most suited, Fisher

argued that it had not made a fundamental difference. It remained the case,

after game theory as before, that a “great many outcomes were known to

be possible. The context in which the theory was set was important, with

528

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

outcomes dependent on what variables the oligopolists used and how they formed conjectures about each other.” The effects of market structure on

conduct and performance, he argued, had to take account of context. It was

true that game theory could model these contexts, but this would not be in a

convenient language. In response, Carl Shapiro argued that game theory had

much to show for its efforts. But the prospect he offered was explicitly close to Schelling, suggesting not so much a unifi ed theory but tools to identify

a range of situations, ideas of what to look for in particular cases, but still dependent on detailed information to work out the best strategy. He also

suspected “diminishing returns in the use of game theory to develop simple

models of business strategy.” 10]] The subtle and complex reasoning described in the models was rarely replicated by actual decision-makers, who were

“far less analytic and perform far less comprehensive analyses than these

models posit.” [^11] Saloner acknowledged the challenge, especially if the models were taken literally and supposed to mirror an actual managerial situa-

tion with the aim of coming up with a prescription for action. He argued

that “the appropriate role for microeconomic-style modeling in strategic

management generally, and for game-theoretical modeling in particular, is

not literal but rather is metaphorical.” 12]] It was not a distinction that was regularly recognized. It was all very well producing elegant solutions, but

they were of little value if they were to problems that practitioners did not recognize and expressed in forms that they could not comprehend, let alone

implement.

Although there were available academic theories that might assist in the

design of organizations fi t for particular purposes or at least explain why

apparently rational designs produced dysfunctional results, nobody in busi-

ness or government seemed to be taking much notice. Despite this growing

divergence, the framework for research was diffi cult to change. Journals put a premium on established theories and methods. The apparently harder, quantitative work inspired by the economists assuming rational actors was domi-

nant. Because modern software made large-scale number crunching possible,

there was also a large database mentality. Research students were advised to

avoid qualitative studies. 13]] The effects could be seen not only in the research but in the norms for behavior the standard models were suggesting. In 2005,

Sumantra Ghoshal observed:

Combine agency theory with transaction costs economics, add in stan-

dard versions of game theory and negotiations analysis, and the picture

of the manager that emerges is one that is now very familiar in prac-

tice: the ruthlessly hard-driving, strictly top-down, command-and

r e d q u e e n s a n d b l u e o c e a n s

529

control focused, shareholder-value-obsessed, win-at-any-cost business leader. [^14]

During the 1990s, theories were developed for this new breed of manager,

promising success that could be measured in profi t margins, market share,

and stock prices. They reinforced the challenge to the idea of manager as the secure and steady, but essentially gray, bureaucrat who knew his place in the large corporation, which in turn knew its place in the larger economy. They

offered “a conception of management itself in virtuous, heroic, high status

terms.” 15 As James Champy]], who was at the heart of the neo-Taylorist push in the 1990s, observed, “Management has joined the ranks of the danger-

ous professions.” 16 The sense of danger refl]] ected the greater demands being placed on managers, as they had to fear not only absolute but even relative

failure. In the world as celebrated by Jensen, stockholders were demand-

ing faster and larger returns, and predators had their eyes open for potential acquisitions. Survival and success required not only attention to customers

and products but a readiness to be ruthless, to hack away at the least effi -

cient parts of the business, to push away and overwhelm competitors, and to

lobby hard for changes in government policy—especially deregulation—that

would open up new markets.

Attitudes toward fi nance had been transformed. The oil shocks and infl a-

tion of the 1970s extended a period of modest returns on equities, com-

bined with a traditional reluctance to carry excessive debt. By the end of that decade, new and imaginative ways of raising capital were found. Companies

could grow ambitiously and quickly by issuing bonds. Those investors pre-

pared to take a greater risk could anticipate higher yields. With capital plentiful, many companies grew through mergers and acquisitions rather than

by developing new products and processes. Attitudes became increasingly

aggressive, with the focus on extracting value from corporate assets that

had been missed by others or which current owners were unable to exploit.

The logical next step was for the senior executives of companies to chal-

lenge the ownership model which saw others get the greatest benefi t from

their achievements. Management buyouts liberated them from their boards,

providing greater scope for initiatives while incidentally generating a lot of money. This surge of activity eventually ran its course as the deals became

more expensive and the returns disappointed. The debt still had to be ser-

viced, and if it was too large, bankruptcy followed.

Businesses were now judged by their market value. This should refl ect

their intrinsic quality and the longer-term prospects for their goods and services, but that was not always easy to assess and all the incentives were for 530

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

those who held the stock, including managers, to talk up its current value.

This made success tangible and measurable compared with the longer-term

development of a business which might require patience and low returns

before the rewards became evident. But assessments of market value were

vulnerable to sentiment and hype, as well as downright fraud. The energy

company Enron was the prize exhibit of the latter possibility. This risk was

greatest in areas that were hard to grasp, whether because of the sophistica-

tion of the fi nancial instruments or the potential of the new technologies.

Within companies, any activities that might be holding down the price, not

providing the value that was being extracted elsewhere, came to be targeted.

Thus they encouraged remorseless cost cutting.

_Business Process Re-engineering_

The Japanese success over the postwar decades could be taken as a triumph of

a focused, patient, coherent, and consensual culture, a refl ection of dedicated operational effi ciency or else a combination of the two. Either way, the pace-setter was the car manufacturer, Toyota. Having spent the Second World War

building military vehicles, the company struggled after the war to get back

into the commercial market. Hampered by a lack of capital and technical

capacity and by a strike-prone, radicalized work force, Toyota would prob-

ably have gone bankrupt were it not for the Korean War and large orders to

supply the American military with vehicles. It then began to put together

what became known as the Toyota Production System. The starting point

was a solution to labor unrest by a unique deal which promised employees

lifetime employment in return for loyalty and commitment. Together they

would work to establish a system which would reduce waste. Ideas for improv-

ing productivity could be raised and explored in “quality circles.” As this

was a country where everything was still in short supply, a visit to a Ford

plant in Michigan in 1950 left an abiding impression of the wastefulness of

American production methods. Toyota aimed to keep down inventories and

avoid idle equipment and workers. With excess inventory identifi ed as both a cause of waste and a symptom of waste elsewhere in the system, methods were

developed to process material and then move it on “just in time” for the next operation. Within Japan, Toyota’s methods were emulated and further developed by other companies. In one industry after another, including motorcy-

cles, shipping, steel, cameras, and electronic goods, Western companies found themselves losing market share to the Japanese. Government policy, the need

to start from scratch after the war, and a cheap currency all helped.

r e d q u e e n s a n d b l u e o c e a n s

531

In comparison with Japanese super-managers, their American counterparts appeared as a feeble bunch. During the course of the 1970s, the manage-

ment literature became more introspective as mighty American fi rms were

humbled by the Japanese insurgency, not only losing markets to more nimble

opponents but also being caught out by a business culture that was far more

innovative. Although the momentum behind the Japanese advance came to

a juddering halt after the hubris and boom years of the late 1980s, Western

companies were determined to mimic the Japanese by radical approaches

to their own operational effectiveness. These came fi rst under the heading

of total quality management (TQM) and the second as business process re-

engineering (BPR). Of the two, BPR was more signifi cant in its impact and

implications. The basic idea behind BPR was to bring together a set of tech-

niques designed to make companies more competitive by enabling them to

cut costs and improve products at the same time. The challenge was posed in

terms of a fundamental rethink of how the organization set about its business rather than a determined effort to make the established systems run more

effi ciently. Information technologies were presented as the way to make this happen, by fl attening hierarchies and developing networks. A close examination of what the organization was trying to achieve would lead to questions

about whether goals were appropriate and whether structures could meet

the goals. The idea seemed so attractive that Al Gore sought to re-engineer

government while he served as vice president.

The underlying assumption of BPR, as with agency theory, was that an

organization could be disaggregated as if it was a piece of machinery into a

series of component parts, to be evaluated both individually and in relation

to each other. It could then be put back together in an altered and hope-

fully improved form, with some elements discarded altogether and new ones

added where necessary, to produce a new organization that would work far

more effectively. Once an organization was viewed in these terms, there was

no need for incrementalism. It should be possible to start from scratch and

rethink the whole organization.

Re-engineering is about beginning again with a clean sheet of paper.

It is about rejecting the conventional wisdom and received assump-

tions of the past. Re-engineering is about inventing new approaches to

process structure that bear little or no resemblance to those of previous

eras. [^17]

Thus, the history of an organization could be ignored and its old culture

replaced with a brand new one. Workers would be indifferent and docile, or

possibly even enthused by this process. 18

532

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

At one level, BPR appeared strategic because it was demanding a fundamental reappraisal of businesses. But the main driver was not an assessment

of competitive risks and possibilities or even internal barriers to progress but rather the potential impact of new technologies on effi ciency. In this respect there were parallels with the coincident “revolution in military affairs.”

There was the same claim that this was the start of a new historical epoch, the same expectation that affairs would be shaped by the available methodologies

rather than the competitive challenge, the same presumption that technol-

ogy would drive and everything else would follow, and the same tendency to

take the underlying strategy for granted, assuming that opponents/competi-

tors would accept the same path rather than starting with the strategy and

working out what processes were required.

Michael Hammer, one of the fi gures most associated with BPR, pro-

vided the transformational tone when he explained the idea in the _Harvard_ _Business Review_ : “Rather than embedding outdated processes in silicon and software, we should obliterate them and start over. We should . . . use the

power of modern information technology to radically redesign our busi-

ness processes in order to achieve dramatic improvements in their perfor-

mance.” [^19] Hammer teamed up with James Champy, chairman of CSC Index, Inc., a consulting fi rm that specialized in implementing re-engineering

projects. [^20] Their 1993 book, _Reengineering the Corporation_ , sold nearly two million copies. The rise of the concept was startling. Prior to 1992, the

term “re-engineering” was barely mentioned in the business press; after

that it was hard to escape it. [^21] A survey in 1994 found that 78 percent of the _Fortune_ 500 Companies and 60 percent of a broader sample of 2,200

U.S. companies were engaged in some form of re-engineering, with sev-

eral projects apiece on average. 22 Initial reports were also positive about

success rates. Consulting revenues from re-engineering were an estimated

$2.5 billion by 1995. While Champy expanded CSC Index’s revenues from

$30 million in 1988 to $150 million in 1993, Hammer gave seminars and

speeches for high fees. _Fortune_ magazine described him as “re-engineering’s John the Baptist, a tub-thumping preacher who doesn’t perform miracles

himself but, through speeches and writings, prepares the way for consul-

tants and companies that do.” 23

There were both practical and rhetorical reasons for the success of the

concept. At a time of tumult and uncertainty for industry, Champy and

Hammer were able to play on the fear of being left behind, captured by

Peter Drucker’s endorsement on the cover of their book: “Reengineering

is new, and it must be done.” Hammer, in particular, pushed forward the

message that however tough and brutal it all might be, the alternative was

r e d q u e e n s a n d b l u e o c e a n s

533

so much worse: “The choice is survival: it’s between redundancies of 50 per cent or 100 per cent.” Senior managers must hold their nerve: “Companies

that unfurl the banner and march into battle without collapsing job titles,

changing the compensation policy and instilling new attitudes and values

get lost in the swamp.” The anxiety generated by such language could be

used to press forward: “You must play on the two basic emotions: fear and

greed. You must frighten them by demonstrating the serious shortcomings

of the current processes, spelling out how drastically these defective pro-

cesses are hurting the organization.” 24]]

BPR began as a set of techniques. It was soon elevated into the founda-

tion of a transformational moment. So while Hammer claimed that “just as

the Industrial Revolution drew peasants into the urban factories and created

the new social classes of workers and managers, so will the Reengineering

Revolution profoundly rearrange the way people conceive of themselves,

their work, their place in society.” 25 Champy took this revolutionary theme a]]

step further by arguing: “We are in the grip of the second managerial revolu-

tion, one that’s very different from the fi rst. The fi rst was about a transfer of power. This one is about an access of freedom. Slowly, or suddenly, corporate managers all over the world are learning that free enterprise these days really is free.” 26 Speaking of the virtues of “radical change,” Champy described to]]

managers the “secret satisfaction” of learning to do “what other managers in

your industry thought to be impossible.” They would not only “thrive” but

would also “literally redefi ne the industry.” 27]]

Thomas Davenport, who had been director of research at the Boston-

based Index Group, which was eventually turned into the CSC Index, was

one of those closely associated with the development of the original con-

cept. He later described how a “modest idea had become a monster” as it

created a “Reengineering Industrial Complex.” This was an “iron triangle

of powerful interest groups: top managers at big companies, big-time man-

agement consultants, and big-league information technology vendors.” It

suited them all to make BPR appear not only essential in theory but suc-

cessful in practice. The result was that specifi c projects were “repackaged

as reengineering success stories.” Managers found that they could get proj-

ects approved if they used the BPR label, while consultants repackaged

what they had to offer as BPR specialists, discarding the previous set of

buzzwords.

Continuous improvement, systems analysis, industrial engineer-

ing, cycle time reduction—they all became versions of reengineer-

ing. A feeding frenzy was under way. Major consulting fi rms could

534

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

routinely bill clients at $1 million per month, and keep their strategists, operations experts, and system developers busy for years.

As companies made layoffs, these too were rebranded as “reengineering.”

Whatever the actual relationship, staff reductions “gave reengineering a

strategic rationale and a fi nancial justifi cation.” Meanwhile the computing industry also had a stake in BPR as it encouraged large expenditure on hardware, software, and communications products.

It did not take too long for the bubble to burst. Too many claims had been

made, too much money had been spent, and too much resistance was grow-

ing—largely because of the association of re-engineering with layoffs—and

it had all been accompanied, according to Davenport, by too much “hype.”

“The Reengineering Revolution” took potentially valuable innovation and

experimentation but added exaggerated promise and heightened expectation

leading to “faddishness and failure.” The “time to trumpet change programs

is after results are safely in the can.” Most seriously, the fad treated people as if they were “just so many bits and bytes, interchangable parts to be reengineered.” Dictums such as “Carry the wounded but shoot the stragglers” were

hardly motivating, while young consultants with infl ated salaries and even

higher billing charges treated veteran employees with disdain. Whether or

not this was a moment of historic change, employees were naturally inclined

to think about protecting their own positions rather than enthuse about

broad and expansive visions for the future of the company that could leave

them without a job.

By 1994, the CSC Index “State of Reengineering Report” indicated that

half the participating companies were reporting fear and anxiety, which was

not surprising as almost three quarters of the companies were seeking to

eliminate about a fi fth of their jobs, on average. Of the re-engineering initiatives completed, “67% were judged as producing mediocre, marginal, or

failed results.” As was often the fate of the examples cited in the bestselling management books, companies hailed as champions of BPR were discovered

to have either gotten into serious trouble or abandoned the idea. The CSC

Index itself was in jeopardy. Its credibility was not helped by revelations in _Business Week_ describing an intricate scheme to promote what Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema, two of the CSC Index’s consultants, hoped to be the next

big book in the fi eld, _The Discipline of Market Leaders_ . The aim was to get it on the _New York Times_ bestseller list. It was alleged (though denied) that employees of CSC Index had spent at least $250,000 purchasing more than

ten thousand copies of the book, with yet more copies being bought by the

company. The basis of the investment lay in the fees that were expected to

r e d q u e e n s a n d b l u e o c e a n s

535

come back to the company and consultants through their association with the “next big thing.” Treacy was giving some eighty speeches a year, and

his fee had jumped up to $30,000 per talk from $25,000. The importance

of these books was further illustrated by reports that they were ghostwrit-

ten to ensure maximum effect. The allegations backfi red on CSC Index. The

_New York Times_ re-jigged its bestseller list and also took a contract away from CSC Index. The next year Champy, whose book _Re-Engineering Management_

was also implicated in the scandal, left the company. The fi rm, which had six hundred consultants at its peak, was liquidated in 1999. Its rise and fall was a symptom of a business that had become dependent upon staying ahead of

the latest fashion. 28

_Escaping Competition_

Was it the case that the road to success meant emulating the methods of

those who were already successful? Precisely because their techniques were

well known it was likely that following them would result in diminishing

returns. Like the military concern with the operational art, it offered little by itself if put in the service of a fl awed strategy. This was why Michael Porter questioned whether Japanese fi rms had any strategy at all—at least as he

understood the term, that is, as a means to a unique competitive position.

The Japanese advance during the 1970s and 1980s, he argued, was not the

result of superior strategy but of superior operations. The Japanese managed

to combine lower cost and superior quality and then imitated each other. But

that approach, he noted, was bound to be subject to diminishing marginal

returns as it became harder to squeeze more productivity out of existing fac-

tories and others caught up by improving the effi ciency of their operations.

Cutting costs and product improvements could be easily emulated and so

left the relative competitive position unchanged. In fact, “hypercompetition”

left everyone worse off (except perhaps the consumers). For Porter, a sustainable position required relating the company to its competitive environment.

Outperformance required a difference that could be preserved. 29

The problems facing companies trying to maintain a competitive advan-

tage when everyone was trying to improve along the same metric was

described as the “Red Queen effect.” It was named after the line in _Alice_ _Through the Looking Glass_ with which this chapter opened. This was originally the name of a hypothesis used by evolutionary biologists to describe

an arms race between predators and prey, a zero-sum game between species,

none of which could ever win. 30]] In the business context, it tended to be used 536

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

as more of a race between similar entities. So, for example, early and striking gains might be made by saving time on standard processes, but soon others

would catch up and gains would become increasingly marginal. The compar-

ison was with a war of attrition. By focusing solely on operational effectiveness the result would be mutual destruction, until somehow the competition

was stopped, often by means of consolidation through mergers. 31]]

If the main arena was full of increasingly worn and wan warriors des-

perately trying to land blows on equally exhausted competitors as they dis-

missed the walking wounded and tripped over company corpses, then the

logic was to fi nd a less crowded, less competitive, and much more profi table place. The history of business after all was one of the rise and fall of whole sectors and of companies within them. It was an arena marked by instability.

Of the original S&P 500 companies in 1957, for example, only seventy-four were still on the list thirty years later. Much management strategy literature was addressed to those in charge of existing companies, whereas in practice

the most important innovations often came with new companies, which grew

with new products. As noted by W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne, there

were “no permanently excellent companies, just like there are no perma-

nently excellent industries.” For this reason they argued that the hopeless

fi rms were likely to be those competing without end in the “red oceans”

instead of moving out to the blue oceans where they might “create new mar-

ket space that is uncontested.” Those who failed to do so would go the way

of many past companies and simply disappear or be swallowed up. They

argued that the “strategic move” should be the unit of analysis rather than

the company although they did not suggest that blue oceans were only found

by new companies.

Kim and Mauborgne contrasted business with military strategy. The mil-

itary was bound to focus in a fi ght “over a given piece of land that is both limited and constant,” while in the case of industry the “market universe” was

never constant. Confusing their metaphors somewhat, they therefore argued

that accepting red oceans meant accepting “the key constraining factors of

war,” which were “limited terrain and the need to beat an enemy to suc-

ceed,” while failing to capitalize on the special advantage the business world

offered of being able to “create new market space that is uncontested.” 32]] If their theory really depended on this idea of military strategy as being solely about battle, then it was off to a poor start. We have charted in this book

how the desire to avoid battle except on the most favorable terms animated

much military strategy. There was also a similar impulse at work here, the

belief that the unimaginative plodders would stick with the most simplistic

formulas, creating opportunities for the bold and the visionary to gain the

r e d q u e e n s a n d b l u e o c e a n s

537

advantage. Though Kim and Mauborgne acknowledged that red oceans were sometimes unavoidable, and that even blue oceans might eventually turn

red, they made it clear that they found red ocean strategy fundamentally

uninteresting. And here they fell exactly in line with the tradition in military strategy that sought to escape the brutal logic of battle and urged the application of superior intelligence to achieve political objectives while avoiding slaughter. There was the same infatuation with dichotomy, as if the choice

was always to go one way or the other—direct/indirect, annihilation/exhaus-

tion, attrition/maneuver, red ocean/blue ocean.

It was rarely denied that the orthodox route might at times have to be

followed, but there was normally a clear implication that this could never

satisfy the truly creative. As with so much writing on military strategy, the best way was illustrated by examples of success from companies that had

transformed themselves and their industries, whether through meticulous

plan, an empowered workforce, lateral thinking, bold re-engineering, or

innovative design. The failures tended to be those who had stuck with ortho-

doxy, drifted in complacency, or moved from one crisis to another without

ever getting a grip.

In an appendix to their book, Kim and Mauborgne developed a more ana-

lytical distinction between the red and blue oceans, now described as structuralist and the reconstructionist strategies. The structuralist approach derived from industrial organization theory, with Porter its most famous proponent.

It was “environmentally determinist” because it took the market structure as

given and thus posed the strategic challenge of competing for a known cus-

tomer base. To succeed meant addressing the supply side. This meant doing

whatever competitors did but better, relying on either differentiation or low cost. Suffi cient resources might result in a form of victory, but the competition was essentially redistributive in that the share gained by one would

be lost by another, which led to an attritional logic. The theory assumed

exogenous limits. By contrast, the reconstructionist approach was derived

from endogenous growth theory, which claimed that the ideas and actions of

individual players could change the economic and industrial landscape. Such

a strategy would suit an organization with an innovative bent and sensitivity to the risks of missing future opportunities. This addressed the demand side

by using innovative techniques to create new markets. Those following a

reconstructionist strategy would not be bound by the existing boundaries of

the market. Such boundaries existed “only in managers’ minds,” so with an

imaginative leap new markets might be identifi ed. A new market space could

be created through a deliberate effort. The wealth was new, and need not be

taken from a competitor. 33]]

538

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

In a later article, Kim and Mauborgne developed the distinction further, identifying the importance of not only a value proposition that would attract buyers but also a profi t proposition so that money could be made, and lastly a people proposition to motivate those within the organization to work for

or with the company. From this they defi ned strategy as “the development

and alignment of the three propositions to either exploit or reconstruct the

industrial and economic environment in which an organization operates.”

If these propositions were out of alignment—a great value proposition but

no way of making a profi t or a demotivated staff—then the result would

be failure. Only at the top of the organization, with a senior executive able to take a holistic view, could the propositions be developed. On this basis

they argued that “strategy can shape structure.” The title marked the shift

from Chandler, whose formulation was about the effect of strategy on inter-

nal organization, to the new quest to use strategy to change the external

environment. [^34]

This takes us back to Ansoff’s distinction between strategy as a relation-

ship to the environment and strategy as decision-making with imperfect

information. The broad thrust of business strategy came under the fi rst heading. The second more campaigning form of strategy, which dominated the

military literature, was put in a more subordinate position, a challenge of

implementation. Porter argued that the environment shaped and limited a

business’s strategic options; Kim and Mauborgne claimed that these limits

could be transcended through imagination and innovation. Porter claimed

that the competition could be beaten by either differentiation or price; Kim

and Mauborgne claimed that it was better still to develop products in areas

where there was no competition, but they then had to develop a business case

and have the staff to make it work.

This view of strategy as a general orientation toward the environment

offered a framework for evaluating all other endeavors within the organiza-

tion. Strategy of this sort had to be long term, and it might have the elements of a plan, with an anticipated sequence of events geared to an ultimate goal.

The strategy could be much looser than that, however, setting out a num-

ber of goals with some sense of priorities, available resources, and preferred means, maintaining considerable fl exibility to allow for changing circumstances. How well either approach would work would depend on the nature

of the environment. The more stable the less the freedom to maneuver and so

less scope for a strategy of any sort other than one of internal adaption. Even a reconstructionist strategy would still be affected by responses from potential competitors who might appreciate what was going on or other actors who

might be able to infl uence the demand for new products.

r e d q u e e n s a n d b l u e o c e a n s

539

Such theories still lacked a formulation as compelling as Clausewitz’s portrayal of the dynamic interaction of politics, violence, and chance. There was not even a concept comparable to Clausewitz’s friction, although executives were always likely to experience their own versions of the fog of war.

There were few incentives to dwell on such matters in a literature increas-

ingly infused with promotions of particular strategic nostrums as the author’s unique product. The promise was of success following a true interpretation

of these nostrums according to circumstances, and the will to see it through.

The tendency therefore was to play down the unforeseeable factors that could

frustrate the best laid plans, whether a rogue calculation in product design, a misjudged advertisement, sudden fl uctuations in exchange rates, or a terrible accident. Moments could arise in business as in politics when long-term aspirations had to be put to one side in a desperate struggle for survival,

as a reliable market evaporated or development process failed to deliver or

debts were called in. At such moments, priorities would need to be clarifi ed, help sought wherever it could be found, and exceptional demands made of

the organization. Other types of events might require no more than mid-

course corrections or a reappraisal of one element of the overall approach.

Knowledge of a coming event—such as a presentation to investors, a product

launch, or a meeting with customers—could raise issues that had hitherto

been neglected or illuminate aspects of the changing environment that had

been missed before.

The infl uence of equilibrium models from classical economics on business

strategy remained strong, while alternative concepts of non-linearity, chaos, and complex adaptive systems, though picked up by military strategists,

were less in evidence. An article by Eric Beinhocker pointed to the challenge.

An open system constantly in fl ux, shaped and reshaped by many agents

acting independently, could seem more relevant to companies than a closed

system tending to equilibrium. For example, a characteristic of complex

adaptive systems was described as “punctuated equilibrium,” referring to

when times of relative calm and stability are interrupted by stormy restruc-

turing periods. At such time, those whose strategies and skills were geared

to the stable periods risked sudden obsolescence. Those who survived were

likely to have prepared to adapt even if they could not be sure what adapta-

tions would be required. Strategy, therefore, could not be based on a “focused line of attack—a clear statement of where, how and when to compete,” but

instead on preparations to perform well in a variety of future environments.

Small organizations with relatively few parts were unlikely to adapt as well

as those with more parts and a larger repertoire of responses to new situa-

tions, but after a certain point the capacity to adapt would fall off as response 540

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

times shortened. There was a new balance to be struck, between complete resistance to change on the one hand and oversensitivity to shifts in the environment on the other, between stasis and chaos. [^35]

A strategy could never really be considered a settled product, a fi xed ref-

erence point for all decision-making, but rather a continuing activity, with

important moments of decision. Such moments could not settle matters once

and for all but provided the basis for moving on until the next decision. In

this respect, strategy was the basis for getting from one state of affairs to another, hopefully better, state of affairs. Economic models might fi nd ways of describing this dynamic but were less helpful when it came to guidance

on how to cope.

The Sociological Challenge

_I learned a great deal about military history and Confucian metaphors._

_But the only practical advice that we were given was that every company_

_should send teams of people from different disciplines to country hotels_

_every year to think about the future._

—Participant in a fi fteen-part course on business strategy given

by a leading name in the fi eld, quoted by John Micklethwait

and Adrian Wooldridge.

We now need to follow the second strand in management schol-

arship, drawn more from sociology than economics, which was

inclined from the start to consider human beings as social actors and orga-

nizations as bundles of social relationships. Although this strand had a separate course, there were overlaps with the economic strand in the challenge

to managerialism and in the propensity to follow fashion. It was infl uenced

by the counterculture of the 1960s in two respects. The fi rst was distaste for bureaucratic rigidity and hierarchy. This challenged the processes of rationalization and bureaucratization, arguing that a new and more enriching

form of organization needed to be devised. The second was the infl uence of

postmodernism, not only in the critique of the modernist forms of rational-

ist bureaucracy but also in offering a completely new way of considering

human affairs.

The critical anti-managerialist literature of the 1950s presented a monolithic, homogenized dystopian vision, only one step short of George Orwell’s

_1984_ . The elites of large corporations were described as presiding over armies of white-collar workers, formed in their own bland—and obedient—image.

During the 1960s and 1970s, however, demographic trends and lifestyle

choices worked against conformity. The new businesses based on information

and communication technologies often seemed to celebrate relaxed workplace

practices and freethinking rather than crude hierarchy. Moreover there was a

better anthropological understanding of organizations, the complex social formations that developed within and between individual units, and the incen-

tives for individuals to develop practices that satisfi ed their needs as much as those of the organization for which they were supposed to be working.

The human relations school provided the foundations for this work, but it

moved on after the war and turned into a rich fi eld of organizational studies.

Once organizations began to be viewed as social systems in their own right

rather than as means to some management goal, questions arose not only about

how this insight could lead to greater effi ciency—which had been the concern of Elton Mayo and Chester Barnard—but how organizations could be arranged

to make for a more fulfi lling life for the workforce. This also fi t in with a trend for individual pathologies to be explained by reference to their social settings. Structures that encouraged harmony, solidarity, and support should also therefore promote general well-being. An example of this was the book by the

infl uential British social psychologist, James Brown, who after his experiences in the army and industry had concluded that mental illness was more of a social than a biological problem. He argued that organizations should be judged by

their social as much as their technical and economic effi ciency. [^1]

Douglas McGregor’s _The Human Side of Enterprise_ opened with the question, “What are your assumptions (implicit as well explicit) about the most

effective way to manage people?” 2]] He offered two alternative theories. Under Theory X, which had developed with the factory shop fl oor, the presumption was that people disliked work and preferred direction rather than initiative, and so they must be controlled by means of threats and rewards. Under

Theory Y, individuals wished for fulfi llment and responsibility, and if offered the chance, they would commit themselves more thoroughly to the organization. He developed these ideas while on the staff at MIT and then had a

chance to put them into practice as president of Antioch College. While he

found support for his theory, the experience of coping with fractious students and faculty convinced him of the need for active leadership. He had believed, he later recalled, “that a leader could operate successfully as a kind of adviser to his organization. I thought I could avoid being a ‘boss’ . . . I hoped to duck t h e s o c i o l o g i c a l c h a l l e n g e

543

the unpleasant necessity of making diffi cult decisions . . . I fi nally began to realize that a leader cannot avoid the exercise of authority any more than he can avoid responsibility for what happens to his organization.” [^3] He did not, however, reject his more humanistic approach to management or embrace

authoritarianism. While critics might have worried that the dichotomy

between Theory X and Theory Y was too sharp, and that actual practice

would be contingent on circumstances, McGregor appeared as a champion

of consent against coercion, the democratic against the autocratic, the active against the passive.

Herbert Simon’s ideas of bounded rationality encouraged a realistic assess-

ment of how managers actually went about their business. 4]] Another organizational psychologist, Karl Weick, challenged standard models in his book

_The Social Psychology of Organizing_ by demonstrating how uncoordinated and apparently chaotic systems could nonetheless prove adaptable when faced

with the unexpected—more so than systems geared to assumptions of linear-

ity. Weick drew on a range of disciplines, and introduced into the lexicon concepts such as “loose-coupling” (a distance and lack of responsiveness between individual parts of an organization created a form of adaptability), “enactment” (how structures and events are brought into existence by individual

actions), and “sensemaking” (the processes by which people give meaning to

experiences). Sensemaking was necessary because individuals must operate in

inherently uncertain and unpredictable environments (“equivocality”). There

were a variety of ways individuals could make sense of things, and his work

focused on the different forms communication could take within an organiza-

tion, notably in the face of external shocks. Weick’s theories were, however, complex and did not offer the easiest read. His defi nition of an organization, for example, was “the resolving of equivocality in an enacted environment by

means of interlocked behaviors in conditionally related processes.” 5

_Business Revolutionaries_

The idea that management should focus on the softer side of organiza-

tional life came to be developed and promoted by two McKinsey analysts,

Tom Peters and Robert Waterman. The starting point was the pressure felt

[c h a p t e r 3 5](index_split_000.html#p9)

Deliberate or Emergent

_If many remedies are prescribed for an illness, you may be certain that the_ _illness has no cure._

—Anton Chekhov, _The Cherry Orchard_

The question of whether senior management really could give a busi-

ness strategic direction was turned into one of the more infl uential

dichotomies in the fi eld, that between deliberate or emergent strategies.

Henry Mintzberg, who was responsible for the most sustained challenge to

the so-called design model of strategy, stressed the possibility of a continuing, intelligent learning response to a changing environment. In a seminal

article with James Waters, Mintzberg urged that instead of considering strat-

egy as a single product, handed over to others for implementation, it should

be understood as a “pattern in a stream of decisions.” On this basis they distinguished between “intended” and “realized” strategy. If what was realized

was intended then this was “deliberate”; patterns that were realized despite

of or in the absence of intentions were “emergent.”

A deliberate strategy depended on the intentions disseminated in an orga-

nization being precise, so there could be no doubt about what was desired, and realizable. There could be no interference from any external force, whether

the market, politics, or technology. Such a totally benign environment, or at least one where the problems could be anticipated and controlled, would be

a “tall order.” By contrast, a perfectly emergent strategy would demonstrate

consistency in action in the absence of intention. While a total absence of intention was hard to imagine, the reference was to the idea of the environment imposing a pattern of decision, as if notional decision-takers could not help themselves in the face of the structural constraints and imperatives they faced. Innumerable small decisions taken throughout the organization could

move it to an unanticipated place, to the surprise and possible consterna-

tion of senior management. In practice, the sharp distinction was between a

strategy that involved central direction and control based on an original plan, a model which Mintzberg considered extremely unwise, and one that was

about learning and adaption. 1

The idea of organizations being able to stick to an original plan in the face of uncertainty was easy enough to challenge. In some respect, all strategies

were bound to be emergent. There was always a previous history, which had

shaped the original plan, and even a strategy that had emerged and seemed

to be working would at some point have to be addressed, if only because a

particular goal had been reached. Mintzberg’s main point therefore was about

the need for the organization and its leadership to keep on learning. Just

like the m ē tis of ancient Greece, this learning, fl exibility, and responsiveness would be particularly important when an environment was “too unstable or

complex to comprehend, or too imposing to defy.” It was likely to require a

degree of experimentation, or surrendering some control to those closest to

situations who had the best information to develop realistic strategies. This was not to deny the importance of managers at times imposing their intentions and providing a sense of direction.

Mintzberg’s careful conclusion was that “strategy formation walks on two

feet, one deliberate, the other emergent.” His heart, however, was clearly

with the emergent, perhaps because it required more of the organization and

was a surer test of its structures. An organization capable of benefi ting from the experiences and insights of all its members should be in better shape

than one where all the running had to be made by senior management. After

the 2008 fi nancial crisis, he bemoaned the consequences of “the deprecia-

tion in companies of community—people’s sense of belonging to and caring

for something larger than themselves.” Human beings were social animals

who could not “function effectively without a social system that is larger

than ourselves.” Communities were “the social glue that binds us together

for the greater good.” Admired companies managed to create this sense of

community, and to this end he cited an article by the president of Pixar (an

animated fi lm production company) who attributed his studio’s success to its

“vibrant community where talented people are loyal to one another and their

collective work, everyone feels that they are part of something extraordinary, d e l i b e r a t e o r e m e r g e n t

555

and their passion and accomplishments make the community a magnet for talented people coming out of schools or working at other places.” [^2] Instead of the celebrated form of heroic egocentric leadership, an alternative sort

was needed that was “personally engaged in order to engage others, so that

anyone and everyone can exercise initiative.” This required shedding “indi-

vidualist behavior and many of its short-term measures in favor of practices

that promote trust, engagement, and spontaneous collaboration aimed at

sustainability.” [^3]

_Learning Organizations_

Mintzberg was by no means unique in celebrating “learning organizations.”

One justifi cation was organizational effi ciency: those with a commitment

to knowledge, mechanisms for renewal, and openness to the outside world

should perform more effectively. Another was that organizational life should

be an uplifting social and collective experience, “a group of people working

together to collectively enhance their capacities to create results that they

truly care about.” 4 As individuals did the learning, a fi]] rm which aspired to be a learning organization “must teach its employees how to learn, and it

must reward them for success in learning.” 5 These twin objectives refl]] ected the ambition of the human relations school. If work became a positive experience, a source of personal fulfi llment, it could serve the organization by also serving the individual, marrying humanism with bureaucratic effi ciency.

This was refl ected in the rhetoric of Peters and Hamel. Charles Handy, a

British management consultant and another enthusiast for this approach,

described a learning organization as being about “curiosity, forgiveness,

trust, togetherness.” 6

One book took these ideas to the extreme, advocating _Strategy without_

_Design_ . Rational, deliberate, strategy-making directed at specifi c goals was naïve, failing to grasp how actions refl ected “invisible historical and cultural forces,” unaware of the impossibility of comprehending the whole or the foolishness of attempts to move entities around like chessboard pieces (the favorite image from the master strategist). In practice there were “too many contingencies, too many alternative limits, too many system infl uences, and the

pursuit is too debilitating, for such an intellectualized picture ever to emerge fully.” 7 By contrast Chia and Holt, acknowledging Liddell Hart, pointed to]]

the “surprising effi cacy of indirect action.” Action that is “oblique or deemed peripheral in relation to specifi c ends can often produce more dramatic and

lasting effects than direct, focused action.” 8 This alternative strategy was not

556

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

only unintelligible but also discussed without reference to power, deal-making, coercion, or coalition construction. The result was a postmodern version of Tolstoy, with barely perceptible everyday gestures moving big organizations in ways that nobody intended but could still come out right at the end.

Rather than success being attributed to “the pre-existence of a deliberately

planned strategy,” it could be “traced indirectly as the cumulative effect of a whole plethora of coping actions initiated by a multitude of individuals,

all seeking merely to respond constructively to the predicaments they fi nd

themselves in.” The wise strategist was advised to avoid the temptation to

control and to go with the organizational fl ow. Chia and Holt called this

“strategic blandness,” involving a “will-o’-the-wisp endurance that invites

no opposition and assumes no domination; it exists only in the plenitude of

as yet unrealized possibilities.” The aim should be “to shy away from once

fervid ambition and stringently held commitments and, instead, nurture a

curiosity whose meandering enquiry moves through infatuation, temperance

and indifference with equal passion.” 9 As “sensemaking,” this left a lot to]]

be desired. It was also some distance away from the more prosaic reality of

organizational life for most people most of the time.

_Management as Domination_

Theories of strategy that lacked a theory of power were bound to mislead.

With enthusiasm for organizations as learning and mutually supportive

communities could come reluctance to address issues of power. If anything,

organizational politics was deplored for its disruptive effects. Power plays

by individuals promoting their own careers or just their pet projects gener-

ated bad feeling. This could be detrimental to overall effi ciency as well as to morale. Power certainly could become an end in itself, a source of status and opportunities to boss others around. Nonetheless, it was also the case that

without power it was hard to move organizations toward particular goals and

little of value might be accomplished. With a grasp of power, bad decisions

might be implemented too rigorously, but without such a grasp potentially

good decisions might not be quite taken or followed through. Power struc-

tures within organizations, even more so than in states, would depend on

personalities and culture, on social contacts as well as personnel contracts, on the reputation of particular units, and on the way budgets were put together

and expenditures monitored. Addressing issues of power was not a strategy in

itself but an unavoidable part of strategy. It meant considering how decisions might best be formed and implemented.

d e l i b e r a t e o r e m e r g e n t

557

Jeffrey Pfeffer, one of the rare writers on organizations to make power his main focus, largely advised on the sources and exercise of power, emphasizing the importance of understanding the main players who need to be brought on

board, acquiring positions on key committees, exercising a role over budgets

and promotions, gaining allies and supporters, and learning how to frame

issues to best advantage. 10 A]] later book provided guidance on how to succeed with power in organizations, including advice to beware of the leadership

literature, with its “prescriptions about following an inner compass, being

truthful, letting inner feelings show, being modest and self-effacing, not

behaving in a bullying or abusive way,” which explained how people wished

the world to be rather than how it was. 11

Critics of the more optimistic views of management picked up on their

naïveté about power. Helen Armstrong described the “learning organization”

as a “Machiavellian subterfuge” to encourage workers in their own exploita-

tion. The “prevalence of insecure job markets, contract and part-time work,

outsourcing and downsizing is hardly conducive to feelings of empowerment

for most workers.” 12]] Even when there was evidence of shared meanings and values these were most likely to refl ect the perspectives of senior management. What might be thought of as a benign culture could appear in a dif-

ferent light as a hegemonic project. Issues of power and ideology could not

be avoided. 13

This view formed part of a critical theory, infl uenced by postmodern-

ism, that considered corporate strategy a natural target because it presented itself as a very modernist project, seeking to manipulate causes to achieve

defi ned effects in a rational way. On this basis, strategy was an example of thinking that concealed more than it revealed in order to support established power structures. Individuals and what they said and did could not

be understood outside of their social context, which was in turn reshaped

by what they said and did. In one Foucault-inspired critique, refl ecting

a postmodern insurgency in British management schools, David Knights

and Glenn Morgan challenged the idea of strategy as a set of rational tech-

niques for managing complex businesses in a changing environment and

instead proposed “focusing upon corporate strategy as a set of discourses

and practices which transform managers and employees alike into subjects

who secure their sense of purpose and reality by formulating, evaluating

and conducting strategy.” [^14]

In this strategy was not a general approach to the problems of man-

agement but a specifi c corporate ideology. Thus they asked: “If strategy is so important, how did business manage to survive so long without ‘consciously’ having a concept of strategy?” Somewhat oddly, given Foucault’s

558

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

own extensive references to strategy, they criticized early writers, such as Chandler, for imputing “strategic intent to the business world as if it existed prior to practitioners having subscribed explicitly to the discipline of strategy.” The crime, apparently, was for the academic to act as legislator, tell-

ing people what they really meant in a way which might be quite different

from the actors’ “own discursive understanding of their actions.” This meant

neglecting the interesting question of what people actually meant when they

talked about strategy or whatever other descriptor they used for activity that an observer might consider to be strategic. Knights and Morgan argued that

strategy only became important as the corporation had to explain what it was

doing and why to internal and external audiences. It was about legitimiz-

ing the elite as much as deciding upon a course of action. The “discourse

of corporate strategy” constituted “a fi eld of knowledge and power which

defi nes what the ‘real problems’ are within organizations and the parameters of the ‘real solutions’ to them.” It was a “technology of power,” enabling

some actors while disabling others, and a source of “the problems it professes to resolve.” As such it might have been challenged by alternative discourses, for example, refl ecting more instinctive and or less hierarchical approaches or else the indifference and cynicism prompted by top-down pronouncements.

For the discourse of strategic management to have become so embedded was

a “triumph.” It sustained and enhanced the prerogatives of management and

gave them a sense of security, legitimized their exercise of power, identi-

fi ed those able to contribute to their discourse, and rationalized success and failure.

Stewart Clegg, Chris Carter, and Martin Kornberger, also representing the

critical strand in British management theory, took this theme further. They

argued that strategy of this type, especially in its manifestation as a corporate strategic plan, could be represented in Cartesian terms as an intelligent mind attempting to lead a dumb and submissive body or as a Nietzschean “will

to power,” an attempt to control, predict, and dominate the future. 15]] This effort was, however, doomed. Strategic plans were often management fantasies, far exceeding organizational capabilities, with goals defi ned as if the future could be predicted. The effort was bound to fail because of the inevitable gaps between planning and implementation, means and ends, manage-

ment and organization, order and disorder. Instead of managing these gaps,

strategic planning actively generated and sustained them. The practice of

strategic planning created “a system of divisions that constantly undermines

and subverts the order that the strategic plan proposes.” It created an illu-

sion of “an ordered and cosy realm, as a controllable inside, confronting a

more or less chaotic outside, an exterior that constantly threatens its survival.

d e l i b e r a t e o r e m e r g e n t

559

Strategic planning reinforces and deepens this gap: it ignores the complexities and potentialities of ‘disorganization.’ ”

This critique was directed at something of a straw man. Possibly in

earlier decades senior managers had really believed in such an orderly and

controllable interior world, and had been sustained in this belief by this

comforting and ambitious ideology, manifested in a detailed plan, based

on ultra-rationalist assumptions, passed down through the hierarchy, and

prescribing behavior on almost Taylorist lines. In terms of the grip of eco-

nomic theory on business schools, the idea that real businesses might try to

work this way was not wholly preposterous. It lingered on, in a mild form,

with “the balanced scorecard.” Actual management practice, however, sug-

gested a much greater sense of insecurity and uncertainty. Management

strategy had become a much more capacious umbrella, including a range

of approaches. Some managers might approximate to this caricature but

others would be seeking to draw staff into decision-making and were well

aware of the distorting effects of attempts at detailed plans with fi xed

targets.

_Fads and Fashions_

Mintzberg et al’s infl uential _Strategy Safari_ identifi ed ten different approaches to the challenge of strategy. Elsewhere the concern was that the disagreements had become so numerous and “fractious” that “scholars despaired that

[they] could not even come up with a logically coherent defi nition of the

fi eld.” [^16] Another described strategy as being in a “pre-paradigmatic state.” [^17]

Yet another saw the source of confusion as a multiplicity of strategies rather than a single paradigm. The word _strategy_ was being attached to every new initiative:

Strategy has become a catchall term used to mean whatever one wants

it to mean. Business magazines now have regular sections devoted

to strategy, typically discussing how featured fi rms are dealing with

distinct issues, such as customer service, joint ventures, branding or

e-commerce. In turn, executives talk about their “service strategy,”

their “joint venture strategy,” their “branding strategy” or whatever

kind of strategy is on their minds at a particular moment. 18

John Kay observed in a skeptical overview that: “Probably the common-

est sense in which the word strategy is employed today is as a synonym for

expensive.” 19

560

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

The proliferation of strategies had been both vertical, in the range of sub-sidiary activities given the label, and horizontal, in the range of both pro-

cedural and substantive prescriptions for relating to the environment. The

1980s and 1990s involved a dizzying sequence of grand ideas, the appearance

of gurus such as Peters and Hamel, and the rise and fall of BPR. As a result, a new fi eld of research developed around the proliferation of management fashions and fads. Their frequency and variety, the surrounding hype, and their

short half-life prompted a degree of wonder at why they were taken at all

seriously. 20 The management consumer was not confronted with a dominant]]

paradigm but instead with cacophony and inconsistency, hints of unique keys

to success that could be accessed by buying the book, attending the seminar,

or—best of all—signing the consultancy contract. The ideas came thick and

fast, tumbling over each other, the banal with the counterintuitive, genu-

ine insights with implausible propositions, telling insights with dubious

generalizations.

There were a variety of explanations for the phenomenon. Gurus helped

the managers make sense of an uncertain world and provided a degree of pre-

dictability. They also offered an external authority to help legitimize what

they were up to. Even the skeptics were anxious that they might be missing

out on something, or that they might be perceived to be ignoring impor-

tant developments. The succession of fads and fashions might have suggested

something cynical and even random, but there was always the possibility of

actual progress, as if some higher stage of management was really at hand. If so, the conscientious manager at least had to pay attention. [^21] Nor was it the case that all products were useless. [^22] Since Drucker fi rst introduced management by objectives, certain techniques had been introduced that might once

have been considered fads but were now considered generally helpful, such

as SWOT analysis, the Boston matrix, or quality circles. Even with BPR

the problem was in excessive radicalism, demanding too much at once and

overstating the benefi ts. After the 1980s, it was the rare company that would not claim to be aspiring to excellence and quality, looking to encourage local initiative. One legacy was the regular insistence that senior managers were

“passionate” about such matters.

The innovations most likely to endure were those that helped senior

executives exert infl uence over the organization. Consider the example of

the “balanced scorecard,” fi rst introduced in a 1992 _Harvard Business Review_ article by Robert Kaplan and David Norton. Financial returns, they argued,

were an inadequate guide to how well a company was doing. A much broader

and also realistic view of performance was required. They understood strat-

egy as being a “set of hypotheses about cause and effect” and proposed that

d e l i b e r a t e o r e m e r g e n t

561

by measuring key effects it should be possible to demonstrate whether or not a strategy was being properly implemented. Goals and appropriate measures should be developed, covering fi nance, the views of customers, internal organization, and the ability to innovate. This assumed that “people will

adopt whatever behaviors and take whatever actions are necessary to arrive at those goals.” The advantages of the balanced scorecard were that it was easy

to understand, staff could be involved in its construction, and it improved

the information available to management. The key performance indicators

(KPIs) would refl ect, however, what could be measured—not necessarily

what was important—and then become ends in themselves. Staff would meet

the goals as measured even if there was no obvious benefi t to the organi-

zation. Managers who relied solely on monitoring the indicators could be

swamped by data that was hard to interpret, fail to understand the complex

interactions between the different measures, and still miss vital signs of dysfunction. 23 W]]ithout being clear on what needs to be done and why, Stephen Bungay pointed out, “the fetishization of the metrics is a near certainty.”

Though the scorecard could be a way of communicating intent, it was still

fundamentally a control system. 24

A study of sixteen management fashions from over fi ve decades suggested

that over time they had become “broader-based but shorter-lived and more

diffi cult for upper management to implement.” 25 When a particular man-]]

agement technique was adopted, few effects on organizational performance

could be discerned. Nonetheless, adoption did infl uence corporate reputa-

tion and even executive pay. The research strengthened “previous arguments

that fi rms do not necessarily choose the technologically best or most effi -

cient techniques but, instead, seek external legitimacy by adopting widely

accepted and approved practices.” 26 Other research suggested that the new

ideas that seemed to catch on were considered to be capturing “the zeitgeist

or ‘spirit of the times.’ ” 27]] An analysis of the conceptual development of the word _strategy_ gathered ninety-one defi nitions for the period from 1962 to 2008. Looking at the way nouns were used, the authors observed an abrupt

drop in _planning_ , a rise and then steady decline in _environment_ , with _competition_ showing a steady increase. While the verb _achieve_ was a constant, over time _formulate_ gave way to _relate_ . 28]]

This interest in the role of fads and fashions in enterprises refl ected awareness that strategy could not be considered as a product, something that in

the form of an input might give direction to an organization or as an output

that might order relations with the external environment, but as a continu-

ing practice, the everyday work of many people (not just those at the top)

within an organization. Strategy was not the property of organizations but

562

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

something that people did. This led to the idea of “strategy as practice.” This was a natural continuation of the work of organizational sociologists and

psychologists, such as Weick, with their interest in the disparate experiences and aspirations of individuals bound together by the demands of employment and developing social forms that were more or less creative or destruc-

tive, both for them and the broader purpose the organization was supposed

to serve. It could bring together the macro-level of the institution with the

micro-level of the individual with guidelines for observational research. 29

One unfortunate consequence of the focus on strategy as practice was to

encourage the use of the verb _strategizing_ , meaning “to do strategy.” It also encouraged the idea that this was a ubiquitous activity, “to the extent that

it is consequential for the strategic outcomes, directions, survival and com-

petitive advantage of the fi rm.” This therefore involved multiple actors at all levels. [^30] Strategy “practitioners,” including managers and consultants, would draw on the established strategic “practices” particular to their organizations, turning these into a specifi c strategic “praxis” as they engaged with others to generate something called strategy, which in turn reshaped the orga-

nizational practices. 31 This challenged the idea of strategy as a deliberate,]]

top-down process that was the purview of senior management. As soon as

questions of implementation came in, it was evident that micro-level deci-

sions could infl uence the macro-level performance. This was at the heart of

the familiar critique of the strategic planning model. That was not the same, however, as organizations effectively being managed from the bottom up.

The decisions of senior managers, for better or worse, more or less infl uenced by what they understood to be the character of organizational practices, were still normally much more signifi cant than those further down the hierarchy

thanks to their reach and the resources at their disposal. Strategy as practice was important when it came to understanding organizations, but so too was

strategy as power.

_Back to the Narrative_

What about strategy as “sensemaking”? If there was one persistent theme it

was the attraction of a good story to help convey the most important points.

This was evident in Taylor’s story of the hard-working Schmidt, Mayo’s of

the Hawthorne experiment, or Barnard’s unemployed in New Jersey. It was

behind the whole reliance on the case study method, underscoring the view

that the best way to understand the challenges of management was to try to

tell a tale around a specifi c set of circumstances. In much of the organizational d e l i b e r a t e o r e m e r g e n t

563

literature, as a methodological contrast to rational actor theory, stories were elevated to a vital source of organizational communication and effectiveness. [^32] This could draw on psychological research which confi rmed their importance as ways of explaining the past but also convincing people about

future courses of action. With businesses no longer run on military lines and employees expecting to be persuaded rather than just instructed, managers

were urged to use stories to help make their case. “Gone are the command-

and-control days of executives managing by decree,” observed Jay Conger

in 1998, for now businesses were run “largely by cross-functional teams of

peers and populated by baby boomers and their Generation Y offspring, who

show little tolerance for unquestioned authority.” 33]] “Stories are the latest fad to have hit the corporate communications industry,” observed columnist

Lucy Kellaway. “Experts everywhere are waking up to the something that

any child could tell them: that a story is easier to listen to and much easier to remember than a dry string of facts and propositions.” [^34]

Stories made it possible to avoid abstractions, reduce complexity, and

make vital points indirectly, stressing the importance of being alert to serendipitous opportunities, discontented staff, or the one small point that might ruin an otherwise brilliant campaign. Stories were to the fore in Weick’s

account of sensemaking, allowing “the clarity achieved in one small area to

be extended to and imposed on an adjacent area that is less orderly.” 35]] Peters and Waterman came to appreciate through successive briefi ngs that their

ideas worked with business audiences as stories but not as charts and dia-

grams. They described how their excellent companies were “unashamed col-

lectors and tellers of stories . . . rich tapestries of anecdote, myth, and fairy tale.” Many business strategy books were essentially collections of stories,

each intended to underline some general point.

Stories could come in all shapes and sizes: innocent and unstructured, as

well as deliberate and purposeful; about technical specifi cations or perhaps the antics of a senior manager; elaborate or barely an anecdote; designed for regular re-telling or heard once and then forgotten; intended for a privileged few, and thus sharp and to the point, or knowingly prepared for multiple

audiences, and so carefully ambiguous. Narratives could be found in min-

utes of meetings, presentations to clients, business plans, and even formulaic forms of analysis: in SWOT, analysis “opportunities” represented the “call,”

whereas “threats” became antagonists. “As strengths are employed and weak-

nesses transformed, the protagonist becomes a hero.”

Eventually academics took notice, infl uenced by the “narrative turn,” so

that stories and storytelling came to be identifi ed not only as essential to effective leadership when formulating and implementing its strategy, but at

564

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

the heart of all communication in an organization, from low-level grumbles and mid-level pep talks up to the high-level visions. Stories were told about senior managers to show how reasonable or out of touch they might be, of

past events to show how the organization was once great or had an endur-

ing culture, of the chance insight that led to an exciting new product or the poor calculation that led to a fl op. By studying stories, the development and reinforcement of institutional cultures could be explored as well as the beliefs and assumptions that underpinned them. In the constant conversations that

made up any organization, this culture could be changed and even subverted,

as individuals on the basis of their own experiences told their own stories that qualifi ed or challenged those of senior management, while senior manage-

ment picked up cues that led them to reappraise key assumptions. 36

The narrative fi eld became a battleground. The political practices that

we discussed in the last section, as parties sought to present themselves in

the best possible light and their opponents in the worst, were evident in

the business world as well. Rockefeller’s control of Standard Oil began to

unravel as the trust’s dubious claims were undermined by a muckraking

journalist. Not surprisingly, one of the greatest storytelling organizations

of recent times, Walt Disney Studios, was adept at fabricating stories about

its own history, “as artfully constructed and as carefully edited as their legendary characters.” Disney was acclaimed for the cartoon characters, such

as Mickey Mouse, and the animation techniques. But this required deny-

ing others the credit they deserved. Disney’s creativity was played up and

his authoritarianism played down. His studios were organized, not at all

uniquely, on Taylorist, paternalistic lines, yet employees were referred to as part of a family, an image that was put under strain as union disputes broke

out in the 1940s. 37 This opened up the basic paradox of stories:]] they might have great explanatory power and be the most natural form of communication, but that could be at the expense of reinforcing explanations that suited those best able to control the means of communication while making it diffi cult to mount a challenge. Even the best and most liberating stories could be wide of the mark or else so ambiguous that the intended message was

lost. The accomplished storyteller might derive an inspirational message

from the mundane, but the inspiration could soon fade should the reality

turn out to be more tedious.

The more academic business strategists tended to use their stories largely

for illustration, selecting cases which made their points without always

asking whether there were comparable cases where the outcomes had been

quite different, or whether the same players would always get the same

results by employing the approved strategic practices in slightly different

d e l i b e r a t e o r e m e r g e n t

565

circumstances. Sometimes the stories were not only selected carefully, but their telling was also highly contrived. We have seen how those of Taylor,

Mayo, and Barnard were embellished. Weick’s favorite story involved an inci-

dent during military maneuvers in Switzerland, when a small unit had got

lost in bitterly cold weather and was feared lost. The unit eventually returned and the young lieutenant in charge was asked how they had made their way

back. Though they had assumed they would die, they had gotten back by

means of a map one of the men had in his pocket by which they were able to

get their bearings. When the map was examined, however, it turned out not

to be a map of the Alps but of the Pyrenees. 38 The strategic lesson was that

with a map the unit calmed down and took action, which led to the conclu-

sion that “when you are lost, any map will do!” 39 But luck would also have

been required, as there are not many routes out of the Alps. Unfortunately,

there was also no way of knowing whether the story was true or not. Weick

received it via the Czech poet Miroslav Holub based on an anecdote told to

him from the Second World War. 40]]

Consider another of Mintzberg’s favorite stories, as narrated by Richard

Pascale, who we last met working for McKinsey’s researching Japanese indus-

trial success. Between 1958 and 1974, the American motorcycle market dou-

bled but the British share shrank from 11 percent to 1 percent. Japan gained

87 percent of the new market, with Honda alone accounting for 43 percent.

Pascale challenged the established explanation for Honda’s successful entry

into the American market in 1959, which stressed issues of price and volume.

A much more intriguing story that highlighted “miscalculation, serendipity,

and organizational learning” had been missed. When Honda sent its market-

ing team to the United States, the intention had been to compete with mid-

sized bikes, but Honda struggled to fi nd dealers and was plagued by technical problems. Then they received inquiries about the small 50cc SuperCubs they

were using for their own transport. So they sold them instead. The moral of

the story, according to Pascale, was that over-rational explanations, assuming that what happened was intended, could result in missing the most important reasons for a marketing success. Rather than a determined, long-term

perspective, he pointed to the ability of an organization to learn from experi-

ence and show agility in the face of unexpected opportunities. 41]] This lesson was picked up enthusiastically by Mintzberg, who referred to it regularly as

he emphasized the importance of emergent strategies. He used it to show

that the managers made every mistake in this case, except to learn when the

market told them they were going wrong. 42 He described Pascale’]]s article as the most infl uential in the management literature. Other writers have developed this “lesson” further to turn it into a story about how lowly employees

566

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

can transform a strategy. Out of this single case study, a series of general propositions were developed about learning organizations.

This was not the only use made of the Honda story. This was one of

the great Japanese success stories, from the company’s formation in 1948 to

becoming the world’s largest manufacturer of motorcycles and an effective

manufacturer of cars by 1964. It fascinated business strategists as a source of lessons for American companies. Andrew Mair warned, however, of the perils

of extracting one episode, often imperfectly understood, and drawing large

conclusions. For example, Honda had always intended to sell the SuperCub

in the United States. This bike made up a quarter of those sent with the

American team. The company had, however, supposed that it would fi rst

have to prove the worth of its bikes against larger models (which is why they put an emphasis on racing). The error was in not realizing that the American

market was actually going to be similar to the Japanese. At any rate, sales

collapsed in the late 1960s, and then Honda did have to rely on the larger

bikes it had always expected would be the key to its American success. In

practice, Honda’s strategy followed the experience already successfully fol-

lowed in Japan—it was not a leap in the dark. 43

Its experience up to this point had demonstrated the importance of ruth-

less management and robust organization. The postwar Japanese market

for motorcycles was huge because public transport could barely cope and

gasoline supplies were limited. Unlike other industrial sectors, this one was barely regulated, resulting in something of a Darwinian struggle for survival. During the 1950s there were some two hundred companies compet-

ing for this market in what was known as the “motorcycle wars.” This was a

time when “doing business was a turbulent and hazardous pursuit involving

all manner of lucrative opportunities and nasty surprises.” 44]] When the wars were over, four companies were left (Yamaha, Suzuki, Kawasaki, and Honda).

Of these, Honda (formed in 1948) was the most prominent. Its success was

due to a number of factors. It began with Soichiro Honda’s own engineer-

ing genius, combined with the fi nancial acumen of his business manager,

Takio Fujisawa. They had some wartime experience of mass production tech-

niques and they understood the Toyota production model and the importance

of supply chains. Their internal organization was very strong, with careful

fi nancial control and—particularly important—great effort put into devel-

oping their dealer network.

In the late 1950s, Honda overtook the previous domestic leader Tohatsu

(which soon went bankrupt). As Honda then went on to car production,

Yamaha caught up in market share and, believing its rival to be distracted,

decided to build a brand new factory with the aim of becoming the market

d e l i b e r a t e o r e m e r g e n t

567

leader. Instead, Honda mounted a strong defense leading to a fi erce battle between the two (known as the “H-Y war”) in 1981. Honda’s response

was neither subtle nor indirect. According to Stalk, who made this clash

a centerpiece of his analysis of Japanese competitiveness, this was launched

with a war cry, “Yamaha wo tsubusu!” which he roughly translated as “We

will crush, squash, butcher, slaughter, etc., Yamaha!” Honda cut prices and

boosted advertising expenditures, and introduced a number of new products,

so that having the most up-to-date motorcycle became a fashion necessity.

Yamaha’s bikes were left looking “old, out-of-date, and unattractive” and

demand for them dried up, leaving dealers stuck with old stock. Eventually

Yamaha surrendered. Honda’s victory had come at a price but had deterred

other competitors besides Yamaha. Stalk was most impressed by the way

that Honda had accelerated its production cycles to head off the competition

and made this the central lesson he drew for Americans. Although this was

undoubtedly impressive, this focus played down the extent to which Honda’s

strategy had been brutally attritional, with its price cuts and promotions.

Hamel and Prahalad also used Honda in 1994 as an example of exploit-

ing core competence, mocking the experience curve, demonstrating great

ambition and creativity in extracting maximum benefi t from the mastery

of the internal combustion engine (which allowed them to move success-

fully into a number of related production lines, from lawnmowers to tractors

and marine engines), and enabling a challenge to Ferrari and Porsche in the

high-end sports car market with the new NSX. They understood the needs

of customers without following them slavishly. Yet as Mair reports, the NSX

was a costly failure for Honda. This was not the result of only bad luck due

to an appreciating currency undermining its competitiveness, but also the

choice of market. The interest in sports cars was more a refl ection of Honda’s culture than of its core competence and meant that it missed the developing American market in the 1990s for recreational vehicles and minivans.

In other areas, a determination to make a technological breakthrough meant

that they lacked a follow-on car when it was needed. More generally, the

only serious diversity made possible by Honda’s engine technology was from

motorcycles to cars. Other products remained a minor part of its portfolio.

In fact, its strategy from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s revealed a “narrow

self-defi nition and a technological stubbornness” and so a lack of responsiveness to consumers.

Mair raised a number of basic methodological problems with these sto-

ries. They were often based on patchy research and focused on a particular

period. All the way through Honda was treated as a great success, yet dur-

ing the course of its history it had made a number of major errors and at

568

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

times faced fi nancial ruin. The failures were never deemed to be of interest. The business theorists who wanted to draw lessons might have asked

why it never managed to dent Toyota’s dominance of the Japanese car mar-

ket or explain why companies that followed similar strategies did not do as

well. Insuffi cient attention was paid to the less glamorous but vital aspects of Honda’s approach, such as its operations and dealer management, perhaps

equivalent to the disinterest in logistics often displayed by military strategists. There was always going to be more interest in sparks of genius than

the tedious slog of administration. Mair criticized analysts seeing “only what

they want to see” and of “acute one-sided reductionism.” 45]] He noted the tendencies toward polarization, as in deliberate/emergent and competence/

capabilities, as if it had to be one or the other. The data was aligned to fi t the theory, while inconvenient material was ignored or fudged.

_Back to Basics_

Military strategy had been launched at a time when it was believed that

there were basic principles which, if applied properly, could at least increase the probability of success, even if success could not be guaranteed. It then

struggled as it became apparent that the application of military force was a

more complicated and frustrating business than envisaged by Jomini in the

fi rst glow of Napoleon’s advances, especially as it proved hard to escape from the norm of decisive battle. Business strategy was the product of a similar

bout of optimism of the mid-twentieth century, picking up on a general

confi dence in the possibilities of long-term planning, not only for nations

but also for large companies, including the large American conglomerates.

It also struggled as the limitations of the planning model became appar-

ent, but unlike the military the managers did not have an agreed framework

to provide coherence. As a result, business strategy lost its way, following

many diverse paths and falling prey to temporary enthusiasms. There was a

resulting tendency to prescriptive hyperbole. In a cautionary analysis, Phil

Rosenzweig dismissed purveyors of business success stories for misleading

their readers, sustaining the myth that there were reliable rules for success that once discovered could ensure the success of a business. He offered examples of sloppy thinking, by and large involving the standard muddle between

correlation and causation, the tendency to explore explanations of success

without worrying whether the same factors might be present in failures, and

paying inadequate attention to the competition. The basic muddle he iden-

tifi ed was the “halo effect,” the tendency to assign factors such as culture, d e l i b e r a t e o r e m e r g e n t

569

leadership, and values, responsibility for a strong performance when they are really attributions that resulted from a strong performance. [^46]

Skeptical fi gures, who had seen fads and fashions come and go, urged a

return to the basics. John Kay warned that strategies could not be generic

because they had to be based on distinctive capabilities. The aim therefore

should not be to come up with grand designs that even the most totalitarian

institution would struggle to realize. Companies lacked the knowledge to

construct the plans and the power to implement them. Instead of the “illu-

sion of control” and the belief that success would result from superior vision and will, he urged a resource-based approach based on the work of Edith

Penrose in the 1950s. The task was to fi nd the best fi t between the internal capabilities of the fi rm and its external environment. The place to start was with an understanding of a company’s actual and possible position in the

marketplace, as well as the distinctive capabilities it already had rather than

those it would like to have. 47

Positioning documents might describe desirable end points—places to

be in fi ve years’ time—but the starting point would have to be the current

situation. While there might be a temperamental preference for strategies

that outsmarted competitors rather than relied on superior capacity, much

would depend on the problem that was to be solved. Thus Stephen Bungay

urged avoiding the pathologies of central control, with constant demands

for extra information and reduced opportunities for individual initiative.

His advice was to concentrate on what mattered, not to attempt to “plan

beyond the circumstances you can foresee,” and formulate strategy as intent

and with a simple message, encouraging people to adapt their actions to

circumstances. 48]] A book based on the successful experience of Alan Laffl ey in charge of Proctor & Gamble (P&G), written with his chief consultant Roger Martin, considered strategy in terms of “making specifi c choices to win in

the marketplace.” The questions behind a winning strategy, they advised,

were about describing a winning aspiration, where to play, how to win, the

capabilities and management systems that needed to be in place. The book

explained how this was done at P&G, but also commented on the need to

avoid “strategic traps.” The basic source of error was failing to set real priorities, traps described as “do-it-all,” “something-for-everyone,” or as Waterloo (starting with multiple competitors on multiple fronts). Other errors were

described as Don Quixote, attacking the strongest competitor fi rst; “program of the month,” which meant going for the latest fashion; and last, “dreams

that never come true.” 49

Similarly, Richard Rumelt described good strategy as starting with

a diagnosis that defi ned or explained the nature of the challenge, thus

570

s t r a t e g y f r o m a b o v e

simplifying the complexity of reality—which could be overwhelming—by identifying the most critical aspects of the current situation. This would

facilitate a guiding policy for dealing with the challenge and a set of coherent actions designed to carry out the guiding policy. Rumelt recognized that

the problem could be internal as well as external, found in both its routines and bureaucratic interests, and that rather than reaching for the sky the best course at times was to set proximate objectives, close enough at hand to be

feasible.

Many writers on strategy seem to suggest that the more dynamic

the situation, the farther ahead a leader must look. This is illogical.

The more dynamic the situation, the poorer your foresight will be.

Therefore, the more uncertain and dynamic the situation, the more

proximate a strategic objective must be. 50

Rumelt also warned of the dangers of bad strategy, especially the quality he

described simply as “fl uff” or a “form of gibberish masquerading as strate-

gic concepts or arguments,” but also for failing to defi ne the challenge to

be addressed, mistaking goals for strategy, stating a desire without a means

for achieving it, and setting objectives without considering their practica-

bility. 51 He warned against senior management setting impossible tar]]gets and explaining how anything can be achieved with suffi cient drive and will

(though in practice they were unlikely to be able to manage more than a few

challenges at any one time), seeking consensus between incompatible visions

instead of making a defi nitive choice, and attempting to inspire by buzz-

words (“charisma in a can”) instead of natural, personal language. “Bad strategy fl ourishes,” Rumelt suggested, “because it fl oats above analysis, logic, and choice, held aloft by the hope that one can avoid dealing with these

tricky fundamentals and the diffi culties of mastering them.” 52]]

Business strategy, like military and revolutionary strategy, could suffer

from its own heroic myths. It acquired an unrealistically elevated status as

the ingredient that could make all the difference between success and fail-

ure. Master strategists with master strategies were regularly identifi ed to be admired and emulated: “captains of industry” keeping their organizations

stable and set on a steady course; fi nancial wizards taking aggressive action against all ineffi ciencies and so extracting the last ounce of shareholder value from a business; hard competitors scouring the marketplace for the most

advantageous position; soft revolutionaries recognizing the creative potential of a committed workforce; innovative designers transforming a market with

a truly unique product. Management theorists and gurus promoted their

own preferred heroes. There were inevitably some managers who matched at

d e l i b e r a t e o r e m e r g e n t

571

least one of these types, but what worked in one situation could go wrong in another. Too often, the individuals and companies who soared one moment

seemed to come crashing down the next. The hype that accompanied the

promotion of successive strategic fashions exaggerated the importance of the

enlightened manager and played down the importance of chance and circum-

stances in explaining success.

The Limits of Rational Choice

_In theory there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice_ _there is._

—Yogi Berra (also attributed to Albert Einstein)

This section is concerned with the possibility of strategic theory based

on the insights of contemporary social sciences. We have already seen

how apparently detached intellectual activity was the product of wider social forces, whether the effort put in by the RAND Corporation to develop new

sciences of decision-making, the foundation grants that encouraged business

schools to adopt these—and which the more sociologically inclined organi-

zational theorists sought to resist—or else the impact of the radical thinking of the 1960s on the relationship between discourse and power.

A particularly infl uential theory was one that stressed the benefi ts of treating all choices as if they were rational. Adherents were confi dent that they, almost uniquely, could offer a theory deserving of the accolade “social science” in which all propositions could both be deduced from a strong theory

and then validated empirically. Though rational choice theory consistently

delivered far less than promised, and its underlying assumptions became vul-

nerable to a fundamental challenge from cognitive psychology, it was pro-

moted effectively and in a highly strategic manner. In a remarkably short

space of time, supporters of the theory became embedded in political science

departments. They were not deterred by the widespread apprehension that the theory depended on an untenable view of human rationality. The claim,

they insisted, was no more than that the premise of rationality helped gener-

ate good theory.

_The Rochester School_

As Kuhn observed, the promotion of new schools of thought in academia

has rarely depended on reason alone. Successful promotion has also relied on

access to the sources of academic power through dispensing grants, editing

journals, or appointing acolytes to faculty positions. So it was that econom-

ics was given a singular boost after the Second World War with a substan-

tial investment which made it possible to exploit the opportunities for the

sophisticated quantitative methods opened up by computers. As it grew in

confi dence and assertiveness, economics offered itself as the master discipline of the social sciences. There were no obvious boundaries to its imperialism. The “economic approach provides a framework applicable to all human

behavior,” observed Gary Becker, “to all types of decisions and to persons

from all walks of life.” 1

Before the Ford Foundation began to invest in business schools in the

late 1950s, it had already undertaken a major investment in the so-called

behavioral sciences. This investment did not create the fi eld, which could

be traced back to the 1920s and the work of Charles Merriam and Harold

Lasswell at the University of Chicago. There was already a developing inter-

est in analyzing large data sets, such as censuses, election results, and polling data. Ford, followed by other foundations, undoubtedly made a difference,

encouraging universities to establish centers for behavioral studies by pro-

viding large grants—often unsolicited (so that some universities were unsure

what was expected of them)—to the tune of some $24 million between 1951

and 1957. The RAND Corporation’s infl uence was evident, with Gaither in

charge of the Foundation and Hans Speier, the head of RAND’s social science

division, advising. The aim therefore was to move away from earlier forms of

social and political theory and encourage an interest in phenomena that could be measured. This new approach was described as “behavioralism” to emphasize the positivist, empirical, and value-free quality of the research. Against the anti-communist backdrop of the time, there was also concern that “social

science” smacked too much of a “socialist science” or social reform. 2]] The individualistic assumptions behind this approach fi t naturally with theories of

markets and democracy and challenged Marxist notions of class struggle. This

576

t h e o r i e s o f s t r a t e g y

encouraged the view that liberal individualism was rational and collectivism irrational. [^3] The core attraction of the theory, however, was not ideological but that it was elegant, parsimonious, and genuinely innovative. Some of those

attracted by its virtues even gamefully sought to demonstrate that it was not incompatible with Marxism. Unfortunately it was often asserted dogmati-cally and embraced as a project of ambitious model-building.

There was ambiguity about whether this theory was descriptive or pre-

scriptive. Did it explain how actors did behave or how they should behave? If prescriptive, then actors would need to make a deliberate decision to follow

the advice. That would be the rational thing to do. “To identify a rational

choice is to say that an agent would, in some sense and circumstances, do

well to make it. If actual agents do not, they rather than the theory may be

at fault.” 4]] So if actors chose not to follow rational advice, they therefore were capable of behaving irrationally. If that was generally the case, the theory was going to be limited in any descriptive, let alone predictive, capacity. If, on the other hand, the theory was reliably descriptive, the prescription would be both obvious and irrelevant. Why should actors bother with strategy when

the solution was evident in advance? 5

The starting point for the theory was that individuals made their own

choices in order to maximize their utilities, which could be subjectively

defi ned, although there was a tendency to assume that these were quite basic and could be measured in terms of economic rewards or the acquisition of

power. The next stage was for actors with their preferences to play a struc-

tured game, presuming a certain amount of knowledge about their own posi-

tion and those of the other players. The following, crucial step would be to

identify the equilibrium point. Assuming that all players followed strategies to maximize their utilities, this point would be one from which individual

actors had no incentive to deviate. In principle, it would represent the most logical outcome to the strategic game and would set the terms for future

empirical work.

A key fi gure in the development of rational choice theory at RAND was

Kenneth Arrow, who developed the “impossibility theorem” that explained

why democratic systems do not always produce outcomes that conform to the

wishes of the majority. His student Anthony Downs, in his _Economic Theory of_ _Democracy_ used the idea of individuals maximizing their self-interest to challenge notions of public interest. The person who turned all this into what

he saw as a paradigm shift in political science was William Riker. Riker had

followed a relatively mainstream path since graduating from Harvard in the

late 1940s, yet was looking for a means to elevate political science to a new level. He found it in game theory.

t h e l i m i t s o f r a t i o n a l c h o i c e

577

When he fi rst became aware of game theory in the mid-1950s, Riker was attracted by the presumption of amoral rationality. He was reacting against

what he saw as the then dominant paradigm of normative political theory,

written as a set of imperatives, about how politics should be conducted rather than as an analysis of how it was actually conducted. Yet he also wanted to

move beyond a Machiavelli-like focus on the realities of power. He aspired to something truly scientifi c, offering testable models that could guide empirical work. This was why he was excited by game theory, with its “uncompromising rationalism.” Asking what sensible people trying to achieve straightfor-

ward goals would choose to do was in line with traditional political science.

This tradition he judged to have been lost during the fi rst half of the century under the infl uence of biological, psychological, and metaphysical theories.

Game theory left “no role for instinct, for thoughtless habit, for unconscious self-defeating desire, or for some metaphysical and exogenous will.”

The second appeal lay in the emphasis on free choice. Here Riker was

reacting to the historical determinism associated with Marxism. Game the-

ory assumed that people consider their own preferences and how alternative

strategies might satisfy them in the face of similar calculations by oppo-

nents. The outcomes therefore depended on free human choices rather than

on “some exogenous plan for the world” or “built-in human irrationality.”

There was an obvious tension here, which Riker acknowledged. As a pre-

scriptive theory this was fi ne. It was all about helping people make better

choices. But as a descriptive theory, variations in choices caused all sorts of problems. The value of deterministic assumptions about rational choice was

that they should help identify regularity of behavior and so make possible

generalizations. Yet truly free choices allowed for quirky and random behav-

ior that defi ed generalization. 6 Riker saw game theory as offering a way out]]

of the dilemma by combining the possibilities of generalization with free

choice. On the one hand, it could be presumed that all persons with the same

goals in the same circumstances would rationally choose the same alternative, so regularities could be observed. That did not, however, remove the role of

choice, especially in situations characterized by uncertainty. In the end it was the choices that fascinated Riker most, and this meant that by the time he

died he was moving into areas where science was of little help. But by that

time he had spawned a whole school determined to prove that politics could

be a science and was resolutely disinterested in it as an art.

In 1959, Riker applied for a fellowship at the Center for Advanced Study

in the Behavioral Sciences at Palo Alto with the aim of working in a fi eld

he described as “formal, positive, political theory.” “Formal” referred to

“the expression of the theory in algebraic rather than verbal symbols” and

578

t h e o r i e s o f s t r a t e g y

“positive” to the “expression of descriptive rather than normative propositions.” He sought the “growth in political science of a body of theory

somewhat similar to . . . the neo-classical theory of value in economics.” In particular he mentioned the potential role of the “mathematical theory of

games” for “the construction of political theory.” 7 The result of his fellowship]]

was _The Theory of Political Coalitions_ , which served as his manifesto. What made the difference in terms of the spread of his ideas, however, was his

appointment to run the political science department at the well-endowed

University of Rochester, already committed to forms of social science based

on rigorous quantitative analysis. Here he insisted on students capable of statistical analysis and faculty who were signed on to his own vision. Under his leadership, Rochester moved up the rankings, producing graduate students

who went forth into other departments to spread the word of rational actor

theory. Two of his acolytes have written of “consistent, thorough preparation of students who recognized themselves to be part of a distinct movement to

alter political science, the camaraderie and tightknit sense of community

among those students, and their impressive scholarly productivity.” These

students were “unyielding in their efforts to research and advance the theo-

retical paradigm of rational choice” and determined to “displace other forms

of political science.”

In 1982, Riker became president of the American Political Science

Association. He could observe the dominance of “the rational choice para-

digm.” Its success was “driving out all others.” 8 He was now ar]]guing against the need to add such modifi ers as “positive” or “formal” as this was the only

“political theory” deserving of the name because it met scientifi c standards. [^9]

By the 1990s, mathematics was an essential attribute for a political science

program, and rational choice articles accounted for some 40 percent of all

contributions to the _American Political Science Review_ . There were complaints that the growing infl uence of the paradigm was due to a strong-arm mentality as much as clarity of thought. Rather than criticism being taken seri-

ously, it was dismissed because the critics lacked the training to master the methods and so failed to understand what was going on. Because they supported their own, it was alleged that rational choice scholars would prefer a second-rate member of their own fraternity to anyone else when it came to

appointments. 10

Their theory was not a simple imposition of an economics model. The

development of economics as a discipline had been served by the assump-

tions of self-interest, narrowly conceived, so that individuals facing the same constraints and with the same preferences would make the same choices each

time. Both goals and the resources used to obtain them could be expressed in

t h e l i m i t s o f r a t i o n a l c h o i c e

579

monetary terms and numerous comparable transactions could be observed in everyday economic life: the larger the sample the less important anomalous

behavior and the more distinct the observable patterns and relationships.

Riker was impressed by the robust market economics of the Chicago School,

and this was present in his original Rochester curriculum. But he embraced

game theory well before mainstream economists, and he was always care-

ful to distinguish economics—which attributed a mechanical rationality to

agents—from politics—in which rationality was deliberate and conscious,

often in direct opposition to other actors. This was the basis of game theory, and on its use Riker’s school followed rather than led.

As the theorists became more ambitious, they moved from the areas where

it might be assumed to be most valuable, with large samples but few vari-

ables, into areas of small samples and many variables. This included interna-

tional relations. When the available options were not naturally constrained,

the approach struggled because the identifi cation of both a clear interest and an optimum strategy were hard to discern. Even in areas where fi ndings were

expressed with high confi dence—for example, election studies—quite subtle

variations in underlying conditions might render these fi ndings unreliable.

The more stable the environment the more behavior within it should show

regularity. The more uncertain the environment the harder for actors to dis-

cern a rational way forward. In the textbook he wrote with Peter Ordeshook,

Riker observed that when the “range of alternatives is infi nite and when the consequences of choosing each alternative are uncertain, it is likely that most choices involve error.” [^11]

If only certain sorts of solutions could be recognized, then only certain

sorts of problems could be addressed. The most susceptible were likely to be

the most narrow, with the model incorporating as few factors as possible. If

any attempt was to be made at empirical validation, data sets were needed

which involved a suffi ciency of comparable instances that would occur in a

measurable form. While the fi ndings might confi rm what had been deduced

from the model, despite the mathematical trappings, this could rarely be

considered a proof. Causation might have something to do with those factors

that did not fi t easily into the model or could not be readily measured. Even when goals were achieved it was not always possible to be sure whether this

was the result of the actions chosen rather than chance, coincidence, or the

critical intervention of an extraneous factor.

In the natural sciences, laws could be established. As particles did not

have free will, cause and effect would be predictable. This was impossible

when dealing with voluntary agents. Threats or inducements that normally

produced one response could on occasion produce something quite different.

580

t h e o r i e s o f s t r a t e g y

This might not matter when the aim was to affect numerous small and comparable transactions, as was often the case in economics. By insisting that

research into politics must meet standards of formal rigor and mathematical

elegance, priority could not be given to the quality of the questions asked

or the value of the answers. One critic observed, “Rigor is subject to a con-

servation law, and the more rigor along mathematical dimensions, the less

of it along other, perhaps more important, dimensions.” 12]] As game theorists addressed these limitations, they either had to move away from the strict

confi nes of the theory or take it to levels of complexity that only the cogno-scenti could savor or follow.

In one of the most serious challenges to rational actor theory in political science, Donald Green and Ian Shapiro observed that despite all the effort, what

had been learned about politics was “exceedingly little.” 13]] They addressed one standard problem for rational choice theory which suggested that it would be

irrational for anyone to vote since the time invested in the process would have to be set against the minimal impact that one person could expect to have on

the fi nal result. Yet people did vote in large numbers. How could the fi nding be reconciled without challenging a core precept of the theory? They mocked

one response which explained the outcomes by “psychic gratifi cation,” which

might be an interest, but then why that rather than other interests? And what was the source of this gratifi cation? Was it a concern for a cause, or belief that democracy depends on voting, or the quality of the candidates? The theory

offered no good answer. When an interesting fi nding was obtained, explana-

tions had to be found outside the theory. Stephen Walt concluded after sur-

veying the application of the rational actor model to international relations theory that its “growing technical complexity” had not been matched by any

“corresponding increase in insight.” The complexity allowed key assumptions

to be buried and made the theories diffi cult to evaluate. 14]]

One Kuhnian answer to this challenge was that “a theory cannot be

rejected because of disconfi rming facts.” It could “only be supplanted by

a superior theory.” 15 But this exaggerated the status of what were often no]]

more than speculative hypotheses deduced from suspect models. The fact

that they might be discussed mathematically did not put these theories on

the same level as those in the natural sciences.

_Forming Coalitions_

The book announcing Riker’s new approach was on coalition formation.

The nature of communication between players, and whether this could be

t h e l i m i t s o f r a t i o n a l c h o i c e

581

incorporated within the game or involved working outside the confi nes of the game, was one of the most challenging issues for game theory. If the

starting presumption of autonomous, rational individuals devoid of social

ties and cultural references meant that there could be no presumption of

empathy, cooperation would depend solely on the logic of situations rather

than any natural inclinations. Von Neumann and Morgenstern had promised,

without quite delivering, advice on how to form coalitions when more than

one player came into the game. With three or more players (n-person games),

it became harder to make simplifying assumptions. The confl icts of interest

were less straightforward. With three players, two acting in concert should

win. When such a coalition was formed the calculation was as simple as it

would be for a two-person game with a minimax solution. The challenge was

on working out whether the rational course for weak players was to gang up

against a strong player (balancing) or ally themselves with a strong player

(bandwagoning). As many alternative coalitions might be stable, it would be

necessary to go methodically through all potential coalitions to work out an

optimum strategy.

Just before Riker published his book, William Gamson had sought to

develop a formal theory of coalitions. He agreed that the problem had to be

reduced to a two-person game. He defi ned coalitions as “temporary, means

oriented, alliances among individuals or groups which differ in goals.” They

were likely to come together for the pursuit of power itself, by which he

meant the ability to control future decisions. This they would be able to do

because their joint resources would be greater than those of other units or

coalitions. Some of the goals of the component parts would remain incompat-

ible, but they could concentrate on those that were distinctively their own.

But when it came to predicting who would join with whom, which required

understanding the resources most relevant for a given decision, their distri-

bution, and what alternative coalitions offered the parties in terms of payoffs, Gamson found that game theory produced too many solutions. His general

hypothesis was that participants would expect from a coalition a proportional share of the payoff according to the resources they contributed. This, he suggested, depended on reciprocity and a step-by-step process of pairing until a

decision point was reached. 16

Riker took this further and developed a strong proposition, based on a

study of coalition formation in legislatures, that complete and winning coalitions were “minimal” in the sense that they were just large enough to win

and no larger, with the rider that the less perfect and less complete the participants’ information the larger the winning coalition would be. He found this

“sparse model” worked quite well, though it deliberately excluded ideology

582

t h e o r i e s o f s t r a t e g y

and tradition. 17 He also concluded, however]], by the end of the 1960s that

“much more energy has been expended on the elaboration of the theory of

coalitions than on the verifi cation of it.” 18 Once again, the limits of game]]

theory became evident when there were too many potential inputs and many

possible outcomes.

In his book on coalitions, Riker asserted, “What the rational political

man wants, I believe, is to win, a much more specifi c and specifi able motive than the desire for power.” This posed the issue in zero-sum terms, which

for most political men might be true only in a narrow sense and suggested

that attitudes toward coalition formation would at best be grudging. It also

allowed him to defi ne rationality without reference to power, giving his

rational political man a defi nite personality: “The man who wants to win also wants to make people do things they would not otherwise do. He wants to

exploit each situation to his advantage. And he wants to succeed in a given

situation.” 19 This refl]] ected Riker’s own personal interest not so much in the occasional political acts of ordinary voters, to which his refl ections on democracy assigned only a limited signifi cance, but on the key players among the

political elite. Arguably, just as game theory worked best in economics when

looking at oligopoly, where there were few players, this form of political science worked best when looking at oligarchy.

An important attempt to demonstrate how the theory might be applied

to a wider range of situations came from Mancur Olson, who was intrigued

by the implications of the logic of self-interested rationality when it came

to cooperation. Whereas Marx had sought class consciousness as a way of

turning a shared interest into a political force, Olson pointed to the diffi culties of a large and dispersed group ever acting as a political force. This was because each individual would assess that the marginal benefi t from making

contributions to a public good (that is one that is shared collectively rather than held by a few alone) was normally below the marginal cost, and also

that their own contributions would barely make a difference. It was therefore irrational to cooperate with others, even in great numbers, to achieve collective goals: “Unless there is coercion or some other special device to make individuals act in their common interest, rational, self-interested individuals will not act to achieve their common or group interests.” An individual’s

rational self-interest was to shirk on his contributions while continuing to

receive benefi t from the work of others. [^20]

This problem of the “free rider” was one that could be recognized, for

example, in a member of a military alliance who gained protection but put few resources into the pool. This point was made forcefully by Olson while working as a consultant to RAND in the 1960s. He showed how NATO’s smaller

t h e l i m i t s o f r a t i o n a l c h o i c e

583

members found that they had “little or no incentive to provide additional amounts of the collective good,” and so burdens were shared in a disproportionate way. [^21] Even though there was a shared interest, there was no point in acting on that interest if it was likely to be achieved whether or not you acted and without you paying any price. By contrast, however, if an individual’s actions really would make a difference and the benefi ts would exceed the cost, then it was rational to act to secure the shared interest. In some

respects, therefore, Olson offered a form of elite theory because he explained how small concentrated groups with resources could retain infl uence. The

majority might hold a contrary interest, but so long as it was diffuse and

dispersed its impact was muted.

Part of the explanation lay in a consideration of the social costs and ben-

efi ts. An individual who did not bother to vote or join a union might escape notice, whereas in a small group engaged in an active campaign this would

not be the case. On this basis Olson could explain, for example, why motor

manufacturers might be able to lobby together for government measures that

would keep car prices up, but the more numerous consumers would not be

able to act equivalently to bring prices down. Collective goods affected everyone, but they were more likely to serve the interests of those best placed to lobby for them.

Once social pressures were admitted then the questions of where interests

lay became more problematic. Questions of honor and reputation had to be

socially validated. They were meaningless outside of a social context, but

that also meant that they could vary with context. A theory in which inter-

ests were narrowly conceived and pursued, in the form of money and power,

might remain elegant and parsimonious but not necessarily very realistic.

A variety of types of interests did not in itself damage the theory, which

required only that they be pursued effi ciently, but it made it less elegant and parsimonious.

_The Development of Cooperation_

It was not necessarily the case that game theory could not cope with behavior other than the most egotistical. The authors of a popular account of game theory as a strategic tool noted that one difference from the fi rst edition (1991) to the second (2008) was the “full realization of the important part that

cooperation plays in strategic situations.” 22]] One way of providing a game-theoretic understanding of the development of social behavior was through

iterated games, a point made most strongly by Robert Axelrod’s _The Evolution_ 584

t h e o r i e s o f s t r a t e g y

_of Cooperation._ The origins of this book are intriguing. It can be traced to Anatol Rapoport, who combined intense interest in game theory with an

equally intense anti-militarism. Discovering von Neumann’s support for a

preemptive war with the Soviet Union while the two were discussing support

for mathematical biology was said to have been a turning point in his life. In 1964, he published a polemic against what he considered to be the misuse

of game theory by strategists such as Schelling. 23]] While at the University of Michigan (before he moved to Toronto in protest at the Vietnam War), he

actively promoted experimental games as a means of exploring the validity

of theoretical “solutions” to theories of rational cooperation. Among a group who continued this work at Michigan was Robert Axelrod, also with a background as an antiwar activist.

Axelrod saw the possibilities of using computers to experiment with game

theory by setting up a tournament. He invited experts to send programs for

a game of prisoner’s dilemma that could be repeated up to two hundred

times to see if it was possible to learn or signal in ways that produced a

cooperative outcome. Not surprisingly, perhaps, the winner was a simple

program submitted by Rapoport. The requirement was to play continuing

games of tit-for-tat, which required that one side replicate what the other did in the previous round. The fi rst command was “cooperate,” and a continuing cooperative outcome fl owed naturally. The message was that cooperative

behavior could “thrive with rules that are nice, provocable, and somewhat

forgiving.” [^24] This made a point about the possibilities of cooperation at a time of Cold War tension, and it had the great advantage of not depending

on claims about how human goodness could trump amoral rationality. Other

than the somewhat critical starting assumptions, the process was then com-

puter dependent and untouched by human hand. Compared to the egotistical

presumption of the theory, Axelrod demonstrated that cooperation could be

rational.

Did this have any value for strategists? The presumption was that coop-

eration was a good thing except when it obviously was not (such as cartels).

The book was a hymn to the virtues of altruism and reciprocity. Axelrod

came up with four rules to establish cooperation. First, do not be envious.

Be satisfi ed with absolute rather than relative gains, so that if you are doing nicely, do not worry is someone is doing even better. Second, do not be the

fi rst to defect, because you need to establish the logic of cooperation. Third, if another player defects, reciprocate in order to establish confi dence in your retaliation. Last, do not be too clever, as others will not be sure what you are up to. Axelrod also pointed to the importance of a long-term perspective.

If you were in a relationship for a long time then it made sense to continue

t h e l i m i t s o f r a t i o n a l c h o i c e

585

cooperation, even when there were occasional wobbles, but in short-term encounters there were fewer incentives to do so. Little might then be lost by defecting.

Axelrod’s analysis was not irrelevant to the confl icts with which strategy

was largely concerned, especially those where there were signifi cant areas of cooperation even against the backdrop of a general antagonism or competition. But the specifi c form of the tit-for-tat approach, even in situations which approximated to the form of prisoner’s dilemma, would be hard to

replicate. A symmetry in position between two parties was rare so that the

impact of moves, whether cooperation or defection, would not be the same.

Cooperation was as likely to be based on exchange of benefi ts of different

types as on things of equivalent value. This was why there were many ways

in which cooperation could develop, for example by means of barter, rather

than through iterated games of prisoner’s dilemma. One important point was

reinforced by Axelrod’s tournament. Strategies have to be judged over time,

in a series of engagements rather than in a single encounter. This is why it

was unwise to try to be too clever. Players who used “complex methods of

making inferences about the other player” were often wrong. It was diffi cult to interpret the behavior of another without accounting for the impact of

one’s own. Otherwise, what might have been assumed to be complex signal-

ing just appeared as random messages.

Using iterated games (though of assurance rather than prisoner’s dilemma),

Dennis Chong looked hard at the civil rights movement to address the issue

raised by Olson of rational participation in what he called “public-spirited

collective action.” He saw the initial unwillingness to indulge in futile gestures and the later nervousness about taking personal risks when others were

carrying the weight of the protest. This form of collective action offered no tangible incentives. Yet there were “social and psychological” benefi ts. It

became a “long-term interest to cooperate in collective endeavors if noncoop-

eration results in damage to one’s reputation, ostracism, or repudiation from the community.”

Chong noted the diffi culty with looking at strategy in terms of the one-

off encounters to which game theory seemed to lend itself. The ability to

think long term required taking into account the “repeated exchanges and

encounters that one will have with other members of the community.” The

diffi culty collective movements faced was getting started. Chong’s model

could not explain where the leaders came from. They acted “autonomously”

and got engaged without being sure of success or followers. Once a start had

been made with the acquisition of the fi rst followers but prior to any tangible results, momentum developed as a result of a form of social contagion. This

586

t h e o r i e s o f s t r a t e g y

led to the conclusion, which might have been reached by more straightforward historical observation, that “strong organizations and effective lead-

ership” combined with “symbolic and substantive concessions” from the

authorities. In addition, it was wise to be cautious about being able to identify any “combination of objective factors in a society that will predictably set

off a chain of events leading up to a collective movement.” 25

The problem was not that the methods used in rational choice could not

lead to intriguing and signifi cant insights but that so many really interesting questions were begged. Unless preferences were attributed (such as profi t or power maximization) because they would work well for most actors in most

circumstances, then only the actors themselves could explain what they were

trying to achieve and what their expectations were with regard to their own

options and the reactions of others. This meant that before the theory could

get to work it had to be told a great deal. As Robert Jervis observed, the

“actor’s values, preferences, beliefs, and defi nition of self all are exogenous to

the model and must be provided before analysis can begin.” 26]] Rather than just take utility functions as givens, it was important to understand where

they came from and how they might change with different contexts. “We

need to understand not only how people reason about alternatives,” observed

Herbert Simon, “but where the alternatives come from in the fi rst place. The processes whereby alternatives are generated has been somewhat ignored as

an object of research.” 27

The point could be illustrated by the intellectual trajectory of William

Riker. It was always an important feature of his approach that he did not

assume that individuals were motivated by simple measures of self-interest,

such as money or prestige, but allowed for other more emotional or ethical

considerations. That is, utilities could be subjective, which reinforced the

point about the prior determination of the preferences that were brought to

the game. [^28] He also stressed that the structure of the game made a big difference. If the issue at stake was framed one way rather than another, alternative possibilities were opened up even with the same set of players.

In his outgoing address as president of the American Political Science

Association in 1983, Riker identifi ed three analytical steps. The fi rst was to identify the constraints imposed “by institutions, culture, ideology and

prior events,” that is, the context. Rational choice models came with the

next step, which was to identify “partial equilibria from utility maximization within the constraints.” The third step was “the explication of participants’

acts of creative adjustments to improve their opportunities.” Unfortunately,

he noted, not very much effort had been devoted to this third step. This

was the arena of what he dubbed “heresthetics, the art of political strategy.”

t h e l i m i t s o f r a t i o n a l c h o i c e

587

This came from Greek roots for choosing or electing. As areas of comparative ignorance, he listed “the way alternatives are modifi ed in political confl icts”

and the “rhetorical content of campaigns which is their principal feature.” [^29]

These means were important because that is how politicians structured the

environment and required others to respond to their agenda. They could

prevail by creating a situation with its own inexorable logic. It was through these devices that they could persuade others to join them in coalitions and

alliances. This led the fi eld away from the position where Riker had previ-

ously placed his fl ag. Simon commented, “I could wish he had not invented

the word ‘heresthetics’ to conceal the heresies he is propagating.” 30

Heresthetics was about structuring the way the world was viewed so as

to create political advantage. Riker identifi ed a number of heresthetic strategies: setting the agenda, strategic voting (supporting a less favored outcome to avoid something even worse), trading votes, altering the sequence of decisions, and redefi ning a situation. Initially he saw these forms of manipulation as separate from rhetoric, although it was hard to see how many of these

strategies could work without persuasive skills. In an unfi nished book, pub-

lished posthumously, he was focusing much more on rhetoric. His disciples

claimed that he was returning the discipline to “the science behind persua-

sion and campaigning,” 31]] but he acknowledged he was moving into terrain where the science would struggle. The point was made in the title of his

book on heresthetics, _The Art of Manipulation_ . He was clear that this was “not a science. There is no set of scientifi c laws that can be more or less mechanically applied to generate successful strategies.” [^32] In his posthumous book he expressed concern that “our knowledge of rhetoric and persuasion is itself

minuscule.” 33 Riker certainly did not abandon his conviction that statistical]]

analysis could sharpen his propositions, and he was determinedly avoiding

a large body of work that directly addressed exactly the issues of agenda setting, framing, and persuasion that were interesting him, because it was too

“belle-lettres” and insuffi ciently rigorous. However, he still ended up where so many students of strategists found themselves, fascinated by why some

players in the political game were smarter and more persuasive than their

opponents.

Beyond Rational Choice

_Reason is and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can never_

_pretend to any other offi ce than to serve and obey them._

—David Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature, 1740

The presumption of rationality was the most contentious feature of

formal theories. The presumption was that individuals were rational if

they behaved in such a way that their goals, which could be obnoxious as well as noble, would be most likely to be achieved. This was the point made by

the eighteenth-century philosopher David Hume. He was as convinced of the

importance of reason as he was that it could not provide its own motivation.

This would come from a great range of possible human desires: “Ambition,

avarice, self-love, vanity, friendship, generosity, public spirit,” which would be “mixed in various degrees and distributed through society.” 1]] As Downs put it, the rational man “moves towards his goals in a way which to the best

of his knowledge uses the least possible input of scarce resources per unit of valued output.” This also required focusing on one aspect of an individual

and not his “whole personality.” The theory “did not allow for the rich diversity of ends served by each of his acts, the complexity of his motives, the way

in which every part of his life is intimately related to his emotional needs. 2

Riker wrote that he was not asserting that all behavior was rational, but only that some behavior was “and that this possibly small amount is crucial for the

construction and operation of economic and political institutions.” 3]] In addition, the settings in which actors were operating—whether a congressional

election, legislative committee, or revolutionary council—were also taken as

givens, unless the issues being studied concerned establishing new institu-

tions. The challenge then was to show that collective political outcomes could be explained by individuals ranking “their preferences consistently over a set of possible outcomes, taking risk and uncertainty into consideration and acting to maximize their expected payoffs.” This could easily become tautologi-

cal because the only way that preferences and priorities could be discerned

was by examining the choices made in actual situations.

The main challenge to the presumption that intended egotistical choices

was the best basis from which to understand human behavior, was that it was

consistently hard to square with reality. To take a rather obvious example,

researchers tried to replicate the prisoner’s dilemma in the circumstances in which it was fi rst described. [^4] Could prosecutors gain leverage in cases involving codefendants by exchanging a prospect of a reduced sentence in return

for information or testimony against other codefendants? The evidence sug-

gested that it made no difference to the rates of pleas, convictions, and incarcerations in robbery cases with or without codefendants. The surmised reason

for this was the threat of extralegal sanctions that offenders could impose on each other. The codefendants might be kept separate during the negotiations,

but they could still expect to meet again. 5 T]]o the proponents of rational choice, such observations were irrelevant. The claim was not that rational

choice replicated reality but that as an assumption it was productive for the development of theory.

By the 1990s, the debate on rationality appeared to have reached a

stalemate, with all conceivable arguments exhausted on both sides. It was,

however, starting to be reshaped by new research, bringing insights from

psychology and neuroscience into economics. The standard critique of ratio-

nal choice theory was that people were just not rational in the way that the

theory assumed. Instead, they were subject to mental quirks, ignorance,

insensitivity, internal contradictions, incompetence, errors in judment, overactive or blinkered imaginations, and so on. One response to this criticism

was to say that there was no need for absurdly exacting standards of rationality. The theory worked well enough if it assumed people were generally rea-

sonable and sensible, attentive to information, open-minded, and thoughtful

about consequences. 6

As a formal theory, however, rationality was assessed in terms of the ideal

of defi ned utilities, ordered preferences, consistency, and a statistical grasp of probabilities when relating specifi c moves to desired outcomes. This sort of 590

t h e o r i e s o f s t r a t e g y

hyper-rationality was required in the world of abstract modeling. The model-ers knew that human beings were rarely rational in such an extreme form, but

their models required simplifying assumptions. The method was deductive

rather than inductive, less concerned with observed patterns of behavior than developing hypotheses which could then be subjected to empirical tests. If

what was observed deviated from what was predicted, that set a research task

that could lead to either a more sophisticated model or specifi c explanations about why a surprising result occurred in a particular case. Predicted outcomes might well be counterintuitive but then turn out to be more accurate

than those suggested by intuition.

One of the clearest expositions of what a truly rational action required

was set out in 1986 by Jon Elster. The action should be _optimal_ , that is, the best way to satisfy desire, given belief. The belief itself would be the best that could be formed, given the evidence, and the amount of evidence collected

would be optimal, given the original desire. Next the action should be _consistent_ so that both the belief and the desire were free of internal contradictions.

The agent must not act on a desire that, in her own opinion, was less weighty than other desires which might be reasons for not acting. Lastly, there was the test of _causality_ . Not only must the action be rationalized by the desire and the belief, but it must also be caused by them. This must also be true for the

relation between belief and evidence. 7

Except in the simplest of situations, meeting such demanding criteria

for rational action required a grasp of statistical methods and a capacity for interpretation that could only be acquired through specialist study. In practice, faced with complex data sets, most people were apt to make elementary

mistakes. 8 Even individuals capable of following the logical demands of such]]

an approach were unlikely to be prepared to accept the considerable invest-

ment it would involve. Some decisions were simply not worth the time and

effort to get them absolutely right. The time might not even be available

in some instances. Gathering all the relevant information and evaluating it

carefully would use up more resources than the potential gains from getting

the correct answer.

If rational choices required individuals to absorb and evaluate all available information and analyze probabilities with mathematical precision, it could

never capture actual human behavior. As we have seen, the urge to scientifi c rigor that animated rational choice theory only really got going once actors

sorted out their preferences and core beliefs. The actors came to the point where their calculations might be translated into equations and matrices as formed

individuals, with built-in values and beliefs. They were then ready to play out their contrived dramas. The formal theorists remained unimpressed by claims

b e y o n d r a t i o n a l c h o i c e

591

that they should seek out more accurate descriptions of human behavior, for example, by drawing on the rapid advances in understanding the human brain.

One economist patiently explained that this had nothing to do with his sub-

ject. It was not possible to “refute economic models” by this means because

these models make “no assumptions and draw no conclusions about the physi-

ology of the brain.” Rationality was not an assumption but a methodological

stance, refl ecting a decision to view the individual as the unit of agency. 9]]

If rational choice theory was to be challenged on its own terms, the alterna-

tive methodological stance had to demonstrate that it not only approximated

better to perceived reality but also that it would produce better theories. The challenge was fi rst set out in the early 1950s by Herbert Simon. He had a

background in political science and a grasp of how institutions worked. After entering economics through the Cowles Commission, he became something

of an iconoclast at RAND. He developed a fascination with artifi cial intel-

ligence and how computers might replicate and exceed human capacity. This

led him to ponder the nature of human consciousness. He concluded that a

reliable behavioral theory must acknowledge elements of irrationality and

not just view them as sources of awkward anomalies. While at the Carnegie

Graduate School of Industrial Administration, he complained that his econo-

mist colleagues “made almost a positive virtue of avoiding direct, systematic observations of individual human beings while valuing the casual empiricism of the economist’s armchair introspections.” At Carnegie he went to war

against neoclassical economics and lost. The economists grew in numbers and

power in the institution and had no interest in his ideas of “bounded rationality.” [^10] He gave up on economics and moved into psychology and computer science. This idea of “bounded rationality,” however, came to be recognized

as offering a compelling description of how people actually made decisions

in the absence of perfect information and computational capacity. It accepted human fallibility without losing the predictability that might still result

from a modicum of rationality. Simon showed how people might reasonably

accept suboptimal outcomes because of the excessive effort required to get to the optimal. Rather than perform exhaustive searches to get the best solution, they searched until they found one that was satisfactory, a process he

described as “satisfi cing.” 11]] Social norms were adopted, even when inconvenient, to avoid unwanted confl icts. When the empirical work demonstrated

strong and consistent patterns of behavior this might refl ect the rational pursuit of egotistical goals, but alternatively these patterns might refl ect the infl uence of powerful conventions that inclined people to follow the pack.

Building upon Simon’s work, Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman intro-

duced further insights from psychology into economics. To gain credibility,

592

t h e o r i e s o f s t r a t e g y

they used suffi cient mathematics to demonstrate the seriousness of their methodology and so were able to create a new fi eld of behavioral economics.

They demonstrated how individuals used shortcuts to cope with complex sit-

uations, relying on processes that were “good enough” and interpreted infor-

mation superfi cially using “rules of thumb.” As Kahneman put it, “people

rely on a limited number of heuristic principles which reduce the complex

tasks of assessing probabilities and predicting values to simpler judgmental

operations. In general, these heuristics are quite useful, but sometimes they

lead to severe and systematic errors.” 12]] _The Economist_ summed up what behavioral research suggested about actual decision-making:

[People] fear failure and are prone to cognitive dissonance, sticking

with a belief plainly at odds with the evidence, usually because the

belief has been held and cherished for a long time. People like to

anchor their beliefs so they can claim that they have external support,

and are more likely to take risks to support the status quo than to

get to a better place. Issues are compartmentalized so that decisions

are taken on one matter with little thought about the implications

for elsewhere. They see patterns in data where none exist, represent

events as an example of a familiar type rather than acknowledge dis-

tinctive features and zoom in on fresh facts rather than big pictures.

Probabilities are routinely miscalculated, so . . . people . . . assume that outcomes which are very probable are less likely than they really are,

that outcomes which are quite unlikely are more likely than they are,

and that extremely improbable, but still possible, outcomes have no

chance at all of happening. They also tend to view decisions in isola-

tion, rather than as part of a bigger picture. 13

Of particular importance were “framing effects.” These were mentioned ear-

lier as having been identifi ed by Goffman and used in explanations of how

the media helped shape public opinion. Framing helped explain how choices

came to be viewed differently by altering the relative salience of certain

features. Individuals compared alternative courses of action by focusing on

one aspect, often randomly chosen, rather than keep in the frame all key

aspects. 14]] Another important fi nding concerned loss aversion. The value of a good to an individual appeared to be higher when viewed as something that

could be lost or given up than when evaluated as a potential gain. Richard

Thaler, one of the fi rst to incorporate the insights from behavioral econom-

ics into mainstream economics, described the “endowment effect,” whereby

the selling price for consumption goods was much higher than the buying

price. [^15]

_Experiments_

Another challenge to the rational choice model came from experiments that

tested propositions derived from game theory. These were not the same as

experiments in the natural sciences which should not be context dependent.

Claims that some universal truths about human cognition and behavior were

being illuminated needed qualifi cation. The results could only really be considered at all valid for Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) societies in which the bulk of the experiments were conducted.

Nonetheless, while WEIRD societies were admittedly an unrepresentative

subset of the world’s population, they were also an important subset. 16]]

One of the most famous experiments was the ultimatum game. It was fi rst

used in an experimental setting during the early 1960s in order to explore

bargaining behavior. From the start, and to the frustration of the experimenters, the games showed individuals making apparently suboptimal choices.

A person (the proposer) was given a sum of money and then chose what

proportion another (the responder) should get. The responder could accept or

refuse the offer. If the offer was refused, both got nothing. A Nash equilib-

rium based on rational self-interest would suggest that the proposer should

make a small offer, which the responder should accept. In practice, notions

of fairness intervened. Responders regularly refused to accept anything less

than a third, while most proposers were inclined to offer something close to

half, anticipating that the other party would expect fairness. [^17] Faced with this unexpected fi nding, researchers at fi rst wondered if there was something wrong with the experiments, such as whether there had been insuffi cient

time to think through the options. But giving people more time or raising

the stakes to turn the game into something more serious made little differ-

ence. In a variation known as the dictator game, the responder was bound

to accept whatever the proposer granted. As might be expected, lower offers

were made—perhaps about half the average sum offered in the ultimatum

game. [^18] Yet, at about 20 percent of the total, they were not tiny.

It became clear that the key factor was not faulty calculation but the nature of the social interaction. In the ultimatum game, the responders accepted far less if they were told that the amount had been determined by a computer

or the spin of a roulette wheel. If the human interaction was less direct, with complete anonymity, then proposers made smaller grants. 19]] A further fi nding was that there were variations according to ethnicity. The amounts distributed refl ected culturally accepted notions of fairness. In some cultures, the proposers would make a point of offering more than half; in others, the responders

were reluctant to accept anything. It also made a difference if the transaction 594

t h e o r i e s o f s t r a t e g y

was within a family, especially in the dictator game. Playing these games with children also demonstrated that altruism was something to be learned during

childhood. 20 As they grew older]], most individuals turned away from the self-regarding decisions anticipated by classical economic theory and become more

other-regarding. The exceptions were those suffering from neural disorders

such as autism. In this way, as Angela Stanton caustically noted, the canoni-

cal model of rational decision-making treated the decision-making ability of

children and those with emotional disorders as the norm. 21

The research confi rmed the importance of reputation in social interac-

tions. 22 The concern with infl]] uencing another’s beliefs about oneself was evident when there was a need for trust, for example, when there were to

be regular exchanges. This sense of fairness and concern about reputation,

though it appeared instinctive and impulsive, was hardly irrational. It was

important for an individual to have a good reputation to consolidate her

social networks, while a social norm that sustained group cohesion was worth

upholding. There was further experimental evidence suggesting that when a

proposer had been insuffi ciently altruistic, the responders would not accept

their reward in order to ensure that the miserly proposer was punished. 23

Another experiment involved a group of investors. When each made an

investment everyone else gained, though they made a small loss. These losses

should not have mattered, for they were covered by the gains resulting from the investments of others. Those motivated by a narrow self-interest would see an incentive to become a free rider. They could avoid losses by making no personal investments while benefi ting from the investments of others. They would then gain at the expense of the group. Such behavior would soon lead to a breakdown in cooperation. To prevent this would require the imposition of sanctions by the rest of the group, even though this would cost them as individuals. When given a choice which group to join, individuals at fi rst often recoiled from joining one with known sanctions against free riders but eventually would migrate to that group, as they appreciated the importance of ensuring cooperation.

Free riders, or unfair proposers in the ultimatum game, were also stigma-

tized. In another experiment, individuals who expected to play by the rules

were told in advance of the game the identities of other players who would

be free riders. Once these individuals had been described as less trustworthy, they were generally seen as less likable and attractive. When the games were

underway, this prior profi ling infl uenced behavior. There was a reluctance to take risks with those designated untrustworthy, even when these individuals were acting no differently from others. Little effort was made to check

their reputations against actual behavior during the game. In experiments

which showed individuals described as either free-riders or cooperators

b e y o n d r a t i o n a l c h o i c e

595

experiencing pain, far less empathy was shown for the free riders than for the cooperators. [^24]

One response from those committed to the rational actor model was that

it was interesting but irrelevant. The experiments involved small groups,

often graduate students. It was entirely possible that as these types of situations became better understood, behavior would tend to become more ratio-

nal as understood by the theory. Indeed, there was evidence that when these

games were played with subjects who were either professors or students in

economics and business, players acted in a far more selfi sh way, were more

likely to free ride, were half as likely to contribute to a public good, kept more resources for themselves in an ultimatum game, and were more likely

to defect in a prisoner’s dilemma game. This fi t in with studies that showed economists to be more corruptible and less likely to donate to charity. 25]] One researcher suggested that the “experience of taking a course in microeconomics actually altered students’ conceptions of the appropriateness of acting in a self-interested manner, not merely their defi nition of self-interest.” 26]] In studies of traders in fi nancial markets, it transpired that while the inexperienced might be infl uenced by Thaler’s “endowment effect,” for example, the

experienced were not. 27 This might not be fl]] attering to economists, but it did show that egotistical behavior could also be quite natural. This argument,

however, could be played back to the formal theorists. To be sure, it showed

the possibility of self-interested and calculating behavior but it also required a degree of socialization. If it could not be shown to occur naturally and if it had to be learned, then that demonstrated the importance of social networks

as a source of guidance on how to behave.

When individuals were acting as consumers in a marketplace or in other

circumstances that encouraged them to act as egotistical and self-regarding,

their behavior could get close to what might be expected from models that

assumed such conduct. The experiments employed to explore the degree of

actual rationality refl ected the preoccupations with a particular sort of choice, a type “with clearly defi ned probabilities and outcomes, such as choosing

between monetary gambles.” 28 It was almost by accident that as researchers

sought to prove the rational actor models through experiments they came to

appreciate the importance of social pressures and the value attached to coop-

eration. Within the complex social networks of everyday life, truly egotistical and self-regarding behavior was, in a basic sense, irrational.

Attempts were made to recast formal theories to refl ect the insights of

behavioral psychology, in the guise of behavioral economics, but they made

limited progress. The most important insight from the new research was

that rather than studying individuals as more complex and rounded than

596

t h e o r i e s o f s t r a t e g y

the old models assumed, it was even more important to study them in their social context.

Only a very particular view of rationality considered cooperation irratio-

nal and failed to understand why it made sense to make sacrifi ces to punish

the uncooperative and free riders in order to uphold norms and sustain coop-

erative relationships. Many social and economic transactions would become

impossible if at every stage there was suspicion and reason to doubt another’s motives. The essence of trust was to knowingly and willingly accept a degree

of vulnerability, aware that trustees might intend harm but fi nding it more

profi table to assume that they did not. The evidence suggested that by and

large people would prefer to trust others than not to trust. There were for-

midable normative pressures to honor commitments once made, and a repu-

tation for untrustworthiness could prove to be a hindrance. Life became a

lot easier if the people with whom one was dealing trusted and could be

trusted in turn, saving the bother of complicated contracts and enforcement

issues. Trusting another did not necessarily assume good faith. The calculus

could be quite balanced. On occasion there might be no choice but to trust

someone, even though there were indicators to prompt suspicion, because

the alternative of not trusting was even more likely to lead to a bad result.

In other circumstances, with little information one way or another, accepting another’s trustworthiness would involve a leap of faith. This was why deception was deplored. It meant taking advantage of another’s trust, hiding mali-

cious intent behind a mask of good faith. Trust involved accepting evidence

of another’s intentions; deception involved faking this evidence. [^29]

So important was trust that even when clues were arriving thick and fast

that they were being deceived, individuals could stay in denial for a sur-

prising time. A confi dence trickster might be vulnerable to intensive prob-

ing and so would rely on those who were inclined to accept his story: the

woman yearning for love or the greedy looking for a get-rich-quick proposi-

tion. Research showed that people were “poor deception-detectors and yet are

overconfi dent of their ability to detect deception.” 30]] “Cognitive laziness” led to shortcuts that resulted in misapprehending people and situations, failing

to explore context, ignoring contradictions, and sticking with an early judg-

ment of another’s trustworthiness. 31]]

_Mentalization_

The ability to recognize different traits in people, to distinguish them according to their personalities, is essential to all social interaction. It might be b e y o n d r a t i o n a l c h o i c e

597

diffi cult to predict the responses of people to particular situations, but to the extent that it is possible to anticipate the responses of specifi c individuals, their behavior might be anticipated or even manipulated.

The process of developing theories about how other minds work has been

described as “mentalization.” Instead of assuming that other minds resem-

bled one’s own, by observing the behavior of others it became evident that

others had distinctive mental and emotional states. The quality of empathy,

of being able to feel as another feels, was drawn from the German _Einfühlung_ , which was about the process of feeling one’s way into an art object or another person. Empathy might be a precursor to sympathy, but it was not the same.

With empathy one could feel another’s pain; with sympathy one would also

itive human societies, by identifying some elemental features of strategic

behavior. Such behavior emerged out of social structures that invited con-

fl ict, recognized the distinctive attributes of potential opponents or allies, displayed suffi cient empathy to fi nd ways to infl uence their actions, and were able to prevail through deception or coalition as well as brute force. These features have regularly come to the fore as we have considered strategy in both theory and practice. We have also come across a number of defi nitions of strategy,

many of which are perfectly serviceable, although none quite capture all these elements. Some have been quite specifi c to particular spheres, notably the

military, referring to engagements, maps, and deployments. Others have been

more general, referring to the interaction of ends, ways and means, combina-

tions of long-term goals and courses of action, systems of expediencies and

forms of domination, dialectics of opposing wills and interdependent deci-

sion-making, relationships to environments, advanced problem-solving, and

a means of coping with uncertainty. The preface offered “the art of creating

power” as my short defi nition. This has the advantage of allowing the impact

of strategy to be measured as the difference between the outcome anticipated by reference to the prevailing balance of power and the actual outcome after

the application of strategy. It helps explain why underdogs fi nd strategy most challenging. It does not, however, provide guidance for practitioners. To this end this chapter explores the value of considering strategy as a story about

power told in the future tense from the perspective of a leading character.

Those who want to be sure that their strategy is well done can draw on

many forms of advice, from professional manuals to self-help books to spe-

cialist consultancies to academic journals. Some prescriptions are exhortatory while others are more analytical; some struggle to rise above banalities while others are couched in terms barely intelligible to lay readers lacking higher mathematics or the ability to penetrate postmodernist codes. Some insist on a paradigm shift. Others suggest nurturing an inspirational personality or urge close attention to detail. Faced with such diverse and often contradictory advice it is hard to avoid the conclusion that while strategy is undoubtedly a good

thing to have, it is also a hard thing to get right. The world of strategy is full of disappointment and frustration, of means not working and ends not reached.

The various strands of literature examined in this book all began con-

fi dently with a belief that given the right measures demanding objectives

could be achieved on a regular basis. The Napoleonic phenomenon led

Jomini and Clausewitz to explain to aspiring generals how they might win

decisive battles and so decide the fate of nations. The recollection of the

French Revolution and gathering social and political unrest encouraged the

fi rst professional revolutionaries to imagine equally decisive insurrections from which new forms of social order would emerge. Over a century later,

large American corporations—apparently unassailable and enjoying benign

market conditions—were encouraged by Chandler, Drucker, and Sloan to

look to strategy as a guide to the organizational structures and long-term

plans that could sustain this happy state of affairs.

In all three cases, experience undermined the foundations of this confi -

dence. Victory in battle did not necessarily lead to victory in war. The ruling classes found ways to meet popular demands for political and economic rights

that diverted revolutionary pressures. The comfortable position of American

manufacturers was rocked by international competition, notably—but not

solely—from Japan. Yet these setbacks did not lead to the initial frameworks

being abandoned. Military strategists continued to yearn for a route to deci-

sive victories even as they were frustrated by grinding campaigns of attrition or popular resistance and guerrilla ambushes. Revolutionaries continued to

seek ways to mobilize the broad masses to overthrow governments even as

the Western democracies legitimated expressions of discontent and paths to

608

t h e o r i e s o f s t r a t e g y

reform, and as these encouraged quite different and generally more productive types of political strategy. It was only in the business sphere that the fl aws in the early strategic models were so evident that they were soon left behind by a frenetic search for alternatives which came to involve a range of competing, often contradictory, and confusing propositions.

The problems experienced with strategy were a natural consequence of its

Enlightenment origins. Progressive rationalism, later identifi ed by Weber

as an unstoppable secular trend manifest in the rise of bureaucracies, was

expected to squeeze out emotions and romance, thereby removing intru-

sive sources of error and uncertainty. The prospect was one of human affairs

ordered on the basis of accumulated knowledge. But relevant knowledge was

hard to accumulate or present with suffi cient precision to guide practitioners, who were faced with a series of competing demands and uncertainties and

often had little real choice but to “muddle through.” [^1] The assumption of rationalism, infl uencing not only the theorizing but expectations of how it

would be received and acted upon, turned out to be inadequate.

Strategies were neither designed nor implemented in controlled environ-

ments. The longer the sequence of planned moves, the greater the number

of human agents who must act in particular ways, the more extensive the

ambition of the project, the more likely that something would go wrong.

Should the fi rst moves in the planned sequence of events fail to produce the intended effects matters could soon go awry. Situations would become more

complex and the actors more numerous and contrary. The chains of causa-

tion would become attenuated and then broken altogether. Without going

as far as Tolstoy, who dismissed the idea of strategy as presumptuous and

naïve, it was evident that successful outcomes would depend on trying to

affect a range of institutions, processes, personalities, and perceptions that would often be quite impervious to infl uence. Warning against the belief

that history was full of lessons, Gordon Wood argued that there was but one

big one: “Nothing ever works out quite the way its managers intended or

expected.” History taught “skepticism about people’s ability to manipulate

and control purposely their own destinies.” 2]] Strategies were not so much means of asserting control over situations but ways of coping with situations in which nobody was in total control.

_The Limits of Strategy_

Did this leave strategy with any value? “Plans are worthless,” observed

President Eisenhower, drawing on his military experience, “but planning is

s t o r i e s a n d s c r i p t s

609

everything.” 3 The same could be said about strategy]]. Without some prior deliberation it might be even harder to cope with the unexpected, pick up

the cues of a changing situation, challenge set assumptions, or consider the

implications of uncharacteristic behavior. If strategy is a fi xed plan that set out a reliable path to an eventual goal, then it is likely to be not only disappointing but also counterproductive, conceding the advantage to others

with greater fl exibility and imagination. Adding fl exibility and imagination, however, offers a better chance of keeping pace with a developing situation,

regularly re-evaluating risks and opportunities.

A productive approach to strategy requires recognizing its limits. This

applies not only to the benefi ts of strategy but also to its domain. Boundaries are required. As strategy has become so ubiquitous, so that every forward-looking decision might be worthy of the term, it now risks meaninglessness,

lacking any truly distinguishing feature. One obvious boundary is to insist

on its irrelevance in situations involving inanimate objects or simple tasks. It only really comes into play when elements of confl ict are present. Situations in which this confl ict is only latent are rarely approached in a truly strategic frame of mind. Rather than assume trouble people prefer instead to trust

others with the expectation of being trusted in turn. Within a familiar envi-

ronment, working with an “in-group,” overtly strategic behavior can lead to

resentment and resistance without commensurate gain. People can be at the

wrong end of power relationships without either realizing or caring, because

of the way they have been encouraged to think about their life circumstances

or because of their habitual reluctance to challenge established hierarchies

and conventions. What makes the difference, so that strategy comes to the

fore, is the recognition of confl ict. Some event, or shift in social attitudes or patterns of behavior, can challenge what had previously been taken for

granted. Familiar situations may be seen with fresh eyes and those previously part of the “in-group” come to be viewed with suspicion as defectors to the

“out-group.”

If emerging situations of confl ict bring strategy into the picture, a desire to play down confl ict can take it out. This can even be the case with offi cial documents with strategy in the title which are largely designed to demonstrate a capacity for long-term thought. In these documents strategy is

packaged as an authoritative forward look, refl ecting the approved views of

a government or company. Hew Strachan has complained of how strategy

has come to be abused in this way, at the expense of its original role as a

link between ends and means. By extending strategy into all governmen-

tal endeavors the word is “robbed” of its meaning leaving only “banalities”

behind. 4 Certainly many “strategy” documents deliberately avoid the topic,]]

610

t h e o r i e s o f s t r a t e g y

lack focus, cover too many dissimilar or only loosely connected issues and themes, address multiple audiences to the satisfaction of none, and refl ect

nuanced bureaucratic compromises. They are often about issues that might

have to be addressed rather than ways of dealing with specifi c problems.

Consequently, their half-lives are often short. To the extent that such docu-

ments have any strategic content they are about a broad orientation to the

environment, what became known in business strategy as “positioning.” It

may well be that in a broadly stable and satisfactory environment, in which

goals are being realized with relative ease, there may be little need for anything sharper and bolder. Only at moments of environmental instability, as

latent confl ict becomes actual, when real choices have to be made does some-

thing resembling a true strategy become necessary.

So what turns something that is not quite strategy into strategy is a sense

of actual or imminent instability, a changing context that induces a sense

of confl ict. Strategy therefore starts with an existing state of affairs and only gains meaning by an awareness of how, for better or worse, it could be different. This view is quite different from those that assume strategy must

be about reaching some prior objective. It may well be more concerned

with coping with some dire crisis or preventing further deterioration in an

already stressful situation. So the fi rst requirement might be one of survival.

This is why as a practical matter strategy is best understood modestly, as

moving to the “next stage” rather than to a defi nitive and permanent con-

clusion. The next stage is a place that can be realistically reached from the current stage. That place may not necessarily be better, but it will still be an improvement upon what could have been achieved with a lesser strategy or no strategy at all. It will also be suffi ciently stable to be a base from which to prepare to move to the stage after that. This does not mean that

it is easy to manage without a view of a desired end state. Without some

sense of where the journey should be leading it will be diffi cult to evaluate alternative outcomes. Like a grandmaster at chess, a gifted strategist will

be able to see the future possibilities inherent in the next moves, and think through successive stages. The ability to think ahead is therefore a valuable attribute in a strategist, but the starting point will still be the challenges of the present rather than the promise of the future. With each move from

one state of affairs to another, the combination of ends and means will be

reappraised. Some means will be discarded and new ones found, while some

ends will turn out to be beyond reach even as unexpected opportunities

come into view. Even when what had been assumed to be the ultimate goal

is reached, strategy will not stop. Victory in a climactic event such as a

battle, an insurrection, an election, a sporting fi nal, or a business acquisition s t o r i e s a n d s c r i p t s

611

will mean a move to a new and more satisfactory state but not the end of struggle. What has gone before will set the terms for the next set of encounters. The effort required to achieve victory may have left resources depleted.

A crushed rebellion may add to the resentment of the oppressed; bruising

election campaigns can hamper coalition formation; hostile takeovers make

merging two companies more diffi cult.

One reason why it is so diffi cult to anticipate how situations might

develop over many stages results from the need to address many relation-

ships. Strategy is often presented as being solely about opponents and rivals.

In the fi rst instance, however, colleagues and subordinates must agree on the strategy and how it should be implemented. Achieving an internal consensus

often requires great strategic skill and must be a priority because of the weaknesses caused by divisions, but the accommodation of different interests and

perspectives can result in a compromised product—suboptimal when deal-

ing with a capable opponent. The larger the circle of cooperation required,

including third parties who might become allies, the harder it can become to

reach agreement. While there can be tensions among supposed friends, there

can also be areas of shared interest that provide the basis for a negotiation.

Rival states might prefer to avoid all-out war, political parties to maintain standards of civility, and businesses to avoid pushing prices down to unprof-itable levels.This interaction between cooperation and confl ict is at the heart of all strategy. There is a spectrum marked by complete consensus (absence

of any disputes) at one end and complete control (disputes smothered by one

party’s domination) at the other. Both extremes are rare and almost certainly unstable as circumstances change and new types of interest emerge. In practice, the choice may well be between degrees of conciliation or coercion. As

the best way of coping with superior strength is often to put together a coalition or break up that of the opponent, strategy is apt to involve compromises and negotiations. “The pursuit of relative power,” Timothy Crawford has

observed, “is as much about subtracting and dividing as about adding and

multiplying.” This can require diffi cult forms of accommodation to keep a

party neutral and away from the enemy camp. 5]] All this explains why strategy is an art and not a science. It comes into play when situations are uncertain, unstable, and thus unpredictable.

_System 1 Strategy and System 2 Strategy_

Developments in cognitive psychology mean that we now know much more

than before about how human beings cope with uncertain situations. They

612

t h e o r i e s o f s t r a t e g y

encourage the view that strategic thinking can and often does start in the subconscious before it breaks into conscious thought. It can originate as

apparently intuitive judgments, refl ecting what can now be labeled System

1 thinking. System 1 strategies draw on an ability to read situations and see possibilities that less-strategic intelligences would miss. This form of strategic reasoning has been appreciated since classical times. It was manifested as m ē tis, exemplifi ed by Odysseus, who was resourceful, coped with ambiguity, and used artful language to lead the in-group and disorient the out-group.

Napoleon spoke of the _coup d’œil_ as the “gift of being able to see at a glance the possibilities offered by the terrain.” It was at the heart of Clausewitz’s belief in military genius, a “highly developed mental aptitude” that allowed

the great general to pick the right moment and place for attack. Jon Sumida

described Clausewitz’s concept of genius as involving “a combination of

rational intelligence and subrational intellectual and emotional faculties that make up intuition.” It was the only basis of decision in the “face of diffi cult circumstances such as inadequate information, great complexity, high levels

of contingency, and severe negative consequences in the event of failure.” 6]]

Napoleon described this as an inborn talent, but Clausewitz saw that it could also be developed through experience and education.

In one of his last published articles, the philosopher Isaiah Berlin spoke

up for instinct and fl air, challenging the idea that good judgment in politics could be scientifi c and founded on “indubitable knowledge”. 7]] “In the realm of political action,” Berlin concluded, “laws are far and few indeed: skills are everything.” The key skill was the ability to grasp what made a situation unique. Great political fi gures were able to “understand the character

of a particular movement, of a particular individual, of a unique state of

affairs, of a unique atmosphere, of some particular combination of economic,

political, personal factors.” This grasp of the interplay of human beings and impersonal forces, sense of the specifi c over the general, and capacity to

anticipate the consequential “tremors” of actions involved a special sort of

judgment. This was, he averred, “semi-instinctive.” He described a form of

political intelligence, closely resembling m ē tis and capturing the best of

System 1 thinking:

. . . a capacity for integrating a vast amalgam of constantly changing,

multicolored, evanescent, perpetually overlapping data, too many, too

swift, too intermingled to be caught and pinned down and labeled

like so many individual butterfl ies. To integrate in this sense is to see

the data (those identifi ed by scientifi c knowledge as well as by direct

perception) as elements in a single pattern, with their implications,

s t o r i e s a n d s c r i p t s

613

to see them as symptoms of past and future possibilities, to see them pragmatically—that is, in terms of what you or others can or will do

to them, and what they can or will do to others or to you.

It was a capacity that could be lost by a focus on formal methodologies and

a determination to squeeze out the intuition and stress the analytical. “Many of the strategists I have examined,” observed Bruce Kuklick of contributors

to postwar American security policy, “were essentially apolitical, in that they lacked what I must call for want of a better phrase _elementary political sense_ . It is almost as if they sought to learn in a seminar room or from cogitation what

only instinct, experience and savvy could teach.” 8

The quality that often comes with political judgment is the ability to

persuade others to follow a particular course. Indeed, for those who are

not Napoleons, who cannot expect orders to be accepted without ques-

tion, shrewd judgment is of little value unless it is coupled with an abil-

ity to express its meaning to those who must follow its imperatives. It

is at this point that strategy moves from intuition to deliberation, from

knowing that a particular course is the right one to fi nding the argu-

ments to explain why this must be so. So system 2 thinking is needed

for those situations that are too complex and unique for System 1. Such

circumstances require that alternative arguments be weighed and mea-

sured against each other to identify a credible course of action. Thus, for

the most part, strategy must be in the realm of System 2, but that may

only be in terms of turning what are essentially System 1 judgments into

persuasive arguments.

The reason this book has returned so often to questions of language and

communication is because strategy is meaningless without them. Not only

does strategy need to be put into words so that others can follow, but it works through affecting the behavior of others. Thus it is always about persuasion, whether convincing others to work with you or explaining to adversaries the

consequences if they do not. Pericles gained authority for his ability to make a reasoned case in a democratic setting; Machiavelli urged princes to develop compelling arguments; Churchill’s speeches gave the British people a sense

of purpose in war. Brute force or economic inducements may play their part,

but their impact may be lost without clarity about what must be done to

avoid punishment or gain reward. “Power is actualized only where word and

deed have not parted company,” observed Hannah Arendt, “where words are

not empty and deeds not brutal, where words are not used to veil intentions

but to disclose realities, and deeds are not used to violate and destroy but to

establish relations and create new realities.” 9

614

t h e o r i e s o f s t r a t e g y

The greatest power is that which achieves its effects without notice. This comes about when established structures appear settled and uncontentious,

part of the natural and generally benign order of things, even to those who

might be supposed to be disadvantaged. [^10] The ability of elites to render essentially sectional interests as a general good so that their satisfaction is taken for granted and put beyond challenge has been a source of intense frustration to radicals. The limited revolutionary zeal of the masses has been explained

by grand stories—labeled as formulas, myths, ideologies, paradigms, and

eventually narratives—which assumed that since people could not grasp

objective reality they must depend on interpretative constructs, and those

best placed to infl uence those constructs could acquire enormous power. The

radicals sought to develop strategies promoting alternative, healthier forms

of consciousness, contradicting any suggestion that the existing scheme of

things must be accepted without question as natural and enduring rather

than constructed and contingent. This question of how best to affect the

attitudes of others has come to be seen to be relevant to all aspects of strategy and not just efforts to turn the existing order upside down. Partisan politicians have worked to set agendas and frame issues, offering damaging stories

about opponents while portraying a party’s own candidates in the best pos-

sible light. This “narrative turn” has also been evident in the military and

business arenas, refl ected in calls for sensitivity to “hearts and minds” in counterinsurgency, corporate lobbyists challenging regulatory restraints, or

managers trying to convince employees that they will benefi t from drastic

organizational changes. Not only are stories instruments of strategy, they

also give form to strategy. Reinforced by cognitive theories and the role of

interpretative constructs and scripts in organizing attitudes and behavior,

narratives have moved to the fore in the contemporary strategic literature in military, politics, and business. In order to come to terms with recent trends in thinking about strategy we need to come to terms with stories.

_The Trouble with Stories_

In his essay “The Trouble with Stories,” Charles Tilly considered the persistent human tendency to seek explanations in terms of stories about individuals,

along with collectives such as churches or states and even abstractions such as classes or regions. These stories would tell of deliberate, conscious, and often successful acts to achieve defi nite goals. They satisfi ed their audience, including social scientists, far too easily. All that seemed to be required was a degree of plausibility, recognition of the constraints of time and circumstance,

s t o r i e s a n d s c r i p t s

615

and a match with cultural expectations. Yet, Tilly warned, stories had limited explanatory power. The most signifi cant cause-effect relations tended to be “indirect, incremental, interactive, unintended, collective, or mediated by the nonhuman environment rather than being direct, willed consequences

of individual action.” The demand for stories encouraged analysis in terms

of actors making deliberate choices among well-defi ned alternatives, when

actual decision-making was likely to be far less calculating and deliberate,

more improvised, often quite wobbly. Social scientists had a responsibility

to seek something better. Tilly was not optimistic. Brains, he noted, would

“store, retrieve and manipulate information about social processes” in terms

of standard stories, thereby encouraging accounts of complex events in terms

of the “interactions of self-motivated objects.” If this was the case, Tilly at least hoped for superior stories, doing justice to the impersonal and collective forces at work as well as the human, and making the appropriate connections

with time, places, actors, and actions outside their purview. Better still, we should tell stories about stories, giving stories context and considering how

they were generated. 11

Business historians have come to warn of accepting at face value narra-

tives, such as Sloan’s _My Life with General Motors_ , that suggest that challenging decisions were matters of purely rational choice. Whether or not such

narratives exaggerate the role of senior managers they leave the impression

of inevitability, understating the possibility of different decisions leading to alternative outcomes. [^12] Daniel Raff advocates recreating the choices of the past, looking at historical events as “sequences of challenges to be addressed rather than as initiatives which have already happened.” This would mean

recognizing the alternatives that were available in the past and how actors

made sense of them. 13]] Kahneman has also observed that although good stories “provide a simple and coherent account of people’s actions and inten-

tions,” this encourages a readiness to “interpret behavior as a manifestation of general propensities and personality traits—causes that you can readily

match to effects.” As an example he cites analyses of corporate success. The

numerous management books full of these stories “consistently exaggerate

the impact of leadership style and management practices.” He suggests that

luck is as important a factor if not more so. The result of these biases is that when it comes to “explaining the past and in predicting the future, we focus

on the causal role of skill and neglect the role of luck. We are therefore prone to an illusion of control.” He further notes the paradox that it “is easier to construct a coherent story when you know little, when there are fewer pieces

to fi t into the puzzle.” This reinforces the tendency to neglect factors about which little is known, thereby encouraging overconfi dence. 14]]

616

t h e o r i e s o f s t r a t e g y

These fl awed stories of the past shape our predictions of the future. In this he draws attention to the work of Nassim Taleb, who stresses the importance

of unexpected and random events (which he calls “black swans”) for which

inadequate provision has been made because they are so out of line with

past experience. Yet Taleb also acknowledges a contradiction in his method,

for although he points to forms of narrative fallacy he also uses stories “to illustrate our gullibility about stories and our preference for the dangerous compression of narratives.” This is because metaphors and stories are “far

more potent (alas) than ideas; they are also easier to remember and more fun

to read.” As a result: “You need a story to displace a story.” 15]]

We have seen in this book how familiar stories with a strong message turn

out on closer examination to be either fabricated or subject to alternative

interpretations offering different lessons. David and Goliath is now under-

stood to be about what an underdog might achieve, but it was originally

about the importance of belief in God. Odysseus began as a celebration of a

shrewd and crafty intelligence, but as he morphed into the Roman Ulysses

he came to exemplify treachery and trickery. Plato outdid the sophists at

their own game, making his claim for a pure discipline of philosophy by

recasting those who came before him as caring more for money than truth.

Milton sought to make sense of the Creation by constructing a Machiavellian

Satan who many came to fi nd a more compelling character than his worthy

God. Clausewitz looked at Napoleon’s ill-fated Russian campaign as fl awed

strategy; Tolstoy saw it as proof that there could be no such thing as strategy.

Liddell Hart collected stories of battle and then gave them his own twist to

validate his indirect approach. John Boyd and his acolytes took the idea of

the blitzkrieg—as exemplifi ed by the German success in Europe in 1940—

stripped it of context by ignoring its failure in the East, and turned it into a model for future warfare. Marx complained about the persistent infl uence

of the French Revolution but could not quite escape from it himself. As his

predictions about the development of capitalism turned out to be fl awed, his followers contorted themselves to prove that this was still scientifi c history and so bound to be vindicated. The traditional teaching of business strategy

depended on stories known as case histories. The management gurus, from

Frederick Taylor to Tom Peters, knew that they could make their points

with a good tale that could illustrate their essential points. The very human temptation to seize on some specifi c incident to make a general point—demonstrated by the uses of anecdotes about Honda—led invariably to overstated

conclusions that were far more contingent than their tellers would allow.

“Research suggests that power comes less from knowing the right stories

than from knowing how and [how] well to tell them: what to leave out,

s t o r i e s a n d s c r i p t s

617

what to fi ll in, when to revise and when to challenge, and whom to tell or not to tell.” [^16] In terms of everyday human interaction, persuasion through storytelling can be an important skill, especially when engaging those with simi-

lar backgrounds and interests. When engaging those who might be skeptical

or suspicious, with separate frames of reference, they may be of less value.

Moreover, narratives deliberately manufactured to achieve some desired effect risk appearing forced and contrived. They suffer from all the problems once

associated with propaganda, which lost credibility precisely because of its

blatant attempt to infl uence how others thought and behaved.

Indeed, the current enthusiasm for “strategic narratives” might fade with

greater appreciation of their roots in what was once unashamedly and posi-

tively called propaganda, before it acquired totalitarian connotations. These narratives have to work within all the previously described constraints. With suffi cient ambiguity, the same strategic story might hold a group together

or advance a political project but then fall apart as soon as clarity is required, empirical tests present themselves, or contradictory messages emerge. When

it comes to “battles of narratives,” what matters is not only their inherent

quality but the resources behind them, refl ected in the capacity for an organization to propagate its own myths and censor or counter contrary claims.

Narratives are neither “fundamentally subversive nor hegemonic.” They can

be told effectively—and ineffectually—by authorities and their opponents.

They are not precise strategic instruments because they can convey a range

of messages, not all of which may be understood, and narrative devices such

as metaphors and irony can cause confusion. The meaning of stories can be

ambiguous and some interpretations may undercut the storyteller. Audiences

may focus on minor features or impose their own experiences on the narra-

tive. Familiar stories which apparently convey one message can be given a

mischievous twist by groups promoting an apparently contrary cause. 17]] We can recall the classicist Francis Cornford’s defi nition of propaganda: “That branch of the art of lying which consists in very nearly deceiving your friends

without quite deceiving your enemies.” 18

_Scripts_

These ambiguous aspects of narratives explain their limitations as strategic

instruments. Are there ways of thinking about them that might help give

them more value? We can assume that it is much easier to control for prob-

lems of meaning and interpretation when the audience is quite small and

already sharing much by way of culture and purposes. Reference was made in

618

t h e o r i e s o f s t r a t e g y

the last chapter to the concept of an internalized script as a source of orientation to a new situation. This concept has been infl uential in the psychology and artifi cial intelligence communities but less so in the strategic. Strictly speaking, the concept refers to stereotypical situations which set expectations for appropriate behavior. Scripts can be either weak, for example, deciding

that somebody fi ts a certain personality type, or strong, in anticipating a

whole sequence of events. In the original concept, scripts were about drawing on stored knowledge that led to almost automatic responses—which might

turn out to be wholly inappropriate. Scripts can, however, be taken as start-

ing points for deliberate action and even be developed and internalized by

groups as they consider together a developing situation. Studies of scripts

have therefore considered how individuals respond to organizational rou-

tines, such as appraisals, or to events which they are unlikely to have experienced ever before, such as fi res in a public place. This work has demonstrated the hold scripts can have and the diffi culty of persuading people who have

committed to a particular script to abandon it. Scripts may be a natural way

of responding to new situations, but they can also be seriously misleading.

Thus, if people need to behave abnormally, they need to know that they are

in an abnormal situation. 19

The advantages of scripts for our purposes are twofold. First, the concept

provides a way of addressing the problem about how individuals enter into

new situations, give them meaning, and decide how to behave. Second, it has a natural link with performance and narrative. Indeed, Abelson discussed scripts in terms of being composed of a series of scenes made up of linked vignettes

that are as likely to originate in reading, including fi ction, as experience. [^20]

One use of the idea in a wider context comes from Avner Offer’s account

of the origins of the Great War, in which he describes the importance of

“honor” as a motivation and asks why it took precedence over survival. It was not as if the German High Command was confi dent of victory. They knew

that the planned offensive was something of a gamble, even though they

could think of no other way to wage the war. In the war counsels of Berlin in 1914, the view was that Germany dared not hold back. It had done so with

the last crisis, and if it did so again its reputation would be lost. The only prospect would be an ignominious and decadent decline. The consequences

were uncertain, but a fi ne intention would provide its own vindication. The

German decision to go to war—and those equally belligerent decisions it

provoked—was, Offer asserts, an “expressive rather than instrumental act.”

In this respect war was the outcome of a sequence of insults, a “chain of honorable reactions” which none felt able to ignore. Offer explains the emphasis on honor in deciding on war and then the military mobilization of whole

s t o r i e s a n d s c r i p t s

619

societies on the basis of scripts. The honor script was not “overt” but was infl uential, sanctioning a “reckless attitude” and creating “a powerful social pressure to subordinate prudential considerations and to conform.” This

script, he suggests, was derivative of an even more implicit dueling script,

which had its own sequence. When honor was challenged or questioned in

some episode, the remedy was violence “in the case of nation-states, preceded by the polite maneuvers and language of diplomacy.” If “satisfaction” was

denied, there would be a “loss of reputation, status, [and] honor,” which

would lead to “humiliation and shame.” This script proved to be powerful.

It “provided a narrative in which decisions could be communicated, a jus-

tifi cation and legitimation for sacrifi ce that everyone could understand and accept.” So what started as an emotion among the few at the top could be

transmitted through the culture. So powerful was this script that those in its grip were blinded to alternative scripts based on “other forms of courage and risk taking; to those of timely concession, of conciliation, cooperation, and trust.” [^21]

In this respect, a strategic script in a System 1 sense can be considered a

largely internalized foundation for attempts to give situations meaning and

suggest appropriate responses. These scripts may be implicit or just taken for granted, as in the assumptions that the logic of war is a battle of annihilation leading to enemy capitulation, that sea power must be about command of the

sea, that the best form of counterinsurgency addresses hearts and minds, that appeasement always leads to an impression of weakness, or that an arms race

always escalates into war. These are stereotypes that can often serve as substitutes for original thought or consideration of the particularities of situations.

While they may be validated if acted upon, they may turn out to be wrong. At

a less elevated level, scripts may be about the correct sequence of operations in a military campaign, the effect of state violence on popular movements, forming community organizations, securing a presidential nomination, managing

organizational change, identifying the optimum time and place for a new

product launch, or making the fi rst move in a hostile takeover.

The point about these scripts is that if not challenged they may result in

predictable behavior and miss variations in the context that should demand

original responses. As I argued earlier, strategy really kicks in when there is something different and unfamiliar about the situation. System 1 scripts may

be a natural starting point, but they may benefi t from a System 2 appraisal

that considers why the normal script might not work this time. In this

respect, following established scripts risks strategic failure.

System 2 scripts should be more deserving of the adjective “strategic.” For

dramatists, a compelling narrative is something to be worked on and refi ned

620

t h e o r i e s o f s t r a t e g y

rather than merely a way of dignifying the inchoate mutterings of ordinary folk. Instead of being a subconscious set of internalized scripts, these scripts may be seen as acts of conscious communication. They do not need to take

the form of screenplays in which each actor speaks in turn, but they should

have a composed quality indicating the expected interaction between the

main actors. They may be rooted in the past or draw on well-known events,

but they have to take the present as a starting point and project forward.

These strategies are stories about the future, starting with imaginative fi ction but with an aspiration to nonfi ction.

Jerome Bruner’s discussion of narratives also illustrates the possibilities

and limitations of strategic scripts. He suggested the following require-

ments. First, though they may not present reality accurately, they must meet

the standard of verisimilitude, that is, the appearance of being true. Second, they will predispose an audience to a particular interpretation of events and an anticipation of what is to come. They do not involve empirical verifi cation or steps in a logical sequence, but they create their own imperatives.

“Narrative necessity” is the counterpart of “logical necessity.” They can use devices such as suspense, foreshadowing, and fl ashbacks, and be allowed more ambiguity and uncertainty than formal analyses. Third, while they cannot be

constituted as a formal proof of any general theory, they can be used to dem-

onstrate a principle, uphold a norm, or offer guidance for the future. These, however, must arise naturally out of the narrative and not necessarily be

stated explicitly in conclusion. It is often impossible to know where a good

story is leading until the destination is reached. The audience must be taken to the required point by the “narrative imperative.” According to Bruner,

an “innovative story teller goes beyond the obvious.” To get the audience’s

attention, the story must breach the expectations created by an “implicit

canonical script” to contain an element of the unusual and unexpected. 22

The purpose of such a strategic story is not solely to predict events but to

convince others to act in such a way that the story will follow its proposed

course. If it fails to convince, the inherent prediction will certainly be wrong.

As with other stories, these must relate to the audience’s culture, experi-

ence, beliefs, and aspirations. To engage, they must ring true and survive

examination in terms of their internal coherence and consistency (“narrative

probability”). They must also resonate with the historical and cultural understandings of their intended audience (“narrative fi delity”). [^23] The main challenges for strategic narratives lie in their potentially brutal encounter with reality, which may require early adjustment, and the need to address mul-

tiple audiences, which risks incoherence. 24 It might be possible to reconcile

apparently incompatible demands through a rhetorical trick or to combine

s t o r i e s a n d s c r i p t s

621

optimistic assumptions on top of each other, but such devices can soon be exposed. There needs to be candor and little make-believe.

What about the criticisms of Tilly and Kahneman that our dependence

on stories leads us to exaggerate the importance of human agency, to assume

that effects fl ow from the deliberate acts of the central characters in our stories (often ourselves) rather than large impersonal forces or chance events or questions of timing and happenstance that could never be part of the starting narrative? The answer is that ignoring these factors certainly makes for bad

history but not necessarily bad strategy. When we seek to understand the

present it is unwise to assume that things are the way they are solely because strong actors wished them to be thus, but when we look forward to the future

we have little choice but to identify a way forward dependent upon human

agency which might lead to a good outcome. It is as well to avoid illusions

of control, but in the end all we can do is act as if we can infl uence events. To do otherwise is to succumb to fatalism.

Moreover, the unexpected and the accidental can be managed if provi-

sion is made from the start to accommodate them. A strategic plan, relating

available means to desired ends through a series of steps which if followed

carefully and in sequence produces the desired outcome, suggests a predict-

able world, with cause and effect known in advance. One large conclusion

of this book is that such plans struggle to survive their encounters with an

awkward reality. A script may share with a plan an anticipated sequence

of events, but as it moves from System 1 to System 2, from a subconscious

assumption to a deliberate composition, it can incorporate the possibility of chance events and anticipate the interaction of a number of players over an

extended period of time. This requires an unfi nished quality. The script must leave considerable scope for improvisation. There is only one action that can be anticipated with any degree of certainty, and that is the fi rst move of the central player for whom the strategy has been devised. Whether the plot will

unfold as intended will then depend on not only the acuity of the starting

assumptions but also whether other players follow the script or deviate sig-

nifi cantly from it.

_Scripts: Strategic and Dramatic_

Once strategies are considered as narratives a close relationship with drama

becomes evident. David Barry and Michael Elmes consider strategy, “one of

the most prominent, infl uential and costly stories told in organizations.” It carries elements of “theatrical drama, the historical novel, futurist fantasy, 622

t h e o r i e s o f s t r a t e g y

and autobiography,” with “parts” prescribed for different characters. “Its traditional emphasis on forecasting aligns it with visionary novels having a

prospective, forward-looking focus.” 25 If this is the case then there might be]]

guidance for strategists in the methods by which dramatists work out their

plots and write their scripts.

A good place to begin is Robert McKee’s guide to the art of storytelling

for movies. 26 The starting point is exactly the same as with strategy]]. The story, like the strategy, moves forward with confl ict. Scripts fail, he warns, when they are marked by “either a glut of meaningless and absurdly violent

confl ict, or a vacancy of meaningful and honestly expressed confl ict.” This means recognizing that even within an apparently harmonious organization

there is always some confl ict. There is never enough space, time, or resources to go round, leaving aside the forms of confl ict that result from discordant personalities and a clash of egos (which a successful organizational politician will also need to understand). Confl ict does not necessarily lead to violence and mayhem. The confl ict may be within the main character, which is

refl ected in the strategist’s need to choose. As McKee observes, the interesting and challenging choices are not those between good and evil but those

between irreconcilable goods or two evils. The challenge of choice, however,

is to know what can be done to achieve the preferred outcome, so that aiming

for one does not lead to the other. This is the role of the plot, so that when

“confronted by a dozen branching possibilities” the correct path is chosen.

The plot will contain its own internal laws of probability. The choices faced by the protagonists must emerge naturally out of the world as described. The

plot represents the dramatist’s “choice of events and their design in time.”

The strategist must also stick closely to what McKee calls the “archplot,”

in which “motivated actions cause effects that in turn become the causes of

yet other effects, thereby interlinking the various levels of confl ict in a chain reaction of episodes to the story climax, expressing the interconnectedness of reality.”

In drama, plots provide the structure that holds stories together and

gives meaning to particular events. Aristotle in his _Poetics_ described a plot as an “arrangement of incidents” that should have an inner unity. The story

should not contain anything of irrelevance and it must maintain its credibil-

ity throughout. This required that the key players stay in character. Aristotle insisted that cause and effect should be explicable within the terms of the

story rather than as the result of some artifi cial, external intervention. The

“function of the poet” was in relating not what had happened but what could

happen, to show what was possible “according to the law of probability or

necessity.” [^27]

s t o r i e s a n d s c r i p t s

623

The features of a good plot are therefore shared between drama and strategy: confl ict, convincing characters and credible interactions, sensitivity to the impact of chance, and a whole set of factors that no plan can

anticipate or accommodate in advance. In both, the line between fi ction

and nonfi ction can be blurred. A dramatist may attempt to reconstruct real

events by showing what might have happened, while the strategist opens

with a current reality but must then imagine how it could be changed.

In neither case is there value in a wonderful and compelling narrative

that falls fl at and fails to engage its intended audience. A story that is too clever, convoluted, experimental, or shocking may fail to connect, produce an appalled counterreaction, or convey the wrong set of messages. In

strategy as in drama, a poor plot can result from incredible characters, too

much disparate activity, too many discordant points of view, events mov-

ing too slowly or too fast, confusing links, or obvious gaps.

There are, however, important differences between the dramatist and

strategist. These can be illustrated by an example. In 1921, secretary of

the interior Albert Fall took bribes from oil executives to hand over leases

to drill for oil under the Teapot Dome rock formation in Wyoming. The

press picked up the story because of rumblings from those within the oil

industry denied the opportunity to bid for the reserves, although one news-

paper used evidence to blackmail rather than reveal. Fall refused to answer

any questions, and the government tried to prevent progress. Ultimately,

a Congressional panel concluded that the leases “were executed under

circumstances indicating fraud and corruption.” This was determined

through tedious investigations, depending on a keen understanding of

institutional processes. [^28] One anti-corruption fi ghter in the Senate was Burton Wheeler of Montana, a lawyer who had made his name fi ghting

for workers’ rights and against corruption and had acted as prosecutor for

another Congressional investigation into corruption at the Department of

Justice. An unsuccessful attempt was made to discredit him through alle-

gations that he had accepted a fee from a client to help secure government

oil concessions. [^29]

Wheeler was said to be the model for Jefferson Smith, the hero of Frank

Capra’s movie, _Mr. Smith Goes to Washington_ . In the movie, Smith, the head of the state’s Boy Rangers, is naïve and idealistic. He is sent by the boss of the local political machine (James Taylor), to go to Washington as a replacement

for a recently deceased Senator in the mistaken belief that he will be easy to manipulate. The state’s other Senator, Joseph Paine—once a good friend of

Smith’s father and a fellow idealist—has been corrupted by power. Smith

proposes a bill to create a boys’ camp in his home state, but the chosen site 624

t h e o r i e s o f s t r a t e g y

is one Taylor has found for a corrupt dam-building scheme. Taylor, therefore, forces a reluctant Paine to denounce Smith as planning to profi t from the bill at the expense of the boys he claims to champion. The plan almost works.

A disconsolate Smith almost gives up until his previously skeptical aide,

Clarissa Saunders, persuades him to take a stand. As Paine is about to call for a vote to expel Smith from the Senate, Smith begins to fi libuster, hoping to get the message about corruption to the people of his state. Though Smith

stays on his feet, Taylor is able to use strong-arm tactics to prevent the message getting out. Paine prepares the fi nal blow by bringing in to the Senate hundreds of letters and telegrams demanding Smith’s expulsion. Before collapsing exhausted, Smith insists that he will continue fi ghting “even if this room gets fi lled with lies like these, and the Taylors and all their armies

come marching into this place. Somebody’ll listen to me.” Paine is shocked.

He tries to shoot himself and then exclaims that he is the one who should

be expelled. He confesses all. Smith is now a hero and his Senate career is

assured.

The movie contrasted the manipulative business trusts who put them-

selves beyond democratic accountability, through their control of party

machines and a supine media, with the decent aspirations of ordinary folk.

It conveyed distaste for Machiavellian political methods, wiles and ruses,

pretense and deception, while applauding those who were straightforward,

principled, and brave. It demonstrated how a good man could defeat evil

lurking in the body politic. Although Capra was a Republican, the script

was written by a communist, Sidney Buchman. Capra had found it expedi-

ent to play down Buchman’s role, and he appears to have been happy with

the movie as a simple morality tale, with the good rewarded and the bad

punished. Buchman believed that his script was a challenge to dictatorship

and emphasized “the spirit of vigilance which is necessary if one believes in

democracy the refusal to surrender even before small things.” 30

Joseph Breen, the enforcer of the movie industry’s Production Code

Administration, 31]] was at fi rst hostile to the Senate’s portrayal as “if not deliberately crooked . . . completely controlled by lobbyists with special interests.”

Aware that he needed to avoid the impression of political censorship, Breen

accepted it as a “grand yarn” so long as most Senators were shown to be “fi ne, upstanding, citizens who labor long and tirelessly for the best interests of the nation.” [^32] Nonetheless, when fi rst screened, senators (including Wheeler) and journalists were outraged. State Department offi cials feared that U.S. institutions were made to look ridiculous. The public—abroad as well as in the

United States— was caught up in the brilliance of Capra’s storytelling and

accepted his claim that the movie idealized American democracy. 33]] Ronald s t o r i e s a n d s c r i p t s

625

Reagan almost modeled himself on Jefferson Smith, even as president quoting the line about fi ghting for lost causes. [^34]

For Capra’s purposes, Smith appeared as idealistic and a-strategic. His

strategic advice came from Saunders, fi rst mischievously and then lovingly.

In a key scene, she fi nds Smith alone at the Lincoln Memorial, bemoaning

the discrepancy between the “fancy words . . . carved in stone” and the lies he faced. She urges him not to quit. All the “good in the world” comes from

“fools with faith.” In the original screenplay she appeals to “a little fellow called David [who] walked out with only a sling-shot—but he had the _truth_

on his side.” 35 In the fi]] nal version she has a strategy: “A forty foot dive into a tub of water, but I think you can do it.” This strategy works for an underdog who must survive the stronger side’s push for a quick victory. Paine, a

master of the rulebook, is surprised by the fi libuster. Smith knows enough

not to yield the fl oor and so was not caught by Paine’s request for him to do just that. The second part of Saunders’s plan fails. As Smith speaks to encourage people in his state to “kick Mister Taylor’s machine to kingdom come,”

Taylor observes: “He won’t get started! I’ll make public opinion out there in fi ve hours. I’ve done it all my life!” He is even able to suppress the brave effort by the Boy Rangers to distribute their own paper. What actually makes the

difference is the comparative fragility of the coalitions. That between Taylor and Paine breaks as the senator is reminded of his lost idealism. For his part, Smith is helped by a kindly vice president, who lets Smith get started on

his fi libuster and offers friendly smiles as he becomes weary. 36]] The features of a strategy are therefore all present, even if not always explicit. They have to be to give the plot some credibility and to show that Smith was able, to

a degree, to shape his own success. Where the drama takes over is in the

compression of events, the lack of boring processes (such as the painstaking

investigations of the Teapot Dome scandal), and a satisfactory conclusion

dependent upon a sudden change of heart coming at the very last moment

when it might have made a difference.

The dramatist controls the plot, manipulating the behavior of all parties

and introducing elements of chance and coincidence to move the story to

a predetermined conclusion. She sets boundaries to reduce the numbers of

tangents and loose ends. All the main characters are under her control. She

can decide how they meet and their interactions, which can be complicated

through misunderstanding at crucial moments and then transformed by

freak accidents or serendipitous encounters. She knows when there is going

to be a surprising twist, a shocking revelation that presents a character in a completely new light, an accident that interferes with an apparently perfect

plan, or an extraordinary opportunity that allows the hero to escape a terrible 626

t h e o r i e s o f s t r a t e g y

fate in the nick of time. She can introduce minor characters to make a point with complete confi dence that they need never be seen again. She can hint

at things to come, knowing that an attentive reader will pick up the clues or appreciate their relevance. By sustaining suspense to the end, she can ensure a thrilling denouement. Audiences expect a proper conclusion, which pulls

together the distinct strands of the story, explains puzzles, and brings the

suspense to an end. There may be a moral lesson, as evil characters get their comeuppance while the good are rewarded, or else deliberate moral ambiguity, confi rming a sense of disappointment and injustice.

The strategist faces quite different challenges. The most important is that

the stakes are for real. The dramatist may allow the “baddies” to win as a

statement about the human condition; the strategist knows this will have

real and possibly dire consequences. The dramatist can ensure that the plot

unfolds as intended; the strategist has to cope with the choices of others while remaining relatively ignorant of what they might be. The dramatist can use

these choices to reveal the true character of key players; the strategist must make a starting assumption about character when anticipating what choices

may be made under intense forms of pressure. The strategist must avoid

the standard plot lines of literature shaping expectations. It is unlikely that everything will come together in some sudden, thrilling climax. In drama,

the most satisfactory foes appear as truly monstrous, malign, and egocentric.

It might be tempting to denounce actual opponents in these terms but it is

also dangerous if taken too seriously. An otherwise resolvable confl ict might turn into a confrontation between the forces of light and darkness. Caricature depictions of opponents, along with glowing portrayals of friends, add to

the risks of being caught by surprise by actual behavior. It must be under-

stood that strategies that depend on others to act out of character, beyond

their competence, or against their declared interests and preferences, are

gambles. Rather than play out assigned roles that will leave them frustrated, contained, ambushed, or suppressed, they will write their own scripts. The

challenge for the strategist—indeed, the essence of strategy—is to force or

persuade those who are hostile or unsympathetic to act differently than their current intentions. The risk is always that the conclusions will be messier and less satisfactory than anticipated. There may not even be a proper conclusion.

The plot may just peter out. The original story line may lead nowhere and be

overtaken by a different story.

Both the dramatist and strategist must think about their audiences, but

the problem of multiple audiences is more challenging for the strategist.

If those who need to follow the plot are confused, they will be unable to

play their parts. At the same time there may be others who are best kept

s t o r i e s a n d s c r i p t s

627

in the dark, following false trails and deliberately ambiguous signals. The dramatist can reduce the demands on her audience. There is no need to show

results being eked out through hard grind and close attention to detail over

an expanded period. She also has the option of a thrilling climax. Here there can be complete closure, with absolute and irreversible change achieved. The

strategist may face similar temptations: anxiety to bring matters to a swift

conclusion, impatience at the thought of wearing opponents down over time

or engaging potential allies in extended negotiations. A determination to

seek a quick and decisive result is a frequent cause of failure. Unlike the dramatist, the strategist cannot rely on last-minute escapes from certain doom,

in which chance, a sharp eye, a sudden revelation, or a uniquely cool head

makes all the difference. The challenge is to identify moves that will require other players to follow the script out of the logic of the developing situation.

The opening bid in negotiations, a feint on a battlefi eld, and a bellicose statement at a time of crisis may all assume a likely response by the other side. If that is not forthcoming, the improvisation will start early.

The strategist has to accept that even when there is an obvious climax (a

battle or an election), the story line will still be open-ended—what McKee

calls a “miniplot”—leaving a number of issues to be resolved later. Even

when the desired endpoint is reached, it is not really the end. The enemy

may have surrendered, the election won, the target company taken over,

the revolutionary opportunity seized, but that just means that there is now

an occupied country to run, a new government to be formed, a whole new

revolutionary order to be established, or distinctive sets of corporate activity to be merged. Here the dramatist can leave the next stage to the reader’s imagination or pick up the story again after the passage of time, perhaps even with many new characters. Strategists have no such luxury. The transition is

immediate and may well be conditional on how the original endpoint was

reached. This takes us back to the observation that much strategy is about

getting to the next stage rather than some ultimate destination. Rather than

think of strategy as a three-act play, it is better to think of it as a soap opera with a continuing cast of characters and plot lines that unfold over a series of episodes. Each of these episodes will be self-contained and set up the subsequent episode. Unlike a play with a defi nite ending, there is no need for a soap opera to ever reach a conclusion, even though the central characters and their circumstances change.

The dramatist can use coincidences to move the plot along, to ensure that

the main protagonist faces the hard choices at the right time. The strategist knows that there will be events which were never part of the plot and which

disrupt its logic but cannot be sure when, where, and how. Boundaries will

628

t h e o r i e s o f s t r a t e g y

be hard to maintain, and apparently irrelevant issues will intrude and complicate matters. The plot must therefore build in a certain freedom of action.

The earlier defi nitive choices must be made, the greater the commitment to a particular course and the harder the adjustment when the actions of others or chance events defl ect the protagonist from this course. The strategist cannot rely on the device of the _deus ex machina_ , by which classical plays used divine intervention to sort out desperate situations at the last moment. Writers can allow a coincidence to turn an ending, acknowledges McKee, but this is the

“writer’s greatest sin” for it negates the value of the plot and allows the central characters to duck responsibility for their own actions. Aristotle also

deplored the regular recourse to this device.

In ancient Greece, the most important distinction in plots was between

comedy and tragedy. This was not a distinction between happy/sad or funny/

miserable but between alternative ways of resolving confl icts. [^37] It may be that the confl ict is not between opposing characters but between individuals and society. Comedy ends with a satisfactory resolution and the main characters looking forward positively to the future; tragedy ends with a negative prospect—especially for the main character, who is probably largely responsible for his own misfortune—even if society as a whole is restored to some

sort of equilibrium. When a new and positive relationship has been forged

between society and the main character that is comedy; when the main char-

acter’s attempt to change the status quo has been defeated that is tragedy.

The dramatist knows from the start whether she is writing comedy or a trag-

edy: the strategist aims for comedy but risks tragedy.

n o t e s

with English translations by Major-General R. H. Barry in 1965 as _Introduction to Strategy_ and _Dissuasion and Strategy_ , respectively, by Faber

& Faber in London. This quote comes from _Introduction_ , p. 22. Beaufre is discussed in Beatrice Heuser, _The Evolution of Strategy_ , 460–463. See Chapter 6, n. 4.

“French Strategy Emergent: General André Beaufre: A Critique,” _World_

_Politics_ 19, no. 3 (April 1967): 417–442. While he was unimpressed with Brodie’s complaint about “majestic concepts” that got in the way, he

acknowledged that Beaufre ideas were often expressed too vaguely to be

convincing.

11 . The theory was popularized by Edward Lorenz, a diligent meteorologist who discovered the “butterfl y effect” while searching for a way to produce

more accurate weather predictions. Minuscule changes in his initial input to

mathematical calculations for weather predictions could have extraordinary

and unpredictable effects on the outcomes. The butterfl y effect comes from

a 1972 paper by Lorenz to the American Association for the Advancement

of Science entitled, “Predictability: Does the Flap of a Butterfl y’s Wings

victory in the war, yet he nonetheless used Burnham’s geopolitical analysis,

predicting a world divided into three strategic centers for world control,

each similar to the other yet engaged in a constant struggle, as the basis for his dystopian novel, _1984_ . As always, Orwell’s analysis makes for fascinating reading. See his “James Burnham and the Managerial Revolution,” _New_

mob’s operations, from “gin mills and whorehouses and bookie joints to the

legitimate businesses they were beginning to take over.” Given that they had

much of the local political class and police force in their pockets, he argued that there was not much he could do with the information he gathered. As he

later noted, “the only real opposition to the mob came from other gangsters,

like Bugs Moran or Roger Touhy.” He claimed to have learned “a hell of a

lot about the uses and abuses of power from the mob, lessons that stood me

in good stead later on, when I was organizing.” “Empowering People, Not

anything worth having convictions about.” The viciousness of the attacks led

biology teachers are out of tune with the dominant scientifi c paradigm of

the time, the important point is that they are still far more in tune with

this paradigm than with the general public support for creationism and/or

intelligent design. A 2008 Gallup poll suggests 44 percent of Americans

believe that “God created man in present form” and another 36 percent

believe that God guided man’s development. Only 14 percent did not think

explains that “Sun-Tuh-Zoo” is the “Chinese Prince Machiavelli,” at which

point his colleague Silvio Dante corrects him: “Tzu, Tzu! Sun Tzu, you

fucking ass-kiss!” In the next episode, Paulie, trying to reestablish himself after a spell in prison, is listening to a tape of Sun Tzu while driving to

his aunt’s neighborhood. At an appropriate moment, as the tape refers to

catching an enemy by surprise, he comes across two brothers pruning trees

in an area which they have just taken from one of Gualtieri’s friends. His

tactics are similar to those used by the brothers: intimidation based on brute force. When they refuse to give the area back, Gualtieri hits one brother

over the head with a shovel causing him to let go of the rope holding the other brother in the tree, who then plunges down. Not really Sun Tzu!

Luttwak (as the celebrator of strategy as paradox) were called in aid, and

both certainly argued against direct frontal approaches, neither suggested

that somehow military success could be achieved by purposeless activity,

seeing how the individuals in an army coped with the predicaments in which

they found themselves (which without any direction would probably have

been to surrender or desert). Indirect strategies in war required imaginative leadership and an ability to consider the world as it might appear to the

enemy before embarking on maneuvers that could carry high risks.

Faces of Honda”; and Henry Mintzberg, “Introduction” and “Reply to

Group commissioned by the British Government to explain the precipitate

decline of the British motorcycle industry from a commanding market

position. BCG blamed “a concern for short term profi tability” in Britain

while reporting on how the Japanese had managed to develop a massive

internal market for small motorcycles. This meant that costs were low, so

when they decided to export there was no way that British fi rms geared

to large motorcycles could compete. Honda achieved stunning economies

of scale: producing about two hundred motorcycles per worker per year

compared with fourteen motorcycles in British factories. Boston Consulting

appearance of profundity. It was refl ected in a tendency to string abstract

academic world, where the manipulation of abstractions was often a way of

making authors appear cleverer than they are, and could require constant

translation with real examples to give meaning to the ideas.

The contract for this book is dated 1994. The original commission

came from Tim Barton, and I appreciate his extraordinary patience as

I busied myself with other projects and made a number of false starts on this one. Once it did get underway, he guided me to the capable hands of David

McBride, who has been an extraordinarily supportive editor. It is thanks to

him, Cammy Richelli, and the rest of the team at Oxford University Press

that this book is making an appearance.

The project, however, would not have even been re-started had it not been

for James Gow’s encouragement and seminar opportunities to develop my

ideas. James, with Brad Robinson, pushed me into applying to the Research

Councils UK under their Global Uncertainties program and helped me

put together a successful submission. This joint ESRC/AHRC Fellowship

provided me with space to research and write that would otherwise have

been impossible. I was particularly fortunate in my coworkers on the grant.

I have benefi ted from Jeff Michaels’s own work on strategic ideas, as well

as his sharp critiques of my own. While I was supposedly supervising Ben

Wilkinson’s thesis, he was in practice supervising me—especially when it

came to the Classics.

The department of War Studies at King’s College London has been a

stimulating home to me for over three decades. Conversations with staff and

students inform many parts of this book. I have been grateful for the support of successive department heads: Brian Holden Reid, Christopher Dandeker,

and Mervyn Frost. Other colleagues have also given me advice on the manu-

script, notably Theo Farrell, Jan Willem Honig, and John Stone, who was

a regular source of interesting references. Limor Simhony helped check my references, and Sarah Chukwudebe put in many corrections.

I have also benefi ted greatly from the advice of colleagues outside the

department. Special mention must be made of two outstanding students of

strategy, Beatrice Heuser and Bob Jervis, who provided detailed and meticu-

lous annotations, far beyond the call of duty. Thanks for many useful com-

ments are also due to Rob Ayson, Dick Betts, Stuart Croft, Pete Feaver, Azar

Gat, Carl Levy, Albert Weale, and Nick Wheeler. Lastly, my son Sam was a

source of good advice on structure and the title, and I was able to discuss the counterculture with my daughter-in-law Linda. I could mention many people with whom I have discussed the issues raised in this book—and a number

of them appear in its pages—but two deserve special mention. The fi rst is

my teacher and mentor, Sir Michael Howard, who set me on this course and

still inspires me to continue. The second is Colin Gray. Our careers have run in parallel, with many shared themes. Though our views have often diverged,

the encounters have always been rewarding.

In all my books I have thanked my wife Judith for her forbearance. Once

again she has had to cope with my “book daze,” during which I am oblivi-

ous to everything around me other than the manuscript. It struck me, as we

approach our ruby wedding, that it is about time I dedicated one of these

books to her.

to achieve ends” is comparatively recent but is now well established in

military circles, although not in such a way as always to capture the dynamic interaction between these elements. Arthur F. Lykke, Jr., “Toward an

Understanding of Military Strategy,” _Military Strategy: Theory and Application_ (Carlisle, PA: U.S. Army War College, 1989), 3–8.

21 . Terence Holmes uses this stress on planning to challenge the view that Clausewitz was preoccupied only with the chaotic and unpredictable. The

point is that the potential chaos and unpredictability set the challenge for

the general. This is why Clausewitz argued for cautious strategies. Holmes

notes the reasons why plans may go awry, of which the most important

would be a failure to anticipate the enemy’s moves correctly, and that when

the original plans do not work new ones will be needed. It is setting up a

straw man to counter a claim that Clausewitz opposed all planning, because

clearly the logistical and command issues posed by the great armies of the

time demanded planning. Better to view the strategic challenge as drawing

up plans that took account of the problems of friction and unpredictable

enemies but would not necessarily solve them. Terence Holmes , “Planning versus Chaos in Clausewitz’s _On War_ , ” _The Journal of Strategic Studies_ 30 , no. 1

earlier air attacks before our defence was organized, will not be disposed to underestimate the panic and disturbance that would result from a

concentrated blow dealt by a superior air fl eet. Who that saw it will

ever forget the nightly sight of the population of a great industrial and

shipping town, such as Hull, streaming out into the fi elds on the fi rst

sound of the alarm signals? Women, children, babies in arms, spending

night after night huddled in sodden fi elds, shivering under a bitter winter

14 . Churchill’s memoir of the war, written in its aftermath, denied that

there was any consideration of whether or not to fi ght on. Resistance was

“taken for granted and as a matter of course.” It would have been a waste

of time to worry about “such unreal, academic issues” as a negotiated

settlement. Winston S. Churchill , _The Second World War, Their Finest Hour_ _,_ _vol. 2_ ( London : Penguin , 1949 ), 157 . Reynolds explains the cover-up by a desire to protect Halifax, who was still a colleague in the higher ranks

of the Conservative Party when the book was written in 1948, yet who

later acquired the mantle of a would-be appeaser held back by Churchill’s

bellicosity. The record, however, shows that Churchill was aware that

negotiations with Germany might at some point be necessary. He knew

that the next stage might turn out very badly, and that a settlement that

compromised British independence might have to be accepted, but his

task was to make invasion as hard as possible for the Germans, and his

vivid language and steely demeanor (“We shall fi ght on the beaches . . . We

shall never surrender”) were in that respect vital parts of his weaponry.

The story he told in 1940 was of inevitable victory and he had no desire to

correct it when he got the chance to rewrite it in 1948. David Reynolds,

Herbert Swope, claimed paternity in a speech he wrote for Bernard Baruch,

a high-profi le fi nancier. He also claimed to have been thinking back to the late 1930s when he had been asked whether America would get involved in a

“shooting war” in Europe. He was struck by the oddity of the phrase: “It was

like saying a death murder—rather tautological, verbose, and redundant.”

He thought the opposite of a “hot war” was a “cold war” and he began to use

the phrase. William Safi re , _Safi re’s New Political Dictionary_ ( New York : Oxford University Press , 2008 ), 134– 13 5 .

Wayland Young, an active proponent of disarmament, who referred to

“the danger of what strategists call escalation, the danger that the size of

the weapons used would mount up and up in retaliation until civilization

is destroyed as surely as it would have been by an initial exchange of

thermonuclear weapons.” In his glossary, we fi nd the following: “Escalation-

Escalator: The uncontrolled exchange of ever larger weapons in war, leading

to the destruction of civilization.” Wayland Young , _Strategy for Survival: First_ _Steps in Nuclear Disarmament_ ( London : Penguin Books , 1959 ).
