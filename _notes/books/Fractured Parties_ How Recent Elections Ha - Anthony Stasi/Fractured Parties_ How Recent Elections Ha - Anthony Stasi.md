In the spring of 1995, I drove from New York City to Washington, D.C. in order to find work as a Capitol Hill staffer. The previous November was a historic election, where the Republican Party had won majorities in both legislative houses for the first time in forty years. My thinking was that this would free up some positions in both houses. Along with incoming freshman Republicans staffing-up in Washington, there were a few crossovers, where elected Democrats crossed the aisle to become Republicans. In other words, there were openings for a college graduate who was willing to earn very little money, while working in American politics. Two of those crossovers were Democratic Congressman Billy Tauzin (LA-3) and Colorado Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell. I spent an entire week, visiting congressional office after congressional office. While crossing a street one afternoon, I noticed Congressman Charles “Chuck” Schumer, then a member of the House of Representatives representing parts of Brooklyn and Queens, walking in my direction. Having seen him at more than a few local events and campaign stops back home, we recognized each other. “What are you doing here?” he asked me. I told him I had come to Washington to see if I could work as a staffer. He asked me to meet up with him later that day in the Rayburn Room at the House of Representatives, where he explained to me that he was well connected in Washington, and it was mainly due to his ability to work with members of both sides of the political aisle. Schumer is a partisan Democrat, and is now an influential member of the U.S. Senate. His office was a breeding ground for other successful Democrats, such as Anthony Weiner and Phillip Goldfeder. He explained to me how much it mattered to him to work with both parties in order to get things done, and he wanted to help me get established wherever I found an opportunity. Those days when members worked together, at least when the C-Span cameras shut off, started to wane in the middle 1990s.

Today, there is complete polarization between the two parties, due in large part to the fact that there is polarization within the parties. Primary races have become hotbeds for extreme ideologies. This has resulted in historic levels of independent voters. Voters, especially centrist voters, are voting for party candidates, but not joining parties.

In 2016, Donald Trump, a complete political novice, secured the Republican Party’s nomination in the 2016 election, all while accusing the Republican Party of rigging the political system against him. Similar polls (early in the primary season) had Independent-turned Democratic candidate Senator Bernie Sanders (D-VT) either leading or running a very close second in most primaries. Sanders ultimately lost his bid for the nomination, but his impressive run speaks volumes about the gap between what voters think and where parties stand.

It is not uncommon, in contemporary times or in generations past, for the voting public to have a fascination with “outsider” candidates who run populist campaigns. What Trump and Sanders showed in 2016 was that such fascination has gone one step further. There almost seems to be a lack of trust between primary voters and political parties.

Consider the following two quotes about party politics from the camps of these two candidates:

“In an outsider year, a year of discontent, when the electorate clearly is unhappy with business as usual and politics as usual, for the DNC to try and use the thuggish politics of usual to try and muscle the Sanders campaign? It’s going to backfire on them,” said a top Sanders aide on the eve of the forum.[^1]

“Our Republican system is absolutely rigged. It’s a phony deal,” he (Trump) said, accusing party leaders of maneuvering to cut his supporters out of the process. “They wanted to keep people out. This is a dirty trick.”[^2]

Two candidates, neither of whom were longtime members of their parties, blaming their newly adopted parties for rigging a system for which they were both relatively successful tells the story of how candidates and campaigns are outweighing party influence. Since the dawn of the modern presidency, it is clear that incumbent presidents are the de-facto leaders of their parties. The Republican Party was Ronald Reagan’s party when he was in office. The Democratic Party was Bill Clinton’s party when he was office. Today, however, we are seeing candidates working around parties and making them less a part of the system.

While this diminished relevancy of parties goes beyond any one candidate or election, the 2016 primary race is an interesting focal point. While Sanders did not win the nomination for his party, his journey is significant. Senator John McCain (2008) and Governor Bill Clinton (1992) won the nominations of their parties in different election years. They were both considered “establishment” candidates who were lifetime party members. The total vote count for those candidates in their respective primaries were as follows:

Sanders and Trump, two anti-establishment candidates received the following vote totals in primaries as far as April of 2016:

These results are significant because we are living in an age where fewer Americans join political parties, and even in closed-party primaries, voters are choosing candidates who do not even have a great deal of history with those parties.

This may not continue to be the case, and it doesn’t matter if it does. What does matter, however, is that voters are rejecting establishment party candidates and gravitating toward a-typical, and even a-political, candidates. This coincides with the growing number of independent voters in the United States. Why are parties so unpopular with voters today? I wanted to see if this trend away from parties is cultural or a result of our political climate. If it is cultural, it would fit nicely with similar reasoning as to why Americans do not join other organizations, like the Knights of Columbus, as much as they once did. If the reasoning is political, however, then the question is: can parties return to relevancy?

In 2010, I wrote a paper that focused on nonpartisan elections in the New York City Council. The New York City Council is a 51-member governing body that usually has anywhere from 2 to 7 Republicans, depending on the circumstances. Those circumstances are often the frequency of special elections, which occur after a member of the council leaves office or is elected to something else before his or her term ends. It is the only time in New York City’s electoral process when the playing field is relatively level, and it is the only time when Republican candidates have an opportunity to make an impression on an otherwise liberal progressive electorate. What was more interesting was that when Republicans were elected in those unlikely districts in New York City, they were often re-elected. This means that once they had a chance to compete in an open system, they had a better chance to get their message across to voters.

What I found in that research was that not only did New York City Republicans favor a nonpartisan system, but so did moderates and some centrist Democrats. When I looked at the rest of the country, there was a similar feel. Nebraska state politics is usually safe Republican territory, but nonpartisan elections have allowed more Democrats to gain office. Is the closed primary system creating an environment where the ideological candidates have too much of an advantage? If that is the case, that might explain the sour taste that many American have regarding parties. There are more independent voters today than ever before, and they are routinely rejecting candidates that are thought to be the “party’s choice.”

There is a sense of cache in being independent that may allow voters to separate themselves from the dug-in path of a political party. It is also tempting for voters to shy away from the fire and brimstone of ideological extremes, to which both parties have fallen victim. Ultimately, there are no democracies without parties. New democracies, such as those developing in the Middle East, have parties. It is what societies do when they choose to hold elections, no matter how culturally different. Clearly this is a necessary component of electoral politics.

Parties might remedy the current dangers to the electoral process, should the parties wish to take the lead on reform. Campaign finance reform, for example, has met serious constitutional challenges. Parties, however, can make their own rules and set limits independent of the Constitution. Since there is no requirement to be in a party, one runs on a party line by choice and accepts the rules. Parties can, if they innovate, get a stronger control of the process.

Many people today have a strong understanding of the issues and challenges that exist right now. What I have found is lacking at the undergraduate, and graduate, level is a stronger understanding of how our politics grew into what it is today. This is why there is a strong historical component to this book. Parties can experience a kind of renaissance, but they need to take a more active role in the primary and funding processes. If they do not, the system is left to self-financed political unknowns that could be risky for electoral politics.

As for my 1995 sojourn to Washington, D.C., it would only be another fifteen years before I retuned as an academic, still trying to fully understand what I experienced in that warm week that I spent trying to fit in.

Modern Parties Are Weaker . . . By Modern Standards

We are living in an age of weakened political parties. The American two-party system has been the way Americans have accessed politics from the early nineteenth century. The parties, through campaign law, are regulated and thus recognized as fixtures in our political system. For this reason, the study of parties, and why they matter, is the focus here. Parties have a history of strong and weak periods.

How we define strong parties is also an issue in measuring the strength of parties. If smaller, more ideological parties are considered strong, modern American parties may be in a period of strength. If strong parties are to be defined by how well they reach the American public, they are not in a very weak place. Modern parties are losing the attention of mainstream voters as they curry more favor with their ideological bases. The 2016 presidential primaries are a good example of how both major parties saw serious challenges from candidates who did not take the party line on many issues. Both parties are affected by these elements of modernity. There are examples of how efforts to modernize party stances have been met with resistance.

Modern voters are a mix of ideological types and solution seekers. The solution seekers are often in the center, and more pragmatic. Ideologues are keepers of the faith on both the political left and right. An example of how a party can remain rigid, even when some of its own prominent members try to innovate, is the story of how some prominent Republicans found a free-market solution to controlling toxic emissions, only to face opposition within the party. As far back as the Reagan administration, there was a dialogue, albeit internally, regarding the best ways to reign-in toxic emissions. It may seem like a concern from the political left, but the idea of an emissions trading policy, based on a free-market solution, came from the right—at least originally. Richard Conniff, writing on the history of emissions trading policy (better known as Cap and Trade) explains how the idea developed:

John B. Henry was hiking in Maine’s Acadia National Park one August in the 1980s when he first heard his friend C. Boyden Gray talk about cleaning up the environment by letting people buy and sell the right to pollute. Gray, a tall, lanky heir to a tobacco fortune, was then working as a lawyer in the Reagan White House, where environmental ideas were only slightly more popular than godless Communism. “I thought he was smoking dope,” recalls Henry, a Washington, D.C. entrepreneur. But if the system Gray had in mind now looks like a politically acceptable way to slow climate change—an approach being hotly debated in Congress—you could say that it got its start on the global stage on that hike up Acadia’s Cadillac Mountain.[^1]

This innovative idea is known informally today as a “Cap and Trade” energy policy. They called it emissions trading up until the turn of the century. Back in the 1990s, however, the idea of a free-market solution to a public policy problem was right in line with free-market-oriented Republicans. It had the potential to usher in a weird, but happy, marriage between centrist Republicans and the environmental crowd. It was a perfect way for Republicans to usurp a major issue on which the Democrats prided themselves. Emissions trading is a less intrusive approach to a complex environmental problem. There was little language in the legislation that would have polluters explain how they would clean up their messes, such as acid rain. All that was required of those who were polluting was that they would need to purchase more certificates to continue doing business the way they were . . . or stop polluting.

Later, the administration of President George H.W. Bush wanted to embrace the idea of an emissions trading policy because it was a way to curtail emissions and thus cut down on acid rain—an early focus of the Bush camp. Since the election of Bush in 1988, there have been calls for environmental policies that are more involved, more muscular. It has been almost thirty years since the Bush team, along with environmentalists, explored Cap and Trade, and the attitudes toward the idea have changed dramatically.

What changed from 1988, when a then-popular Republican president was a proponent of a free-market solution to emissions to the current climate where the Republican Party uses the term Cap and Trade as a way to brand impure conservatives? Even the idea of calling a bill a Cap and Trade policy is enough to scare off political leaders today. In 2010, Democratic Senator John Kerry, Republican Senator Lindsay Graham, and Independent Senator Joseph Lieberman worked on legislation that would curb emissions through a trading mechanism. They were careful not to use the words “Cap and Trade,” however, as the policy had gained a bad reputation. Coral Davenport of CQ Weekly explains that even President Barack Obama had doubts about calling the policy by its former moniker:

The White House is also onboard the re-messaging train. While President Obama had repeatedly said that passing energy and climate legislation this year is a top priority, he hasn’t used the phrase “cap and trade” in a speech in months. Instead, when he talks about pushing the climate bill, he calls for “putting American to work building clean energy facilities” and emphasized competition with China on new energy technology while keeping “clean energy jobs” at home.[^2]

Democrats are usually on the progressive side of environmental policy, although they too face risks if they embrace aggressive policies that appear to be over-reaching. We are living in a time where branding policies, products, and reputations is serious business. The Cap and Trade brand comes with a lot of political risk, which President Obama and most politicians understand. One example of how the Republicans shifted away from their own idea was how Senator John McCain moved away from the legislation that he once stood alongside. Lisa Lerer, writing for Politico, chronicled the change in McCain’s stance, “McCain refers to the bill as ‘cap and tax,”’ calls the climate legislation that passed the House in June “a 1,400-page monstrosity” and dismisses a cap-and-trade proposal includes in the White House budget as “a government slush fund.” Former aides are mystified by what they see as a retreat on the issue, given McCain’s long history of leadership on climate legislation.”[^3] This Cap and Trade issue is also important because it establishes an interesting timeline in political polarization in American politics. McCain and Lieberman worked closely together in 2003 on this legislation. By the end of the decade, however, parties were working together less, and this was one of the first issues where this change can be seen.

McCain started throwing darts at Cap and Trade policies when he became a serious contender for the Republican nomination for president. In order for McCain to win the GOP nomination, he had to show his conservative bona fides. He had to eschew all ideas embraced from the left, such as Cap and Trade. It became important not to adopt ideas that were being embraced by the opposition.[^4]

CLIMATE CHANGE VOTE: 2009

Almost three decades after Cap and Trade’s free-market approach was hatched within Republican circles, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for a vote on H.R. 2454 on June 26, 2009. The results were as follows in Table I.1.

![[Stasi_Table-I.1_fmt.jpeg]]

These results illustrate how far the Republican Party has drifted from one of its own solutions. It is fair to point out that this was put to the floor in a Democratic Party majority, and the GOP was not going to give the opposition a victory. Even when the Republicans were in the majority, however, the issue of climate change legislation was non-existent. The party has not only abandoned its own idea, but has even made it difficult for other Republicans who may feel that emissions control is a good idea.

What caused this issue to hit such a wall within Republican ranks? It could be almost as simple as the idea that the Democratic Party came around to embracing it—and that was enough to annoy the GOP away from the concept. Harvard University professor Robert Stavins (as told to Chris Arnold of National Public Radio) did a good job of explaining where the Democratic Party was thirty years ago when it came to a market-based emissions trading policy, “Democrats of that era were much more suspicious of the market. I remember they characterized cap-and-trade systems as ‘licenses to pollute.’”[^5]

President George H.W. Bush liked the idea of emissions trading; it was a position that was tailor made for a mainstream pragmatist Republican, who wanted to be “the environmental president.” By the late 1990s, however, the Republican Party, even though the policy idea came from the right, was more concerned with sticking to a set playbook and opposing environmental policy. For academics, this rigidness is often considered an ideological strength, despite the ramifications on policy advancement. For the general voting public, however, this is an example of a party moving away from pragmatism and keeping its own original policy from developing. This case illustrates how scholars and voters sometimes view strength in parties differently. Scholars on parties, such as E.E. Schattschneider, along with the American Political Science Association’s Committee on Parties, originally viewed parties with set agendas as strong. The lack of new voters registering in parties, however, suggests that parties are not very strong or influential. Academic and party professionals may equate party strength with ideological unification. That definition of party strength, however, does not necessarily take into account that membership within the party still matters.

What the issue of Cap and Trade exemplifies is that there are splits within parties that can be strong enough to actually make one of their own policy initiatives off limits. Parties that do not have a definitive stance on important issues like environmental policy allow themselves to be pushed and pulled by special interest groups. Climate change legislation is one that is rife with special interest fingerprints and influence peddling.

Neither party has exercised responsibility to the electorate on important issues. Because of this, there is a vague definition of what these parties are for or against. This makes understanding candidates more difficult. Cap and Trade is one issue, and its history with the GOP is just one example of how parties have the ability to make a big contribution and still fall short because of their own internal politics.

The Democratic Party, while it has been successful in recent national elections (namely presidential races), has also experienced some internal discord when it comes to particular issues. The Democrats are just as vulnerable to varied viewpoints on important issues within their ranks.

In 2003, Washington, D.C. experimented with a scholarship program that provided scholarships for low-income students who were relegated to poorly performing public schools. The Washington, D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program was a program that offered a solution to over-crowded, poorly performing schools. The Democratic Party, however, counts organized labor, which includes influential teachers’ unions, as an important leg of support. The progressive base of the party has opposed any semblance of a voucher program as a means to counter failing public schools. Just read the following from Ben Smith of Politico and it is clear who would be opposing this program:

The American Federation of Teachers spent heavily to unseat Washington, D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty and to put the brakes on his aggressive efforts to shake up the city’s schools system.

The national union spent roughly $1 million in contributions to a labor-backed independent expenditure campaign—also supported by the public workers union AFSCME—and on its own extensive political operation, a Democratic political consultant familiar with the details of the spending told POLITICO.[^6]

Washington, D.C. schools had been underperforming for a long time, which was enough to cause past opponents to take a second look at a voucher-like program. A 2008 editorial in National Review magazine explains how the program brought together a mix of policy people who are not typically on the same page politically, “The program exists only because of a strange-bedfellow coalition comprising the (George W.) Bush administration, congressional Republicans, and black Democrats in Washington.”[^7]

Washington, D.C. was given a boost of federal money, and had the support of former D.C. mayors, along with then-incumbent Democratic Mayor Adrian Fenty. It was, like most public policy is in the early stages, a pilot program. Why would the federal government even entertain the idea of diverting public school money toward a school choice program? The answer is that there was no other answer to the troubled public school system in the nation’s capital. Fenty, his schools chancellor, and former mayors of the city understood that asking students to wait until the public school system improved would put those students at a disadvantage. This put the Democratic Party in a unique, and awkward, position. The Democratic Party counts on support from low-income Americans and teachers’ unions. On this issue, those two concerns conflicted with each other.

What we see here with Washington, D.C. mayors, who are generally quite progressive, is an openness to explore different policy. This is not a perfect sister story to the Republican Cap and Trade policy that ultimately failed, but it is similar in a particular way. Environmental policy is not usually a cornerstone of Republican politics, and school choice is not a popular stance in Democratic circles. Supporters of both policies were pushing against the dominant elements of their party.

What killed the Washington, D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program was when it was defunded federally in the 2010 budget of President Barack Obama. Despite the popularity of the policy with Washington Democrats in the electorate, the party in government, and its more ideological side, pushed to defund the program.

Fenty went on to lose his party’s primary in a bid to be re-elected Mayor of Washington, D.C. His defeat can be attributed to a number of things, but not being attached to the party’s political base (and big labor) was certainly a part of that. 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney summed up the reach of an ideological party when he described the defeat of the scholarship program at the hands of the federal budget, “The president shut that down, his party shut that down.”[^8]

The Republican effort to introduce a market-based solution to emission reduction and the local Washington, D.C. effort to bring better education to under privileged students both hit walls when party bases stepped in.

WHAT DO WE EXPECT FROM PARTIES?

The rapid increase of independent voters, and decline of enthusiasm in the electorate toward the two major parties, is indication that parties have changed. Because we are living in a time when there is a diminished appetite to join parties, the expectations of parties in the electorate may be vague. In The Handbook of Political Parties, there are many definitions of what a party should be according to some of the more storied political thinkers in modern times. While the definition of a party by Edmund Burke may differ somewhat from that of V.O. Key, there is a common thread throughout each answer.[^9] Parties are institutions that have shared values. They function to inform the electorate and run candidates. We may also add to this the notion that parties maintain a dialogue with the electorate on a host of issues. Sure, voters can get information and communications from various sources and groups other than parties. The two major parties, however, are a reliable and steady base for American politics. Chapter 3]] focuses on how institutional changes have affected parties, and one of those changes comes from Congress. The parties in Congress vote together at steady rates north of 90 percent. The parties in the electorate, however, are not as consistent on issues.

As we examine parties, there is also the question of what defines a strong party. Academics tend to define strong parties differently than the general public. In the public sphere, a party that is large and representative of the greater electorate is a strong party. To academics, especially scholars who have focused on parties, party strength is more about ideological consistency.

When the American Political Science Association’s Committee on Parties produced a study on how parties can remain strong, the “strength” they focused on in the report was about consistency on issues. For academics who favor a responsible party system, there is a dialogue that happens between the voters and parties. That dialogue is based on an understanding that parties stand for things, and their candidates and issues are understood. Today, there is little structural responsibility within the parties. In other words, the Cap and Trade issue or the idea of public school vouchers are not uniformly accepted or rejected by Republicans and Democrats.

Modernity has caused changes in American politics, and because of those changes, parties are less relevant. There may be a renewed need and desire for political parties as voters begin to see what exists in a democracy without parties. Some element or entity will engineer politics in a free society, and with all of the special interests and moneyed interests that exist, parties might be a solution.

What is more, there are not many democracies that do not have a party system. We do not want to make the mistake of thinking that political parties exist solely in American politics. Parties exist in just about every democratic government in the world because they adequately set the stage for an adversarial system that provides checks and balances.

What this research will explore in greater detail is the need for robust political parties. Despite the diminishing returns of party politics in the last fifty years, there is a renewed need for parties. Parties have a unique ability to set their own electoral rules, which allows them to avoid constitutional constraints. They can regulate campaign spending if they want to do so. They can enforce their own term limits with candidates that seek their ballot access—if they so desired. They can also work to change the primary process and have the system more accessible to a greater variety of voters. The hypothesis here is that parties matter, not just in our past, but perhaps even more so in our future.

There are important academic theories as to why parties are so polarized from within and what is causing the lack of interest that has led to so many independent voters. There is the idea that the parties have not embraced immigrants, nor brought them into the political system correctly. There is a theory that the American narrative is deeply flawed, and this creates an unrealistic expectation of American political life.

There are all kinds of reasons as to why people do not join our parties. It is also useful for us to remember that we are defined by our time, and the last ten to twenty years have caused a lot of anxiety in America. Following a war on two foreign fronts, a troubled economy, and a general skepticism about politics, Americans’ opinions of parties may have changed.

Political parties are a permanent part of the American democratic framework. They are not mentioned in any great detail in the founding documents or language of the republic, but they have been—and are—a fixture in American politics. There have been periods where the parties were weaker and stronger, but they have been an integral part of elective politics since George Washington left office.

Since the middle twentieth century, there has been a noticeable change in attitude from the American electorate toward parties. More and more voters register as non-affiliated or independent. The parties are still relevant in that they field candidates, have platforms, and work to mobilize voters. The last two elements (developing platforms and mobilizing voters) have not been the sole territory of parties, however, and thus the political system has seen the two major parties become less influential in American political dialogue.

In 1962, political scientist James Q. Wilson wrote The Amateur Democrat: Club Politics in Three Cities. This was an exploration of the growth of small groups of citizens—amateurs to politics—who were becoming politically involved outside the core structures of parties. He focuses on New York City and then-Democratic Party leader Carmine de Sapio as one example of how parties had a new challenge emerging. Not only were the major parties hopeful to defeat their opposition party candidates, they also had to speak to the concerns of local, mobilized citizens. The research in this paper is a combination of two important methods regarding party politics––the data that shows the waning influence of parties and the road to how this happened. Wilson’s book on club politics in the 1960s is a spot on that road, but it is not the entire journey. Parties have had a long life, almost as long as the democracy itself. There have been growing pains and challenges to their relevance.

Wilson explains the danger of parties losing control of the agenda to factions:

Political parties perform, to some degree, at least three functions in a democratic government. They recruit candidates, mobilize voters, and assemble power within the formal government. The first two functions are indispensable regardless of the precise nature of the political institutions; the third, on the other hand, varies with the extent to which elective officials have sufficient formal, legal powers to operate the government. If legal power is badly fragmented among many levels of government, the need for informal methods for assembling power becomes great. The political party is one, although by no means the only, mechanism for performing this task.[^10]

When Wilson says that the party is one—but not the only—means for assembling power, he is leaving open the door to what might exist without parties. In 1962, there was not the explosion of interest groups and political action committees (PACs) that would hit a high water mark in the 1980s. Wilson, however, seems to see it coming.

The question is whether parties still need to be relevant in order for a democracy to be robust. Almost all democratic nations in the world utilize a party system. In fact, even in countries that are not as democratic, parties exist. This must be because they provide a lens into understanding politics that would be too convoluted otherwise.

Wilson focuses mainly on the Democratic Party and the shifts that were taking place. As citizen groups began to mobilize, they eventually would develop into a significant community board system that still exists today. Community boards, especially in New York City, are devised almost entirely of registered Democrats, despite their non-party status. The Democratic Party often recruits candidates from the community board ranks, since these are citizens who have been involved with many issues.

The problem that Wilson describes with the amateur movements, however, is that it caused there to be what we might refer to as “agenda confusion.” The Democratic Party in the post–World War II era was quite comfortable with successfully echoing the New Deal mainstay issues of labor support, public projects, and a modicum of government involvement as a means to problem solving. It was a less complex approach to politics, until the progressives found civil rights, the environment, and equality issues. This meant that the agenda for the most storied political party in the country was now up for grabs in certain ways.

Both parties experienced this change where the party line was being challenged from inside the party, as well as the usually party opposition from the other side of the aisle. The Republican challenge with local amateur politics followed directly behind the progressives’ challenging the Democrats.

Wilson describes what he refers to as The Stevenson Impact, where there was a palpable national change to the Democratic Party.[^11] To Wilson, The Stevenson Impact was in reference to the Democratic Party’s nomination of Adlai Stevenson, a progressive thinking man’s answer to traditional blue-collar Democratic politics. His candidacy highlighted the dual road that the party would have to navigate going forward.

There is another challenge to parties exemplified in the Stevenson nomination that Wilson does not get into, however, but it is equally important to both parties. The role of the presidency was growing, as was the expectation of national candidates. The modern presidency started around the time of Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR), although it would be fair to make the starting point at Theodore Roosevelt or Woodrow Wilson. The president as a party leader became a permanent role for presidents in this period—and it has not slowed in momentum at all. This is an intermediate variable to what may have weakened parties. In the American Political Science Association’s report, Toward a More Responsible Two-Party System, the report warns of how a less organized party system can lead to a presidency that is too influential in party agendas.[^12]

Stevenson may have symbolized a nod to the growing progressive left within the Democratic Party, but parties were looking for more than that. Chapter 3]] will explain the role of presidencies and how they affect parties. The chapter will focus on two presidencies in particular: the Reagan presidency and Roosevelt’s New Deal. Parties, due to a lack of leadership and structure, started being led by incumbent presidents. Stevenson may have reflected the younger, forward looking, concerns of the new Democratic Party, but he was not the lightning rod agenda setter that parties were about to demand.

If we split national nominees into two overly simplistic categories, we could argue that there are image candidates and intellectual candidates. In the age of the modern presidency, image candidates have been more successful. Just as Stevenson was a good example of the split among Democrats, Senator Barry Goldwater’s nomination for the Republicans in 1964 signaled that there were insurgents on the right as well.

Stevenson was running against Dwight Eisenhower, a national figure before every entering politics. Eisenhower exemplified the image that America wanted. Eisenhower was already a piece of American history when he ran for president. He was the nominee over the intellectual Robert Taft, who was more academic and more conservative. Stevenson soon learned (in two tries) that running against historical figures is an uphill battle. Ronald Reagan, a former actor and radio personality, was the quintessential image candidate. He soundly defeated his intellectual incumbent president, Jimmy Carter, and then Walter Mondale four years later. All of this change meant that the local feel of party politics was fading, giving way to celebritized national agendas. This is an intermediate variable to what may have led to the state of modern parties.

The club movement, however, exposed fault lines in both parties. The voters who supported Patrick Buchanan’s primary run in 1996 (many of them under the age of 30) were not the same Republicans who nominated patrician Senator Bob Dole as the party’s eventual nominee. There were groundswells of local passion and the parties needed to find ways to absorb new concerns with old ones as a way to keep a sense of wholeness. The case study of the Cap and Trade environmental solution is an example of how some elements in a party can be in favor of a policy while others are emphatically opposed. Parties may be more ideological, but they still seem rudderless.

“The principal reward of politics to the amateur,” according to Wilson, “is the sense of having satisfied a felt obligation to participate and this satisfaction is greater the higher the value the amateur can attach to the ends which the outcomes of politics serve.”[^13] Looking back at what Wilson discovered about club politics, it would seem today that political parties have the amateurs as their chief participants. Primary turnouts are small and ideological and not always represented by the larger registration of the party.

Has modernity made it easier for parties, party leaders, and candidates to connect with voters? That answer may not be easy to come by. Where technology and communications has made information far more accessible—across all economic levels, no less—there is a greater than ever disconnect between political parties and voters.

There have been ideas and proposals by academics in hopes of making the party system more visible to modern voters. A great deal of this research delves into those ideas. There could be modern and contemporary reasons that would make muscular parties more beneficial to voters of all sides.

One of those concerns that have come with modernity, for example, is the cost of elections. Candidates can listen to a party agenda and agree with a message, but they are still left with the onus of financing a campaign. In the wake of the high cost of elections, parties had some of the fundraising burden lifted when PACs and interest groups picked up the slack. This, however, has caused a deep cleavage between parties and candidates. Wilson pokes at this notion a little in The Amateur Democrat: Club Politics in Three Cities:

The complete and disjointed nature of the party organization makes the crucial question of party finance a perplexing one. With no clear center of political gravity and no recognized leadership, many party agencies and individuals raise money in independent and often conflicting ways.[^14]

Wilson is right to point to how parties, when ineffective, open the process up to other funding and influence streams. As unpopular as political parties are, would it better to have a completely disjointed system where, ultimately, money from unpredictable sources steer American politics?

What follows is an exploration of where parties are in the current political environment and how they got to that point. The work of James Q. Wilson is important to lead into the chapters because both his work and this research use New York City as particular reference points. Wilson’s work has always intrigued me due to the fact that it often focuses urban politics, and yet has had a center-right flavor to it. It is a unique and useful approach to public policy.

If academics see strong parties are those that are cohesive on policy, they would be happy with members of Congress voting along party lines to the tune of almost 90 percent. There needs to be more to the definition, or criteria, of party strength other than just a lack of diversity on policy stances. There is a difference between what the general voting public refers to as “strong parties” and how many academics view strong parties. Looking back at significant efforts, such as the American Political Science Association’s Toward a More Responsible Two Party System, there is a discernable effort to make parties more ideologically definable—or more rigid. If this is what constitutes a strong party, there is no wonder that the Republican free-market idea regarding climate change drifted away from them. The same is true for Mayor Adrian Fenty’s attempt to make public schools more competitive. American voters are—by and large—not academics in political science, and they are drifting from party politics at a high rate. They clearly do not share with academics the opinion that smaller, more ideological, parties are strong.

The focus of this book is wider than one city, and it does not lean in any particular direction politically. It is important to understand what strong parties are, and whether we really need them. Over ten million Republican primary voters cast their lots for Donald Trump in 2016, despite his having little synergy with the mainstream Republican Party. This drift away from the party apparatus was not introduced by Trump or Senator Bernie Sanders, it is a phenomenon that has been building. We would have to go back to the Republican primary of 1976 to see the seedlings of modern insurgent politics. The president was Republican Gerald Ford, who steered the nation away from crisis. Yet, there was a groundswell of support within his own party for the conservative governor of California, Ronald Reagan, at the 1976 Republican national convention. Reagan was the standard-bearer for going against the grain within one’s own party. He eventually became the de facto face of the party in 1980, and he breathed new life into the agenda, but history would be right to see 1976 as a watermark for insurgent politics. Reagan, unlike Trump, had been a two-term governor of an influential state, and thus, had skin in the game. A novice like Donald Trump winning a party nomination means that the notion of pushing back against party elites may have gone a step too far.

There are a few things that both political parties share in American politics. One of those concerns is that they remain in existence and stay relevant. The question of what utility parties have in modern politics may well come down to financing campaigns.

What Is a Strong Party?

Parties have a strong history in American politics. There has been a great deal of literature regarding the strength of parties within the electorate. There are still a great many partisan voters, but their affiliations with parties have declined. With parties growing weaker in the last five to six decades, the question for scholars is whether or not this trend will continue or gradually drift in the opposite direction. More voters register independently today, and even those who do not, are less active members within their party. Turnouts in primaries, including historic national elections, have not been great. The diminished influence of political parties may not register as a political crisis by itself, but when other interests are gaining power because of it, this could register as a risk to democracy.

Parties were relatively weak in the early days of the republic. The Founders did not focus on parties in most of their publications. In Federalist 10, James Madison discusses the risks that a minority party would endure in a pure democracy:

Among the numerous advantages promised by a well-constructed Union, none deserves to be more accurately developed than its tendency to break and control the violence of faction. The friend of popular governments never finds himself so much alarmed for their character and fate, as when he contemplates their propensity to this dangerous vice.[^1]

In the early stages of the republic, parties were not a big part of the dialogue. There is almost no mention of them in the Federalist Papers. George Washington was by all rights the least political president in history, and while much of his cabinet harbored strong political opinions, he did not.

Madison refers to a “minor party” in Federalist 10, but he is not referring to a political party, but instead as a way to protect minorities when majorities have so much power. The Founders were aware of political parties, and they were already beginning to develop—both (Democratic) Republican and Federalist. Madison, however, wanted to stress that democracy needed a certain system (types of political speed bumps) to ensure that an emotional majority would not infringe on the rights of others. This was sage wisdom, considering that without this language, civil rights legislation in the future would have been harder to achieve without such protections. What does this mean for today’s political parties? Parties gradually became necessary public entities that sat adjacent to the system of checks and balances. As the republic developed, parties were how Americans accessed their democracy.

The Founders were not vocal about political parties, and they may not have foreseen the permanence that they would eventually have in the American political system. They did, however, choose to rally supporters on opposing sides of contemporary issues, as John Aldrich explains:

Instead of solving problems by vote trades among opposing leaders or by other forms of piecemeal, issue-by-issue compromise, these leaders—first Hamilton, then Jefferson and Madison—turned to organizing their supporters. In time these organizations would strengthen and would widen their scope with respect to both members and issues, to become the first political parties of modern democratic form in this or any nation. In 1790 none of the principals either foresaw the invention of parties or had any master partisan design in mind, but the path they set out on culminated in modern political parties.[^2]

Following George Washington’s presidency, the party system gained more steam, as Federalists and Republicans viewed the nature of a national government differently. Perhaps Washington was the only president who could be less political. Once parties became institutionalized, there was no going back. Even in today’s climate of anti-party establishment candidates, people seeking office still need to use parties to get ballot access. The 2016 Republican and Democratic presidential primaries were dominated early on by two candidates who have pushed back on the establishment of their respective parties. Donald Trump may be considered anti-establishment to the modern Republican field, but he did participate in the Republican nomination process. Only Washington got around that aspect because parties were not established at the time.

The latter nineteenth century to the middle twentieth century was a period of strong parties. From the 1950s to the present day, parties have become weaker. Fewer Americans see parties as their vehicle to democracy today.

While parties were relatively weak during the founding, the current weak stage of political parties is quite different. Perhaps parties are weaker because America has changed. Structurally, not much has changed in regard to American democracy. The Voting Rights Act exposed fault lines in the system as far as process, but structure has not changed dramatically. Our system of federalism, courts, and the voting process has remained relatively unchanged for much of the last half century. There have been great changes in political power in Congress and in the presidency, as well as on the local and state level. But those changes are political, not structural. As Louis Hartz has explained, America has no history of feudal past, and therefore does not indulge in revolution. In other words, despite hostile elections and campaigns, Americans respect the structure that is in place. Parties are no exception in that they are permanent institutions—underutilized, but not going away.

Parties are not membership-driven to the point where they discriminate on matters of social status, race, or even an individual’s belief system. People can register in parties on an equal footing. Some have argued that because there is a dispersion of those actively engaged in parties, there tends to be an inequality of participation, and thus an inequality of government resources.[^3]

STRONG PARTIES

As the country grew, especially economically, the demands for a more involved national government emerged. The middle of the twentieth century is a good starting point to examine the decline of party influence in American politics. The presidency of Andrew Jackson and the high point of the spoils system marks a strong period for parties. This was when parties went from being a result of how the Founders governed, to being established institutions.[^4] Jackson’s Democratic Party was the image or structure for parties to follow, and John Aldrich sums this up well, “Electoral politics in the first parties, while assuming many of the same forms to come later simply paled in comparison with the electoral organization of Jacksonian democracy.”[^5]

The modern Republican Party, which developed some thirty years later, grew to similar heft as the Democratic Party. For Jackson, the party in charge was the government in charge. Party bosses were the way people accessed parties. The Democratic Republicans (now the Democratic Party) had less competition with a waning Federalist Party in the early 1800s. The emergence of the Republican Party (former Whigs for the most part) in 1850, however, solidified the two-party system that we have today. Parties were in a period of strength in this period, so much so that Republican Abraham Lincoln was lauded for bringing opposition party members into his cabinet, which was not regularly practiced. Lincoln would have a great deal of trouble in a Republican primary race today, if were here to seek the nomination.

New York City’s Tammany Hall, for example, was a political machine. It was through Tammany that people accessed their government. This type of muscular party system had its detractors, but it also had supporters. One supporter was Tammany Hall political operative George Washington Plunkitt, who adamantly defends a version of strong party politics better described as machine politics:

When the people elected Tammany, they knew just want they were doin.’ We didn’t put any false pretenses. We didn’t go in for humbug civil service and all that rot. We stood as we have always stood, for reward-in’ the men that won the victory. They call that the spoils system. All right; Tammany is for the spoils system, and when we go in we fire every anti-Tammany man from office that can be fired under the law. It’s an elastic sort of law and you can bet it will be stretched to the limit.[^6]

As blunt as Plunkitt’s description is of a spoils system, it is the type of exclusive political activity for which Madison warned. By the way, how does one not love the brutal honesty that Plunkitt pours out? It is a testament to the muscle of Tammany Hall to simply celebrate all of the political things of which people were suspect at the time. What is more, Plunkitt was a man defending the system of politics that he knew. In the end, this is not very different from the way party loyalists defend the current system.

Progressives moved to make changes to that system. Wisconsin Senator Robert La Follette wanted to wrest power from party bosses and return the process choosing candidates to the party in the electorate. One of La Follette’s early concerns as governor was to introduce a direct a primary system that would pull power away from the party machines and put that power in the hands of the electorate. This is an important parallel to nonpartisan elections in contemporary politics. The primary system was viewed in La Follette’s time as a threat to the party system.

THE DIRECT PRIMARY

The direct primary was a bold suggestion because parties were seen as the buffer zone between American politics and big industry. Party bosses may have been susceptible to certain types of influence, but they were in safe positions to choose candidates. A primary election would make choosing candidates more competitive, but could also make candidates more prone to outside fundraising.

The first direct primary was introduced by South Carolina in the re-aligning year of 1896. There may have been an argument for the direct primary including African-Americans in the Midwestern states, although there is not a great deal of evidence of that, but the South Carolina primary was only for white males. The advent of the primary in American politics was important, but it was not useful to Southern blacks as Albert D. Kirwin (quoted by Elizabeth Sanders) explained in Revolt of the Rednecks, “The Negro fared the same—no better, no worse.”[^7] Sanders explains the exclusivity of the Southern primary and how it ended:

It excluded the African-American from what was, in most cases, the only significant election, and the contention that the organization that conducted this election (the Democratic Party) was a private and exclusive association of white citizens reigned until the Supreme Court struck down the white primary in 1944.[^8]

Before examining the development of the primary any further, it is important to make what should be an obvious point. In the midst of people like La Follette pushing for reform in the post–Civil War era, black Americans were politically invisible, even to the reformers. It took courage for reform-minded politicians to introduce a primary system because it was a huge slight to party bosses who had given their lives to this work. None of this, however, forgives the fact that a large portion of Americans were ignored when it came to political participation and basic human rights.

Southern primaries, although exclusive, may have been more useful than the early western and Midwestern primaries. Southern primary voters were relatively poor, and many were peripheral farmers. They almost always elected populist candidates that reflected their concerns. The change that the Southern primary brought about was evidence that politics change when the process becomes more inclusive.

Candidates that won primaries in the diverse regions of the country might go on to win in a general election, but they would have been without a political machine backing their agenda. The primary system took the party bosses out of the process, but it did not eliminate them. Once elected, politicians still required political support, and a diverse candidate that was not the party choice before the primary might not have the support needed to survive. In the South, however, the parties and candidates were all quite similar in their focus on the rights of farmers on the periphery. Party bosses may have lost some power with the direct primary, but they have survived this reform. Neither party has seen an unbalanced advantage due to the direct primary, which makes this particular reform nonpartisan.

The direct primary was seen as a way to reign in the influence of the banks and railroads, especially in the South, where farmers were often at odds with such industrial influences. The California State Primary Law was enacted in 1909. Until 1909, nominating conventions decided which candidates would appear on a ballot. Progressives fought for, and won, the introduction of the direct primary in California, and its first post-primary governor, Hiram Johnson, was the kind of candidate that many of them envisioned.

THE SLACK TIDE: IN BETWEEN THE STRONGER AND WEAKER PERIODS FOR PARTIES

Following the period of strong parties was an explosion of growth in the country, both in populous and economic. In the progressive period, with Theodore Roosevelt, Robert La Follette and Woodrow Wilson leading parties, the two major parties were strong parts of the democratic process. There were very few people who registered to vote and did not choose a party. There was a great deal of experimentation within the parties themselves (such as La Follette pushing for a direct primary and FDR trying to eliminate his party’s Two-Thirds rule), but among the electorate, the two major parties were established entities.

There were third parties that emerged in this period, but none had any staying power. The period of strong parties eventually led head first into the development of the modern presidency. Strong parties and strong national leadership would provide effective presidents, like FDR and Reagan, with ideological collectives that could carry their agendas. Parties, however, would eventually weaken as the presidency grew stronger. This meant that presidents would emerge as the de-facto leaders of their parties, and thus any thought of reforming the party process was less likely.

WEAK PARTIES

The American economy was growing exponentially in the middle twentieth century, yet parties were at a peak—meaning that they were about to decline. American culture changed following World War II, and the hypothesis here is that this change is important when exploring the decline of political parties that followed. Figure 1.1]] shows how voters leaned regarding parties in 1950.

In 2008 and 2012, with the same wording, the results were different. There were more responses that veered away from the two major parties (see Figure 1.2]]).

Enthusiasm about politics may not be predictable in American politics, but voters have drifted away from identifying with parties.

ECONOMIC CHANGE AND POLITICAL CHANGE

America was changing and expanding west during the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century. Economic development of the country came with a cost to democracy. The changing shifts were not simply regional. Demographically, there were tremendous numbers of new Americans pouring into the country, many of them taking jobs in the expanding manufacturing industries. Much of the manufacturing belt at this time was in the northeast region. It would not be long before labor movements would develop. What gave the labor movement muscle were two factors: the large numbers of laborers (thanks in part to immigration) and the political alliance that they established with agrarian reformers.

A bigger difference between the late nineteenth century and today is not defined by ideology but instead by economics. Regardless of politics, there was unprecedented economic growth in this period. Parties were fighting among themselves at times, and they were fighting with each other. There was not, however, any doubt as to the good news of the growing economy and the optimism that it brought. Today’s Democratic and Republican parties argue over ideological policy without the backdrop of a certain economic future. This could cause insecurity in the electorate that leaks into the parties in government. Political pundit Chris Matthews once explained how Americans are always “next.” If the economy is weak, Americans tend to think they are next to lose their jobs, so they may lean more toward a Keynesian or supportive government, type of economics. When the economy is growing, Americans tend to see themselves as next to become wealthy, and so they favor tax cuts. Matthews was arguing that these are sometimes the same people behaving differently depending on circumstance. There is this self-absorption among the electorate that steers voting behavior, and when they have no party registration anchoring them, they can bounce from idealistic to skeptical rather quickly.

Contemporary critics of federal regulation often point to the Founders’ intentions when analyzing the legislative and the executive branches. The debate between constitutional purists and more progressive types stems from the period between 1880 and 1940. This debate is still alive today in American politics. Progressive Democrats are pushing for more safeguards, while conservatives want fewer regulations. Before the late nineteenth century, the push for federal regulation was either non-existent or not terribly visible. This time period, however, is when large portions of the electorate began to look at the role of the federal government differently. The catalyst in bringing about this reform is the residual effects of economic expansion. Laborers and farmers were growing more politically active, although not necessarily more politically partisan. No longer was American politics completely dominated by Anglo-Saxon property owners. The pool of political influence now included Catholics, women, farmers, and manufacturers. Historians such as Theda Skocpol, Elizabeth Sanders, and Stephen Skowronek point to various elements in identifying what caused the creation of the American state.

The creation of the American state matters because the federal government developed most during this period due to the appetite for reform. Economic expansion drives reform in many cases. These historians share one element in common in their research, which is that the post–Civil War United States led to the emergence of a new American electorate. For Skocpol, in Protecting Soldiers and Mothers, the state emerges as a result of the end of the Civil War through social programs, such as Civil War pensions, that eventually become unifying elements for the country.[^9] The developments of such programs are indicative of what was then a changing American state. Skocpol explains how these kinds of policies got traction rather quickly as the war ended, “This was especially true when it came to eligibility for benefits. Civil War pensioners could automatically claim disability for manual labor due to old age by 62.”[^10] These new duties for government led to new expectations of parties and candidates.

Agrarian interests became influential enough to change the country’s politics. The federal government saw an obligation to regulate the railroads and other types of industry as a means to keep America’s democracy whole. John Aldrich, explains how the expanded American led to a “golden age” for American politics:

Indeed, the “golden age” of parties (also known from another perspective as the most corrupt of partisan eras) is generally located in the late nineteenth century. From these heights, political parties entered a long, slow period of decline, according to the magisterial account of Burnham (1970). The decline would have been continual except that, he argues, it was broken by a short but sharp revitalization of parties in the New Deal era.[^11]

Aldrich makes an interesting point in his mention of the New Deal era and how periods of abnormality are just that—not normal. The discussion here is only to set up the premise that the country’s politics was headed toward an era of weakened parties, despite the hiccups of the New Deal and Cold War.

These arguments all point to the idea that the old governmental structure was changing. The population growth among laborers and farmers meant that political interests would inevitably change. These Americans were less concerned with responsible parties and more concerned with responsible government. Reform was coming, and it was not focused on a particular party’s agenda. Without the backdrop of economic growth, polarization gets sharper. It is one thing to argue over now to spend money. It is entirely something else to argue over why money is no longer there. In a strong party system, reformers take a political risk of losing support from parties. Parties may not stifle reform, but they do not always encourage it.

SCHOLARLY THEORIES ON PARTY POLARIZATION: WHAT IS HOLDING UP REFORM?

Are political parties necessary for government to perform innovatively and efficiently? If the answer to this is no, the study of party history and direction many not be very vital to American democracy. Data has shown that more and more Americans have drifted away from parties, and thus the two major parties have become more ideological. If the two-party system, being staunchly rooted in ideology or values, were producing a more effective government, then it serves democracy well. What we have seen in recent decades, however, is that polarization has slowed reform politics. New York State, for example, has had a divided government for all of the last twenty five years. The state assembly is heavily liberal, while the state senate has been relatively conservative for most of that time. In 2012, the state’s Conservative Party cross-endorsed the Republican candidate in 42 contests in the state senate.[^12] Divided government is not necessarily a cause for polarization, but in this case it has caused state budgets to arrive late 22 out of the last 25 budgets between 1984 and 2009.[^13]

A reason why politicians are slow to work together on something as necessary as a state budget is because they can take the time. There may simply be no need to work across the aisle if a politician’s seat is safe. If the political system has created districts that are relatively safe according to ideology, there may be no need to compromise. This chapter outlines a few scholarly theories on why our political system and parties have become polarized. These theories are relevant because they help explain how voters approach parties and what they are looking for in American politics. None of these theories stand alone as reasons for our polarized climate, which I will explain later in more detail, but they are useful in understanding the dramatic change that America has experienced in the last fifty to seventy five years. That phrase “The American Century,” which is used to define America’s leap into becoming a super-power, also marks the period where America’s political party system began to decline.

Some arguments that scholars put forth explain how parties, and our politics, have become polarized. The two major parties have a long history, so it is no surprise that they have both gone through changes. The Republican Party has gone from a progressive to a socially conservative party. The Democratic Party, the older of the two, has also experienced great change. As for the modern (post–World War II) era, scholars have written about why our politics have grown so polarized and why we do not see reform as often.

There are many reasons why Americans choose one party over another when they actually register with a political party.[^14] Family ties are certainly one reason for their possible loyalties, while work and life experiences would most likely weigh in as important as well. American life, since the early and middle twentieth century has grown ever more complex. Families often have more than one (multiple, in many cases) breadwinner.[^15] This means that more Americans are exposed to a diversity of issues, namely economic issues.

The American Narrative Argument

Something happened on the way to the twenty first century that changed how Americans approached politics. E.J. Dionne, in Our Divided Political Heart, makes the argument that the current polarization in American politics is due to how history is handed down from one generation to another. For Dionne, if we cannot agree with how we got to this place in our politics, then there is little to hope for remedying the problem of polarization:

We typically blame this on our “polarized politics,” our “vicious political culture,” our “gotcha,” and our “partisan” media climate… But procedural, technical, and symbolic reforms are inadequate because our difficulties run deeper. Underlying our political impasse is a lost sense of national balance that in turn reflects a loss of historical memory. Americans disagree about who we are because we can’t agree about who we’ve been.[^16]

Dionne may be onto to something that is beyond simple adversarial politics. The notion that there needs to be a national understanding of history seems challenging, even if it is true that history creates a lens focused on our political values. An analogy to this point could be how Middle Eastern cultures hand down different versions of history and this has resulted in a polarized environment. The history that is taught to young Israelis and young Palestinians, for example, can be attributed directly to how they approach their own politics and worldviews. American politics is not any more immune to the effectiveness of historical perspective. What Democrats may view as the right values to prioritize are not always the same values that the Republican Party views as priorities.

For Dionne, the American story was gradually told differently. The splendor of American exceptionalism comes from the perspective that relates to American individualism. A person approaches the American dream alone, and makes a success of him or herself.[^17] A government exists, but only for limited purposes. Any government involvement that exceeds this, according those who stress individuality, is practicing a false notion of what the Founders intended. Barack Obama attempted to push back on that narrative in campaign speeches in 2012. Obama explained that even the most successful people did not build their businesses on their own, but had the institutional framework that often does not get mentioned. This leads directly to one of Dionne’s chief points of contention with the issue of polarization; the emergence and success of The Tea Party in American politics. While Dionne explains that these two varied understandings of the Founders’ intent has led to a polarized political atmosphere, he actualizes these two camps with the New Dealers and Tea Party activists.

Dionne stresses the middle class throughout Our Divided Political Heart most likely because that is the sector of the population that primes the economic pump, and it is also the sector that is best known to volley between individualistic and communitarian sentiments. According to Dionne, Americans have lost a sense of the Long Consensus.[^18] In other words, what Americans once shared politically, regardless of ideology, was a thought that the country needed to be better off in the long term. Dionne explains how this focus on the Long Consensus got lost in the last half century:

But the Long Consensus also fell into difficulty because many Americans outside the ranks of the Tea Party and the right concluded that government was no longer the realm of “us” but it was, in fact, under the control of “them.” The rise of Occupy Wall Street was powered by a sense that government served the interests of the wealthiest Americans—and those of the banks and the financial institutions—rather than the needs of the remaining “99 percent” of the citizenry.[^19]

In the past, Americans may have disagreed with the process, but prior to this period of polarization, they did not disagree on the America they wanted. A weakness in Dionne’s argument might be that perhaps Americans gravitate toward communitarianism more in periods of political abnormality. Was the New Deal the natural bridge to what the Founders wanted, as posited by historian Gordon Wood? There is a possibility that Americans gravitated toward the New Deal because the political-economic situation in the country was so out of the norm that the middle class simply embraced it.

The discussion as to whether Gordon Wood got the Founders’ understanding right when he described them as having the common good in mind has great use to those of us who are exploring this notion of history. American politics has always had varying understandings of the Founders’ intent (be it communitarian or individualistic), and yet the country has weathered polarization better than it does today. Something is very different today, and it could be due to a more recent phenomenon than what the Founders were thinking.

It has become useful political rhetoric, especially from those on the political right, to quote history as a means to encourage conservative policy initiatives. Dionne is right to point to the Tea Party as having capitalized on that notion. It could be said that many in politics use elements of history to win support. So many politicians, from both parties, quote Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., for example. Partisans will quote Dr. King in completely different contexts. The same is true for how politicians react to the Constitution. James W. Ceaser, himself a relatively conservative scholar is quoted by Dionne, as having written the following about this defaulting into history for political purposes, “Like the experience of foreign travel; it (the value of history) can refresh the mind and provide a sense of distance from the familiar. How sad it is, therefore, that so much academic history today does just the opposite, projecting current issues back onto the past, invariably for the purpose of promoting a contemporary ideological viewpoint.”[^20] That quote is very telling in how politics takes from history what it wants or needs.

The historical context is a good argument, but perhaps not a great one, for explaining political polarization in that it addresses more regarding the party in the government. Dionne offers little evidence that Americans are deeply affected by historical perspective. The Long Consensus theory could be true; there is no empirical evidence to support it.

The Geographic Polarization Argument

There is an argument posited by Nicole Mellow that suggests that a great deal of our political polarization comes from the regional affects of politics. This geographic explanation may not fully explain political polarization, but the argument is useful. America’s diversity of land, resources, and business interests are a good dynamic for polarization.

Mellow makes the main argument that politicians exploit differences that develop through regional and cultural divides.[^21] The idea of politicians as opportunists is not a revelation. To what significant extent would regional rhetoric and politics contribute to a polarized climate? Mellow explains that geography is central to important cultural and political changes:

Existing analyses of political geography, whether they emphasize economy or culture, run aground on contemporary party politics. Political economists fail to explain the contemporary cultural divisions that are paramount in political debate, and the cultural accounts that could help explain today’s divisions cannot be sufficiently leveraged until they are made to respond to geography-specific economic and demographic changes. To understand why and how both traditions inform the current partisanship, we need a better understanding of region and its political significance.[^22]

Southern and western politicians have made careers out of rallying against northeastern elites.[^23] Politicians take advantage of the diversity of the country. The strength in Mellow’s argument, however, is that culture and region are so closely connected.

A great modern example of this cultural change is in the American South. The South’s aversion to federal involvement after Reconstruction remained a constant factor in its politics. The Republican Party, once the least popular party in the American South, absorbed the states’ rights culture of the South, and became dominant. Mellow is right that there are regional differences, but the more important part of the argument is that there are cultural differences at play. A significant part of that change occurred in the second half of the twentieth century.

There was a steady increase in House GOP representation in southern states. At the same time, Republican representation in northeastern districts was declining. Simply put, region matters. This change eventually benefited the GOP as it gained more permanent ground in the South. This change in regional representation is interesting, and it also means that the election of Jimmy Carter may have been something of a last gasp for the Democratic Party on a national level in the South. Carter, a popular southern governor, garnered the support of the Christian Coalition, an organization that would go on to be a factor in the rise of the Republican right. The South was moving in a Republican direction as the above chart indicates, but 1976 was the post-Nixon period for Republicans, and Carter was able to hold onto a number of southern states, despite continuing the trend of losing white votes in the south. Figure 1.3]] is an indication of how the vote turned out in the election of 1976.

What this charts illustrates is that the Democratic Party was still in a position to win in some southern states, but the demographics were not on their side. Southern whites, in the post–civil rights era, were drifting over to the Republicans consistently.

What we are seeing more and more in presidential elections is a sign of political polarization in the country. Bill Bishop, in The Big Sort: Why The Clustering of Like-Minded America is Tearing Us Apart, explains that in presidential elections, more GOP districts are resulting in landslide elections. In other words, in districts that have Republican majorities, those are considered completely safe wins for a GOP presidential candidate. It also implies, however, that in districts that lean Democratic, or even close to evenly represented by both parties, Republican presidential candidates have not been very successful. This goes against the winning playbooks of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. This is another way of showing how divided the electorate is and how districts are built to not change.[^24]

Florida, for example, would eventually become a state that was “in play” for the Republicans. Most people, especially those of the Millennial generation, would be surprised to see California colored red, while Texas was blue. This argument that polarization is directly connected to geography is interesting, but it does not fully explain polarization. The weakness in this argument is that in order for geography to be the driving force in recent political polarization, one has to ignore the regional differences that have always existed. In other words, the argument is good, but it does not stand on its own because geographic and economic factors have always been a sticking point in American politics. Even if we look at geographic polarization through a specific policy lens, it is not new. Mellow very succinctly characterizes how economics are directly connected to polarization:

Party conflict historically has intensified when the parties have hailed from different regions. For political economists, this is because fundamental economic differences between the regions lead parties in those circumstances to fight for control of the nation’s resources. The logic is that the more members of a party hail from the same region, the closer their interests, and therefore their policy preferences, will be.[^25]

What Mellow may be describing is the problem of the dual role of Congress. Balancing the work in Washington and back at home (regionally) is important for incumbents. History is filled with regional differences that eventually leak into our politics. Would members of Congress work better together if it were not for the polarized electorate that they need to impress? Polarization can also be matched with what scholars refer to as realignment. Realignment occurs over a period of time and documents the changes in the electorate. It can breakdown regionally, although the theory is not solely based on geography. Regional emotion would likely fuel party polarization, yet Americans are more averse to joining parties than ever before.

Philosophical Realignment Theory

Realignment theory is not specifically geographic, but when realignment occurs, it often does break down along geographic lines. The theory of realignment as introduced by V.O. Key suggests that after an approximate amount of time, the electorate realigns. Economic and demographic changes over a period of twenty four to thirty six years, causes a change in the electorate. Parties and electorates realign. Key posited this theory and refined it as “secular realignment.” Walter Dean Burnham embraced the notion that electorates realign and it occurs for Burnham, not with a whimper, but with a bang. Significant elections have changed the controlling elements of government. The election of 1800 ushered in Jefferson’s Democratic-Republican Party to power in Congress and the executive branch. Realignment theory suggests that changes in the electorate build up over time. The lower rate of party registration may even suggest that future realignments are faulty. Even if a party dominates in a critical election, with much of the electorate unaffiliated, it is hardly a realignment at all.

Everett Carll Ladd has posited that electorates experience philosophical realignments. This understanding most closely resembles the argument that the culture can change electoral behavior. Ladd describes realignment in four distinct periods; post-revolution, Jacksonian, industrial revolution, and post-industrial. For Ladd, all realignments thus far can fall into one of these categories.[^26] If we examine the post-industrial period and the slowing influence of big labor, and match that up with the timing of southern voters’ shift toward the Republican Party, there is the make up for the realignment that eventually took place in 1994 (if we choose to call 1994 a realignment). America’s post-industrial economic period is probably the single most significant influence of change in American society, whether the issue is politics, social behavior, or economic concerns.

The type of alignment that Ladd attributes to the current political climate is a post-industrial alignment. Where at one time the electorate expressed more ideology, today’s climate for realignment, according to Ladd, is centered on skepticism toward government. Each party makes a claim that it can ratchet down the cost of government as the blank (independent) voters are the most skeptical and the most sought after.[^27] This theory of the electorate, and how it reacts to economic periods is very useful. It helps explain how modern economic concerns in the post-industrial age have contributed to a lack of party involvement (as well as involvement in many traditional organizations).

The benefit of this contemporary focus is that it is unfolding in front of us. The post-industrial era, however, is still in progress. Do we characterize the post-industrial period by the pro-market 1980s or the financially and culturally conscious Obama period? The answer to this question is still unfolding. The philosophical change in our electorate is still developing, but these changes have caused a great deal of polarization in the electorate.

Perhaps it is our expectation of government that has led to the polarization in our politics. Expectations of government has changed dramatically from a survey taken in 1941 to those taken in the last two decades. In April of 1941, Gallup polled Americans on whether the national government had too much power. North of 50 percent of those polled answered that the government did not have too much power. Only 30 percent of people in that poll felt that government was doing too much.[^28] Gallup retries a bunch of political questions on which it continues to poll over decades. It is very valuable information for political scientists because it gives us a timeline. In 2013, that same question on whether the government was doing too much garnered almost 60 percent in the “yes” column, up from just over 30 percent in 1941.[^29] It would be fair to point out that in 1941, there was lot of national anxiety. The country was at war and had just climbed out of a depression that many thought might have crushed the republic. People may have been less inclined to think government was too muscular at the time. Even with those circumstances, however, a gap of 30 percent signifying a change in attitude toward government is hard to ignore.

1994 was a realigning year for the Republicans, but the polarization, which started in the middle of the twentieth century, seemed to get more potent by the early 1990s. Although the results of the second poll could partly be the result of the anxiety that came with a young new, young Democratic president, there began to emerge an aversion to government from all sides. Two years later, President Clinton declared in his State of the Union speech that “the era of big government is over.”[^30] Even before that speech, Clinton had made cutting bureaucracy a part of his campaign.

What caused this mutual distrust of government and could it be linked to why voters are slower to register in mainstream political parties? Ladd points to six features, or contributing factors, that may explain this:

•A philosophical realignment which sees the electorate significantly more conservative than it was in the preceding era, especially in the sense of being far less inclined to accept claims that more government represents progress;

•Markedly weakened ties of voters to the political parties;

•Televisions dominance as the campaign’s medium and an institutional setting that is a vast departure from predecessor systems. Candidates lacking television access to voters on a par with their opponents in a very real sense lack political free speech. New political gatekeepers, including television news producers, on-air journalists, and talk show pundits, are a major force in this “electronic democracy.”

•In large part due to factors that inhere in the loss of party loyalty and the dominance of television, the contemporary system lacks a majority party/minority party model that Samuel Lubell described so vividly nearly half a century ago.

•Divided government does not inevitably follow in a no-majority-party era, but it is naturally more readily obtained in one.

•Finally, the composition and alignment of social groups that we see today in politics-differing sharply as they so from those of the New Deal years-persist because they reflect central structural features of the post-industrial economy and the group conflicts and cultural tensions of this era.[^31]

There are many reasons why voters get dissatisfied with parties. Ladd illustrates that the American experience greatly affects our politics. This understanding is in line with Robert Putnam’s theory that Americans have changed. Americans join traditional organizations less than they used to—and parties are organizations.

The Immigration Argument

Any study on American voting behavior has to include the importance of how the electorate has changed demographically. Since the mid-twentieth century, a large portion of the American immigrant population has been from Latin America. Many of these voters tend to start off as independents, at least for a little while.[^32]

Zoltan L. Hajnal and Taeku Lee, like Dionne and Mellow, offer an explanation for the diminished returns of political parties. For Hajnal and Lee, the reasoning is not that we have handed down the American narrative differently or that geographic fault lines caused polarization, but that immigration has not been approached in a way that makes parties more attractive.

New Americans getting involved in the political process quickly is rather new. This is a big change from the Tammany days when politicians would meet new Americans at the ports and brought them into the political fold. Hajnal and Lee focus a great deal on this demographic change in the country and see it as what most greatly affects parties, as described in the following quote from Why Americans Don’t Join The Party:

the role of African Americans, Latinos, and Asian Americans in this partisan competition is far from predetermined. Despite the fact that these communities of color voted overwhelmingly for Obama in the 2008 presidential contest, the single most important finding in our research is that the bulk of this segment of the electorate remains uncertain about its place in the partisan landscape of the nation. The best data that we have indicate that the clear majority of immigrant-based groups such as Latinos and Asian Americans are not affiliated with either of the two major parties.[^33]

Voting populations, even those often-reliable Democratic populations, do not self-identify with parties very often. A study done by the American National Election Studies (ANES) in 2004 found that close to 38 percent of Latino voters were not committed to a particular party. The important aspect of that quote is that they surveyed these populations at the height of a major national election, when America elected its first African American president, as well as a Democrat. Although voters were energized, they did not run toward parties.

This research looks back to 1950 as a benchmark for where American political culture changed. It would be remiss to not mention how demography has also changed since that period. Not only did America change its approach to institutions, but the ethnic make-up has changed. What has changed regarding immigration and political parties? For one, immigration has risen dramatically since 1948. In 1948, approximately 100,000 people entered the United States. 1972 saw close to 400,000 immigrants coming ashore. In 2008, there were just under one million immigrants entering the United States.[^34]

As the population of immigrants increased heavily from the 1951–1960 decade, political parties experienced a period of decline. Hajnal and Lee see a correlation between the two. They argue that white independents are not to be put in the same category as non-white independent voters.[^35] As the vast majority of immigrants came from Mexico and South America, they were slower to join parties. Voter identity is very much about relationships. Americans’ connection with institutions is about relationships. Americans have relationships with institutions. Politics is about community, and when people come to a new country to work and live, they become part of a community.

Contemporary generations may not have the same relationships with institutions as before. America’s demographic make-up, and a series of landmark legislation, has made such change possible. The Voting Rights, Civil Rights, and Immigration Rights Acts all contributed to the changing electorate. In this particular argument, these acts changed how Americans approached political institutions, as explained by Hajnal and Lee in the following:

More often overlooked—until recently—was the passage of the Immigration Act of 1965. Commonly referred to as the Hart-Celler Act, the Immigration Act of 1965 passed amendments that aimed to undo the restrictive quotas of the Johnson-Reed Immigration Act of 1924 and the McCarren—Walter Immigration and Naturalizations Act of 1952.[^36]

There is no question that the passage of several civil rights bills contributed to a changing national electorate. The Democratic Party took the lead on immigration and civil rights, and the rewards benefited the party. Many new voters registering after these amendments became, in large part, registered Democrats. Most of those new Democrats were African Americans and Hispanics, who are still today an important element of the Democratic Party. The Pew Research Center studies political typology, and even makes their questionnaire public each year. This is a great tool for teachers and students. Many times, I have assigned students to visit the page and see if their politics winds up in the category that they expect. According to Pew, African Americans identify with the Democratic Party to the tune of 80 percent, with roughly 10 percent going to the Republicans. This was not always the case. Without counting the post–Civil War period, where most African Americans were Republicans, there has only been one period where the Republican Party came close to closing the huge identity gap it has with black voters. In 1956, African Americans identified with the Republican Party at a percentage of close to 40 percent, a gain from the 20 percent of voter identification that existed for Republicans in 1936.[^37]

The Republican Party lost much of its black support in three eras. The first was when the party gave up on Reconstruction, thus leaving Jim Crow laws to blossom. The second was the Great Depression, when FDR and the Democrats befriended blue-collar labor. The third period where Republicans lost the attention of African Americans came during the combination period of Watergate, Vietnam, and Civil Rights legislation. So, why was 1956 different? How did the Republican Party, which closed a gap with this population, drop the ball—again?

1956 was well into the administration of President Dwight Eisenhower. Although Eisenhower was a Republican president, he chose to not dismantle the New Deal. The 1950s were not easy for African Americans, but it may have been a time when FDR’s efforts were enough in the rear-view mirror for northeastern black voters to consider the Republican Party. It would not take long for that spurt in GOP identity to drop back to under 10 percent, where it has lived ever since.

What is interesting is that in 1965, African Americans were 92 percent of the non-white vote. By 2000, African Americans were 50 percent of the non-white vote.[^38] In 2014, non-white voters counted for 25 percent of the vote, with less than half of that being African American.[^39] The country is clearly growing less white (and more Hispanic), but whether that is a reason for weaker political parties is still not entirely clear. The Hispanic vote is a little less predictable when it comes to party allegiance. Depending on place of origin and personal values, Latino voters can be an integral part of any election.

For Hajnal and Lee, parties failed to entice voters on three fronts. The first issue that voters have with parties is that they do not speak to values any longer.[^40] If they do speak to values, they do not do it with as much emphasis as they once did. There is room to disagree with this notion. Since 1980, conservative elements of the Republican Party have pushed the party to the right. Although modern immigrants may not be looking for conservative values in the two parties, the push toward conservatism is an expression of values. Hajnal and Lee make the argument that the parties are not standing up for values, but perhaps they are by becoming more ideological.

Native-born Latino voters are often blended into the American culture in many ways, but are not always engaged in the political issues of the day. Foreign-born Latino voters, however, might be more on top of current political events because the stakes are greater for them.[^41] With modernity, foreign-born Latinos can start developing opinions about American politics, even when they are still in their native countries. Matt Barreto explains the difference between the native and foreign-born Latino voter:

the naturalized Latino voter has lifecycle advantages over native-born citizens that make them potentially more likely to vote. Native-born Latinos and non-Latinos alike are “baptized” into the political system at age eighteen when their interest in politics and rate of turnout are known to be very low. . .In contract, as Ramirez (Ricardo Ramirez, 2002) argues, many foreign-born Latinos have been politically baptized when the stakes are higher.[^42]

This understanding of immigrant voting runs counter to what most political spectators might assume. Traditionally in the United States, people do not become civically active until they are at least a generation into their stay. Historically, immigrants were more concerned with remaining under the radar, and being less visible. Today, however, immigrants have a greater ability to hear about American politics even when they are in their native country. What is more, Latinos who are born in the United States are actually slightly less prone to vote, making them quite similar to their fellow Americans of all backgrounds. The aloof or ambivalent reaction to politics is a binding aspect for many Americans, regardless of background or nationality. Latino immigrants, however, have an appreciation for the democratic process, perhaps because they have a combination of familiarity with American politics and an appreciation for their ability to participate. There is also the added caveat that immigration is a modern-day issue that may well affect them.[^43]

There is great relevance to this is as the Latino wave of immigration has been so large in recent decades.[^44] If look at this same voting population in California in Figure 1.4]], we see how it has grown exponentially since 1998, but there is a big cleavage between eligible Latino voters and actual registered voters.

The drop-off in party participation (and the steadily low level of registered voters) came at about the same time that this wave of politically active immigrants gained momentum. It could be coincidental that parties are weaker at the same point in time that Latino immigrants become more involved politically. Although Latino immigration came along at the same time as the period of weaker parties, this party aversion was already taking place in the United States. Latino-Americans joined the political system already in place when they arrived, they did not change it in this regard.

Weaker parties, and the slowing of reform efforts in Congress and in state government, are the result of voters not acting to change the situation. There is a lack of voting activity in primaries, where candidates are chosen. Candidates are more in control of their campaigns than parties. It stands to reason that immigrants, being newly introduced to the political system, would follow this trend. They see parties as weak, and they are less prone to become very active in parties.

Latino partisanship is not as easy to pin down as national elections might suggest. In national elections, the Latino vote is relatively safe territory for the Democratic Party, but in local elections, this population can be less predictable. Cuban Americans have traditionally backed Republican candidates, namely due to their strong anti-communist stance. This differs greatly from Mexican Americans, who tend to favor the Democratic Party. Those, however, are mostly national trends. Locally, mayoral or gubernatorial candidates from both parties have seen Latino voters as potential supporters. Texas Governor George W. Bush won a substantial percentage of Latino support in his bid for re-election in 1998. New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani also did well with Latino voters in New York City. For the most part, those were two different Latino voter bases (New York is heavily Puerto Rican and Texas is largely Mexican American), but it still illustrates that Hispanic voters are not to be taken for granted by any one party in local elections.

Partisanship develops over time. Foreign-born Latinos vote more often than many other foreign-born groups, although they do not declare a party allegiance right away.[^45] A partisan allegiance develops over time, often taking a generation and a half, according to scholars. This is slightly different from previous immigrant waves. So, we see that there are two differences in the Latino immigration surge in the last twenty years as compared to previous immigration waves. First, there is the notion that foreign-born immigrants are voting more often and with more purpose than other immigrants have in the past. Second, these active, foreign-born Latinos are slower to join parties than other immigrant groups have been in the past. This makes the political landscape less predictable for policy makers, and perhaps even causes politicians to act more cautiously when it comes to introducing reform policies.

Have immigrants coming from Mexico and South America arrived with a different approach to assimilating into American culture? Samuel Huntington explains how more and more new Americans are holding onto an allegiance to their country of origin, thus showing a split loyalty:

America’s third major wave of immigration that began in the 1960s brought to America people primarily from Latin America and Asia rather than Europe as the previous waves did. The culture and values of their countries of origin often differ substantially from those prevalent in America. It is much easier for these immigrants to retain contact with and to remain culturally part of their country of origin. Earlier waves of immigrants were subjected to intense programs of Americanization to assimilate them into American society.[^46]

Huntington’s thesis is controversial, and some have described it as polemic and even racist. Huntington might have been right about a different attitude toward American democracy in present-day immigrants, but he was not right to assign this solely to Hispanics. The change away from institutionalism is not an Hispanic change, it’s an American change. Perhaps immigrants are coming here and adopting the culture of non-participation, and not the other way around. Huntington may have been right about his observation, and less right about the root cause.

Foreign-born Latinos not registering in parties, but still voting, is one unique characteristic of this population. Another interesting aspect of Latino partisanship breaks down along the lines of issues. Like most voters, Latino voters consider social and economic issues when identifying politically. Another factor that may be useful in examining modern immigrant voter patterns is that there are no substantial third parties today. Immigrant and first generation Americans in the previous century often had a third party choice to go along with the two major parties. The American Socialist Party, for example, might have been a choice for some immigrants coming to American today, whether they are from Russia or South America. For today’s new Americans, however, they are basically given the choice between two mammoth-sized, and seemingly soulless, parties.

Without third parties to push the two major parties toward values, there is no pressure on the major parties to step out and stand for values. Hajnal and Lee describe this as reluctance by the two major parties to adjust to the changing needs of new citizens:

How can only two major parties speak to an American electorate characterized by a dizzying array of experiences, motivations, and worldviews? How well do the two parties success at attracting those who are in various aspects “different”? Where do Americans whose interest, identities, and ideological beliefs are not recognized and represented by the two major parties go?[^47]

The argument here is that there are concerns on which the two major parties are not focusing. Immigrants may be coming here with an expectation that is more concrete or specific than immigrants in the past.[^48]

Another difference between past immigrants and today’s immigrants could be that they are coming in large part from South America, where there are often multiple party governments. Perhaps new Americans expect there to be more parties because they come from regions where that is the case.

This is not to suggest that immigrants coming from Europe in the nineteenth century did not come from countries with multiple parties, but democracy was not as widespread as it is today. The number of parties has grown in many countries, and modern immigrants may have different expectations as to party choice when they arrive. It may be more accurate to say that recent waves of immigration, namely from South America, are not that different in their values or in their appreciation for American politics, but parties should make a modern effort to bring them into their ranks. The challenges for immigrants today are not exactly the same as the challenges were for German, Irish, Polish, and other groups coming to American shores a hundred years ago. The following illustrates how Latino immigrants may be a wave of immigrants that need to be approached differently:

Instead, for both the Latino and Asian American population, the single largest group is what we call nonidentifiers, individuals who refuse to place themselves on the party-identification scale and who instead offer responded such as “don’t know,” “no preference,” or “none of the above.”[^49]

The third argument as to why immigrants do not join parties according to Hajnal and Lee is that parties are not doing enough to bring immigrants into the fold. Are parties trying less or working less to absorb immigrants than they did before, or does this wave of immigrants require a different kind of wooing? For Hajnal and Lee, the answer is the latter. What could be identified as a weakness in this approach is that the two major parties have made efforts to break ground with the Hispanic community and Latino immigrants. The Democratic Party has been discernibly more successful by embracing immigration reforms that would provide paths to citizenship.

The affiliation among registered Hispanics is heavily Democratic, but there are still a great deal of Hispanic voters who do not affiliate, or have not affiliated as of yet. A Gallup Poll taken at the same time of the Pew research showed that 51 percent of Hispanic voters were still unaffiliated with a party.[^50] If immigrants are not joining parties, it may not be because of a lack of outreach. The Democratic Party has done outreach.

The thesis in this research is that the country has changed, and along with it our voting behavior. If the hypothesis is that Americans view institutions differently today is true, immigrants may be simply catching on to what they see when they arrive. If Mexican immigrants are claiming that their path to citizenship is unfair, it may be because they are entering a society that is now bucking tradition and emphasizing fairness.

This suggests a psychological attachment that voters have with parties. The value of the Michigan School theory is that it fits so many other societal attachments that people share. Families sometimes identify as Republican or Democratic families, the same way they may root for similar athletic teams. Hajnal and Lee describe this pattern that follows individuals throughout life, “This habit, moreover, persists over the source of an individual’s life. More than 90 percent of self-identified Democrats reported never having identified as Republicans, and about 80 percent of self-identified Republicans reported never having identified as Democrats on ANES continuum of party identification. Across seven initial 95 percent of respondents were able to locate themselves somewhere on the party identification scale.”[^51]

Downsian Theory approaches partisanship differently. The Downsian model suggests that people gravitate to what affects them (in most cases, economically) the most. Partisan leanings are, for most voters, a cross of what is suggested in both theories. Voters are partial to the values that they have developed over time. They are also quite sensitive to what may affect their future. McWilliams articulates how Americans are drifting away from traditional ties and toward a more Downsian approach to institutions:

Political allegiances, consequently, show signs of fragmenting. Political fashion features “identity politics,” which—by emphasizing different experiences and unique perspectives—points first to groups (most insistently, genders, races, and sexual orientations), but ultimately to individuals. Organized group membership, accordingly, is declining in favor of “networks” and volunteering, styles of participation—fluid, informal, often intense, but relatively episodic—in which civic involvement is shaped to the mood and convenience of the individual.[^52]

Americans are looking at how they attach to groups differently than they did before.

Here we have a number of arguments by scholars that attempt to explain why voting parties have become weaker in the last sixty years. For Dionne, the story of the American experience is different, and thus the values are different. Voters are not gravitating toward parties because parties are not same institutions that they once were. For Mellow, there is America’s great geographical divide, which creates a cultural divide. Hajnal and Lee point to the changes in immigration from the middle twentieth century. These scholarly theories are important, but they may not give us a the real understanding of why Americans are slow to embrace this great privilege of being a part of a American politics through parties. The narrative of the American experience is told in many different ways, thanks in part to multiculturalism and more outlets in which to tell the story. Mellow is right that geographical differences are real. All of these approaches to explaining why Americans are averse to joining parties are slightly flawed, however. The notion that there would be a unified description of what it means to be an American is difficult to envision. American diversity, both demographically and politically, do not allow for that kind of cohesion. Geographical divides have existed long before 1950, so that is not a new change. The argument that immigration has had an enormous effect on why parties have declined may be true, but it does not explain all of the white independent voters who are just as responsible for weaker parties as new Americans. There is a change in the American electorate that goes beyond race, demography, and geography.

Both the Democratic Party and the Republican Party have grown less attractive to new voters. This philosophical change, however, may seem worse for conservatives. The present day Republican Party clings to the “traditional values” moniker in an age of changing priorities. Both parties have lost momentum due to the move away from institutionalism. In other words, both parties have to deal with the notion that Americans are not joiners as they once were. The Republican Party, however, is in a worse position than the Democratic Party. How does a party that prides itself on traditional values grow when society is less attached to these values? This is not to suggest that the values of family, work, and community do not exist in modern American society. It simply means that traditional values do not always drive our politics. Unlike the Republicans, the Democrats have managed to merge this societal change into an agenda. Historically, Republicans have maintained that as new Americans assimilate into the culture, they share in the mission of a traditional values oriented society. Irish and Italian immigrants, arriving on American shores in the early twentieth century eventually became traditional Americans, following traditional American norms. They joined civic groups, were given mortgages, paid taxes, and eventually voted. Many of these immigrants, or their children, drifted to the Republican Party many years after Tammany Hall Democrats (and later Franklin Delano Roosevelt) introduced them to Democratic politics. From a strategy standpoint, the Republicans took the same approach to present-day Hispanic voters as they did with the Irish and Italians immigrants. Waiting for a population to assimilate and then woo them with establishment-oriented policies worked for the GOP, and they were hoping the same would happen with Hispanic Americans. To a degree, it could be argued that this shows some element of confidence in the Hispanic population that they too will be as successful in the American economy as the Irish and Italians before them. The reason why the Republican strategy is flawed is because it fails to take into account the change that has taken place in modern America. Previous generations of immigrants may have expected the country to develop around them less. Language differences, for example, were an obstacle that the individual needed to overcome.[^53]

It is difficult to pin down the identities of Hispanics as voters, since they are quite diverse and come from different countries. Cuban Americans, for example, tend to have a strong anti-communist sentiment. In standing strong against communism, the Republican Party established a beachhead with these voters. The Reagan doctrine was a values-based doctrine, and Cuban Americans adopted those values. Younger Cuban Americans are focused elsewhere. This is why the Cuban-American vote is no longer a sure bet for the Republican Party.

It could be argued that the Cold War created an issue in the study of American electoral behavior. Had American foreign policy not been absorbed with containing communism, Cuban Americans may well have followed the same path as all other immigrant voters, first gravitating to the Democratic Party and then drifting to the GOP. The Cold War may have thrown American electoral patterns off course.

The Cuban-American vote and the anomaly of communism aside, Republicans did not put forth a proactive approach to garnering Hispanic votes in the late twentieth century. While the GOP waits for Hispanics to arrive at their values, Democrats have appealed to their sense of fairness. The mistake that the Republicans made is that they were not beaten to the punch on getting Hispanic voters into their party. They simply chose to not chase these potential voters. It could be labeled a laissez-faire system of drawing voters. In Jeffersonian times, this laid back style of attracting voters would be considered professional, but in modern day politics this is considered being aloof and disconnected.

This strategy could prove fatal to the Republican Party. Relying on historical trends has been a risky, yet successful, approach for the GOP. Following the Vietnam War and the Watergate Scandal, the national party was weakened. This could have been the death knell for the Republicans, since the country was drifting away from the values-society model—although it was not so obvious at the time. The GOP has reason to think it can rebound from losing ground with Hispanic voters if history is a barometer. It has lost ground on a host of other reasons in history (early immigration trends in the beginning of the twentieth century, Vietnam, Watergate, etc.) and still bounced back. This is a risky strategy, although it has not proved fatal to the party. It can be fatal this time, however, because—unlike moments in the past—the culture of the country has changed. Scholars have discussed the possible future of a permanent majority for the Democratic Party, but that has not been realized at this point.

If the Republican Party is averse to chasing votes, it is worth noting that there was one period when they did put fairness ahead of traditional values. The very beginning of the party’s existence saw former Whig Party members and former Free Soil Party members come together to reject the expansion of slavery, namely the Kansas-Nebraska Act that repealed the Missouri Compromise. Northern Republicans opposed slavery, and following the Emancipation Proclamation, most African Americans were either Republicans or GOP sympathizers.

The Party in Theory . . . Theory

How involved have academics become in parties, and has that also been something that has pushed voters away? Intellectuals who influence policy, yet are not official party office holders, have become influential in agenda setting. Russell Kirk, for example, may not have been a Republican Party operative, but his beliefs about conservatism reformed the GOP in the early 1980s. Noam Chomsky, William F. Buckley, and Alan Bloom are among the scholars and writers who were expressing bold new political directions and stances. Parties were slowing down on the formation of policy as think tanks were growing in influence. This observation is important since many approaches to policy, whether they focus on a concept of progressivism or traditional values, are now coming from academic institutions and think tanks.[^54]

The Republican Party may have been the party of business and modest government regulation in the shift from William McKinley to Theodore Roosevelt, but eventually a vacuum opened for a values-based party. Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater used the phrase “in your heart, you know he’s right,” in his presidential campaign 1964. He was appealing to Americans who saw this drift from values and were concerned. The Republicans were about to split into two halves: the libertarian capitalist wing and Burkean social conservatives.[^55]

The emergence of the parties in theory means that it was not only people like Goldwater who were tugging at the parties’ ideological strings. Political theory was influential, and people like Russell Kirk were playing a large role in influencing parties. In 1953, Kirk wrote The Conservative Mind, a treatise on how traditional values should be the focus of conservative political thought. The Republican Party, through Kirk, Buckley, and other intellectuals, was finding a new voice. To add to this traditionalist muscle was the involvement of groups like the Christian Coalition, which later became known to many as the Christian Right. Organized religion, like political institutions, was losing steam and it found a kindred spirit in the Republican Party. This, however, caused a split with what many Republicans, especially in the northeast, felt was the cornerstone of the party. For libertarian, or pro-business, Republicans, the value of the party was in its pragmatism. Despite the Watergate scandal, the Nixon and Ford administrations were not radically different from the Democratic Party. The Republicans were about to split into two camps, and the presidential primary in 1976 was a good example of that split. Former Governor of California Ronald Reagan threatened the establishment GOP with a conservative agenda that caused a split in the party that is wider today.

Parties may have fallen victim to a philosophical change that was taking place in the country following the 1960s and the Vietnam War era. Academics, whether they were from universities or think tanks, were becoming more influential in policy agendas.[^56] Some have argued that because of heated debates in committees, legislators started consulting heavily with think tanks.[^57] This fostered a relationship between the parties (especially the parties in government) and think tanks. The influence of political theorists became more muscular at this time. After all, members of Congress had to spend more time being re-elected, so having think tanks steer some of the policy making was a welcome development.

The change that took place in America regarding its politics post-1950 was not solely a religious, demographic, or geographic change, even though such factors provide excellent examples of how Americans drifted away from traditional institutionalism. The change, it could be argued, was also philosophical. On the whole, this is a study on political parties, but the explanation as to why they have lost traction with American voters does have a philosophical bent.

If we choose to look at this period through a philosophical lens, we see that political theory was changing along with voting behavior. The era of what some refer to as “new pragmatism” began when students of the John Dewey school of political thought emerged. Richard Rorty was one of Dewey’s most ardent followers, and he described new pragmatism as the following:

Philosophers, who, like myself, eschew this distinction, must abandon the traditional philosophical project of finding something stable, which will serve as a criterion for judging the transitory products of our transitory needs and interests. This means, for example, that we cannot give up on the idea that there are unconditional, transcultural moral obligations, obligations rooted in an unchanging, ahistorical human nature. This attempt to put aside both Plato and Kant is the bond, which links post-Nietzschean tradition in European philosophy with pragmatic tradition in American philosophy.[^58]

What Rorty is explaining is that although ancient philosophy, such as that of Plato and Aristotle, has a great deal of value, there is a new criterion for which we use to explore what is right and just. While Rorty and Dewey see the importance of a traditional link that all Americans share, there is a constant theme of fairness and equality that runs through their work. The main traditional value, for the new pragmatists, is this push toward a fairer society. To them, this is the unifying link. This philosophy got traction at the same time that universities and academies were becoming more progressive. This may have had influence on the Democratic Party, or at least the progressive elements of the party. The term “ahistorical” is useful in exploring what has changed in our culture, including politically. If “historical” is a nod toward traditionalism, then perhaps society as the new pragmatists see it is not rooted in those traditions. The left was growing more ideological, as was the right. The results-oriented politics that grew out of local governments in Indianapolis, New York, Philadelphia and the District of Columbia is not always a good fit with ideological politics.

In the case of political parties, the culture changed how parties operate. The culture, it can be said, changed the politics of the country. Alexis de Tocqueville and Robert Putman showed us how Americans access democracy differently over time. The work of the new pragmatists on the left and conservative theorists on the right, are a potential reason for parties having deeper ideological roots. Once parties became more ideological, they became a vehicle for theorists or academics . . . many of which had no political stake in policy outcomes. Policy outcomes are not always as important as the values statement that a policy may make. In a meeting with leaders of a local, right-leaning, political party, I once posed a question about an issue that mattered to the party’s membership. Would they be willing to accept legalized abortion if there was a public policy that addressed pregnancy early enough so that (in this hypothetical) the abortion rate would go down to zero? In other words, would they trade zero abortions in exchange for legal language protecting abortion rights? The answer was unanimously in the negative. For this room of people, the values outweighed the outcome. The two major parties seem to be drifting in similar directions on this front. If this is how party members view public policy, it could explain less pragmatic candidates making it through the primary system.

ALL PASSION AND NO REAL CHANGE

In 2011, Francis Fukuyama penned an article titled Left Out for The American Interest that asked why, with so much controversy and inequality had there been so little outcry from the political left. He was suggesting that, with the economic crisis and the widening income gap, that there was no hint of revolution (political or otherwise) in America. Americans joining parties less frequently is also an indication of a lack of revolutionary spirit. Around the world in the present day, revolutions happen through some kind of party (or organizational) vehicle. Parties, even in various types of systems, are used all over the world as platforms for change. Americans are not joining parties with the enthusiasm they once did. This could be a symptom of what Fukuyama sees as a sedentary electorate.

Following the financial crash in 2008, neither party took a major swipe at the financial establishment. Americans may be split politically by the reasons mentioned, but they share common interests, and one of those interests lay in the free-market system. They want things and they want success. The financial crash of 2008 would have been a good time for sweeping change, but other than Occupy Wall Street, there was no real push politically. President Barack Obama called for new and stronger regulations, but the system itself was left unfettered. The government even did what it could to revive it.

Fukuyama wonders why that has not happened given the trifecta of a crashed financial sector, a controversial war, and concerns about the environment. He lays out a few potential reasons, but he mentions one that could be useful here. Fukuyama suggests that modernity, namely access to cheap credit, keeps many Americans in a state of limited hostility. People will argue politically, but in the end, they still want to buy the same things. They still want to earn money. Raghuram Rajan says in Fault Lines: How Hidden Fractures Still Threaten the World Economy that this is the one thing that binds all sides. People may have once shared a common bond of collectivism or a concern for the common good. Today they share the fact that they want things. Our politics are polarized, but our habits and expectations may be more homogenized than ever before.

The two major parties may be steeped in ideological fights while many Americans are more concerned with the after-effects of a free-market economy. They want to see the country succeed, especially on their watch. There are the theories about how to get to that point that have caused the split and Francis Fukuyama explains this, “The intellectual turn taken by the economics profession from Marxist or Keynesian models to strict monetarism and the Chicago School occurred right about the time that Reagan and Thatcher emerged on the political scene, and served to provide a seemingly scientific justification for market liberalization.”[^59]

Even with a heavily polarized political climate, the country will only go so far in what kind of change that it accepts. There may be bumper stickers expressing passion for all political stripes, but a sale is a sale, and Americans with easy access to credit are not going to stop being consumers in order to make a political statement. Reform may come slowly because, regardless of people’s politics, they are weary of what change could do the economic system that affords them comforts such as easy credit. When we look our modern political system, candidates are appealing to voters as though they are consumers. This plays directly into the theory that America’s post-industrial economic period is a big challenge for the country and its politics.

RESPONSIBLE PARTIES: THE CURE FOR A BETTER POLITICAL DIALOGUE?

Academics have been trying to stem the tide of weakened parties longer than politicians have, and the American Political Science Association’s (henceforth APSA) study “Toward a More Responsible Two-Party System,” is evidence of this. In a modern sense, responsible party government is a way of dealing with nationalized parties—by embracing the concept.

Responsible party government grew out of years of party observation as to how best to keep parties as robust institutions in our political system. It had become a concern to the APSA that the emergence of the Australian ballot and the autonomy of candidates could eventually lead to a party system that had little teeth in the eyes of the public.[^60] The study basically looked at the question; what do we want from political parties? Responsible party government is an approach to party politics where the values and agenda of the party are centralized. “The Report” in 1950 outlined how to best go about establishing such a system, but for right now, it is better to understand why.

David R. Jones and Monika L. McDermott explain responsible parties in the following text:

In the normative theory of responsible party government, elections are mechanisms crucial to enforcing party responsibility. According to Austin Ranney’s classical work The Doctrine of Responsible Party Government, “party government in its ideal form” should work such that when a party had been in power, “at the next election the people decide whether they approve of the general direction the party in power has been taking—in short, whether their wants are being satisfied.”[^61]

Although Jones and McDermott do a good job of defining the goal of responsible parties, one problem is that state and local concerns (and issues) differ from national concerns. How does a responsible party cover all of that ground? Responsible party government was something that Woodrow Wilson and many future members of the APSA very much favored. It is a system where voters are helped over the important hump of knowing what candidates stand for in elections. By attaching a blanket party agenda to candidates, the process gets simplified. Not only do voters have a better understanding of what candidates believe, but candidates are given an almost instant introduction to voters. Once voters see the party label, they have a roundabout understanding of his or her issue stances. The main thrust of responsible party government is to recognize that voters can understand parties easier than they can understand individual candidates.

If political scientists saw a remedy in responsible party government to what looked like a confusing party system, why did the idea did not get traction? For one, not all theories that come from research work in the real world. Those favoring responsible party government, according to Jones and McDermott, have often been academics who see it as a means to balancing a relationship with the voters:

Not surprisingly, advocates of responsible parties frequently lament the American system of separately elected institutions in part because they feel it subverts the ability of voters to hold the parties responsible. Their main concern is that with separately elected institutions, the same party does not always control both the legislature and executive branches; and that with both parties playing important roles in government, it may be difficult for voters to ascertain who is responsible for government performance.[^62]

Responsible party government was endorsed by Woodrow Wilson, but Wilson also favored a parliamentary system. If a responsible system resembles parliamentary government, that could be enough to turn people away from it. Americans may complain about their institutions but they do not want them changed. A Euro-style government might be a harder sell than the blurriness of the current system. Wilson is an important figure in understanding responsible parties because he was a staunch advocate of such a system, only to saunter away from this stance later as president. For a young Wilson, and for many scholars, a responsible system can live alongside a constitutional system of government. The American Constitution is a theoretical framework that defines the scopes and limits of government. A responsible system, however, is a more a blueprint as to how policy and parties operate. Wilson explains, in a rather lengthy quote from Congressional Government, that a constitutional or presidential form of government is a good starting point, but it may not be a workable system for the challenges that are ahead for any government, “The Constitution itself is not a complete system; it takes none but the first steps in organization. It does little more than lay a foundation of principles. It provides with all possible brevity for the establishment of a government having, in several distinct branches, executive, legislative, and judicial powers.”[^63] As Wilson explains that the Constitution is a “first step in the beginning of organization (organizational government),” he is also signaling that the demands of government are headed to a busier place. Wilson was only twenty eight years old when he wrote Congressional Government, but he was correct in seeing that government would grow more complex and more involved in public policy. For him, there needed to be a system that would be ready for the added constraints of government.

It is possible to see a responsible system as running counter to a federalist system where various levels of government, represented by variously elected officials, occurs through the electoral process. In other words, the American system was not designed to mimic that of Great Britain or Norway or any other parliamentary system. Americans tend to not like changes to their institutional frameworks, even when they are not happy. We will see evidence in the following chapter of how Americans are often dissatisfied with American politics, and yet do not wish to change much about the system.

There has been a longstanding debate, as old as the Constitution itself, about how power can or should accumulate in American government. The notion of a centralized government never sat well with Jefferson and the Republicans. It was what politicians like Calvin Coolidge argued against. All of this is to say that the theme of a centralized government, even in a democratic system is never an easy sell electorally. In the United States, it was also a difficult argument to make among many of the party faithful, especially presidents—with Wilson being one of them eventually. But Wilson saw centralization as important as the country moved into the twentieth century, “The leading inquiry in the examination of any system of government must, of course, concern primarily the real depositaries and the essential machinery of power. There is always a centre of power.”[^64]

Wilson questions how practical it would be to have a large complex government that shares power in a president, Congress, and judiciary. Sure, checks and balances are important in this adversarial system, but more to the point, how do things get done? Modern politics has seen many efforts at problem solving at the congressional and presidential level slowed or stopped because of a system that puts no particular power in a centralized place. An American version of a responsible system would not be a parliamentary system, but at least members of each party would share a political identity with the voting public. It is also important to point out that Wilson’s desire to see a muscular Congress slowed up when he was president of the United States. In fact, it is similar to when Senator Barack Obama opposed the nomination of Chief Justice John Roberts based on his feelings about expanded presidential powers. Obama was not as passionate about limiting presidential powers after he was elected president. The presidency has that affect people, where it causes them to rethink the scope of the office.

What occurred in the current system is that politics exists in the electoral process and it also exists in the legislative process. For Wilson and other responsible system advocates, some of the politics in the latter would be lessened, this making governing easier. One area where a responsible system may not mollify differences in the party system is in foreign policy. Because modern foreign policy is contingent on outside circumstances which are unpredictable, it is difficult for a party—or both parties—to have firm established stances on what may or may not happen. Modern foreign policy, which can mobilize voters at critical times, differs from that of past generations. There are fewer established enemy and allies. There are factions that do not represent states. For these reasons, responsible systems are more designed to give the American electorate an understanding of the candidates and parties in relation to domestic policies more than in foreign policy.

In a responsible system, there is a party in power and a party out of power, assuming that one of the two major parties would have at least two-thirds of the legislative process. With a party holding two-thirds of the process, and with members on the same page on most issue stances, there would most likely be a party “in power.” The British system allows for, and is celebrated for, its lively debates between the opposition party members and the party in power. For the British, this is a check on power. The prime minister can answer critics on policy in open debate. His or her party members, however, are along for the ride regarding the party’s policy stances. The American system has two major parties that often differ on policy, but there is a political universe within the parties themselves. These factions have caused government to slow down the legislative process. Even the debate process is not as popular in the United States as it is in Britain as Wilson writes, “It is because the parliamentary debates are interesting and ours are not.” Wilson admired the British system, enough to reference the country 47 times in Congressional Government.

An American system that calls for party responsibility would have to lean on the same type of party obligations as the Westminster model. The problem that the United States has is that candidates have to run for office—nationally and locally—primarily with the money they raise. There is less money in British politics, so it is easier for candidates to stick to the party script. In American districts, which are as diverse as the country itself, there are primary battles occurring on a constant basis. The different systems of parliamentary, responsible party, and candidate-based, can be debated at length. As long as the American primary system is designed in its current form, however, the idea of party responsibility is going to be a difficult one to attain.

Progressives fought for this primary system at the turn of the twentieth century as a means to give more of a voice to the party in the electorate. As cultural changes have taken place in Great Britain with their entry into the European Union, so have changes caused American parties to worry.

RESPONSIBLE PARTIES DO NOT RESONATE WITH POLITICAL LEADERS

What is more to the disadvantage of a responsible system is that party leaders would stand to lose turf. In the early 1960s, the leader of the Democratic Party was the incumbent president, John F. Kennedy. Kennedy set the party agenda, at least on a national level. An already inspirational and popular president, Kennedy was not about to hand the agenda setting over to a committee that met every two years. The same is true for Republican presidents. Once elected, they are the de-facto heads of their party. Once that first element of responsibility was nixed, there was little room to carry it further.

The study of responsibility is complex, but for now, the comparison to modern day party politics is useful. Responsibility is a way of nationalizing or homogenizing of party agendas. The whole idea behind it is to streamline what each party stands for so as to make them more understandable in the electorate. If modern parties have become nationalized, then it would stand that they are in a kind of a responsible system by default. If parties are only drawing voters in large national elections, it would appear that their presence at the local and state levels is not that significant. In 2013, New York City was electing a new mayor and Chicago was dealing with controversial public education measures, yet both cities recorded significantly low turnouts. Seattle did not have any serious races on their ballot in 2013, but there was a ballot initiative involving foods that were free of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), which did not get much attention on Election Day despite granola-type issues like this being popular in Seattle. Local elections, when not tied to national elections, are different political experiences. Non-national elections are becoming less of a concern to voters because they identify nationally.

Voters are far more enthusiastic about national elections than they are about local elections. They draw an attachment to national candidates that they do not with local candidates. Their personal politics has become more nationalized, or nationally focused.

V.O. Key’s assertion in 1966 implied that a national party’s performance would ultimately be the deciding factor in national elections. That assertion is not counter to the thesis here, although we could take that assertion a little further. How voters view national parties is reflected in how they react to state parties.[^65] State parties, while rather diverse in the micro sense, are hampered (or helped) by how their national wing is perceived. Since the current system is not modeled on responsibility, this is more of a result of the electorate holding parties responsible for performance. The issue here is that on state levels, performance may be quite different, but there is simply no way to break free of the shadow that national parties cast.

What is the difference between a responsible system and the evolution of a national party system? A responsible system occurs by design. The nationalization of parties developed for other reasons. Responsibility comes with designated rules and structures. Nationalized parties are quite the opposite. The two circumstances may resemble each other, but they are not the same. Responsibility was an idea that aimed to give parties more control over agenda setting. Nationalized parties, as they have occurred, are less predictable. What is more, the idea of parties becoming nationalized in their agendas is not necessarily the choice of the parties themselves—at least not at the local levels. Massachusetts Republicans, who are by and large moderates, are not indicative of the national agenda that leans to the right of them. The same might be the case for New York Republicans, who are less in sync with the national party. As the parties are viewed through a national lens, however, all state and local candidates are either helped or at a disadvantage due to this occurrence. The difference between responsibility and this modern climate for parties is that at least in the responsible model, party leaders would have some voice in setting the centralized agenda. Some examples of what a responsible system would seek to address according to the report set forth by the APSA Committee on Parties:

•Establishment of national councils

•Party platforms that outline what it means to be a member of said party

•Campaign financing support for candidates

•National conventions that occur every two years

The value of exploring this idea is head off what eventually happened to American parties, which is a lost or blurry identity for parties. How can people join parties when they are not sure what they stand for and how serious they are about certain issues? Alternatively, how can a party survive locally if they are homogenized into a small box? The responsible model puts the onus on parties to pore over the newly complex issues of the twentieth century and formulate a stance on these issues.

Responsibility advocates long supported this idea because they saw this as a means to keep parties responsible to both their own members and the electorate. As mentioned above, parties would be giving their candidates immediate agendas and help in the campaign process. Absent a defined party system, the political process often gets left to outside sources, which lends politics to the highest bidder. If the political system is under the influence of a small number of people, the reality is that reform is less likely. There is simply less of an incentive for reform because being “ideologically correct” trumps legislative achievements.

The closest semblance of a responsible system with regard to modern political parties was the Republican House majority that won office in 1994. Newt Gingrich, himself an academic, worked as a back-benching congressman on how to best go about winning and holding a majority. A large part of that strategy was to develop a series of goals that the GOP candidates would sign on to. Barbara Sinclair explains that it was not only Gingrich, but also former Speaker Jim Wright, who wanted an agenda that the party could build around:

Speaker Newt Gingrich’s Contract with America is the best-known instance of congressional party agenda-setting and one that conforms closely to the responsible party model. Though a highly inclusive process involving both House incumbents and Republican candidates for the House, Gingrich put together a legislative agenda, made it the centerpiece of a nationalized congressional campaign in 1994, and then, when republicans won majority control of the chamber, worked to pass all the elements in the first one hundred days of the session. As early as 1987, Speaker Jim Wright proposed and pushed to enactment a congressional Democratic agenda, though it was not set forth as an electoral document.[^66]

In the cases of both Gingrich and Wright, and maybe even because of them, their stints as leaders did not last long enough to stay on top of that type of agenda setting structure. Wright was removed after an investigation by the Republicans, led largely by Gingrich in the House as minority Whip. Gingrich resigned after being the target of a congressional investigation as well.

IN THE ABSENCE OF RESPONSIBLE PARTY GOVERNMENT

Absent a model to keep parties structured, parties were left to candidate-centered campaigns. This works well when parties have charismatic candidates that could act as the lead for parties, but in those cases, parties experience splits. At the middle of the twentieth century, the Democratic Party’s agenda was primarily based on the New Deal. The Republican Party situated itself as cautious about the New Deal, while not entirely dismantling it either. The Republicans, in this case, were the moon to the Democratic Party’s sun, to use Samuel Lubell’s metaphor. Lubell asserted in 1951 that the two parties share a relationship, where one sets the primary agenda (acting as the sun) and the opposition party, through its reflective light, act as the moon. This is well explained by New York Times writer David Brooks as describing the lack of a sun or moon between 1996 and 2004, “In 1951, Samuel Lubell invented the concept of the political solar system. At any moment, he wrote, there is a Sun Party (the majority party, which drives the agenda) and a Moon Party (the minority party, which shines by reflecting the solar rays).”[^67]

The Sun and Moon theory is something that will be with party driven politics for a long time. The Republicans (moon) had to react to FDR’s New Deal (sun). The Democrats (moon) had to react to the Reagan Republican juggernaut (sun) in the 1980s. Brooks is describing a contemporary period through Lubell’s lens, but it is equally useful in understanding any period in party politics. In the 1950s, the Republican Party was a moon party, not really dismantling the New Deal, but instead adjusting around it. The Republicans at that time reflected the social policies of the Democrats and offered a less ambitious agenda.

As the 1960s neared, American politics grew more complex, as the responsible party government advocates had warned. Social justice issues, abortion, civil rights, the Cold War, Vietnam, the Equal Rights Amendment, and environmental policy were all relatively new entrants into the political system. Morris Fiorina, one of the most storied modern political scientists, says it all about the state of political parties today, “Party organizations, already weak in the 1950s, were getting weaker.”[^68]For Fiorina, the problem that parties face is that they have lost control of the electoral process. He wrote that in 1994, but 2016 is a perfect backdrop to explain how parties have lost control of the political wheel. The Republican establishment was lost on how to react to its leading primary candidate, billionaire Donald Trump. Trump had no intention of following the party line on any particular slate of issues. He eschews the very notion of organized politics, even referring to the process as part of the problem when it comes to public policy. Even as he stormed the country wooing GOP voters, he has never been a steady member of the party and does not share consistent viewpoints with Republicans. Both parties have lost the attention of their rank and file register voter to political outsiders. It may just be a temporary trend, but without the two parties stepping up to control the process, it will likely continue.

From the middle of the twentieth century, the two modern parties began to stake claims to politics stances, such as the Cold War and civil rights. This is when parties started to grow more nationalized. When we add the effects of the direct primary and the diminished role of party bosses to these national trends, we have local and state parties with virtually no real identity to the voting public.

Parties, on the national level, did not seem to mind having national reputations. The Republicans enjoyed decades of being the Cold War watchdogs while the Democratic Party (it too was devoutly anti-communist) remained more focused on social issues. Both parties had a national constituency. The Republicans did well in presidential elections while the Democratic Party, with Tip O’Neill leading the way, remained in charge of the House of Representatives. The problem here is that the reputations of the two parties were not in the hands of the many, but instead in the hands of the few.

CONCLUSION

What we can say with confidence is that parties are weaker in influence today than they were before. There are many challenges to the two major parties. One is the task of defining values and agendas in an America that is change. Secondly, America is experiencing changes in demography, world status, and economic status. Add to these challenges, an electorate that views government and politics with skepticism. Thirdly, parties no longer hold the financial reigns on candidates and campaigns. And a final challenge to parties, as expressed in this chapter at length, is an internal problem. Political intellectuals have gained influence when it comes to policy. Can political parties reestablish a relationship with the American public?

The Numbers Don’t Add Up

Parties Are Losing Steam

The decline of political party strength in the last seventy-five years may be the result of changes in the political landscape. At the turn of the twentieth century, America was an emerging economy. The industrial era changed how Americans viewed government, and with that, their expectation of politics changed as well. There was room for the government to grow, and it was at this point that the American people started to look realistically at a stronger federal government.

Parties have been characterized in two ways; they are either political machines or they are completely candidate-centered. This is a point that was first made by Paul Herrnson in Party Campaigning in the 1980s. Without structure and defined roles, parties are susceptible to whatever might influence them, which can very often be big moneyed interest groups. Parties have become less of a focal point with voters.

As was mentioned earlier, there is a theory often held by scholars, that parties that are smaller and more ideologically whole are, in fact, strong. But what we will see in this chapter is just how far the American public has strayed from the two-party system.

THE RISE OF THE INDEPENDENT VOTER

How Americans identify as it relates to voting behavior is directly related to how they approach political parties. Russell J. Dalton explains that there are two types of unaffiliated voters, independents and apartisans. Apartisans are voters who can almost never be predicted to lean in a particular direction. Independents, although also unaffiliated, tend to be more rooted in some kind of ideology.

Perhaps the two major parties each represent a partial image of what Americans see as important to citizenship. On the one hand, there is America’s sense of commonality, the lack of an established aristocracy. The Democratic Party reinforces this by focusing its agenda on the middle class. The other half of American identity, however, centers on the individual spirit, striking out independently without the oversight of government. The Republican Party focuses on this message. Where is the electorate? The answer would most likely be someplace in the middle. As the adage in baseball goes, “every team wins 40 games and every team loses 40 games, the difference is in the 80 games in the middle.” That saying is based on Major League Baseball’s 162 game schedule. Russell J. Dalton explains in The Apartisan American how the rise of the independents has been significant in the unusually close national elections in recent years:

The growing importance of independents can be seen in recent elections. Although parties and candidates necessarily cater to their base voters, increasing attention is being paid to the increasing number of independents, who are more likely to shift votes between elections. If parties seek to increase their vote share since the last poll, independents are often where they search for these new voters.[^1]

The Democrats and Republicans reach enough people on those two basic tenets of American identity; the egalitarian and the individual. The rest of the electorate is like those remaining 80 games in baseball, they are up for grabs. The independent man, striking out on his own or heading out west to find his fortune is a big part of the American narrative. Americans are very protective about how they self-identify. Self-identity and political identity are not always one and the same.

It is the contention here that Americans identify a little differently than they did in past generations. American voters often develop a political identity either through family tradition or life experience. Perhaps a difference today is that information travels so quickly that younger Americans develop opinions on issues and parties quicker. This is not to suggest that the information superhighway has done politics a great service. These issues, such as campaign finance reform, health care reform, and U.S. foreign policy, are all complex political issues, and they get whittled down to easily digestible pieces of information. If the electorate is moving in this direction, then the parties in government are going to have to move with it. If we gauge political identity through one’s background and experience, as the Michigan theory suggests, then perhaps this explains independent voting behavior. Independent voters may come from families or parents who are also independents.[^2] That may be true, but there were far fewer independents in the first half of the twentieth century. If parental influence was a major factor in the growing tide of independents, the ripple effect would have reached further back over time. This is not to suggest that some independent voters are not parroting their parents’ viewpoints, but it is unlikely that this is happening on a large scale.[^3]

Who Are America’s Independent Voters?

To many, independent voters are a dissatisfied portion of the electorate that still shares a desire to participate. This important portion of the electorate is constantly being studied, vetted, and wooed. If one wants to see how important independent voters are in statewide and national elections, just look at how many states would be predictable Democratic or Republican if most of those states’ independent voters went to the other side. In other words, even in some of the more partisan regions of the country, losing the independent vote usually means losing an election. This may not bode well for candidates who gain steam in their party’s closed primaries only to be surprised in general elections. In a January 14, 2016 Gallup poll, Donald Trump had net favorability ratings of -27 percent. That -27 is no typo, and Gallup is not a partisan push-polling mill where the results are baked-in ahead of time. Independent voters are the key to most national elections, and there is no sign of that going away.

Pat Garofalo, of U.S. News and World Report wrote in February of 2016 that the idea that independents are really nonpartisan is a myth. Garofalo claims that the 43 percent of Americans who identify as independent is a “meaningless statistic.”[^4] Garofalo was writing about former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s consideration of running for president. The point was that there was not a giant portion of the electorate up for grabs, should the centrist former mayor have gotten into the race in 2016. Despite the interesting article, Garofalo might be wrong about independent voters. While it is true that these voters are often more left or right than people might assume, they are usually not predictable. In fact, they pride themselves on not being predictable. A self-financed billionaire centrist may not have been elected president, but he would have made the race a lot closer than writers like Garofalo would have expected.

Linda Killian, in The Swing Vote: The Untapped Power of Independents, lumps independent and swing voters into one group. This is open to criticism since there are some independent voters who are quite partisan, while the definition of a “swing” voter is someone who vote either way in an election. For Killian’s part, however, there are defining traits that speak to the expansion of independent voting in the United States in the last half century:

They are not reliably conservative or liberal. Many of them never registered with a party and have been Independent voters their entire lives. Others are former Republicans and Democrats who became disaffected with the parties because of social or economic policies. Many Independents say they have been driven from the two parties by their extremism and a failure to focus on the nation’s most important issues. Independent voters think the parties care more about winning elections than about solving the national problems, and they have largely lost faith in the two-party system. Nearly two-thirds of these voters say they believe both parties care more about special interests than about average Americans.[^5]

Part of a larger issue, one in which Killian does not delve too deeply, is that the lives of Americans are more complex than ever before. People have multiple jobs, the economy is less stable than it was in the 1950s, and there is the ability to poll people more easily, thus magnifying whatever dissatisfaction may exist about parties. Killian, however, comes back to a common element among independent voters and their skepticism about parties; the parties are too reliant on outside funding from special interest groups. This research will get more heavily into that factor in the coming chapters.

Independence through A Geographic Lens

Do more independent voters gravitate in certain parts of the country more than others? The geographic understanding of independent voters is not very clear, but there is likely a generational link to independents. Understanding independents means understanding the generation that follows us, and we never really understand our younger generations, not entirely. This is not a defect, but instead, something to relied upon in a complex democratic society. Millennials are voting differently than those of Generation X. Generation X (my generation) was misunderstood by the Baby Boomers.

The American independent voter is nothing new. Voters have had the right to register to vote without committing to a party for as long as they have been permitted to vote. The change in the last fifty years is that there are a substantial number of voters who are losing interest (or faith) in political parties. If there is a regional explanation, it is worth exploring.

Since the rapid increase of independent voters in recent election cycles, the data is constantly changing. It can be said with confidence, however, that the most independent voters, if broken down region, are in the mid-Atlantic and northeast region of the country. A recent Scarborough survey of more than 200,000 voters suggested that most independent voters are in the northeast states.[^6] The Scarborough report states the following in regard to the 2012 presidential election and how candidates approached independent voters:

When geo-targeting their messaging after the political debates, candidates are most likely to find Independent Voters in the northeast. The top local markets for registered voters who self-identify as Independent are: Providence, RI (27% of registered voter residents are Independents); Boston, MA (24%); Hartford, CT (21%); Des Moines, IA (19%) and Albany, NY (16%).[^7]

Linda Killian attempts to dissect who these independent voters are and where they came from. For the sake of emphasis, Killian, in describing the boom of independent voters in the United States, focuses on New Hampshire, Virginia, Ohio, and Colorado. In other words, she can still paint a picture of a weakened party system and not even include the top five states with the most independents—that is how much of a wave independent voting has become. She even opens her book with a dedication to American independents, “For all the Independent and Swing voters who love this country and want to make it better.”[^8] What many academics refuse to acknowledge, however, is that not all independent voters are centrists. There is strong evidence from Pew, Gallup, and other areas of scholarship that would point to many non-affiliated voters as being very partisan. Nonetheless, Voters—regardless of personal ideology—feel disaffected by the party system in America.

Killian breaks down independents into four categories, one of which pokes at the idea that there is a geographic attachment to such a political identification. For Killian, modern independent voters fall into one of the following categories:

•NPR (National Public Radio) Republicans

•America First Democrats

•The Facebook Generation

•Starbucks Moms and Dads[^9]

This is not a menacing list of potential voters for which parties may have to fear, but pop culture references aside, these are voter categories that can influence elections and weaken parties. These categories are subjective and their references to popular culture may make them harder to explain in to future generations, but according to Killian, these four groups account for a lot of people who are disconnected with the two major parties:

a great many Americans don’t feel truly represented by their politicians and the system, especially the Independent voters, who now account for a larger portion of the electorate than either Democrats or Republicans, This disconnect between so many voters and the people elected to represent them is eroding trust in our political system and its effectiveness.[^10]

The first group, the NPR Republicans, who are often simply called liberal Republicans (or formerly “Rockefeller Republicans”) have always been a staple in the northeast part of the country. That is where Nelson Rockefeller was governor, and liberal Republican Mayor John V. Lindsay made his reputation in politics. The northeast, with their higher collection of better-educated citizens were first to drift away from party politics. Conservative Democrats, one could argue, are the opposite, more or less clamoring in the American south. For the liberal Republicans who did not find a home in the Democratic Party and the conservative Democrats who could not bring themselves to register as Republicans, remaining independent was their chosen political ground.

In two of those categories of independent voters—the younger, millennial, Facebook generation and mothers who identify with Starbuck’s coffee—those groups are non-geographical. There are young people and busy mothers everywhere. As of 2013, the five states with the most independent voters were Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Alaska. Four of the top five, according to each state’s own data, were among the top five most independent states listed in the Scarborough Report. These four states are relatively safe territory for Democratic candidates, save for a few conservative pockets that account for Republican members of Congress. In presidential races, or even statewide races, these four states are Democratic strongholds. Yet, there is a large contingency of independent voters in each. Even the added fifth state, Alaska, helps explain the geographic element. What happened to the conservative Democrats in Alaska? They may have registered as independents.

There are some states that are strongly Republican or Democrat in their registration, yet they tend to be open to the possibilities in certain offices. New Jersey, for instance, almost never elects a Republican to the U.S. Senate. Yet, the state has elected Republican governors. Rhode Island is also heavily Democratic, yet has ties to certain traditional Republican politicians.[^11]

Massachusetts is also a state that has a significant number of registered Democrats and independents (who regularly vote Democratic). Massachusetts will elect members of Congress (in both Houses) from the Democratic Party, but the state has shown a willingness to elect Republican governors. In both New Jersey and Massachusetts, there is an interesting phenomenon occurring. Senatorial and gubernatorial races all both statewide contests, yet there is an aversion to electing Republicans to Congress that does not necessarily carry over to the governor’s office.

What we can surmise from Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and New Jersey is that there are states with a discernable partisan lean, yet they have enough of a centrist pulse to elect opposition party candidates as governors. That could be telling us that there is a pragmatic element to the electorate, even in what appears to be the most ideological states.

Rhode Island is also a significant state in American politics, and as of 2013, independents count for a plurality of registered voters.[^12] Rhode Island also has about a thousand voters who register in a party called the Moderate Party, which was founded by moderate Republican Kenneth Block (who has since left the party).

New Jersey, a state that has seen some of its politicians considered presidential timber, is also quite unaffiliated when it comes to actual registration. Registered independents count for just under 50 percent of voters.[^13]

States like New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island are considered on a political map, highly partisan states. Yet, they have large numbers of voters who are not committing to parties. The voters, therefore, are not drawing a connection between party platforms and their own ideologies. They may vote Democratic, but they do not see enough of a relationship between what they may get from a party and what they see as important politically.

The state of Connecticut has roughly 42 percent of its voters as non-affiliated, which means that both major parties combined barely outnumber those who refuse to join a party.[^14] For Connecticut, the number of independent voters from 2008 to 2012 did not change much. The percentage was 42 in both election cycles.

Alaska is different from the other four states. It is not one of the original states. It did not have representatives at the Constitutional Convention. It also has a unique population consisting of various tribes, as well Americans from the mainland. The American political system may not be something they were ever enthusiastic about, although they have grown more politically relevant nationally in recent years. One could point to the Cold War and Alaska’s proximity to the then-Soviet Union as to its rightward tilt politically, but even Alaska is largely independent, to the tune of more than 50 percent.[^15]

With Alaska, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and New Jersey, these are only states with the largest gaps between non-affiliated voters and party voters. The high numbers of independent voters includes voters all states and cities. New York City, for example, boasts more than 700,000 non-affiliated voters.

What we can say from this data is that even is regions, states, and cities, where there is a clear partisan voice from the electorate, there is still ambivalence to joining political parties. Massachusetts is the home of the Kennedys, stalwarts in Democratic Party politics. Alaska is a safe red state in national elections. Yet, these are states where there are high numbers of independent voters.

A potential reason for this could be that because elections are often foregone conclusions, that the need to join a party is not necessary. Voters do not need to be a part of an organization that will ultimately hit them up for money, signatures, and volunteer activities, when they can sit on the sidelines and still vote the way they feel.

Would people join parties if elections were more contested in these areas? If party politics were the best way to make a voter’s voice heard, joining parties would come back in vogue. For now, however, every major campaign strategy surrounds the best ways to draw independent voters. Independent voters are being heard while not joining parties. As long as this is the case, there is less of a reason to commit to parties.

With large increases in the number of independent voters, there are fewer voters active in primaries. How often do people vote in primaries? Consider Figure 2.1]] data from 1990 to 2012:

There has been a steady decline in primary voting since the late middle twentieth century as tracked in Figure 2.2]].

The 2008 election was an important focal point because the presidency was an open election. If there were an incumbent president running for re-election, the data on the incumbent party would not be useful. Looking at the primary turnout in the Democratic and Republican primaries in 2008, we see in the following data that in 16 of the first primary races and caucuses, the average outcome in the combined two parties was only 25 percent. 2008 was an historical election, and so was 2012. History was made in both elections.

In 2008, America stood to either have its first African American president or its first woman president. Even if John McCain had been the voters’ choice, it would mark the first, and most likely only, Vietnam veteran president. The election also came at a time when there was a lot at stake internationally and economically. Yet, with all of this happening, the primary turnout in both parties was not stellar compared to the results of the previous two presidential primaries.

The main advantage of being registered in a major party is the ability to express a louder voice among the party during primaries. What scholars like Killian are suggesting is that in most cases, a group being shut out of the political process would usually trigger a political reaction. The Civil Rights Act addresses the concern of disenfranchised voters. For instance, if a particular group was denied access to vote or if getting to the polls were more difficult due to their lessened power of minority status, it would be brought into question. Killian explains that in the case of independent voters, however, this is a case of a majority being denied the first steps (primary voting) in the electoral process:

If a minority group were getting shut out of full participation in the political process, there would be a huge outcry. But the Independent voters are far from a minority group. There are more if them than either Democrats or Republicans. Yet they are still woefully unrepresented within the political system. And they are just expected to take it. To sit back and enjoy the scraps thrown to them by the two political parties who have a stranglehold on the electoral and political process.[^16]

Parties, in some areas have attempted to open up the political system and bring independent voters back into the process. Those “Starbucks Moms and Dads” and the other groups are wanted in both parties, even if they are soured on parties. In 1986, the Supreme Court weighed in on whether the Republican Party of Connecticut could change their rules and allow independent voters to participate in what was previously a closed primary. The Court found that the Connecticut GOP could allow non-registered Republicans to vote in their primary, reasoning that it was an expression of their freedom to associate. Justices John Paul Stevens and Antonin Scalia wrote dissenting opinions, with Scalia expressing that the freedom to associate comes with one’s ability to register in a party whenever he or she may wish. He even cited that voters could register the day before a primary. The point that the Connecticut GOP was trying to make by opening up its primary process was that they saw a large number of right-leaning independents that could, and may wish to, have a say in the party’s choice. While the Court agreed with the Connecticut Republicans, Justice Antonin Scalia joined the dissent with the following dicta. The following is lengthy, but Supreme Court opinions, while exhaustive, are significant. In this case, Scalia is defending the closed primary system:

The ability of the members of the Republican Party to select their own candidate, on the other hand, unquestionably implicates an associational freedom—but it can hardly be thought that that freedom is unconstitutionally impaired here. The Party is entirely free to put forward, if it wishes, that candidate who has the highest degree of support among Party members and independents combined. The State is under no obligation, however, to let its party primary be used, instead of a party-funded opinion poll, as the means by which the party identifies the relative popularity of its potential candidates among independents. Nor is there any reason apparent to me why the State cannot insist that this decision to support what might be called the independents’ choice be taken by the party membership in a democratic fashion, rather than through a process that permits the members’ votes to be diluted—and perhaps even absolutely outnumbered—by the votes of outsiders.

In the case before us, Connecticut has said no more than this: Just as the Republican Party may, if it wishes, nominate the candidate recommended by the Party’s executive committee, so long as its members select that candidate by name in a democratic vote; so also it may nominate the independents’ choice, so long as its members select him by name in a democratic vote. That seems to me plainly and entirely constitutional.[^17]

Scalia is basically saying exactly what Democratic and Republican loyalists would say. In an interview with a chief of staff to a local politician on New York City’s Staten Island, the Republican staffer said this on his defense of the closed primary system, “We are in a district where the Republican always wins. For our purposes, losing the label would not help us, but it would help in Queens. Everyone has the option to join a party. Parties are not exclusive. If you want to help decide who gets nominated in the Democratic Party, then you should join that party.”[^18] Scalia is saying the exact same thing.

As a result of the Supreme Court’s decision in Connecticut, there has not been a discernable difference in the amount of primary voters who participate. The purpose of changing the rule, as far as the Connecticut Republicans are concerned, was to get candidates that were more representative of the Connecticut electorate. Primaries are still vehicles for partisan ideologues and the participation has not changed dramatically. There is no question that partisan primaries have ushered in a more polarized electorate. This research will explore how parties grew into this democracy and how they are still relevant in the reform process. There are a number of scholarly explanations as to why parties have grown polarized and are more reluctant to work with one another. It is posited here that a cultural change has caused a lack of interest in parties and primaries. This diminished activity by voters at the primary level may have produced candidates who are less interested in producing reform legislation.

Another aspect attributed to the Michigan School suggests that independents may simply be non-ideologues.[^19] The argument here is that voters may be so detached from political theory and contemporary issues to commit to a party. This notion is supported by Campbell, Converse, Miller, and Stokes in The American Voter on the research performed at the Center for Political Studies (CPS) from 1952–1956:

Far from being more attentive, interested, and informed, Independents tend as a group to be somewhat less involved in politics. They have somewhat poorer knowledge of the issues, their image of the candidate is fainter, their interest in the campaign is less, their concern over the outcome is relatively slight, and their choice between competing candidates . . . seems much less to spring form discoverable evaluations of the elements of national politics.[^20]

This research was conducted at the beginning of the 1950s. The pool of independents was much smaller, and perhaps easier to measure, at this point. Today, however, the number of independents includes voters who are very ideological. A group that may have strong opinions but does not gravitate to parties could be, for example, conservatives who belong to unions. Union members traditionally belong to the Democratic Party but if they happen to be conservative politically, it could be risky for them to register Republican. Conservative independent union members are just an example of how modern independents can be opinionated and interested—yet tend to veer away from parties.

Scholars look at varying degrees of independents on a linear scale. In the Political Independence in America series, Jack Dennis describes four avenues of independence for voters. Listed here are four dimensions of modern independence as explained by Jack Dennis:

1.Independent by neutrality, or complete nonpartisanship.

2.Those who sometimes vote Democratic and sometimes vote Republican.

3.Independent by the sheer virtue of individualism.

4.Independent because of dissatisfaction with parties.[^21]

The linear scale result of voter identifiers is not iron clad. All these models allow for some explanation of independent voters but they do not provide much that links them together. If there is a defining link as to why voters are drawn to registering as independents, political scientists are yet to pinpoint what it is. It is the thesis here that there is a definitive watermark from the middle twentieth century to today where this change occurred. Certainly, there are various reasons as to why voters identify as independents. The categories that Dennis defines make great sense. Has this change been internal or external? An internal change would mean that American voters simply started looking at political parties and the role of politicians differently at some point in time. An external change could be that there are different variables today than there were before 1950. An example of this would be the large immigration wave of Latino Americans.

If there has been a significant number of voters since 1950 that share a common dissatisfaction with parties of government, this could fit the Downsian model. For Anthony Downs, voters gravitate toward a political side that best affects their personal economic situation. Given the two types of models, Downsian and Michigan, voters may be tempted to admit that they fall into the Downsian description. Few voters would argue that they are Democrats or Republicans because their parents were, and that the only reason for their political loyalty is some kind of familial connection. Voters of all backgrounds tend to see their voting preferences as a result of their own reasoning.

Our electorate has changed dramatically since the middle twentieth century due in part to changes in voting rights. The hypothesis in this research is that weaker parties and polarization have stifled reform. As a good starting point, we examine why parties have weakened. This brings us to the growing number of non-party registered voters.

Third Parties: Not Doing Any Better Than Major Parties

Early in the twentieth century, third parties had more influence than they do today. Shigeo Hirano and James M. Snyder, Jr. explain that third parties were a more attractive option before the New Deal, “Electoral support for third parties in the United States has not always been so small. During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the vote shares of third parties—such as Greenbacks, Populists, Progressives, and Prohibitionists—were more than twice as large as in recent years.”[^22] At the end of the nineteenth century and into early parts of the twentieth century, third parties garnered about 10 percent of the vote in House, Senate, and gubernatorial races. This is interesting because third parties began to lose steam most notably after World War II. This is also close to the time when the two major parties started losing influence with voters. Major and minor parties have become less attractive in recent years, and in some cases, for different reasons. Third parties are not as “establishment” as the two major parties. They are borne out of some element of dissatisfaction, and often focused on a single issue.[^23]

Third parties in the United States have never really had a lasting presence on ballots, although they have a place in history. Alabama Governor George Wallace and the American Independent Party won 46 electoral votes in 1968. Richard Nixon won the election, but this was a significant showing for a third party candidacy. What this tells us is that American voters were not tethered to the two-party system. Strong third party candidacies can, even without winning electoral votes, make an impact on national elections. Ross Perot was not a member of a third party, although he ran a third party candidacy (meaning he was not the candidate of either of the two major parties). If we are counting third parties as those candidacies outside the mainstream that influence outcomes, there are third party endeavors that have been important in recent decades. If, however, we are looking at third parties as actual parties with a lasting presence, then there have not been many.

It is easy to confuse the politics of third parties with the politics of populism. Populism resonates with modern American voters because it focuses on fewer issues that are often current. Populism does not live in one particular party, because major parties have established platforms. Third parties, if they are actual parties, carry with the same negatives as the two major parties. Populism, as it relates to voter identity is useful here, and it explored in greater detail in chapter three. If third parties are simply an anti-establishment effort, they can make a difference in elections both national and local, even if the party itself does not have staying power.

Part of this could be that they often develop out of a single issue and once that issue gets addressed or fizzles out, the movement around the party dampens. The issue that may energize a third party may not even be a national issue.[^24] Take, for example, the New York State Working Families Party. This party gained momentum when the Liberal Party, once a third party staple in New York, lost its ballot access due to winning too few votes in 2002. The Working Families Party is basically a pro-labor party that seeks to put pressure on the Democratic Party from the left. Nationally, a good example of how third parties grow out of a single issue is the Green Party. The Green Party has since developed an agenda that goes beyond environmental issues, but it is still primarily a voice for environmentalism. Third parties do not compete like the Democrats and Republicans. They seek to disrupt elections, not win them. Many of the third party efforts in the last century have come from the left or the progressive end of politics. This means that the Democratic Party has been in a good position to co-opt third party agendas.

Evidence points to the exponential growth of independent voters. Figure 2.3]] illustrates the rapid growth of independents from 2008 to 2013. Voters are likely dissatisfied with parties, or they are at least not sold on them.

Along with their dissatisfaction with parties, voters feel that both major parties have drifted to the extreme left and right respectively. Only 30 percent of people polled see the Democratic Party as “moderate” while 25 percent see the party as “very liberal.”[^25]

Voters’ take on the Republican Party was even more skeptical of the party’s ability to think in a pragmatic way (see Figure 2.4]]).

Methodology: Conducted by Public Religion Research Institute, September 21 October 3, 2013 and based on 2,317 online interviews. Sample: National adult. The poll was fielded by GfK Knowledge Networks using its national KnowledgePanel. The KnowledgePanel is a nationally representative probability sample of the U.S. adult population. Panelists are recruited by randomly selecting residential addresses using a process called address-based sampling (ABS). Since nearly 3-in-10 U.S. households do not have home Internet access, respondent households who do not have Internet access or own a computer are provided Internet service and a netbook computer to ensure that panel respondents are representative of the U.S. adult population. Unlike opt-in panels, households are not permitted to “self-select” into KnowledgePanel; nor are they allowed to participate in many surveys per week. [USPRRI.102913.R11B]

In this particular poll, people saw the Republican Party as “very conservative” than “moderate.” It is no wonder that there are a lot of voters, many of them in key states and districts that cannot find a home in either party.

Although voters do not have a great deal of confidence in parties, they also are not enthusiastic about third party candidates. The following data is from a poll where voters were asked if they would be likely to vote for an independent candidate over Republican Mitt Romney or Democratic President Barack Obama, and voters overwhelmingly said they would not choose a non-major party alternative.[^26]

Not many voters were either “Very Likely” or “Fairly Likely” to stray from the traditional party nominees, despite the clear dissatisfaction with party ideology. A potential reason for that may be that there have not been many third party presidential candidates that have been serious choices. Voters may see third party presidential candidates as having little to no chance in the Electoral College and they are often not mainstream enough (which is exactly why independents avoid parties in many cases.)

We have seen the evidence that parties have changed. There are fewer liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats. What of the electorate? Have voters changed in any significant way?

AMERICA HAS CHANGED AND SO HAS ITS POLITICS

American culture has changed in the latter half of the twentieth century; the post–World War II economy changed how Americans participated in all areas of their lives. Robert Putnam has written about how American culture has changed and how fewer people are drawn to join civic organizations. He points to the fact that as people slowed to joining traditional organizations, other types of organizations have grown, but those are not the traditional types of organizations. Wilson Carey McWilliams explains this dynamic as well:

More than words are involved: all our institutions, civil and political are being unsettled, their power reduced, their authority questioned. New technologies and new forms of economic life—most obviously, “globalization” and the “information revolution”-are shaking or shattering relationships and the order of communities and nationalities. Old forms and organizations seem increasingly outdated and irrelevant. Yet while the past grows more distant from our experience, the future becomes unimaginable: Americans find it prudent to go cautiously, limiting—if not avoiding—their commitments to relationships, or moralities.[^27]

Americans are behaving differently toward institutions, and I posit that political parties are a part of that change.

For Putnam, there are two kinds of cultural changes that take place; intra-cohort and inter-cohort.[^28] He describes intra-cohort as change that occurs throughout society regardless of generations. Putnam uses American consumerism as an example. When sport utility vehicles became popular, they were popular across all age groups and generations. This is an intra-cohort change. Inter-cohort is more of a generation-specific change. The example Putnam uses for inter-cohort change is how American culture gradually changes its attitude toward pre-marital sex.

Another way to describe this analysis of change comes from Malcolm Gladwell, who refers to this kind of inter-cohort change as a tipping point. Gladwell’s work is not as deep in evidence to count as science, but on the social exploration front, a tipping point is where a slow build up of behavior results in a significant change. He uses rap music as an example. Once outside the mainstream, the music eventually caught on to where it reached a tipping point and became mainstream. If we look at how voters view parties, they gradually drifted away from parties as the culture changed. We could refer to the cache that voters enjoy of being “independent” as gradually leading to a tipping point. Once the number of independents grew large enough, they tipped the scale of politics, showing a significant change in the electorate. This is well characterized by how there are more independent voters in New York City than there are registered Republicans (almost by a 2 to 1 margin).

Putnam explaining the cultural change in America is more scientific than Gladwell’s observation about popular culture, but they match up well when explaining how parties suffered as society changed. If we examine the various cultural changes related to issues that are political (education, religion, unions, marriage, etc.), we see a move from firmer traditional values to a society that focuses more on being inclusive.

America has changed, and how Americans utilize institutions is different from how they did so centuries ago. Ruy Teixeira writes that the country changed as it grew more suburban . . . and it may be changing again, “As office buildings and other features once thought to define cities spilled outside of the city’s borders, the suburbs transcended the monolithic, bedroom communities they started out as . . .”[^29]

In this research, the aspects of voluntarism and political participation are connected. Some could argue that they are separate notions, but American politics is strictly voluntary. Unlike some countries, where fines are issued for not voting, there is no cost to the citizen for not engaging in the process. Politics, in the United States, is a voluntary process.

Paul Rich writes that “Different kinds of voluntarism are constantly being invented.”[^30] That may be true since technology is allowing people to join groups and communicate faster than ever before, but the voluntarism of American politics differs from technological voluntarism. The only way that political voluntarism has grown due to modernity is through fundraising. As for research on why Americans do not join political parties, this is an aspect in which there is no evidence that technology has helped the cause.

Even skeptics on the changing culture, such as Paul Rich, however, admit that the American party system has fallen victim to the modern approach that citizens use in accessing politics, “. . . scholars and political commentators have called attention to evidence from survey research and electoral data of a decline in confidence and interpersonal trust and a decline in electoral participation.”[^31]

There is a tendency among scholars to discount political participation as just another area of American society that has changed. Everett Carll Ladd explains that the concern for this societal change is not earth shattering enough to cause concern about American political participation:

Unless one is prepared to argue that a particular organization is uniquely valuable in civic terms, what is one to make of its losing ground? Why should we care that the Benevolent Protective Order of Elks (BPOE) has fewer members now than in the 1950s? Putnam offered no evidence—nor have other civic decline-thesis proponents—that the loss of Elks and Jaycees has not been matched, or even surpassed, by increases in other groups equally attractive in their social/civic reach.[^32]

Ben Wattenberg has shown doubt in how definitive such changes in civic society are to our politics.[^33] Disagreeing with Ladd and others, there is a particular organization that is uniquely worth saving: American political parties. Without the two major parties steering political agendas, the process falls into the hands of an electorate that moves on capitalism and popular will—which is exactly what Madison warned against.

The party system in the United States has been on a regular decline for fifty years. It is not counter-weighted by the increase in modern social networking. These elements are not the same or only slightly different. Rich explains that there may be a racial or ethnic explanation to why parties and other traditional institutions are not as attractive to modern Americans. He is mostly likely onto something, and that concept is reiterated by Hajnal and Lee as well. We cannot, however, accept that newer Americans, with different tastes, means that the political system is no longer useful. The system was designed to incorporate differences. The influx of Irish to American shores in the mid-1800s did not weaken the American party system. African Americans being given the right to vote, and access to the polls, did not weaken the party system. American political parties, despite ideology, are not white Anglo-Saxon institutions. All major democracies, and even authoritarian regimes posing as democracies, have political parties as a component of their political system.

What we see here is a connection between people who today “bowl alone” or join fewer organizations and a lower rate of political participation. Those comparing any assemblage of Americans with joining political parties are missing a valuable point. Democracy-based organizations are different from pedestrian social groups. Francis Fukuyama, who has bounced back and forth on Putnam’s theory, writes:

despite the apparent decline in trust, there is evidence that groups and group membership are increasing . . . Rather than taking pride in being a member of a powerful labor federation or working for a large corporation, or in having served in the military, people identify with a local aerobics class, a New Age sect, a co-dependent support group, or an Internet chat room.[^34]

The meaning of the parties, the purpose for which they exist, are more than trendy. Putnam’s work is not airtight in that there is evidence to show increases in human activity. That should not be a surprise since the population is constantly growing. There are, however, different types of institutions with varying degrees of importance.

Scholars arguing either side of this can cherry pick select groups and make a case. Rich explains that there are community organizations that have sprouted up as organizations like the Elks have declined. One issue with that argument, however, is that many organizations are not as large as they appear. In other words, political parties are easier to measure. There are millions of Democrats and Republicans. They are established in every state and city. They are real organizations. What many who argue that there is not a civic decline, but simply a shift in tastes, ignore is that many of those modern groups are few in number. They are groups with letterhead and maybe a web-based presence. Political parties are above and beyond trends. They are stitched into the American fabric.

Among those who doubt that America is losing a sense of social capital is the idea that people are simply participating differently. Rich explains that there is no major concern in the difference between how Americans civically engage and how they did once before, “America leads the world when it comes to richness of organized life and inventing new forms of voluntarism. So it did, to Tocqueville’s bemusement, in the early nineteenth century—and, fortunately for democracy, it still does.”[^35] There are a couple of things to analyze with that above statement. For one, even if Paul Rich can make the argument that Americans are joining groups in similar amounts as they once did, there is evidence that they are not doing so in a way directed toward democracy. They are not joining parties or voting in high numbers.

Strong Presidency + Weak Congress = Weaker Parties

If we are sizing up American political parties as “strong” based on public appeal, it is necessary to look at the institutional influence surrounding parties. Institutional influence may be one of the strongest variables that affect parties. Both the presidency and Congress are important factors in understanding strong parties.

We’ve seen in Chapter 2]] that there is a dramatic drop-off in party registration, especially in recent generations. The idea that parties are smaller, yet more ideological, may be a strength to political scientists, but it is not a strength in retail politics. What are those elements of government that may be causing parties to lose traction? Two major institutions that have direct relationships with our two-party system are the presidency and Congress. Party politics is directly affected by these institutions, and to be fair, vice versa.

A STRONGER PRESIDENCY

If we first look at the presidency, we will see that this institution changed in a time frame that syncs up with parties changing. That does not mean there is a causal relationship based on timeliness alone. It does, however, suggest that this is an important starting point in seeing where and why party popularity dipped as the presidency gained momentum.

The presidency is an American institution that has grown in scope and power, and there is evidence that this has affected parties. Theodore Lowi has explained that the presidency has become a lot more than it was originally intended, especially in the last century:

The accumulated changes in national government since the 1930s have brought the United States into an entirely new constitutional epoch. The two most important changes are the development of the presidency, based upon a new political theory that democracy could be maintained and even enhanced as long as the capacity to govern was lodged in the White House. Woodrow Wilson characterized the regime of the 1880s as congressional government. The regime of the 1980s can be characterized as presidential government. The difference between the two involved the sacrifice of the Separation of Powers and the two-party system.[^1]

Lowi’s work on the presidency is well established, and it echoes the notion that this particular institution has expanded far beyond its original intent.

Presidents are members of parties, and more than before, they are party leaders. In a climate where parties have national agendas and identities, presidents are de facto leaders despite not being given an actual party title. To some extent, presidents have always had great influence in their respective parties since they are the face of the American government, a reality that is heightened in foreign policy.

The rise the presidency has transformed parties and vice versa. E.E. Schattschneider was right in in 1971 when he wrote that the party of an incumbent president is basically considered the party in power.[^2] Even when the opposition party controls Congress, the power of the presidency, in the American psyche and in policy, has grown into the dominant branch of government. This has had a tremendous effect on parties.

The age of presidents being party leaders came before the modern presidency, but involvement in party business only grew as the office grew. The modern presidency brought with it a host of new exposures and social expectations that were less of a concern before Wilson and the Roosevelts came along. Andrew Jackson was by many accounts the first serious party-leader president. Jackson embraced partisanship, and he identified with the Democratic Party. Before Jackson, presidents were affiliated with their respective parties, but they were not the de facto face of their party, until Andrew Jackson established this presidential responsibility. The two-party system developed as a permanent element of American politics, due in large part to Jackson’s party leadership.[^3]

Jackson, maybe due to his lack of an intellectual pedigree, saw American government through the eyes of people who were not elites. It is also quite extraordinary that a man from modest means and education was the driving force behind the establishment of the Democratic Party. Jon Meacham explains how Jackson was a Jeffersonian for the common people. The modern presidency may have come hundred years after Jackson, but the modern Democratic Party was establishing a foothold with commoners as early back as Jackson, “Jackson took the Jeffersonian vision of the centrality of the people further, and he took Jefferson’s view of the role of the president further still. To Jackson, the idea of the sovereignty of the many was compatible with a powerful executive.”[^4]

The party of Jefferson, Meacham writes, became the party of Jackson, despite some deep misgivings by the political elite. Jefferson may have been the face of the Old Republican Party (which later developed into the Democratic Party), but the party’s face was that of Andrew Jackson in 1828. This was not the age of the modern presidency, but it was a watershed period for presidential leadership within parties.

All of the trappings of a modern presidency, such as media influence and expanded campaign war chests, were not at Jackson’s disposal. Nonetheless, Jackson would have felt at home with the presidency gaining the cult status that it has developed. He saw the presidency as a means to relate directly to the people, over the interests of bankers and other interests.[^5] This was a definable beginning for when presidents started taking over the reins of parties.

The beginnings of the modern presidency are often debated, with some arguing that it started with FDR and others arguing that it started with Woodrow Wilson. Part of an opening paragraph from Clinton Rossiter’s The American Presidency in his chapter on the modern presidency reads:

In the course of these twenty years it (the American presidency) had been laden with all kinds of new duties by a people unwilling to submit patiently to the disorders of an industrial civilization or to withdraw sullenly from the turmoils of a mad world. It had taken on all kinds of new help, both personal and institutional, to save it from collapse under the mounting burdens of war and peace. And it had moved even higher, if that were possible, the esteem of the American people, most of whom counted it a mighty weapon in the struggle for liberty at home and security abroad. The Presidency had been modernized, conspicuously if not completely.[^6]

The American Presidency is a seminal work that is every bit as relevant today as it was when it was first written. The esteem of the American people for the presidency has grown a lot more since 1970. Rossiter concedes that the presidency had to change in order to meet these new modern challenges.

The role of the federal government expanded exponentially at the end of the nineteenth century and early twentieth century. The economy and population grew as the country stretched westward. With that, came the need for a more muscular government, and the birth of the modern presidency. As big business grew, so did the need to protect the democracy. A stronger, more involved federal government developed. A stronger federal government meant that there was greater influence in the presidency, since the president is the head of the federal government. In the modern presidency, and that can be argued started with FDR, and that was the defining starting point of a much stronger modern presidency. From that point on, the notion of government reform or economic reform went through the presidency. This was the beginning of a weakened Congress and a more visible presidency.[^7]

V.O Key’s work on responsible electorates focuses on how voters gravitate to parties and how parties align in the electorate. He begins, however, by explaining, with help from the above text, that the expectations of the government were different as the new century emerged. He points to FDR as the beginning point of the modern presidency, and for good reason. FDR was president for an unexpected (and unrepeated) twelve years. This had dramatic effects on the office.

Stephen Hess, writing on how the organization of the executive branch had to change, also summons FDR’s presidency as a watershed moment, “The unprecedented duration of his tenure as President meant that to an unusual degree his style shaped the magnitude of government. Thus by the time of Roosevelt’s death in 1945 most of the elements of the modern presidency were in place, even if in embryonic form. The President, rather than Congress, had clearly become the center of federal attention.”[^8]

Others could argue that Theodore Roosevelt, by expanding the federal government by use of the interstate commerce clause, ushered in the modern presidency. Even still, Woodrow Wilson was a progressive president with ambitions for a stronger federal government. No matter where we mark the beginning point, however, it is important to make note that the public’s expectations of government changed, and this was also matched with expectations of a more involved presidency.

CHIEF OF PARTY

The outline of the American presidency that Rossiter writes about in his book of the same name, is entirely relevant in understanding where the office was headed in the eyes of the American public. Rossiter outlines five constitutional and five extra-constitutional roles of the modern president. One of those extra-constitutional roles is that of Chief of Party. The presidency is one of the most democratic offices in the country. “He is at once, the least political and most political of all heads of government,” writes Rossiter.[^9] With the exception of Washington’s presidency, all presidents have been party figures. In the modern presidency, however, that is even clearer. With presidents involved with legislative activities more than before, their presence as party leaders is even more obvious. Looking at recent presidential elections, it is clear that presidents lead parties. The Republican Party reaped the rewards, and paid for the missteps, of President George W. Bush. The same is true of the Democratic Party and President Barack Obama. Parties have to live and die with their incumbent presidents.

Political parties were reaching a high point during FDR’s tenure. The Democratic and Republican parties were at this point the established two-party system that we know today. With presidents becoming more visible on all policy fronts, their influence within parties grew. When FDR allowed the President’s Committee on Administrative Management to study the needs of the modern presidency, one of the famous phrases that came from the study was “the President needs help.” This was Louis Brownlow’s finding as he recommended the formation of the Executive Office of the President. As this office developed, presidents became more attached to policy making. They were no longer solely the last stop that a bill makes after clearing the House and Senate. They were voices on policy before bills were given a vote in the Houses. The presidency was just as much of a policy clearing house as Congress, and in some cases even more than the Legislature. The National Security Agency, for example, helped presidents develop foreign policy and national security stances outside of the State Department and congressional committees. Presidents were beginning to pull policy creation closer, and they did the same with parties.

The report from the APSA’s Committee on Parties, which focused on responsible party government, came at a similar time that the Executive Office of the President (EOP) was being restructured. Presidents, among their added responsibilities, saw themselves as agenda setters. The days of the care-taker president were waning. To someone like Hess, who analyzes the structure of the office, there is a causal relationship between the added duties of a president and the party in which he or she operates. Presidents are agenda setters, even when they are not very successful at it, “The policy commitments of a new President are found in his campaign speeches, in the party platform, and to a lesser degree in the promises of other members of his party.”[^10]

This attachment of the president to the party is not necessarily a bad thing. Parties need leaders; why not a nationally elected leader? Who is to argue that professional political operative is a better steward of party politics than a sitting U.S. president? The problem with presidents being party leaders, even if it is only an implied power, is that unsuccessful presidents mean trouble for parties. Richard Nixon was invariably not opposed to the expansion of the presidency. He clearly stated to his campaign committee the following: “The next president must take an activist view of his office.”[^11] Nixon was not only suggesting a more involved presidency, but he was calling for activism in how the office was structured.

Nixon did not want a party or a cabinet that did not reflect his vision. He made it clear upon arrival that he did not want a cabinet that symbolized the Eisenhower cabinet, where issues were debated at greater length. He wanted a closed camp.[^12] When his presidency was being investigated by Congress, he relied on his party being in line with his agenda. After all, presidents lead parties. In this case, and it is not very common, the Republicans in Congress—namely Senator Barry Goldwater—were not able to do so. But this is the length that a crisis has to reach in order for there to be a significant breakdown between parties and presidents.

Despite the few times that party members have pushed back hard against presidents, the chief executive has almost always maintained an element of control over the core leadership of party politics. Stephen Sestanovich, in Maximalist: America in the World from Truman to Obama, explains how presidents can be characterized as “entrenched” or “maximalist” in their foreign policy. The presidents who he labels as maximalist are those who take the lead on ambitious foreign policy stance and break, somewhat, from whatever policy they inherited. This offers a good analogy to Skowronek’s regimes in government and party. If presidents can be maximalist in their foreign policy, they can certainly be so in their direction of party. Maximalists may wink at the idea of considering opposing viewpoints, but in the end, they are set in a strategy. The same way Reagan discarded the détente of Henry Kissenger and Richard Nixon is how Reagan moved away from Keynesian economics. Reagan was charting a new course; he was “maximizing” his new path. He threw away the playbook that he inherited from previous Republican presidents, namely Nixon and Ford. The GOP became Reagan’s party.

FDR is a good example of how parties would eventually defer to their national leader on platform stances. The Democratic Party, by embracing a different economic approach and a charismatic leader, effectively attached the party to the president. Matters such as health care, organized labor support, social security, and bank insurance were issues that the Democratic Party incorporated through the presidency of FDR. When FDR made these stances part of his presidency, they became embedded into the Democratic Party. The party was being nationalized. Support for big labor, for example, is a major leg of the Democratic Party. Likewise, supply side economics was not a part of the Republican Party’s economic platform until it was ushered in by Ronald Reagan in 1980. In fact, there was considerable doubt by prominent party members, such as Senator Bob Dole and George Herbert Walker Bush, that such an economic policy even made sense. Thirty five years later, however, that economic philosophy is still an important identifier of the Republican Party. The major parties, with presidents like FDR and Reagan, began getting their identity from the top, and not the other way around. This was the beginning of the end for the local party apparatus in the United States. Voters saw parties grow weaker as they grew more attached to the president regardless of who that was. Following FDR, the Executive Office of the President grew into a professional policy unit, with employees chosen by the executive and not necessarily from the party apparatus. An example of this is when President Harry Truman established the National Security Agency as a means to develop foreign policy through a channel that was more securely fit under the executive. What could parties do to stand in the way of their own presidents? Parties began to more fully cede influence to the executives and strong singular party figures. The public followed presidents and not parties, from that time on.

The Singularity of Party Leadership: Modern Presidents Starting with FDR

When parties fall under a centralized leadership, they may have a more focused direction, but they also become vulnerable. FDR gave the Democratic Party a new face. His Democratic Party was proactive and progressive. Public works projects, bank insurance, and the embrace of Keynesian economics were signs of a new agenda. After the election of 1932, this was FDR’s party. His aggressive New Deal was plan for the country’s economy, but he also developed an identity for his party, as Theodore Lowi explains:

Roosevelt sent these people proposals over to Congress in January 1937. The reorganization bill passed the House in August but was not taken up by the Senate until the following February. At that point it was hit by a firestorm of denunciation as a “dictator bill,” which amounted to “plunging a dagger into the very heart of the democracy.”[^13]

FDR may have been one of the first modern presidents, but he was clear on his role as president and party leader.

An example of FDR reaching to re-configure his party was his effort to do away with the party’s “Two-Thirds Rule,” which affected the Democratic nomination process. The Democratic Party adopted this rule in 1832. It was the idea of Andrew Jackson and his supporters, and it served as a way to have a unified party at the national convention.[^14] Jackson was one of the first rampant party loyalist presidents, described by Rossiter as “a hard driving Chief of Party.”[^15]

The creation of the Two-Thirds Rule was developed to make sure the Democrats would not nominate a candidate who was not strongly supported by the party. Jackson was quite popular within the Democratic Party, so there was no threat to him not securing a two-thirds vote among Democrats for the nomination. Harold Bass, Jr. explains that the move was a strategic one, “Ostensibly, they did so to demonstrate party unity. However, since there was no organized party opposition to Jackson’s re-election effort, it appears likely that the reason for adopting the rule, and indeed calling the convention, was to ensure the selection of Jackson’s choice for vice president, Martin Van Buren, over the incumbent, John C. Calhoun.”[^16] The rule was not loved by future party nominees. As the country grew, the party grew. It became a challenge for some Democratic nominees to secure a two-thirds vote. Both Martin Van Buren (1844) and Champ Clark (1912) did not secure the two-thirds majority vote in the party. Exactly hundred years after Andrew Jackson pushed for, and won, the adoption of this rule, FDR sought to abolish it. FDR did not want a prolonged balloting system at his conventions, but was careful about how he voiced his opposition to the rule. Bass describes how FDR wrested power from the Democratic National Committee immediately following his nomination:

Immediately after accepting the presidential nomination, Roosevelt exercised his new prerogative of party leadership and installed campaign manager (James A.) Farley as chairman of the Democratic National Committee. In that capacity, Farley supervised the successful fall general election campaign and went on to serve in the new administration as the president’s premiere party liaison, tending primarily to patronage but also preparing for the upcoming 1936 presidential reelection campaign.[^17]

FDR understood that taking control of the party needed to happen early in his presidency, or it would be difficult to attain. Parties, when left without a definable rudder, are open to be steered by strong leaders.

The Two-Thirds Rule experience is an example of how strong leaders can, and will, move to control their parties. Modern parties have become less collective and more reactionary toward upper leadership. When parties became nationalized, presidents reaped the reward of more power. FDR was not the only president to appoint his own party boss, but his changing of a hundred year old rule to better suit his campaign is the epitome of a power presidency. Could other Democratic Party leaders oppose FDR’s choice? They likely could, but that would only make their work more difficult when it came to legislating.[^18]

FDR understood the dynamics of a changing America and how it related to parties, and his approach to power would certainly run counter to James Madison’s skepticism about majority factions. For FDR, the majority faction was the fulcrum of his reformist ideas. He reformed the Office of the President, and he tried to stack the Supreme Court with more justices so his New Deal reforms would be ushered through the Court.[^19] A far-reaching agenda needs a strong president and a centralized government.

FDR was quite popular following his election in 1936, but he still had some opposition within the party’s ranks, especially among conservative Southern politicians. This was the only way to engineer change and support the New Deal. In 1938, he was an active campaigner in Midwestern elections. The Democrats already had a strong majority in the House but FDR was active in primaries, bolstering liberal progressive candidates. The press began to refer to this as a “purge,” referring to the president’s effort to make the party in government reflect his agenda.

FDR experienced opposition among Democrats who either opposed the New Deal or opposed his domination of the party. The New Deal was the beginning of the Democratic Party losing its grip on the American south. Susan Dunn explains that as FDR’s agenda became the agenda of the party, splinters emerged, “But the purge represented even more than a scheme to restart the New Deal. It was also the precursor of a historic transformation of American political parties.”[^20]

The hypothesis that strong national leaders have taken over parties does not mean that they face no opposition. FDR had detractors, but his agenda had a lasting effect on the Democratic Party. Most of his legislation made it through Congress. When leaders are successful in controlling parties, it means they are getting what they want, not necessarily that there is never opposition.

One only needs to listen to FDR’s own words in the 1938 primary season to best understand where parties and presidents were headed:

As head of the Democratic Party . . . charged with the responsibility of the definitely liberal declaration of principles set forth in the 1936 Democratic platform, I feel that I have every right to speak in those few instances where there may be a clear issue between candidates for a Democratic nomination involving these principles, or involving a clear misuse of my own name.[^21]

FDR, despite the splinters in the Democratic Party, was the de-facto leader of his party. Critics of FDR saw his commitment to party domination as dictatorial—a criticism that has since followed ambitious leaders.[^22] Not having control of one’s party, however, is a sign of weakness. Rossiter explains how the president has the machinery to build the party that he or she wants, “The President dictates the selection of the national chairman and other top party officials, reminds his partisans in Congress that the legislative record must be bright if victory is to crown their joint efforts, delivers, ‘fight talks’ to the endless procession of professionals who call upon him, and, through the careful distribution of the loaves and fishes of federal patronage, keeps the party a going concern.”[^23]

Legislative cooperation is the biggest sign of how much influence a leader has over a party. The Two-Thirds Rule had supporters, but that was an inter-party rule that basically affected candidates and nominees, and not necessarily the party at large. When FDR moved to re-structure the executive office, however, members of Congress (and many Democrats) bridled at the idea. To many, it was a re-elected president looking to grab more power, which did not do much to dissuade the idea that he was showing dictatorial traits.

The re-organization bill is significant because it illustrates how staffers and leaders see legislative failures as losing party control. He was warned by his own party’s national chair, Jim Farley, that if the re-organization bill did not make it through Congress it would weaken his ability to lead.[^24] Up to the point where the Office of the President was re-organized, FDR had a notoriously small staff, especially given the ambition of his administration. As powerful as FDR was, there was a lot riding on his ability to get his agenda through Congress—and through the Supreme Court. FDR was less upset over the House defeating the bill than some staffers and cabinet members, but he realized the importance of keeping control of the party. He was encouraged to continue pushing for this reform.[^25]

FDR’s approach to controlling his party and pushing legislation also led to institutional (party) change. He not only opposed the Two-Thirds Rule, he changed it hundred years after it was enacted. He pushed to re-structure the executive office. When hampered by judicial review and the Supreme Court, he moved to pack the Court with more (progressive) members. The importance of this is to make the point that this was an executive that wanted control. Parties have since followed this approach of top-down control when it comes to setting agendas.

National leaders may control the party agenda, but they do not control the popularity of the party in the electorate. The 1938 midterm elections saw many progressives defeated. FDR may have been the face of the party, but the electorate did not make the connection necessarily through the party label regarding other candidates. In a responsible party system, candidates may have enjoyed a more stable association with FDR, since the agenda would be built into the campaign.

FDR wanted his agenda, particularly the New Deal, to be the mission of the Democratic Party. Like Wilson, FDR wanted to see the two major parties as fundamentally different. Susan Dunn explains perfectly how FDR had no interest in diversity in his Democratic Party when it came agenda. He would gladly trade some of his conservative Democrats for liberal Republicans:

In 1938, Franklin Roosevelt’s Democratic coalition had become unworkable, and he realized that southern conservatives, New York liberals, and African-American auto workers in Detroit could not continue indefinitely to co-habit the same political party. For his part, he knew the direction he wanted the party to go: to the left—and to the completion of the New Deal. His hope was that Democrats would jettison their right wing while Republicans jettisoned their left so that the nation—and especially the South—could have two vital, responsible parties.[^26]

FDR wanted a Democratic Party with a strong progressive identity. He was careful, however, with challenging the state of affairs on race.[^27] Despite his progressive agenda, the losses that would come with tackling racial politics were risky for FDR. FDR had control of the Democratic Party for the most part, but in contrast to what some critics suggested, he was not in a dictatorial position.

What FDR’s experience tells us is that parties are mainly driven from the top. The platform is the written language of the party. Stephen Skowronek explains how FDR had little interest in accepting party norms, “From the start, Roosevelt was openly and forthrightly engaged in the displacement of the received order and construction of some alternative.”[^28]

FDR’s presidency stands out for many reasons, but his approach to party is very significant. Parties have not charted their own course without national leadership calling a great deal of the shots. Even national conventions do not delve deeply into particular issues. American associate parties with the leadership on a national level—modern parties are nationalized.

Established Democrats fought to keep the party whole after fault lines due to race began to emerge. FDR was a strong national leader, so the party stayed together. At the Democratic convention of 1948, however, many Democrats revolted. The Dixiecrat Party formed, albeit for only a short while. This is a good example of how parties rely so heavily on leadership at the top. Absent FDR, party splits started to occur. Because leaders, especially presidents, do not stay in power for long that identity does not last forever. Voters, in modern times, identify less with parties then they do with leaders. Voters today are registering in greater numbers as independents because they not relate to a particular party. This is similar to what the 1950 APSA report, Toward a More Responsible Two-Party System, warned of in its section The Inadequacy of the Existing Party System, “Party organization does not vest leadership of the party as a whole in either a single person or a committee. There is, at present (published in 1950), no central figure or organ which could claim authority to take up party problems, policies, and strategy.”[^29]

MODERN PRESIDENTS AND HOW THEY STEERED THEIR PARTIES

There is no question that FDR was the face of the Democratic Party. Even today, he casts a big shadow over the Democratic Party. The important elements of the Democratic agenda, such as big labor, welfare, and Keynesian economics, are still the foundation of the party. Was this influence unique to FDR, or have other modern presidents had the same ideological reach in relation to their own party? What history has shown is that presidents do lead their parties, and assume the identity of the party.

Dwight D. Eisenhower as Party Leader

Dwight David Eisenhower entered politics with a label that is more popular today than it was in 1952, that of “outsider.” Being a political outsider, at least in theory, allows candidates to avoid being looked upon as the not-often welcome career politician. His competition for the Republican nomination was the quintessential party Republican, Senator Robert Taft of Ohio. Save for Eisenhower, Taft was the strongest Republican candidate that the party could have fielded at that time. He had the political lineage, and had built relationships throughout the party. Being from the state of Ohio never hurt a presidential candidate either. Taft’s nickname was “Mr. Republican.”

What Eisenhower brought to his campaign was a sense of mystery, since he had no electoral history. He had no skin in the game with the Republican Party, and despite being an important part of American history, he had not built up IOUs within the Republican ranks for which he could later cash in.

Eisenhower entered the presidency as a man more concerned with leadership than party building. This, along with his service to America, was endearing to the larger part of the electorate. The presidency, however, is always bigger than the man, and the role of a modern president includes that of party leader. This is what Rossiter was referring to when he described the unscripted role of “Chief of Party.”

Eisenhower’s campaign was good at attracting people who were not typically active conservatives or Republicans. Cornelius P. Cotter writes “His White House staff observed that the president played the party leadership role with some reluctance.”[^30] That reluctance, however, would later change as Eisenhower did assume the identity of the party. By 1958, at the end of his presidency, his understanding of his role for the Republican Party was different, as described by Cotter, “Eisenhower had no doubt that the party, at the national level, was the president’s party. He wished to improve the national party organization and modernize the attitudes of party activists who seemed to think the New Deal could be reversed and the United States could be insular.”[^31]

It did not take Eisenhower, who was basically apolitical until his presidential run, long to realize that either he took control of the party, or the party would be controlling policy. This quote taken from Cotter is telling in that it shows how a candidate, fashioning himself an outsider, easily grows into the role of party leader. Eisenhower did not want a divided party that would get in the way of policy. When Eisenhower took office in 1953, he met with the then-chair of the Republican National Committee one time. Between 1953 and 1957, core years of his administration, he met with the chair (this time it was his appointment to the chairmanship) a total of 44 times. At the end of his second term, he met with the final chairperson of his party only 8 times. When he was either first entering office, and when he was leaving office, there was no real use for Eisenhower to strategize with the party chair. In the beginning the chair was just someone Eisenhower was going to replace anyway. At the end of his presidency, there was also not so much use in meeting with his party’s chair. In those prime years, however, Eisenhower met with the chair 44 alone 44 times, and with the chair and staff 47 times. For a president that was not “political” he wanted control of the party. Even for a White House not set on transforming the government, or even upending the New Deal, he wanted to make sure his policy house was in order.[^32]

John F. Kennedy as Party Leader

John F. Kennedy, like all modern presidents, was the living of the image of the party when he was president. Not long before Kennedy took office, was the 1950 report from the American Political Science Association, Toward a More Responsible Two-Party System. One of the recommendations in the report is that the two major parties ought to establish national councils that would steer the policy agenda.

Theodore Lowi has written that presidents in the modern era started to move away from parties in the campaign process. He notes that Democratic presidential nominee Adlai Stevenson set up his campaign headquarters in Illinois, his home state, as opposed to doing so in Washington, D.C.[^33] Kennedy, according to Lowi and other scholars, was simply following a trend (one that continues today) of running an entrepreneurial campaign and then dominating the party agenda once elected. David Broder best describes how Kennedy maintained a distance with the Democratic Party while running for president:

The organizational secret of Kennedy’s politics was so simple that it was often overlooked: It was a politics of personal involvement, on a massive scale . . . What gave him his critical advantage, I believe, was his distinctive ability to make his supporters become his workers, and to utilize their efforts effectively . . . What he had shown was a talent for going outside the normal political channels and enlisting in large numbers, the energies of enthusiastic political amateurs . . . While Kennedy always thought of himself and was considered a partisan Democrat, he held back from ever being an “organization man.”[^34]

Kennedy wanted no part of that because he saw himself as the leader of his party.

Sean J Savage’s JFK, LBJ and the Democratic Party, describes the two men, albeit quite different Democrats, as not having great relationships with their party apparatus.[^35] The progressive left was hitting a high point in the 1960s, which ran counter to some of the agenda items that Kennedy and Johnson supported. Larry J. Sabato explains in The Kennedy Half Century how Kennedy worked to maintain relationships across the political aisle and was not as interested in ultra-partisanship:

On Capital Hill, Kennedy worked hard to maintain his reputation as a political moderate. He investigated cases of labor racketeering (an issue popular with voters) and tiptoed around the civil rights issue. Many younger Americans today associate the Kennedy name with liberalism, but it was the post-1963 Bobby and Ted who transformed the name’s ideology.[^36]

Kennedy sauntered away from traditional party stances with his embrace of Keynesian economics, which advocates running deficits at certain times as a means to hold back inflation. The Democratic Party today might not embrace a candidate like John F. Kennedy, with his proposed tax cuts and spending reductions. Jeff Jacoby explains how Kennedy was more conservative than the more liberal mainstream Democratic Party today, “He was anything but a big-spending, welfare-state liberal. ‘I do not believe that Washington should do for the people what they can do for themselves through local and private effort,’ Kennedy bluntly avowed during the 1960 campaign.”[^37]

The Democratic Party today is more ideological to what would be comfortable for Kennedy today. There is no way to know how Kennedy would see current issues through a modern pair of eyes. What we can assume, however, is that the modern presidency has not lost any steam, especially in its influence with parties.

Kennedy’s control over the national party was just as real, although less visible, as FDR’s control over the party. FDR was being challenged on many of his initiatives, which caused him to assert his leadership role more adamantly. Kennedy experienced less party friction. Had Kennedy lived (and been re-elected), he would have experienced the kind of internal struggles that FDR experienced as the civil rights movement gained steam.

Lyndon Baines Johnson inherited Kennedy’s agenda, and as circumstance would have it, complex policy issues. With United States already committing advisers to Vietnam and the civil rights movement gaining momentum, Johnson had to focus more on those concerns than he could on his Great Society agenda.

What we know from FDR, Kennedy, and Johnson, however, is that the Democratic Party still carries the banner of a social safety-net agenda and civil rights-focused party. All presidents are party leaders, and those who are weak party leaders are not as successful. Johnson’s agenda included civil rights, which went against the intentions of many southern Democrats. The split that the Democrats experienced with traditional blue-collar party members and progressive liberals made the party harder to lead. It was a difficulty that continued for the Democrats through the presidency of Jimmy Carter.

Richard Nixon as Party Leader

Richard Nixon, like Eisenhower, had a more pragmatic approach to policy. He did, however, understand his role as party leader. The Watergate scandal, one could argue, occurred for the very reason that Nixon had no confidence in party professionals to manage his campaign. The Nixon inner circle was charged with re-electing him, and that is the team that ultimately caused his presidency to come undone. Margaret C. Rung writes that Nixon was a big believer in the party system, “Nixon’s commitment to party operated on two levels. On one level, he identified himself as a Republican and vigorously campaigned to bring about a new voter realignment to revive the Republican Party after its crushing defeats in the New Deal era. On another level, Nixon perceived himself as a party politician who fervently believed in the viability and necessity of the two-party system.”[^38]

Nixon, unlike Eisenhower, was a student of politics. Although he served in the Navy, he was not a career military man like Eisenhower. He was far more interested in politics. Nixon felt that public policy decisions should come from elected officials, and not interest groups or bureaucratic groups. Unlike some other national candidates, Nixon was from modest means. Growing up poor in Whittier, California, an ambitious politician like Nixon needed the party system. For Nixon, being a Republican meant being a part of something and having a pathway to reach his goals. If parties are being side-stepped today by entrepreneurial candidates, Nixon was the polar opposite of what has become of party politics. Even in his famous “Checkers Speech,” Nixon refers to his wife’s only overcoat as a “Republican coat.”

What has become commonplace for modern presidents, especially in the Barack Obama administration, is the use of policy experts, or Czars. This is something that, although the Obama administration may disagree, would have fit nicely into the way the Nixon presidency operated. Nixon wanted the policy team close to him, without the agenda being debated at great length.

Robert Mason explains that Nixon understood well his role as party, and wanted to build the party:

This examination of Nixon as party leader concentrated on two forms of party activity. First, during the midterm campaign of 1970, Nixon sought to re-package the Republican Party in a form more attractive to the electorate, with lines of conflict between the parties redefined to the advantage of the Republicans. Second, from 1970 and beyond the elections of 1972, Nixon sought to boost Republican strength by persuading key Democratic politicians to change party affiliation. In both, Nixon showed an activist approach to party leadership.[^39]

It is important to not confuse ideology and mission. Pragmatist politicians, such as Eisenhower and Richard Nixon, are not often the most ideological. That centrist approach, however, does not mean that they do not want to hold the reigns of the party. In fact, every modern president wants to steer the party.

Jimmy Carter as Party Leader

Jimmy Carter’s relationship with the Democratic Party was complex. It is common today for candidates to seek the “outsider” status. In 1976, however, being an outsider was not as popular. Carter, however, was quite the political outsider running in 1976. He was not from Washington, D.C. He was a Georgia governor with a progressive slant, which made him something of an outsider even in his home state. Carter, known on the campaign trail as “Jimmy Who” because of his unknown status, was the perfect answer to a political climate that was soured by the Watergate scandal and Vietnam War. As a sitting president, however, he was the de-facto leader of the party. He agreed to the party having a convention in 1978 (an in-between year in the traditional sense), which only wound up loosening his grip on the party. Since then, presidents would not want parties to develop a platform without them getting out in front of it.

As a small-state governor, Carter enjoyed his obscurity on the national scene. It allowed him to distance himself from the ugliness of Washington, especially following Watergate and the national uneasiness of the Vietnam War. Eventually, however, he had to sell himself. He, like all modern presidents, morphed from who he was as a candidate to who he had to be as a president. Lowi explains that Carter transformed, whether he wanted to or not:

Carter’s initial persona was one of the complete modesty . . . . But once he did begin to approach the possibility of actually winning the Democratic presidential nomination, he began to be a great deal more presidential, making the success or failure of government itself dependent upon his election, his own personal election.[^40]

Carter embraced the enormity of the job, even though he gladly campaigned as an outsider. It is also useful to point out that Carter, in his post-presidency, has been anything but an outsider. Carter has been visible in electoral politics all over the globe since leaving office in 1981. Known largely as a micro-managing executive, Carter kept a strong grip on what happened in the White House, and the party agenda. He wanted to keep the special interests at bay, as Craig Allan Kaplowitz explains, “Under the trusteeship model, Jimmy Carter believed Congress to be captured by special interests and narrow constituencies. He further believed that the president should be above parochial politics, acting as a trustee for his constituency, the entire nation.”[^41]

Carter may have been the leader of the Democratic Party, but his political compass lost track of the “soul” of the party. He faced opposition from Senator Edward Kennedy in a primary race in 1980. Carter’s governance either caused, or came along with, a lowering of Democratic Party identity among registered voters. In 1976, 51 percent of Americans identified as Democrats. By 1979, that number dropped to 38 percent.[^42] The reason for this was likely that Carter had lost the base of the Democratic Party to the more progressive members, most notably Senator Kennedy, as Timothy Randolph Stanley describes, “In contrast, Kennedy’s presumed ability to motivate that electoral base to go to the polls in 1980 was a key factor in the endorsements he received from Democratic office holders. The wider public favoured Kennedy as an alternative nominee, too.”[^43]

Scholars today may argue that the fight over the soul of the Democratic Party was won rather easily by President Jimmy Carter. Kennedy, however, won more than 7 million votes in a primary to unseat an incumbent president. He carried primaries in 11 states. If we accept the argument that presidents lead parties, it is safe to say that Carter lost the party, even though he won the nomination. The same can be said for President George H.W. Bush, who followed Ronald Reagan. Reagan, as the next sub-heading will explain, re-energized the heart of the Republican Party.

Ross Perot’s candidacy in 1992 exposed the two parties as having little direction.[^44] In 1992, George H.W. Bush was a president who had lost the confidence of his party (as evidenced by Patrick Buchanan’s strong New Hampshire primary challenge.) He lost the ear of the party, and could not get it back.

Bush did not have to reflect the ideological magic of Reagan, but it was necessary to maintain a grip on the party. He did not maintain that grip, however, and was ultimately handed quite a challenge from Patrick Buchanan in the 1992 New Hampshire primary. Like Carter, there was a fight for the keys to the party. Like Carter, Bush won that primary battle, but was still on shaky enough knees to lose to his eventual Democratic opponent, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas.

Reagan’s Republican Party: The GOP’s Closest Match-up to FDR’s Influence

Ronald Reagan is still the most recognizable standard-bearer for the Republican Party. What we see with all modern presidents is that, even when they came in as “outsiders,” they eventually took over their parties. Reagan set up a standard that helped the Republicans regain their foothold over middle-class America. Since Reagan left office, however, candidates have been chasing his ghost in an effort to be the heir-apparent to the conservative mantle. The problem is that issues and challenges today are different, and there is no way to know what Reagan would have said about modern issues like immigration or global warming.

The Republican Party, in the Reagan era, relied on three important legs; it was anti-communist, it supported economic growth through tax cuts, and it opposed government spending (in some areas more than others). These issues were not boilerplate GOP priorities before Reagan. Reagan, like FDR, was an ideologue. His agenda would become the party’s agenda.

Whereas some of FDR’s progressive momentum came from William Jennings Bryan and Woodrow Wilson, Reagan built on the politics of Senator Barry Goldwater. Reagan made opposing the Soviet Union’s agenda part of his rhetoric. David S. Castle, explains that Goldwater’s biggest impact on the Republican Party was not solely expressed in how members of Congress starting voting in the twenty-year period following his defeat, but also in the leadership that evolved with the party almost twenty years later.[^45]

Evidence of a similar effect on party with Reagan (as was the case with FDR) could be found in the small amount of opposition that Reagan experienced legislatively. The “Reagan Budget,” which included tax cuts, received wide Republican support, passing the House (220 to 184) and the Senate (64 to 20).[^46] His international commitments to stave off communism (and terrorism) were also met with minimal opposition. In fact, then-Representative John McCain’s opposition to sending U.S. marines into Lebanon was a notably rare display of GOP dissent in an ambitious Reagan foreign policy.

Reagan’s policies were the new face of the Republican Party. The regime theory that Stephen Skowronek is widely known for in academic circles is best exemplified in Ronald Reagan. His influence on the Republican Party was a right angle turn from where the party was before his successful campaign in 1980. In both foreign and economic policy, the party shifted toward Reagan’s viewpoint, and it has not really changed its stances in those areas since. Skowronek explains that Reagan was the right man to voice conservative concerns for his party, “Reagan became the very model of the kind of leader needed to make this system work; his relative success became a standing refutation of the charge that something fundamental had gone wrong; his performance became a confirmation of older beliefs that the system is sound and that the problem is simply getting the right person into office.”[^47]

Reagan so radically altered the way the Republican Party self-identified that the term “Reagan Republican” is a commonly uttered phrase among GOP primary contenders at many levels of elected office. Reagan changed how Republicans identified and he changed how the party approached government. The expectations from Reagan’s Republican Party were not the same at the expectations of Richard Nixon’s Republican Party.

Military intervention, tax cuts, increased defense spending, and skepticism toward social programs were parts of the Republican agenda. Skowronek explains that Reagan clearly wanted a break, not only from the policies of Jimmy Carter, but of his Republican predecessor as well:

Reagan needed no prompting to take the part of the great repudiator. His administration opened with a broadside assault on the ruling formulas of a bankrupt past: “In the present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.” This message would be hammered relentlessly over the next eight years, each blow directing the presidential battering ram against the institutions and principal clients of the liberal regime.[^48]

Some may be quick to identify the “liberal regime” with opposition Democrats, but Reagan was sending a message very early on that Republican politics would mean a break from the “New Deal-lite” approach of the past. Enough time had passed where it was okay, according to Reagan Republicans, to challenge the base of New Deal policies. This was not a change in management; it was a change in message.

To understand Reagan’s changing influence on the Republican Party, one has to look back to 1964. While most of FDR’s New Deal was still in place, the Republican Party under Republican presidents only tacitly opposed the plan. Goldwater even poked at that notion in 1964 saying that he offered voters “a choice, not an echo.”[^49] The Republican Party repeatedly shied away from a more conservative approach and, instead, remained the pro-business alternative to the Democratic Party. Goldwater, like Robert Taft before him, was not elected president. Both Taft and Goldwater were part of a movement that would only find the light when Reagan was elected in 1980.

Reagan and FDR made their parties more definable with strong agendas, but did they make their parties more attractive to the general public? Presidents and leaders like FDR and Reagan are significant individuals in American history, but did they leave parties stronger after leaving office? As the American voter started to identify more with leaders, there was less of a premium put on party membership. Parties, if they are vehicles for candidates, do not have long standing and established stances on issues.

Reagan and FDR are good examples as to how presidents influence their parties. The thesis here, however, is that most, if not all, presidents influence parties. Reagan and FDR are simply the most telling. There are anomalies to the theory. While all presidents have a say in the direction of their party, there are times when the party has drifted from modern presidents. Jimmy Carter lost a considerable amount of the progressive left in 1980. In two midterm elections, 1994 and 1998, Democratic candidates ran away from the Clinton White House. 1994 is an example of a newly elected president having few political coattails. The point in the Reagan-FDR thesis here is to show that presidents deeply influence parties. Bill Clinton, despite being a popular president, did not have as much sway with his own party. Clinton’s reinvention of government was successful on many fronts, but he may also have reinvented Democratic politics—and not for the better on the progressive front.

Obama’s Democratic Party

The trend of modern presidents and party leadership is well exemplified with FDR and Reagan, but it is a trend that will likely continue. Barack Obama was elected in 2008. Although elected by a popular vote percentage of 6 percent, he handily won the Electoral College. Obama and the Democratic Party is a good example of how presidents lead parties. Unlike FDR and Reagan, Obama endured a grueling primary battle with Hillary Rodham Clinton to get the nomination for the Democratic Party. Despite defeating his Republican opponent, it was not clear how much inter-party support he had. He had won over the independent voters in the general election, and his support in the electorate was high following his election, but what was there to make of incumbent Democrats?

Obama, with majorities in both Houses at the time of his inauguration, saw a great deal of his agenda moved through Congress. Was there a great deal of opposition within the Democratic Party in the 111th Congress? Senate Democrats in the 111th Congress voted with President Obama 94 percent of the time. Even Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who has been an independent voice from his days in the House of Representatives, voted with his party’s leader 94 percent of the time.[^50]

Ideological regimes became party agendas and they lasted for a period of time until the movement died out. The assertion here is similar in that parties are not as rooted in policy scripture, but more to the particular—and temporary—leadership. Skowronek suggests that regime-building presidents expect to carry the agenda of their party:

New presidents were not to be taken lightly, because they would come to power with a potent political rationale for shattering the received order. They would assert that their election proceeded on the dislike of the current state of affairs; and, acting on authority, they would be likely to try to change as much about it as they could.[^51]

As for modern presidencies, however, it is useful to start with FDR. The comparison of FDR and Reagan are excellent case studies because they both introduced new directions for their parties.

When Richard Neustadt wrote Presidential Power and the Modern Presidents, he was telling future executives that they needed to the power to cajole and bargain. President John F. Kennedy was adept at this, and the Democratic Party was his party to lead for as long as he was president. The Unified Executive Theory, however, was developed during the Cold War and involved more than just a president’s ability to cajole. This idea, borne out of the Reagan Justice Department, recognized greater powers in the office of the president. The Unitary Executive Theory is a focus on how executives are given far more decision-making abilities than before—especially on matters of foreign policy. Parties, whether they meant to or not, have also adopted this approach to power. As presidents grew more identifiable with the voting public, they gained power in parties.

Unified Executive Theory is not a good long-term strategy for parties. Sure, a strong presidency helps incumbent presidents, but parties are tethered to their incumbent presidents. If a president is unpopular, it could have long standing negative effects on a party. This leaves party leaders in Congress, and throughout the country, in a difficult position. If they separate from an unpopular president, the party looks unified. If they go along with an unpopular president, they basically go down with the ship, which is what happened to congressional Republicans in 2006.

Both Neustadt and Rossiter wrote seminal works on the modern presidency. As Michael Nelson, who wrote the introduction to later versions of The American Presidency (Rossiter Revisited) has explained, Neustadt’s work was more of a behavioral nod to the modern presidency, where Rossiter’s work was a snapshot of the constitutional and extra-constitutional roles of the office.[^52] Both Rossiter and Neustadt were writing at times when parties were still strong, but the presidency was getting stronger.

Rossiter explains that Americans defend the institution of the presidency in three general ways: they either see criticism of the office as overblown and unrealistic, or they simply trust that presidents will keep to constitutional restraints, or they may just not know enough to be worried.[^53] It is the second defense, where Americans trust the constitution and the office-holder, that Americans use most to defend the presidency, according to Rossiter. Presidents, such as Roosevelt, have grown the office alongside a public that accepts these new roles, such as Chief of Party. These watershed moments regarding the presidency are important as they relate to parties because both major parties started to look upward for their policy cues. Voters were developing _resources/books//Fractured Parties_ How Recent Elections Ha - Anthony Stasi of the parties based on a stronger presidency and a national message.

There are risks with attaching party agendas to the presidency, or even a strong national leader. As Barry Goldwater strongly influenced Ronald Reagan, it is important to note that Goldwater’s opinions on a few key issues for conservatives changed over time. Elizabeth Tandy Shermer explains that Goldwater would have a different constituency today, “In recent years, Goldwater and Conscience of a Conservative have received renewed attention. In the academy and in politics, Goldwater’s legacy seems to be in flux with libertarians and even some liberals who hail the senator’s latter day hostility to the religious Right and his tolerant attitude toward homosexuality and abortion.”[^54] Parties have adopted the vision of influential leaders, the regime builders. Goldwater was not a regime changer, but he can be considered a regime change catalyst.

Another example of the risk of putting all kinds of power in the presidency is that the results may not always be good. If a party’s agenda is determined by a president, what happens when there are policy mistakes or an excess of power? Lowi explains this when describing Richard Nixon’s influence over his party, “If Oscar Wilde was right and nothing succeeds like excess, nothing could have been a more successful expression of the tendency of presidents to build their own personal organizations than Nixon’s CREEP (Committee to Re-Elect The President) in 1972.”[^55]

Nixon’s re-election campaign was also indicative of how he took the party’s agenda further to the left, embracing bigger government. The influence that presidents have on parties is clearly significant because it has made the major parties more homogenized, ideological, and less open to a wider spectrum of candidates. How voters identify their own politics and how they view parties are two separate questions. Voters have various ways to express their political stances, and this will be explored later. Voters’ opinions of parties, however, have changed in recent decades.

The important take-away from virtually all modern presidencies, and how to they relate to parties, is how all presidents have become party leaders. They may have eschewed party politics at one time or another, and Eisenhower would be the best example of that. Eisenhower, however, did not rail against the Republican Party while seeking the nomination. Donald Trump and Senator Bernie Sanders sought their respective nominations while raising serious concerns and doubts about those parties. This leaves us with one conclusion: the voters within parties are not on the same page as party leaders.

Sanders and Trump have exposed tremendous weaknesses within the party structure. There have been many candidates in the past who have run for president, and despite ideological differences, still embraced the party structure of the American political system. Businessman Herman Cain sought the GOP nomination in 2012, and got pretty far into the primary process before dropping out. Cain, sixty six years old at the time, was born in the South. He was running for president and getting Republican votes from some of the more conservative voters in the primary process. Cain, despite having seen serious discrimination in his own personal history, was not running against his own party.

Trump and Sanders in 2016 are new type of candidates—the anti-party candidates, running within the party system. Whether this continues in future election cycles is to be seen, but it is uniquely complex for any student of political science. My first employer once told me how he fought in Vietnam because he was drafted, but while in uniform, he distributed anti-war literature. This was something that almost landed him in trouble. The story always stayed with me, and the 2016 election cycle continued to bring me back to that paradoxical situation. There are many things in the political landscape that need reform, and parties are going to have to be more aligned. Presidents are not around long enough to forge that kind of change, regardless of how much hope they may have.

CONGRESS AND PARTY LEADERSHIP

Like the presidency, Congress has a direct relationship with parties—albeit in a different way. Congressional parties have become very consistent in voting behavior in the last fifty years. They also tend to defer to the Executive branch more than in any other period in American history. Members of Congress are tethered to their districts, which, through redistricting, are more conservative or liberal than ever before. Critics have gone to great lengths explaining how the modern Republican Party has gotten so conservative that there is almost no effort on the part of the party to reach voters nationally (e.g. in presidential elections) or even to win non-traditional GOP districts. Thomas Schaller, in The Stronghold explains that the rightward drift of the GOP coincides with it being ideologically singular, “The ideological self-marginalization of the national GOP occurred at the same time the party grew in strength in Congress and particularly in the House of Representatives.”[^56] The GOP turned its political priorities toward what was easiest to win on a consistent basis—the House of Representatives. Changes that came through re-districting years before helped make that possible.

Congressional leadership, much like the presidency, has changed over the years. The problem for Congress as it relates to the party system is that both major parties have impermanent identities, yet the votes in Congress are often along party lines. A big example of this is how the modern Republican Party has experienced ideological splits in recent years, although votes in Congress would not necessarily reflect that split. To look at votes on the House floor, it would appear that the Republican Party is comfortable with its tack to the right in the last ten years. Other evidence, however, tells a different story in the electorate. Long-time, reliable Republicans in the House and Senate have experienced primary fights almost regularly. The battle has been between the traditional identity of the Republican Party and the possibilities of a new conservative idealism.

Congressional parties have undergone a metamorphous that has turned their own system against their better interests. The changes that occurred in the early 1970s were changes to the congressional committee system, and they affected the parties in government. The party in the electorate was changing for the Democrats and it affected Congress. As Sinclair suggested, Congress is the place where the party system took root early on, so the changes to Congress had to influence parties. Who can claim the identity of the parties in Congress? The Speakers? Much has changed over time for congressional parties just as the presidency has changed.

Liberal Democrats, many unhappy with the war in Vietnam, established the Democratic Study Group as a vehicle to explore improvements to the committee system. The current committee chairs were seemingly beyond reproach and getting bills to the floor was more difficult. Thomas Mann and Norm Ornstein were congressional staffers during this period, architects of the coming changes, and later commentators on how Congress has evolved since:

The party’s (Democratic Party) senior figures had no interest in other caucus gatherings; why meet as a party if the only reason for doing so was agitation? But open resistance to an assertive call to allow meetings if a sizable group of party members wanted them was hard to justify; besides Speaker John McCormack and Caucus Chair Dan Rostenkowski wanted to find small ways to appease the DSG liberals, since the tension within the majority party was palpable over Vietnam and social issues. So reformers got their first modest victory.[^57]

The reforms that younger members of Congress were looking to bring in during this period were not specific to the Democratic Party. The Republicans were experiencing similar roadblocks within their party when it came to strong committee chairs. Led by Congressman Donald Rumsfeld, the Republicans in Congress wanted change as well. In Mann and Ornstein’s words, the following describes the Subcommittee Bill of Rights that came out of the reforms of the early 1970s:

•It took the power of appointment of subcommittee chairs away from the committee chairs and allowed committee Democrats to bid for them, in order of seniority, with ratification votes taken by the caucus of all committee Democrats.

•It gave the subcommittee fixed jurisdictions and control over their legislation.

•It empowered the subcommittees to meet, hold hearings, receive adequate budgets, and hire subcommittee professional staffs.

•It spread out subcommittee assignments, guaranteeing each member at least one choice assignment.[^58]

These changes were significant because they did not only come from members of Congress, but from influential staffers and activists who were members of the parties. The after-effects of this change meant that party decisions were now on a longer leash. There was more debate as to who would be in leadership positions. This change, however, may have only come about because the Democratic Party was growing more ideologically progressive. It was growing more liberal in scope, and when it grew progressive enough, the time for reform was right. Sinclair explains that the Democratic Party was progressive enough to usher in the Subcommittee Bill of Rights, “The requirement that committee chairs and the chairs of appropriations subcommittees win majority approval in the Democratic caucus was intended to make the chairs responsive to the party majority, which by this time has a clear liberal majority.”[^59] Of course, making a democratic process more open means less predictability. Is a party with less predictability weaker? The reformers in the late 1960s and early 1970s clearly felt that a more democratic committee process meant that parties would better reflect both the in-government membership and the party in the electorate.

THE POST-1980 HOMOGENIZATION OF PARTIES (AT LEAST WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSE VOTES)

Maybe it was the “Reagan Revolution” and the rebirth of conservatism, but for whatever reason, parties that were once ruled by party bosses and congressional party leaders were now returning to basic ideological playbooks, with presidents calling the plays. Democrats were holding the line and voting more often with fellow Democrats, and the Republicans did the same. Sinclair explains that this is where both parties enforced ideological full court presses:

The Republican Party also changed, becoming more aggressively conservative in the 1980s. Not only were there fewer moderates being elected to the House, but more hard edged, ideological conservatives were entering the chamber. The increasing proportion of House Republicans elected from the South accounted for some, but far from all, of this change in the party’s ideological cast.[^60]

What occurred in the 1980s is what can be referred to as an unintentional nod to responsible party government. In a responsible system, parties would adopt boilerplate stances on a particular series of issues for all candidates to fall under. As the parties shifted ideologically from the 1980s to the current state of affairs, it has given the indication of responsibility, although it is clearly not the case. There has been no organized effort to lock down party positions on issues.

The closest a modern party has come to resembling a responsible system is when House Republicans (and candidates hoping to be House Republicans) signed onto the Contract with America. The “Contract” was Republican House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich’s way of streamlining the message of the House Republican Party. The Contract was an informal way of streamlining the opposition party.[^61]

Gingrich was a backbencher member of Congress when first elected. It did not take long for him to start thinking about a plan for the Republicans to win the majority of the House. For forty years, the Democratic Party holding a majority in the House of Representatives was the norm. Even Republican leaders like Robert Michel (R-Il) had no plan to win the majority when he was minority leader. Gingrich had a plan, and he wrote it out and shared it with the electorate.

Gingrich, in developing a platform of reforms, was also signaling what the priorities of the Republican Party would be, should they win the majority. This is the central point of a responsible system. Gingrich being a former academic was no stranger to the American Political Science Association or the concept of responsible parties. For political purposes, the Contract was a way to selling the Republican Party to an electorate already ambivalent about a young Democratic president. The emotional power play of the Contract could be considered quite political. The strategic end of the Contract, however, was a way for Gingrich to maintain control over the party as Speaker once the election was won. There would be no typical Washington “sturm und drang” or hostility at the committee level or on the floor because members already signed off on the these basic tenets.

The story of the Contract with America and the 104th Congress is not the focal point here, but the reasoning behind the strategy is important. If party leaders see a plan like the Contract as a valuable way to communicate with the electorate, why have parties in Congress not embraced more of this? The ten issue stances in the Contract all passed Congress in short order. Almost all of them were either stymied at the Senate level or when they got to President Bill Clinton’s desk. Again, the success of the Contract matters not as much as how well it worked in defining a party. In a manner of self-identification, the Contract was a success. Parties today are weaker than they have been at any time in the last fifty years, and yet the two major parties refuse to take a step, by changing course.

VOTING ALONG PARTY LINES—EVEN WITH IDEOLOGICAL SPLITS

Both major parties in government have shown a tendency to vote along party lines. This chapter is a focus on the “parties in government.” The growth of the presidency is not often disputed, but why are leaders in Congress, who are almost always in Washington longer than particular presidents, not more influential on the direction of their parties? Congressional leaders have the ear of the media. They appear on talk shows and editorialize. Congressional members of the president’s party are often closely in line with the views of the White House. What would be the reason for opposition party members of Congress to not have more of a handle on the party agenda? House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) has not appeared to steer the ideological direction of the GOP. This stands to reason that parties are not stable in the way that they come to designing a platform. There is no major committee that sorts out party stances the way it would in a responsible system.

The case of House Speaker John Boehner is an interesting example of how parties in Congress are not easily definable. In late June of 2013, Boehner backed what was basically a bipartisan farm bill. Uncharacteristically, he got out in front of the bill and announced his support publicly. The Week’s Jon Terbush described the climate around Boehner as such:

The embarrassing defeat for Boehner comes one year after he opted to not even bring the massive, $940 billion measure to the floor for a vote because of Republican objections. The bill was thought to have had more bipartisan support this time around, and its defeat came as a surprise.

Boehner even took the unusual step of publicly backing the bill—to no avail. And to pour salt in the wound, the divisive food-stamp cuts that scuttled the legislation had been pushed by Boehner’s top lieutenant, Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.).[^62]

Boehner, himself, was once a pot stirring backbench member of Congress who rose within the party as a part of a new, ambitious Republican delegation in the House. Boehner, however, is now the face of establishment politics, and to many in the indescribable or indefinable conservative camp, he is not the leader of their agenda.

Those who were once standard bearers of traditional conservative thought were now being considered more “establishment.” Daniel Foster of the National Review, wrote the following about Boehner and the House Republicans, “The fact is House Republicans remain untamable. This isn’t the first—or fifth—time John Boehner has been dealt a surprise defeat on a floor vote.”[^63]

The big problem that congressional Republicans have is that they constantly in the crosshairs of conservative critics. Republican representatives, often in safe GOP districts, are really not safe because there is often a more conservative would-be candidate lurking in the wings. This modern conservative movement does not resemble the Reagan playbook at all. Reagan famously embraced former California state GOP chair Gaylord B. Parkinson’s quote that the 11th Commandment was “Thou shall not speak ill of any Republican.” The party today, however, runs completely counter that conservative mantra that came out of California with Reagan.

Sixty-two Republicans abandoned Boehner on what should have been a bipartisan farm bill. This represents a growing trend in Republican politics—members no longer fear (or even respect) the leadership. The chapter that follows this one is an exploration of campaign finance reform. It explains how nothing can move forward without it. For the purposes here, however, members of Congress, so long as they are being financed someplace else, do not have to fall in line with a party agenda.

Following the election of Barack Obama in 2008, there was a growing movement to keep taxes from being hiked at the federal level. People who were not necessarily members of the Republican Party joined together and formed the Tea Party, a taxation watch-dog group that lasted longer than the passing fancy that many saw it as in the beginning. Originally, the Tea Party movement was a burst of energy to a party that had just endured a presidency with low approval ratings and an historic loss to a charismatic national figure. The Tea Party, not being an actual party, could play outside the rules of professional courtesy. They could criticize the administration, endorse candidates, and were not accountable the way a political party would be to whatever stance they take on issues.

Political parties are established institutions. Groups like the Tea Party are not established, and part of their credo is to remain anti-establishment. This was a group appealing to “the people” in a way that the House of Representatives was unable to as easily. The added momentum from the right was welcome energy to the Republicans, but the staying power of the organization made it difficult for the party-in-government to determine a destination on policy fronts. Peter Boyer of The New Yorker, covered Boehner’s burden with an outside ideological group pressuring the party but here describes the welcome jolt of enthusiasm brought on by the Tea Party, “But Boehner was among the first Beltway Republicans to recognize that the rise of the Tea Party represented, for Republicans, a near-miracle of good luck. At the start of the Obama era, the G.O.P. was a battered and exhausted party, suffering not only defeat but something like an existential crisis.”[^64]

A major problem for party leaders is that polarization has become something that some politicians do not eschew, but instead, grab onto with great success. Candidates for Congress know that the two parties are not as popular as they once were. They may run as Democrats and Republicans, but they want to be considered “outsiders.” This is cause for concern for leaders like Boehner, who have to build consensus around policy initiatives. Polls showing the public’s opinion of Congress are not difficult to find. They almost all look similar if they are tracked over time. According to Gallup polls that have tracked Congress over time show that in 1975, congressional approval was at 38 percent. Approval rates remained in that 40 percent territory until it dropped to 13 percent in 2011. It climbed back to 16 percent in 2013 and was recorded at 16 percent again in 2016.[^65]

A way to interpret this data is to understand that before 1994, the House of Representatives was in Democratic Party control for four decades. When the Republicans took over both Houses in 1994, they were popular with Republicans and not with most Democrats. That means that they were still able to hold on to an approval rating that was competitive with that of the president.

The above Figure 3.1]] graph breaks down approval for Congress by party over a twenty-year period.

Notice how, with the exception of those couple of election cycles surrounding the event of September 11th, congressional approval was never stellar in the last twenty five years. Focusing on the years between 2005 and 2013, we can see a greater disparity between Republicans and Democrats. From 2007 to 2009, the Democratic Party won back Congress and then won the presidency. Democrats polled approved of Congress’s performance.

When considering American politics in Congress and at the executive level from 2001 to 2008, there was a great deal of emotion that played out in poll results. The events of September 11th, followed by a military campaign in Afghanistan, was emotional for the electorate. A controversial war in Iraq was emotional as well.

Looking at the figure from 2011 to 2013, Republicans, Democrats, and Independents seem to be converging on their disappointment with Congress. In other words, as the emotion in the electorate died down, there is one element of general dissatisfaction with Congress that remains steady along all ideological lines. The parties are not winning people over in the electorate.

WHAT TO MAKE OF PARTY UNITY IN CONGRESS

Despite the hostility among ideological Democrats and Republicans, most votes in Congress are along party lines. The battles among ideologues do not occur as much on the House floor as they do in primary battles. Party unity votes have actually increased in this era of inter-party splits. Roll Call has tracked votes indicating party unity in both Houses and the results are telling (see Figure 3.2]]).

Notice the jump in party unity votes among Democrats from 1985 to about 1992. This was when the Reagan and Bush presidencies were starting to show a mobilization of Democrats in Washington. The trend line, however, shows upticks for both parties from the early 1980s to the present day. In fact, the trend line for party unity votes in the U.S. Senate is quite similar to that of the House of Representatives (see Figure 3.3]]).

Polarization in the last ten years has been an issue for the two parties in government. One part of this that appears certain is that the major parties are in agreement in how little they will work across the aisle. Tracking how often House and Senate Democrats have voted against a majority of Republicans, there is a jump from decades ago. In 1995 Senate Democrats opposed Republicans with approximately 1200 votes. House Democrats opposed Republican initiatives in 1995 almost 600 times. In fairness, this was the first year that the GOP took over both houses of Congress in forty years, and there was a lot of animosity.[^66]

It is clear thus far in this chapter that there is polarization between the two parties and that voters have soured on both parties and their performance in Congress. The two parties cannot make the case to the electorate if they have identity crises of their own.

WHAT THE TEA PARTY MEANS TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY

The value of exploring the emergence of a faction within a political party is that is sheds light on the idea of party responsibility. As mentioned earlier, the notion of responsible party government is to establish certain party stances that are shared through candidacies. It is a way to more definitively communicate with the electorate. The issues are clearer and the candidates more easily understood and defined. The party, basically, has an identity in a responsible system. The Tea Party has taken its strong message of less government and lower taxes into larger waters where it now endorses candidates. This means that there is a split in the Republican Party that may beyond the party’s leadership to solve.

The Republican leader in the Senate since 2008 has been Mitch McConnell (R-KY). McConnell already came with his own set of conservative and Reagan Republican bona fides. To speak more to the above data, McConnell had a great deal of unity among fellow Republicans in votes in the upper house:

Beginning with the vote on the stimulus package in 2009, McConnell has yet to lose more than three of his forty one (and, for a time, forty) Republicans to the Democrats on a major piece of domestic legislation; and in what he made the most important test of party loyalty—the health care bill- he didn’t lose anyone at all.[^67]

For authors like Gary Gerstle, the Tea Party movement was right in line with his strong conservative stances. That was in 2010, however, before the movement thought about running a primary candidate against McConnell as well. In 2014, McConnell staved off a primary challenge to his right from a Tea Party endorsed challenger, proving that even if the GOP does not a definitive platform, neither does the Tea Party. If members of the Tea Party were satisfied with McConnell, only to eventually run a candidate against him, can it be said that it has a defined platform? This kind of uncertainty makes it difficult for party leaders. Are the party leaders calling the shots or are outside interest groups calling the shots?

In another type of party system, where candidates are vetted through leadership or are required to adhere to certain platform items, there would be less chaos among parties in important elections. McConnell, like many in party leadership following an historic loss in 2008, welcomed the energy of a new dance partner like an ambitious citizen’s group. The Tea Party, however, gained enough momentum to go beyond what may have been simple rhetoric on taxes.

Facing a primary challenge in 2014 from a Tea Party endorsed candidate, McConnell’s fight was not just for his own political survival. Was the party going to have an established leadership or was it going to resemble an Olympic team that qualifies individually to get to the competition and then hopes to gel enough on the field to be effective? The latter was not what any party leader wants, and McConnell was forced to strategize around the Tea Party.

STRATEGIZING AROUND SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS

The issue of money is at the center of all that makes being a party leader less influential. In order to offset a challenge form a Tea Party endorsed candidate, McConnell raised a great deal of money and hired consultants (namely, Jesse Benton) who were successful dealing with insurgent candidates. The Senate Minority leader has enough resources to get around a primary challenge and hire political consultants from opposing camps, but most candidates do not. McConnell was not only fighting to win his primary, he was fighting to keep the party definable.

Although McConnell won his primary challenge, the story leaves parties wondering who is in charge and how does leadership stay in charge. If this is what it takes to remain a decision-making capacity in a major party, and lower level officials are even less protected, what are the parties? Are they still immovable institutions? Or are they vehicles for the user (candidate) to steer in any direction possible? In a system with more structure, an effective party leader would not have to spend so much time and energy of “going negative” in a primary battle.

What has occurred from moneyed challenges from outside the parties is a race to appeal to donors all over the country. A candidate like Dave Brat, an inexperienced college professor, can raise awareness and money nationally base on a few issues (in this case immigration reform being one). Part of this is basic democratic activity, appealing to voters. But there is a crack in the fault lines for parties where the leadership cannot really define a platform of beliefs. If this is the case, it would make much harder for voters who are undecided as to party to make a choice. If party leaders are defining the party direction, the process is more centralized. If the party is driven by the candidates, there is going to be an amalgam of voices from all over the country.

Another case of a one-time Tea Party favorite being absorbed by the populist movement is House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA7). Cantor was viewed only a few years ago as the more conservative answer to the Republican Speaker of the House, John Boehner. What organizations like the Tea Party (or NetRoots on the left side of the aisle) use as a metric in determining a lack of ideological piety, is when they work across the aisle with the opposition party. Cantor, unlike McConnell, did not survive his primary challenge, leaving the Republican leadership in Washington in a position of not knowing who is steering the ship. The fact that parties today are weak is no wonder at all.

CONCLUSION

Defining strong parties as those that are widely utilized by voters and have a definitive footprint in American politics, it is clear that parties are not as strong as they were in the first half of the last century. The evolution of these two institutions, the presidency and Congress, are directly related to the strength of the two major parties. Parties are not independent of these two powerful institutions.

There are some that would argue that parties, being more ideological today, are stronger. Party leaders, however, are not really in control of the message and are not resonating with the American voting public. Chapter 2]] outlined the growth of independent voters and the shying away from parties. What this chapter on institutional influence illustrates is that there are two very strong intermediate variables that affect parties. Both Congress and the presidency are in stages where they function differently than they did over fifty years ago. The presidency is more muscular and Congress defers a great deal of its power. With these institutional changes, parties have grown weaker. It could be said that although institutional weakness is not the sole reason for weaker parties, it has had a causal relationship with parties being less strong today.

It’s Money That Matters

Along with institutional weaknesses that contribute to parties being less influential with American voters, there is the issue of how people get elected. Another big component to party weakness is the lack of influence that parties have on financing campaigns. This issue was addressed in the 1950 report Toward a More Responsible Two-Party System in an effort to keep parties relevant. We have seen that the presidency and Congress are factors in the weakening of parties. What are the ramifications of an unfettered financial system? If the way campaigns are financed has a causal relationship with how parties have weakened, then it can be counted as a reason for weaker parties.

Americans are attached to parties due to the political process, but also because of historical significance. A democracy may function without major parties, but most do not. Past arguments for a strong party system in the United States have centered on the importance of voter cues, information, and fairness. Progressives at the turn of the twentieth century wanted strong parties as a way to wrest power away from big business interests. Modernity has given us cause to wonder if voters need parties for their cues. There is a plethora of information regarding campaigns and candidates, and there is no certainty that information coming from parties is any more accurate.

As the previous chapter discussed, the parties in Congress are at a point where both the message and the money for campaigns comes from someplace other than the party apparatus. This almost leaves us with enough qualitative evidence that the lack of financial structure for parties makes them weaker.

Parties still provide fundraising, especially in presidential elections, but they are only a part of the puzzle. The research here starts from the middle twentieth century. Much has changed since that period. Frank J. Sorauf explains that this period was a turning point in politics, especially how campaigns were financed:

Before and during World War II, most of the resources for running campaigns, apart from the modest efforts of the candidates and their supporters, came from the parties themselves. They provided volunteers for canvassing the neighborhoods, halls for rallies, cast thousands of parades. What had to be purchased, they bought with cash contributions from their candidates, patronage appointees, and assorted fat cats.[^1]

The 2016 Republican primaries saw a very heavily financed Governor Jeb Bush of Florida, running with virtually no actual party help. Most candidates in the primary stages do run with party money, because it would cause the party to choose an actual side too early in a race. Bush, however, had substantial amounts of money from his PAC, titled Right to Rise. The title of the PAC was as interest-inducing as the candidate, and in the end, Bush could not break though in the early primaries. What Bush understood, and we can add Hillary Clinton and Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) to this as well, was that PACs are viable fundraising machines.

Part of the problem with why congressional parties do not move quickly on reforming how campaigns are financed may be because those who are winning have no interest in changing what works for them. There are incumbents who are locked into relatively safe seats on both sides. The current political climate, however, suggests that there are fewer “safe” seats with interparty challenges. Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY) held on to remain the party’s nominee for his seat in 2014. Republican Majority Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia did not win his primary challenge. This is a new development in American politics, especially at the congressional level. In the early 1980s, the parties in Congress were enjoying their places on the political landscape explains Sorauf:

Increasingly through the 1980s, congressional campaign finance slipped into stability. The number of PACs, which had grown from 608 to 4,009 from 1974 to 1984, stayed on or near the 4,000 plateau for the 1980s and 1990s. More tellingly, their collective contributions to congressional candidates increased at a rate slower than the rate of inflation; they gave $132.7 million to congressional candidates in 1986 and $147.8 million in 1988.[^2]

When PACs began to take over the fund raising machinery, parties allowed it to happen. In some way, PACs were bringing energy to the political world. Party leaders could focus more on legislative agendas and leave the fundraising to someone else—at least in part. The obvious problem with this is that there is little to no continuity between the candidates and parties. Candidates now belong to the funders more than they do to the parties. Party leaders, on both sides, could have addressed this decades ago, but in the short term, it was a help to parties. They did not have to worry about raising money and could concentrate on policy. The problem, in the long term, however, is that the people running the PACs now hold a lot of influence over the party.

The rise of soft money and issue ads created a political environment that lives outside the scope of parties. In the 1970s, William Brock, then chair of the Republican National Committee embarked on a campaign to make the party more muscular financially by appealing to small donors through direct mail. The plan worked and the Democratic Party soon followed in this strategy, as Sorauf describes, “Nationalization was under way with the Brock revitalization in the 1970s and the Manatt-led Democratic Party catching-up in the 1980s.”[^3]

The rise of PACs and Internet fundraising may have made party fundraising less relevant. What is clear from the efforts of the Brock Republicans and later the Democratic Party is that there was a sense of nationalization with party chairs leading the fundraising charge. Party chairs still do this, but they are drowned out by the other funding streams that exist outside their sphere of influence.

Parties have grown weaker over recent decades, sometimes due to external circumstances. Examples of that external change are the cultural change that Putnam described, or the different type of immigrant which Hajnal and Lee described. Another change is the heightened need for money in campaigns. There has been a slight leveling-off in the growth of PACs as the number has gotten into the thousands. This growth of outside influences makes interest groups important intermediate variables in examining why parties look the way they do today. Both parties have had their candidates benefit from PAC money, even though parties become less influential when PACs get involved in our system. In other words, are these candidates the “party choice” candidates or do they belong to interest groups? Here is a breakdown of the type of PACs that make contributions to candidates and parties in the current political climate (see Figure 4.1]]).

Both parties’ candidates have had relationships with PACs that fit their ideology to some degree, as we can see from just this snapshot in Figure 4.2]] and Figure 4.3]].

The participation of PACs have been debated at length over the decades, but a good way to understand the inevitability of their existence in the current system might come from a quote from former Illinois Senator Paul Simon in 1986, “I want to have public financing,” Simon said. “But as long as we have this system, I have to use it . . . . You’ve got to play the game by the current rules.”[^4] The current rules may be damaging parties. Simon, a progressive senator, understood the realities of changing American politics—parties were no longer running the figure, at least not in the financing sense.

Paul Simon was right that in order for all things to be equal in the fundraising world, it makes no sense to hamper one’s efforts to raise money if everyone else is not going along with the program. That understanding, however, has been turned on its side at times in American politics. In 1992, former California Governor (who is the again the governor of California) Jerry Brown ran a presidential campaign where he stated he would not an individual donation over $100. For a local election, accepting no more than $100 is understandable, but for a national race, it is bold. It was also quite an attention-getting move for Brown.

Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton eventually won the nomination and the presidency. Brown’s campaign fizzled when Clinton regained momentum after a shaky start. Brown did something that is significant, however. He showed that by taking less money, he could garner the attention of an electorate that was uneasy about big moneyed, corporate entities interfering with its politics.

The Brown momentum in 1992 was echoed again in 2016 with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Both Sanders and Brown were not new to these questions about campaign financing. Both of them had made a career of being suspicious of big money, whether it was from corporations or individuals. In 2016, like in 1992, younger voters gravitated toward that message.

PACs are an access point for candidates who may not have had a chance at running for office if they were left to their own fundraising abilities. The Republican Party, for example, fails to tap into female donors who are often willing to help Republican candidates. In 2012, Women for Romney was successful in raising $23 million for the Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan presidential ticket. After the election, however, those resources went untapped.[^5]

Groups like Project Grow and Burning Glass developed to harness some of the fundraising energy that the party has ignored. In the 2012 election cycle, 29 percent of total campaign donations (all parties) came from women, and the Republican Party’s candidates received very little of it. Groups like this are picking up the slack, since the GOP certainly is not.

Should organizations like PACs be charged with “picking up the slack” for candidates? By doing this, they may be helping candidates but they are also making the parties less relevant. In the case of PACs, the Republican Party has benefited more than the Democratic Party over a period of twenty years, although the Democrats have figured out how to utilize PACs as well. What is interesting is that even with the Republicans making such gains in fundraising since the 1980s, the statistic is almost in the reverse when it comes to female donors. For twenty nine years, the major influx of money for and from women going to congressional candidates has come from Emily’s List, a progressive, pro-choice, fundraising organization. It was not until 2012, that Women for Romney made a significant dent in the amount of fundraising dollars in a national campaign.[^6]

Even if the Republicans have learned to tap into a market that the Democrats have championed for a long time, the bottom line is that the fundraising is coming from outside the party apparatus. In fact, good campaigns often hire outside fundraisers to help bulk up campaign war chests. Parties are a part of the process, but the main element in fundraising, which makes them less responsible.

If policy makers were hoping that Republicans would eventually agree to curb PAC money, recent developments would suggest otherwise. The rise of the Tea Party, a grass roots movement with its own fundraising capabilities, has allowed the GOP establishment to embrace PAC money as a way to stave off inter-party challenges.

CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM

Reforming how campaigns are financed has been a focus of reformers. Like reforming primaries or redistricting, the idea of creating parity in political campaigns is aimed at making our political arena more competitive. Not every idea works and the political climate across the country can differ according to region and state. National campaigns are heavily financed in both major parties.

Campaign finance reform has historically been supported most reliably on the left of American politics, although it has gained ground on the right. A 2013 Gallup poll, however, illustrated that there was growing support on the right and middle as well. Polled Democrats were in favor of campaign finance reform by 60 percent. We may expect that to be higher, but remember that the winners are always reluctant to change. Barack Obama and Bill Clinton raised a lot of money in their presidential races. Forty percent of Republicans polled were in favor of reform. That 40 percent is a number for Republicans worth noting. It explains the dichotomy that has helped, and hindered, the GOP in the last fifty years. The “red states” in the middle of the country are relatively conservative. These are the “Main Street” Republicans. The wealthier “Wall Street” Republicans can be different on issues like campaign finance reform. Main Street Republicans may feel that the party has gotten away from them, which gets back to the point made earlier about PACs. Fifty percent of independents in the Gallup 2013 poll were in favor of reforming how campaigns are financed. That figure for independents was low when we consider that independents often gripe about external influence in parties. That 50 percent, however, may also be because some people feel that the Supreme Court has tilted toward the First Amendment in cases like this and there is simply no reason to revisit the notion of reform.[^7]

We can see that this is not an issue that is permanently tethered to one side of the political aisle. While parties are shifting in their support with some Republicans supporting the idea (most notably Senator John McCain of Arizona), individual voters may feel that public financing or more laws are not necessary.

McCain—Feingold and the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act

The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (henceforth BCRA) was a much discussed piece of legislation in the 2000 presidential race, especially with one of its key authors, Senator John McCain (R-AZ), being a major possibility for the Republican Party nomination. The BCRA aimed to take a modern look at campaign financing. The legislation took on the issue of soft money (money from outside parties) and issue ads. The first constitutional challenge to the BCRA came a year after the bill passed with McConnell v. FEC (2003). At issue in McConnell v. FEC was the second part of the BCRA that which focused on issue advertising. The language in Court opinions and federal law can be lengthy, but it is worth reading in order to understand the larger picture when it comes to campaign finance reform. Here is a little language from the FEC that speaks to the intended provisions of the law:

The BCRA, and FEC rules, contain provisions related to television and radio ads that refer to a clearly identified federal candidate and are distributed (targeted) to the relevant electorate within a particular time period before an election. These are often referred to as “issue ads” because they have typically discussed candidates in the context of certain issues without specifically advocating a candidate’s election or defeat. Under the new rules, such ads would now be considered “electioneering communications” and as such, may no longer be funded by corporations or labor organizations. Other individuals or groups who pay for these ads must report the activity and the sources of funds if the payments exceed a specific threshold.[^8]

At issue in McConnell v. FEC is how far government can go in limiting political speech, the most protected form of speech recognized by the Court. In the case of McConnell, the Court saw only minimal encroachments on political speech, and thus the reasoning of the Court was that the Federal Election Commission was within its rights to regulate issue ads. The following is from the last paragraph of the opinion of the Court issued by Justices Sandra Day O’Connor and John Paul Stevens:

The parties remain free to challenge the provisions, as interpreted by the FCC’s regulations, or as otherwise applied. Without the greater information any such challenge will likely provide, the Court cannot say that the provisions’ administrative burdens are so great, or their justifications so minimal, as to warrant finding them facially unconstitutional. Similarly, the argument that the “issue request” requirement will force the purchasers to disclose information revealing their political strategies to opponents does not show that BCRA §504 is facially unconstitutional, but the plaintiffs remain free to raise this argument when §504 is applied.[^9]

Much of this reasoning changed in 2010, with the Citizens United v. FEC (henceforth Citizens United), in which the Court recognized a stricter standard of what it takes to regulate speech. This decision struck down a significant piece of the BCRA, and expanded the political speech capabilities of nonprofits, unions, and corporations. Without getting too deeply into the facts of Citizens United, the case revolves around what counts as a movie and what counts as a paid political issue advertisement. This is difficult legal terrain to navigate. Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing the opinion of the Court, summed up the Court’s decision by affirming that government making the decision between what counts as an issue ad and what does not, is out of the constitutional radius of government:

The First Amendment underwrites the freedom to experiment and to create in the realm of thought and speech. Citizens must be free to use new forms, and new forums, for the expression of ideas. The civic discourse belongs to the people, and the Government may not prescribe the means used to conduct it. McConnell, supra, at 341 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).[^10]

What Kennedy is suggesting in this opinion is that if the government wants to go the route of regulating speech as defined by law, it will need to continually decide what constitutes political speech and what constitutes art (or some other form of speech).

Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a 96-page dissent to the Court’s decision in Citizens United, claiming that had Citizens United not utilized its own treasury money within 30 days of an election, that there would have been no argument against their movie. Stevens did not see this as an encroachment of the First Amendment—or even a First Amendment issue. It was more of a rules issue, and Citizens United was not playing by the rules of the BCRA:

Under the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), it could have used those assets to televise and promote Hillary: The Movie wherever and whenever it wanted to. It also could have spent unrestricted sums to broadcast Hillary at any time other than the 30 days before the last primary election. Neither Citizens United’s nor any other corporation’s speech has been “banned,” ante , at 1. All that the parties dispute is whether Citizens United had a right to use the funds in its general treasury to pay for broadcasts during the 30-day period.[^11]

Stevens sees what many Americans see as a necessary nod to modern campaign financing regulation. More telling is what Stevens wrote as part of the dicta of his decision in point number 65 at the end of his dissent, “Quite distinct from the interest in preventing improper influences on the electoral process, I have long believed that a number of [other] purposes, both legitimate and substantial, may justify the imposition of reasonable limitations on the expenditures permitted during the course of any single campaign.”[^12] What is significant here is that Stevens is saying parties can make their own rules, and that would create a scenario that could live without constitutional constraints because parties can make rules within their own ranks.

What this tells us about parties is they are not as involved in the process. In both McConnell v. FEC and Citizens United, there was virtually no mention of either major party, save for the words “Democratic Primary.” These are two landmark Supreme Court decisions on the most influential elements of political campaigns, and they did not involve the two parties. If the courts do not recognize laws because it limits speech, parties can regulate spending without it being a constitutional concern. A party rule on spending is not constitutionally bound by law, because being on a party line is voluntary.

Even if the Supreme Court changes over time, and Citizens United gets overturned, it leaves us without a clear definitive approach as to how candidates and campaigns can spend money. As long as this is the case, there is less influence on the policy front coming from political parties.

Criticism of Campaign Finance Reform

To some critics, campaign financing programs only serve to prop up underwhelming candidates. The public is charged with paying for campaigns that are only mildly competitive because the candidates are simply not that compelling. In Republic, Lost: How Money Corrupts Congress—and a Plan to Stop It, Lawrence Lessig explains that limiting contributions, even before the Citizens United Supreme Court case, was not an effective approach. He supports a type of system similar to the one espoused by Bruce Ackerman at Yale where vouchers are used by citizens to be donated to a federal campaign of their choice. The point is to avoid funneling public funds into a campaign that is not very strong. In order to be eligible for these vouchers, a candidate has to commit to taking no more than $100 individual donations as well. What does this mean for parties? It puts the resources back into the hands of the rank and file party members, and less with interest groups.

The two major parties can take over the fundraising mechanisms and that would centralize a lot of what is being discussed with campaign finance reform. It would not interfere with the Frist Amendment since party participation is voluntary, as Justice Scalia wrote in the Connecticut case. Since there are no signs of parties actually jumping in to do this, however, the ideas that might work in regard to financing our political campaigns could come from academics who are seeking to level the playing field, if not to simply make the playing field more visible. Bruce Ackerman, like Lessig, feels that there may be a way to recognize the “rights” part of political contributions while still addressing the issue. Perhaps a different type of currency is needed. Ackerman refers to these types of spending vouchers as “patriot dollars.” The idea is that tax payers would receive a $50 dollar voucher to spend on federal elections, which they would transfer to the campaign or organization of their choice. This could create an evening of the distribution of donations and thus create a more public voice in political campaigns. The idea would still allow for a great deal of money to make it to a particular campaign, if the candidate is compelling to the public. Voters would not be subject to sending that voucher money within their own district should they feel differently.

On its face, these ideas of vouchers and “purpose money” have a strong idealistic, academic feel. The reality, however, is that it generates participation. If people have to arrive at an ATM-like machine to transfer dollars to a campaign, they are being active. There are also ancillary benefits, such as people not being charged on a personal credit card, which could lend itself to risks.

Some scholars feel it is possible to develop a more competitive system without curbing how much can be spent on a campaign. The unanswered question is whether this makes elections more competitive. Sure, a program such as this would change how campaigns are financed, but would elections be more competitive? In districts in cities like Chicago, would elections be more competitive between parties? Would there be more competition in primaries with more money going to challengers? That has not been the case in New York City, where candidates receive a matching fund allowance of six dollars for every one they receive up to $150. The Ackerman and Lessig ideas are not bad ideas because they address a problem in American electoral politics, which is a disparity among various campaigns. What taking big money out of campaigns would do for parties is give them back a great deal of influence. The candidates are still running on Democratic and Republican lines, so the parties would still be relevant. A fix like this would mean that outside influence could be limited.

Modernity and Campaign Finance Reform

In Party On!: Political Parties from Hamilton to Jefferson to Today’s Networked Age, John Kenneth White and Matthew R. Kerbel explain that the party system on the state level is still alive and well, and thanks to the Internet, technology can work to their advantage.[^13] This may have proved true in a sense that parties have raised more money than ever before (certainly during presidential campaigns). The issue here, however, is that although electronic communications have the propensity to help parties, the same technology causes voters to get mixed messages from various sources.

National candidates like Rep. Ron Paul of Texas are now able to raise large sums of money through online campaigning and online relationships with groups and individuals. In a sense, this has addressed some of what a voucher system may wish to achieve. Candidates of fewer means can get help from supporters all over the country.

A lot of these ideas are especially relevant in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in Citizens United v. FEC (2010). The decision in Citizens United, unraveled a lot of the restraints that were built into the BCRA. Ideas, like the ones from Lessig and Ackerman are important in light of that decision.

How A Court Decision Changed The Way Campaigns Are Financed

“The conceit that corporations must be treated identically to natural persons in the political sphere is not only inaccurate but also inadequate to justify the Court’s disposition of this case”—Justice John Paul Stevens, dissenting in the Citizens United case.

In 2010, the decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in Citizens United v. FEC unraveled a big chunk of the BCRA. Citizens United is a lobbying group that produced a film titled: Hillary—The Movie, a documentary style film focused on then-presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2008. At stake in this decision was where the Court would see entities, as opposed to individual citizens, regarding the First Amendment. The Court had already ruled in previous cases that donations are a form of speech, and not just any speech, but political speech—the most protected form of free speech.

Hillary—The Movie was looked at as electioneering, and because of the timing of its release on pay-per view television, it was in violation of the BCRA. The Court overturned the appellate court’s ruling that argued that the movie could not air 30 days before the Democratic primaries. The Court found that Citizens United did have the same First Amendment rights as individuals by a vote of five to four.

The opinion of the Court was originally going to be written by Chief Justice John Roberts, but Justice Anthony Kennedy was ultimately given the opinion of the Court. For Kennedy, the Court could have drilled down further, the following excerpt is from his opinion:

Consequently, to hold for Citizens United on this argument, the Court would be required to revise the text of MCFL (Massachusetts Citizens for Life), sever BCRA’s Wellstone Amendment, §441b(c)(6), and ignore the plain text of BCRA’s Snowe-Jeffords Amendment, §441b(c)(2). If the Court decided to create a de minimis exception to MCFL (Massachusetts Citizens for Life) or the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment, the result would be to allow for-profit corporate general treasury funds to be spent for independent expenditures that support candidates. There is no principled basis for doing this without rewriting Austin’s holding that the Government can restrict corporate independent expenditures for political speech.[^14]

Kennedy is suggesting that the Court could “revise the text of MCFL, sever BCRA’s Wellstone Amendment.” Roberts, writing a concurrence, basically focused on the nonprofit’s ability to air its film, which is a smaller take on the issue as a whole.

The relevance of this case to political parties is that it muscles up the nonprofit in this case, and thus strengthens other politically influential organizations. As these organizations, which are steering more of our politics grow, the significance of parties gets further away. It also means that a party’s agenda grows less significant. A poll taken in 2009 at the University of Texas asked participants if lawmakers made decisions based on the influence of their contributors: 79 percent answered in the affirmative.[^15]

Citizens United is only part of the story that explains the incredible influence of PACs and special interest groups. As long as parties are not engineering the financing and message of campaigns, those important items will be sponsored elsewhere. Citizens United underscores that change. There is now constitutional legitimacy in the almost unlimited ability for organizations to finance campaigns. If Citizens United is the biggest recent affirmation that there is an unlimited funding stream for campaigns coming from outside the political establishment, the beginning is a little harder to pin down.

For Lawrence Lessig, the change came when the Republican Party won majorities in both Houses in 1994, “It was at this moment that the modern Congress—call it the ‘Fund Raising Congress’—was born. The Republicans came to power raising an unheard amount of money to defeat the Democrats. Republicans in 1994 received $618.42 million (up from $534.64 million in 1992) in contrast to the Democrats’ $488.68 million (down from $498.45 million in 1992). In the four years between 1994 and 1998, Republican candidates and party committees raised over $1 billion. Never before had a party come anywhere close.”[^16]

Going forward from the development of PACs, spending has grown for both parties. What is important, however, is how difficult it is for party leaders to develop agendas and get involved in campaigns without have a lot of fundraising control or expertise. The checklist for choosing a strong party leader now involves fundraising.

Justice John Paul Stevens offered the dissent in Citizens United, and used some precedent as reasoning for why there could be a constitutional check on corporate (organizational) spending:

The majority’s approach to electioneering marks a dramatic break from our past. Congress has placed special limitations on campaign spending by corporations ever since the passage of the Tillman Act in 1907, ch. 420, 34 Stat. 864. . .The Court today rejects a century of history when it treats the distinction between corporate and individual campaign spending as an invidious novelty born of Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U.S. 652 (1990).[^17]

Stevens argues that there should be no surprise on limitations to corporate spending since it has been done before. As we will see later in Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in delivering the opinion of the Court, made the argument that what constituted a “legislature” before is not the same as what does today. She writes that there was no “initiative and referendum” type of process so the Founders only discussed the actual, elected legislature. In other words, the times have changed, and the interpretation of words (in the Constitution) can be interpreted differently. If that is the case, then that could explain why there were once First Amendment checks to corporations that are not being recognized now. If we are going to accept that modernity can change interpretation in one case, it can certainly change in another case. This, more than anything, opens the door for parties to take over the reigns of spending, because they can impose rules that are not constitutionally bound (since candidates are not relegated to join a party or use a party line on a ballot).

Any other way to regulate campaign spending would have to come through parties (unless a new generation of justices sees it differently, but that would not make the change permanent either.) Until parties are given a more active role, at least in the financing of campaigns, there will always a constitutional wall, best described by Chief Justice John Roberts in the Citizens United case (concurring), “It asks us to embrace a theory of the First Amendment that would allow censorship not only of television and radio broadcasts, but of pamphlets, posters, the Internet, and virtually any other medium that corporations and unions might find useful in expressing their views on matters of public concern.”[^18]

Regardless of what critics think about the ideological slant of the Court, that is a very basic consensus understanding of the Constitution. Stevens, like many people, wanted the policy, and so he found it in the Constitution. The same was said for Roberts in the case of the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. Roberts could have made a similar statement on the Government expanding itself too far, but he instead leaned toward the policy and found a way to see the constitutional compatibility. This is also why critics of Roberts, such as Jeffrey Toobin, are wrong to point to him as being too activist in Citizens United, “In a different way, though, Citizens United is a distinctive product of the Roberts Court. The decision followed a lengthy and bitter behind-the-scenes struggle among the Justices that produced both secret unpublished opinions and a rare re-argument of a case. The case, too, reflects the aggressive conservative judicial activism of the Roberts Court.”[^19] Toobin, however, did not complain about Roberts’ activism when the Affordable Care Act was deemed constitutional. Campaign financing is best addressed by the two major parties using the power of their ballot placement to establish serious spending limits.

Matt Bai, writing for The New York Times Magazine, makes the point that Citizens United was not the stand alone event that made it easier for corporations to spend more money. The BCRA caused the explosion of 527 nonprofit groups, of which Citizens United (the organization) happens to be.[^20] Local programs to encourage competitiveness involve matching fund arrangements where candidates qualify for public funding if they raise enough money in small amounts from a minimal number of people. The idea is that if a candidate appears to have gained enough traction on his or her own, there is value in publicly financing a campaign that would make an election more competitive.

Focusing on Maine and Arizona, Neil Malhotra set out to find if such measures increase competitiveness in state elections. The Maine Clean Elections Act (1996) and the Citizens Clean Election Act in Arizona (1998) were the focus of his research. Both programs target public funding in three phases: candidates’ qualifications, primary elections, and general elections.[^21]

The two systems in Maine and Arizona mirror the matching program that was designed to make elections more competitive in New York City. There is a problem with programs like this, and it may just be a side effect, but incumbents can benefit from this if they have a weak opponent. Incumbents are also entitled to apply for public funding. As Chris Bragg at Crain’s New York opined, citywide incumbents can qualify for funding as long as there is a challenger on the ballot, “Even the most ardent New York political junkie would be hard-pressed to name the opponents of Bronx borough president Ruben Diaz Jr. in the 2013 election. Yet earlier this week, the New York City Campaign Finance Board paid $188,000 in taxpayer matching funds to the Democrat’s sure-winner re-election campaign.”[^22] Bragg is describing a particular popular elected official in Ruben Diaz, Jr. Diaz’s father was also a very influential politician in New York City. The fact that a politician like Diaz can qualify for matching funds despite not necessarily needing them is not a deal breaker for this kind of policy. It does, however, show how a program like this would have certain down sides that actually benefit incumbents. This is more likely in places like New York City, where one party is very strong and there is often little by way of a political challenge to well known incumbents. In Arizona, and especially in Maine, where the political climate is a little more balanced, this may not be as much of a problem.

Like any government program, matching fund programs cost the tax payers money. It is a government program for politicians, if one were to view it in the most critical way. The thrust of these plans is to make the political process fairer and thus make policy innovation more realistic. The systems in Maine and Arizona, focus on giving lesser financed candidates a chance in challenging incumbents. In Arizona, candidates need to raise 200 individual contributions of $5 in a district in order to qualify for public funding. In Maine, the system is similar with candidates being required to get 50 donations of $5 in a district.[^23] This may seem easy, because $5 is not much money, but it forces the candidate to meet the people in the district. This is less about the actual amount of money than it is about inclusion. Remember, voters rarely understand campaign finance laws, so every time a candidate approaches them in Arizona or Maine, this conversation about why $5 is needed comes up. It causes dialogue to develop. Of course if a candidate decides to self-finance a campaign, that is a completely different ball game, since these are rules for public financing.

New York City’s program increased from a 4-to-1 match to a 6-to-1 match per every $175 raised, and scattered among a certain amount of donors. The 6-to-1 match is actually lower than what former speaker of the city council in New York City, Gifford Miller fought for when he suggested an 8-to-1 match. All of these programs aim to give lesser-financed candidates more of a fighting chance. In the case of Miller, it could be argued that because he was also seeking to replace incumbent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a self-financed billionaire, he may have wanted the best chance to raise the most money.

It is worth noting that in New York State (unlike New York City) there are currently no public financing mechanisms for candidates. In 2000, I challenged a then fourteen-year incumbent New York State Assembly member. Despite being endorsed by her hometown newspaper and performing well in our debate, I could only run on the money I raised. There were no matching funds, and still are not. Even in the year 2000, raising $10,000 in a blue collar district does not go very far. Weak candidates do get help, to simply lose by big margins, in publicly financed systems. Without public financing, however, there is the chance of holding back potentially strong candidates.

There is no evidence that elections in New York City have become more competitive. There is still a 48-to-3 majority of Democrats in the city council. Incumbents rarely lose primaries. As for Arizona and Maine, there was no evidence that elections were more competitive in either state after their public financing ideas were put in place.

If we measure competitiveness by how many people challenge incumbents, then these reformist ideas are successful. If we measure success by how many incumbents lose re-election to newly-financed challengers, then these programs are not successful. Good campaign finance law has a dual role: it protects rights (as all laws are designed to do) and it opens up the process for more people to participate. In the case of Arizona and Maine (and other states with other ideas), the success is in the long-term activity of the electorate, not what happens on Election Day.

THE CUTLER SOLUTION

Can parties change the face of campaign financing? The Supreme Court had mixed opinions on how the First Amendment can be applied to federal campaign finance law. Parties, however, can create spending parameters for candidates running on their lines; thus, they can regulate how campaigns behave in a financial sense.

Lloyd Cutler, storied Washington attorney and former White House counsel, was one of the petitioning attorneys in Buckley v. Valeo. In 1986, Cutler wrote that parties, should they wish to control how campaigns are financed, have the ability to do this. The First Amendment may allow for money to be spent as a form of free expression, but parties can set up rules for their candidates for which any candidate would elect to abide if they wanted the nomination.[^24] The reason why Cutler’s whole plan is written here is because it is comprehensive and it calls out parties as those who need to take this problem on. Cutler was one of the ultimate Washington insiders, and his understanding of this issue, as a political operative and an attorney, are invaluable.

The importance of Cutler’s proposal is that it comes with an explanation of how it would fit into the legal framework of the Constitution. Most campaign finance law finds its way to an appellate court, if not the Supreme Court. Cutler, as far back as 1986, realized that most laws regulating spending either fail, are found to be ineffective, or unconstitutional. Parties may be the solution to this problem according to Cutler:

Those who favor the regulation of campaign financing propose a variety of government cures for the ills they perceive. . . .Few people, however, have given serious thought to the possibility that the parties themselves, rather than the government, can and should do more to control the campaign-financing practices of other candidates.[^25]

Cutler admits that in the past, the Democratic Party has been more amenable or open-minded to such change. Save for a few influential voices on the Republican side, however, the issue has been explored a lot less.

Parties have the institutional frameworks to take on the work of distributing campaign money to candidates. What is more, this approach to financing political campaigns falls in line with the recent decisions of the Supreme Court on the First Amendment. The decision in Citizens United established that corporations and organizations have First Amendment rights. If that is the case, so do political parties. Parties can establish their rules that their candidates need to follow. Since there is no mandate that a candidate run on one of the two major party lines, there is no infringement on any individual rights. Cutler, writing this before more than twenty years before the Citizens United decision, cited the Democratic Party v. the State of Wisconsin, ex rel. Robert La Follette as a backdrop to argue that parties are more muscular than even some state regulations.[^26]

Although only a suggestion, Cutler laid out a model that both parties could follow that would serve as a useful boilerplate for getting campaign spending under control to some degree. This is relevant because this is a famous Washington attorney outlining what could have made parties (and candidates) more influential. Here is some of the language from his model, as written in the Annals of the American Academy of Political Science:

§ 101 Terms used in §§ 101–7 shall have the meaning set forth in 2 U.S.C. § 431 [the presenvt federal statute], unless otherwise defined.

§102 Each candidate for the party’s nomination for election to federal office shall file with the Committee all report of contributions received and expenditures made that are filed with the Federal Election Commission.

§ 103 No candidate for the party’s nominations shall make expenditures in excess of:

A.$ ___, in the case of a candidate for nomination for election to the office of the president;

B.the greater of $ ___, or ___cents multiplied by the voting-age-population of the state, representative from a state entitles to only one representative;

C.$___, in the case of any campaign for nomination for election to the House of Representatives, delegate from the District of Columbia, or resident commissioner; or

D.$___, in the case of any campaign for nomination for election to the office of national convention delegate from Guam or the Virgin Islands.

§104 (A) No candidate may make expenditures from personal funds, or from the personal funds of his or her immediate family, in connection with his or her campaigns during any calendar year for nomination for election to deferral office in excess or, in the aggregate:

A.$___, in the case of a candidate for the office of president or vice president;

B.$___, in the case of a candidate for the office of senator, or for the office of the representative from a state that is entitled to only one representative;

C.$___, in the case of a candidate for the office of representative, delegate, or resident commissioner, in any other state.

§ 105 No candidate may receive contributions for any person, committee, or other affiliated group aggregating more than $___ in any calendar year with respect to nomination for election to federal office.

§106 At the beginning of each calendar year, the Committee shall adjust the amounts specified in §___ of this section in the manner specified in 18 U.S.C. § 608 (d), indexing to the consumer price index.

§ 107 No candidate may expend funds for the preparation or broadcast of any canned political commercials, herein defined to be any tape prepared before broadcast other than a tape consisting entirely of a live appearance by the candidate or by an identified supporter speaking on the candidate’s behalf.

§ 108 Any contribution to a candidate for the nomination of the party for election to federal office shall be made to the treasurer of the party for the account of that candidate. The treasurer shall establish rules permitting candidates to make expenditures from funds held in their accounts, provided that such expenditures are permitted under §§ 101–8 of these rules.

A.§. 109 A. There is hereby created the [party’s name] Party Campaign Finance Committee (“the Committee”), which shall consist of give members appointed by the ___, with the approval of the ___. The National Committee of the party shall allocate sufficient financial resources and staff to permit the Committee to fulfill its responsibilities under §§ 101–7.

B.The Committee shall establish rules of procedure for the filing of complaints of alleged violations of these rules, the answers to complaints, the investigation of complaints, and such other matters as it deems desirable.

C.The Committee shall establish rules setting forth sanctions for violations of §§ 101–8, including the imposition of restrictions on expenditures by a candidate of funds held for his or her account by the treasurer of the party. [^27]

This model by Cutler is a sketch, but it would fit both major parties today and would remedy a lot of issues that are currently making parties less relevant.

CONCLUSION

Given what we know about spending and campaigns, it is clear that parties cannot play as relevant a role as they would like if candidates are raising money from interest groups. Neither party benefits from the current layout of how campaigns are financed. Even if PAC money helped some candidates stave off intra-party (e.g. Tea Party) challenges, the future ramifications are costly.

By taking over the financing effort, parties can address all money concerns that have come with modernity—and it is constitutionally sound. In the event of ideological challenges from the right or left, those could be decided in primaries, but not with imbalanced amounts of spending.

The idea of parties taking over how candidates spend money is not a perfect solution, but it could work. The major parties already exist. The question of “what do these parties even do anymore?” would be answered in a more definable way.

Ways to Make Parties Relevant with Voters

Modern American culture, money in campaigns, and being over-shadowed by other institutions, are driving party weakness. Historians and academics tend to gravitate toward the idea that ideological rigidity is a sign of strength. Issue alignment is a sign of strength, but so is participation, and both parties are losing ground in this area.

We are seeing how parties have lost control of the conversation in the 2016 primaries with establishment candidates not only having trouble in primary races, but they are actually at a disadvantage. Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump were less concerned with their parties’ stances on particular issues. Sanders decries the amount of that money has been raised by Democratic candidates through PACs. Traditionally, the Republicans had the attention of Wall Street, but Bill Clinton put a dent in that with a message of strong economy. “I want to create more millionaires,” Clinton said in his 1992 acceptance speech. Bernie Sanders will never say that sentence. He is not concerned with that relationship, and it runs counter to what the modern Democratic Party wants.

Are there ways to have modern parties benefit from, or at least co-exist with, the growing number of American voters who are less enamored with joining parties? While constitutional constraints are rather rigid, parties can engineer tweaks within their ranks to make the process more accessible. In other words, changing the constitution is difficult, but changing the rules to getting a party’s nomination is less difficult.

Whether we feel that the party system has held up or not, there is a lack of voter activity at the early stages of the electoral process. John Aldrich claims that the emergence of a two-party system is no surprise, but their survival is surprising.[^1] Both major parties survived a Civil War, the expansive growth of government, changes from the Progressive Era, and two world wars. The changes that were brought about through the Progressive Era were aimed at party bosses and machine politics. In their history, parties have gained and lost influence. The previous chapters explain the causal relationships between parties working and the intermediate variables. The idea of the direct primary was an attempt to make party politics more inclusive. It may have resulted in the opposite as we look back. This chapter focuses on what academics and policy makers have often discussed as ideas to make the democratic process more appealing to a wider number of voters. Ideas like the California Top-Two primary are attempts to shift the primary process away from rank and file ideological voters to a greater portion of the electorate. Redistricting, initiative and referendum, campaign finance reform, and adjusting the Electoral College, are all important ideas. Even if these ideas did not come to fruition, they illustrate what party professionals are thinking about in order to save the two-party system.

Ideas directed at making the political process more accessible will ultimately strengthen the democracy, and parties will go along for the ride. Much of this hints at what James Madison discussed in the Federalist Papers; a concern with majoritarian factions. The risk with any reform is to stay true to that concern without making the political process gimmicky. Electoral results are the results of elections, and as redundant as that may sound, the outcome is what matters even if it is unexpected or completely predictable. There is no good democratic idea that purposely engineers an outcome. It runs counter to what we want in a democracy. What this research is seeking, however, is whether that electoral process can be tweaked enough to make the process more inclusive without losing the integrity of an unpredictable electorate.

Parties have grown smaller in regard to the people who have a say in their direction, yet the reputations of the two parties is wider known due to them being nationalized. They have become larger parties in that there are more people paying attention to them, but they are smaller in the sense that they are less democratic within their ranks.

TYPOLOGY MATTERS: WITH MORE VOTER TYPES TODAY, A NEED FOR A WIDER PARTICIPATION

Looking at the scope of political typologies, we see that there are a number of categories that capture Americans’ political persuasion, from “Staunch Republican” to “Libertarian” to “Disaffected” to “Solid Liberal.” As a professor of political science, I have often pointed students to the Pew Research Center political typology quiz. This is an interesting way to gauge where one falls on the political spectrum. Often people are surprised what label the typology uses to describe them. This typology is a widely viewed product of the Pew Research Center, but their study covers the broad spectrum of American politics. The point of the typology here is to see how closed off the two major parties have become. Progressive Democrats and conservative Republicans are the most influential in control of both parties. How does this fit across the country, where there may be centrists in both parties? Not well for candidates who then need to prove their party bona fides in primary battles.

How do parties maintain a collection of values in a cohesive way without closing out the diversity that is needed in a major national party? Part of the problem is that the country is so diverse, and the problems are as well. Democrats in lower Manhattan can be opposed to school choice policies because the public school system is functional. Registered Democrats in Washington, D.C. may feel quite differently. A poll taken in 2011, when the Washington, D.C. school voucher program was in danger, showed that 74 percent of the heavily Democratic electorate in Washington, D.C. supports either a strict voucher program or a tax credit scholarship program.[^2] It is difficult for parties to remain so large and cover the needs of such a wide pastiche of people.

If parties are echoing such a consistent message on issues that are basically local concerns, there is no way for the two major parties to adequately relate to the electorate. The number of registered Democrats who identify as pro-life is roughly one-third of the party registration (see Figure 5.1]]).

While Democrats in the electorate might be pro-life to the tune of 30 percent, the Democrats in the House of Representatives is much lower as seen in Figure 5.2]].

If voters are veering away from parties because of ideology or a lack of attachment to institutions, there may be ideas to address those concerns. Looking at the data, there are some basic criticisms of parties. According to data, parties are not always representative of voters’ values.[^3] Primary voters constitute a smaller portion of the electorate, and they are very influential in choosing candidates.

Contrary to what some scholars may suggest, there may be procedural reforms that could result in a more representative government. In fact, E.J. Dionne explains that extreme ideologies have closed the system to wider varieties of voters:

Most of the problems of our political life can be traced to the failure of the dominant ideologies of American politics, liberalism, and conservatism. Wracked by contradiction and responsive mainly to the needs of their various constituencies, liberalism and conservatism prevent the nation from settling the questions that most trouble it. On issue after issue, there is consensus on where the country should move or at least on what we should be arguing about; liberalism and conservatism make it impossible for that consensus to express itself.[^4]

Pragmatism simple does not get to win electorally the way it used to. Being practical has taken a back seat to being true to one’s ideology.

Morris Fiorina has also made this point in Disconnect: The Breakdown of Representation in American Politics, where he states that more people are looking at issues on a “case by case” basis, as opposed to some grander, “more abstract principle.”[^5] This is not to suggest that the method of teaching American history is totally relevant in how Americans view politics. The electoral process, however, may be producing elected officials that are less concerned with the American narrative. The level of voter participation and the ideologies of those who are elected suggests that there is an element of the electorate that in not involved. Laurence Lessig of Harvard Law School explains that although the Supreme Court has affirmed that “the people” are ultimately who decides elections; the primaries are much smaller and much more susceptible to funding imbalances.

THE PRIMARY SYSTEM

Primaries were once a key element to what progressives sought in order to reform politics. The idea of the direct primary was championed by progressives like Robert La Follette because they saw the political system as too closed off to party bosses. The direct primary did give the decision-making process back to registered party members, but today that group is small in proportion to the overall electorate.[^6]

The direct primary was the first major step in tinkering with the party system. It aimed to take power away from individual party bosses. The question today is whether this primary system is actually doing the opposite of its original intention. The issue with the direct primary as it relates to party reform is that it has caused what it set out to rectify. There emerged a need for reformist policies that made the political process more inclusive with regard to this part of the population.

Direct primaries were a reform idea when parties were strong. There were not many independent voters at the end of the twentieth century, therefore primaries were open to be won by a wider group of Democrats and Republicans. As parties eventually shrunk in number, however, the power of the primary became more concentrated. Where the direct primary once set out to take power from the few, it now became a vehicle to do the opposite. If parties were closed camps due to exclusive party bosses, they later became closed camps because of the idealist shrinking of parties. There may be a way to adjust the primary process, and thus, make it more inclusive.

Historically, the direct primary was a bold suggestion, because parties were seen as the buffer zone between American politics and big industry. Party bosses may have been susceptible to certain types of influence, but they were in safe positions to choose candidates. A primary election would make the selection process more competitive, but would also make candidates more prone to outside fundraising. Candidates winning primaries in the diverse regions of the country might be without the guarantee of a political machine backing their agenda. Try to think of your local party leaders today. Are they recognizable? There was once a time when party leaders in community were very recognizable. Even as recent as my childhood in Queens, New York, little league uniforms were picked up at the local Democratic Club. Parties and community were closely weaved together. The primary system took the party bosses out of the process, but it did not eliminate them. Once elected, politicians still required political support, and a diverse candidate that was not the party choice before the primary might not have the support needed to survive. In the South, however, the parties and candidates were all quite similar in their focus on the rights of farmers on the periphery. Party bosses may have lost some power with the direct primary, but they have survived this reform. Neither party has seen an unbalanced advantage due to the direct primary, which makes this particular reform nonpartisan.

The direct primary was originally viewed as a way to reign in the influence of the banks and railroads, especially in the South, where farmers were often at odds with such industrial influences. The California State Primary Law was enacted in 1909. Until 1909, nominating conventions decided which candidates would appear on a ballot. Progressives fought for, and won, the introduction of the direct primary in California, and its first post-primary governor, Hiram Johnson, was the kind of candidate that many of them envisioned. What has changed today, however, is that the very point of giving voters a primary was to make the process more inclusive. The problem today is that the primary process is not being utilized with as much enthusiasm. Thus, the results of primaries are a picture of what happens when only the most ideological voters are involved. We see this on a national level, but it is every bit as real locally. Primary elections are dominated by political club members with rigid party stances.

A very important piece of Wisconsin history fits well with the argument that nonpartisan elections can have a wide ranging, fair-minded effect on city politics. Robert La Follette wanted a primary in order to wrest power away from party bosses. What advocates of the direct primary soon discovered, however, was that even though it provided an opportunity for a candidate less connected to the party apparatus, it was also less predictable. La Follette, elected governor of Wisconsin in 1891, now set his sights on an open U.S. Senate seat. The Wisconsin legislature was happy to oblige La Follette in his plan to place himself into the seat, as his lieutenant governor, James Davidson, took over the reins as governor.

The primary system that emerged from the Wisconsin legislature in 1903 was an open primary, where people could cross over and vote regardless of party affiliation. This is similar to the “Top Two” primary that was proposed in New York City in 2003, one of the few major cities in the United States today that does not have nonpartisan elections for citywide contests.

The primary process still addresses what it was set out to do; it keeps one person, or one powerful entity, from owning the political process. There are arguments that the lack of robust primary activity is the decision of the electorate. By some standards, smaller, more ideological parties are a good thing. There is a hint that ideological streamlining is good for parties because it gives them an identity. The downside, however, is that people are turning away. The rise in independent voters, however, suggests otherwise. If the results are a smaller, more ideological party base, then that is simply the result of the electoral process. The problem with this kind of argument is that today there are more and more independent voters.

Many cities have adopted nonpartisan electoral systems, where the ballot does not indicate a party affiliation. What was proposed in 2003 by then-New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg was an initiative that would create a nonpartisan electoral process for all citywide offices. In this proposal, there would be an open primary, whereby the top two finishers would go on to the general election. The benefit of the top-two system would be that eventually, even without the current party labels on the ballot, there would eventually be a two-person race. This means that whoever got elected, there would be a majority of support for that person, as opposed to having potentially three or four candidates. In reality, a system like this would not make life much better for GOP candidates, but it would give hope to moderate Democrats.

Bloomberg was not a career politician, and with the exception of Robert La Follette, there have not been many career politicians who have pushed for electoral reform. What Bloomberg’s plan was aiming to do was avoid “tourist” candidates riding along on party ballots when they are not necessarily in line with the party’s agenda. Maybe New York City would benefit from the two best Democrats (or two best Republicans) running for mayor, or comptroller, or whatever office is up for election in a particular year.

The reason why the Top-Two system looked attractive, at least before the 2003 election, was that nonpartisan elections do take place in New York City on occasion. In cases where there are special elections, the city holds nonpartisan elections to fill that seat. This is how the City Council approaches special elections. The results, over a period of time, have seen more Republicans elected than would normally happen in a closed primary-general election scheme. What has been interesting is that in recent years, those unlikely winners in nonpartisan special elections, have gone on to be re-elected for at least two terms (before 1994 there were no term limits.) This means that when the process is open, the candidates elected are often considered good choices (or at least good enough) by the public. Although the direct primary has become a vehicle for smaller parties, the fact that they exist is not a problem. They are, in fact, the only real way to get the thoughts of a party’s members when it comes to candidate selection.

NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS: POLLING HIGH AND STILL NOT POLICY

In 1970, Willis Hawley focused on partisan and nonpartisan elections by using San Francisco as a backdrop. Hawley aimed to illustrate that those that benefited from nonpartisan elections are those who wished to reform government (he refers to them as “reformers”). By supporting nonpartisan elections, reformers were pushing back against previous progressive achievements, according to Hawley. Samuel Hays, in wrote in The Reform in Municipal Government in the Progressive Era, “The movement for political reform (nonpartisan election advocates) in municipal government . . . constituted an attempt by upper-class, advanced professional, and large business groups to take formal power from the previously dominant lower class and middle-class elements so that they might advance their own conceptions of desirable public policy.”[^7]

Hays and Hawley do not claim that it is Republicans who benefit, but those who are most likely to vote Republican are more likely to push for nonpartisan elections. There is, however, a Republican Benefit Thesis that sets the stage for Republicans to benefit from nonpartisan elections. Republican Benefit Thesis centers on the idea that upper middle class voters are often more engaged in politics and more active in professional groups, making them less likely to require an established party apparatus to deliver the candidates and voting cues that citizens may need.[^8] Alfred de Grazia described society as “a giant spider web of communications and contacts, and the Republicans tend to be stationed right at the centers of contacts and communications with the society at large.”[^9]

New York City has a higher ratio of Democrats to Republicans today than the six studied counties of California had in the 1960s. Parties were still active and had not yet lost some of the electoral steam that they experienced in the 1970s. Voters identified primarily as Republicans or Democrats in the late 1960s, as opposed to the growing number of independent voters today. The irony is that it is Hawley and de Grazia’s argument for partisan elections in the 1960s that actually makes the case for nonpartisan elections today. Progressives wanted a system that did not allow powerful interests to ignore voting minorities. Parties were a way to take power away from wealthy interests, and put it back in the hands of the people, through the party system. Today, however, partisan elections are having the opposite effect, and are instead creating permanent voting minorities in some cities.

The proposal that Mayor Bloomberg endorsed called for nonpartisan primary elections whereby the top two finishers would compete in a general election. Seven years after the defeat of Mayor Bloomberg’s proposal, the Mayor asked the Charter Review Commission to study nonpartisan elections in city elections. Bloomberg’s goal in introducing this legislation was not for his own benefit, and this is where such critics may have underestimated his desire for nonpartisan elections in New York City. Bloomberg learned in his three years in New York City politics that parties still had influence. There is reason to think that the 2003 proposal was defeated due to an electoral year that did not draw many voters to the polls; there were no state elections, congressional elections, or even national elections. Most of the voters in a low focus election such as in 2003 were party loyalists. In New York City, the party loyalists are the least likely to see nonpartisan elections as a good idea. “We may have made a mistake in putting it on the ballot in a slow election year . . . the people that come out (to vote) are usually the most ideological,” explains Francis Barry, Mayor Bloomberg’s Director of Public Affairs. “The polls showed that we were in decent shape, but we lost badly. There was a learning curve. The onus is on us to teach the public . . .”[^10] Barry published The Scandal of Reform in 2009, a treatise on nonpartisan elections in New York City. “There is surprisingly little data going back very far (in city elections throughout the country) and it is hard getting data from agencies,” says Barry.

In 1959, Charles Adrian explained that there are four types of nonpartisan settings.[^11] For Adrian, one type of setting is where a candidate’s political affiliation is easily definable. Perhaps these candidates are well known already. A second setting for Adrian is where political groups and parties, may slate candidates that they favor. A third setting according to Adrian is where groups, but not political parties, slate candidates. This is where critics of nonpartisan elections focus when making the claim that without parties, seats can be owned by special interest groups. The fourth setting is what proponents of nonpartisan elections see as the best scenario for honest candidate-based elections. This setting is where there is no slating by parties or by special interest groups.[^12]

Adrian’s four settings are relevant in exploring why nonpartisan elections might be useful in New York City Council elections and why they may not discriminate against the poor. In the 2003 proposal by Mayor Michael Bloomberg, candidates were able to note in the corner of the ballot their personal party affiliation. By volunteering this information on a ballot, this would fit Adrian’s second setting. This is a strong argument that under the 2003 proposal, Republicans would be at the same disadvantage as in partisan elections. What is even more striking, however, is that the voting participation on the proposal was so low. If critics claim that nonpartisan elections depress voter turnout, the irony is that voter turnout for the proposal itself only fetched 13 percent.

If a measure similar to the 2003 proposal makes it to a ballot, it can be voted in as law, but this can only happen in the next three years. Mayor Bloomberg was widely regarded as one of the most independent politicians in the country. It is unlikely that in the post-Bloomberg era in New York City, the idea of a Top-Two system has a future.

There is a hypothesis that removing party labels depresses voter participation. What the study concluded, however, was that not all nonpartisan elections are voter depressed, but that incumbents are far more advantaged in nonpartisan races.[^13] New York City only holds nonpartisan elections when there are special elections, meaning there is no incumbent. It is fair to assume that if there were nonpartisan elections in City Council primary races, voters may not be terribly familiar with the candidates’ platforms, but they would know more about the incumbent. This is a good argument for partisan elections in New York City Council races, although incumbents already enjoy a 90 percent re-election rate. If the idea of introducing nonpartisan elections is to make the process more inclusive, certainly a system that makes it more beneficial for incumbents runs counter to the very outcome the policy hopes to achieve.

The incumbency advantage is not, however, what critics of nonpartisan elections cite as why they are harmful for City Council races. What Schaffner, Streb, and Wright discovered was that incumbency was the only real factor that pointed negatively toward nonpartisan races. In fact, as the Democratic Party is the clear majority party in New York City (with 46 incumbents of the 51 total members of the City Council) nonpartisan elections stand to benefit the Democratic Party over the Republican Party. If incumbents are being re-elected by 90 percent margins, introducing 730,000 independent voters to the primary system will make it easier for them to continue to be re-elected by such margins.

The Charter Review Commission reviewed the merits of introducing nonpartisan primaries to the City. The issue was not researched enough by the commission to make it a viable issue for the November 2010 ballot. Although the measure was defeated heavily in 2003, the fact that most major cities use these types of elections is enough to put fear into the groups that favor partisan elections. The same arguments about voting cues, incumbency, and wealth exist in those cities, yet nonpartisan elections do not seem to make the system imbalanced or unfair.

If those that favor nonpartisan elections are wealthier, better educated voters (as well as incumbents) what groups are on the other side of this issue? In order to understand the support and opposition of this issue in New York City, you have to first examine the politics of the city. The current political climate in the New York City Council heavily favors the Democratic Party. There are 51 total members that represent districts in all 5 boroughs. Of the 51 City Council representatives, 49 are Democrats and 2 are Republicans. One of the two Republican members was elected in a nonpartisan special election. If the Democratic primary is the deciding factor in these races, then there is a progressive population within the Democratic Party population that is deciding almost all of the City’s representation. In the most populous city in America, creators of public policy are elected from a party within a party. There is no surprise that a majority of New York City Republicans share a belief that nonpartisan elections are more inclusive and provide for more competitive elections.

In 1977, Ed Koch ran for mayor of New York City on the Democratic Party line, while his main challenger, Mario M. Cuomo, ran on the Liberal Party line. Cuomo lost that race to Koch, but still received more votes on a third party line than both Mayor Michael Bloomberg in 2009. Cuomo received 587,913 votes to a sitting mayor’s 585,466 votes.[^14] This history shows how New York City’s partisan system has not encouraged voter turnout.

If Bloomberg was speaking to 585,466 staunch conservatives, there would probably be a stronger Republican Party in New York City. Voters only listened to his message because there was a general feeling that he was not part of the system of either party. He was able to tap into the more than 1 million non-major party affiliated voters in New York City.

THE LOW VOTER TURNOUT ARGUMENT AND NONPARTISAN ELECTIONS

In a city that has a majority of minority race residents, the argument that policy could discriminate is taken quite seriously. When Mayor Bloomberg asked the Charter Review Commission to examine the issue, it spurred a reaction from career political figures. An article penned by former mayoral candidate and former New York City Comptroller Bill Thompson, in the Amsterdam News for the week of July 8, 2010, warned of the dangers of nonpartisan elections in New York City.

Thompson, along with fellow New York City Democrats, held a press conference in 2010 and spoke against the notion of nonpartisan elections. The Democratic delegation made similar points against the idea that have been documented in previous research, and began by asserting that nonpartisan elections depress voter turnout: “In order to increase participation among less advantaged groups, including Latinos and African- Americans, it is critical to ensure they have access to information about candidates,” explained Thompson. “There is plenty of evidence that shows that in cities where nonpartisan elections have been instituted, they have led to lower voter participation rates, especially among communities of color.”[^15] If there is less voter turnout among minority voters in nonpartisan elections, why are political parties not working harder to educate them? There is nothing to stop a political party from advertising and promoting a candidate in a nonpartisan system. Nonpartisan elections are only nonpartisan on voter ballots. In fact, Thompson, during debates with Bloomberg in 2009, often referred to the Mayor as “my Republican opponent.” Thompson and Dukes are claiming that voter turnout will go down if 730,000 voters are given access to voting in primaries.

If the Democratic Party relies on a strong turnout of Hispanic and African American voters, it can still work to mobilize voters on Election Day in a “Top Two” system. As political scientist David Schleicher of George Mason University explains, “national party organizations have a First Amendment right to organize campaigns in local elections even if the election is nonpartisan.”[^16]

It is not only loyal Democrats such as Thompson and Dukes, who support a partisan system. In places where party identification is an advantage, there are supporters of the current system regardless of party label. Republicans in districts where they are considered “safe,” there is little effort to change the system. Allowing party identification to serve as the vehicle for candidate evaluation might diminish the individual characteristics of the candidate. Not all Republicans have the same views on social issues, crime, and education. Not all Democrats agree on abortion and taxation. To use party identifiers as the primary source, which is what Thompson and Dukes suggest, puts the individual approach toward policy at a lower value than party affiliation.

Research conducted by Schleicher that suggests a correlation between minority voters and voter participation. But Schleicher makes the point that parties in local elections do very little to describe a candidate in local elections.[^17] Schleicher references the work of Paul Peterson’s book City Limits when he explains that local elections are about local issues that rarely have a connection to a greater ideological base: “Instead, local politics only deals with the provision of widely-agreed upon public goods and their allocation, for example, the creation of city parks and the decision of where to locate them.” “These issues,” Peterson argues, “do not give rise to political disputes because, by their very nature, no one is against public goods.”[^18] If parties are not holding to the responsible party model that indicates a united platform, then there is room to question the value and accuracy of the party label.

While many major cities in the United States hold nonpartisan elections, the collection of cities that has routinely nixed the idea of nonpartisan elections is on the east coast. New York, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, and Baltimore have remained partisan. Los Angeles, Chicago, and San Francisco do not have partisan elections. All of these cities, regardless of their election schemes, have low-income voters and minority voters, yet the cities with nonpartisan elections do not have lower voter turnout rates than the cities with partisan elections.

This is what makes Boston such an interesting outlier when observing nonpartisan election schemes in major cities. Boston has a strong Democratic Party, and it nominates and elects powerful Democrats to public office. Boston, however, was one of the first cities to introduce nonpartisan elections. Boston remains a culturally, and ethnically, partisan city, while being electorally nonpartisan . This is evidence that voters in Boston do not rely on party cues in order to find the candidate that best fits their values preference.

806,756 DISENFRANCHISED VOTERS

Schleicher explains that while the issue of nonpartisan elections is important, there is a general agreement between the two major parties that the desired result is a more active electorate. Democrats in New York City do not want to disenfranchise voters by having them less informed. Republicans, and a growing number of independent advocacy groups, want non-Democrats to have a voice in city government.[^19]

As it stands today, there are 806,756 voters in New York City that do not get to vote in primary elections, which puts them at a disadvantage in choosing candidates for city-wide office and in City Council races. As of 2015, there were 3,111,786 registered Democrats in the City of New York.[^20] The other parties’ registrations are listed in Table 5.1]].

Politically, there has been a change in how the issue of nonpartisan elections is perceived in New York City since 2003. Populist approaches to government are more in demand today, whether they are ballot referendum issues in California or charter revisions in New York City.

There were not many advocacy groups that favored nonpartisan elections in 2003. Citizen’s Union, a leading good government organization, was in opposition to the proposal. Since 2003, the organization has changed its stance on the issue. In a study released on August 2, 2010, Citizen’s Union explained how nonpartisan special elections (the only nonpartisan elections in New York City) have a higher rate of voter participation than partisan state level special elections.[^21] Figure 5.3]] illustrates that partisan special elections at the state level do not turn out more voters than nonpartisan special elections in City Council races.

It is important to note that special elections in New York City are often not held on Election Day. Special elections can be held in January and February when the weather is not conducive for voter turnout. The results of the Citizen’s Union study shows that nonpartisan city elections outdraw partisan state participation in special elections, but those figures are percentages. The actual number of voters in special elections is quite low, regardless of whether the system is partisan or nonpartisan.

New York City has only special elections to measure the success or failure of nonpartisan elections. The results in the last decade have not shown a great Republican advantage, but it is clear that Democrats have every desire to keep the current system in place.

Source: “Fair Elections for New York: How Public Matching Creates Greater Competition and Voter Choice,” Citizen’s Union Voter Turnout Analysis 2012, November 2012, p.1.

The argument for the New York City Council to consider nonpartisan elections is best explained in a quote from scholar V.O. Key in American State Politics written in 1956, “A belief in the corrective efficacy of competition permeates American political thought as well as other aspects of American life.”[^22]

CALIFORNIA’S TOP-TWO PRIMARY

The American political system has fallen to consumerism, with candidates being autonomous and campaigns not being closely tied to a party platform: “Central here is the development of a new breed of benefit seekers, motivated more by policy concerns than by the selective incentives of jobs, contracts, and the like typical of a political machine,” writes John Aldrich.[^23] It would only stand to reason that if a new paradigm for the primary system were going to be tested on a statewide level, it would be a state like California, where consumerism and imagery are prominent elements of the culture.

As a way to offset the polarized climate of political candidates, the state of California adopted the Top-Two primary system. This was voted into state law in 2010 as a means to make the process more inclusive. The system was first tested in 2012. The new primary layout has critics and supporters, and the results have not been dramatically different or unexpected so far.

Part of understanding the choice to adopt a new primary system comes with understanding the state of California itself. California is a large state that has an economy that could rival some countries. The voter base is diverse; ethnically, professionally, and geographically. The real question before voters when considering a change like this is whether the two parties are fielding candidates who are representative of the electorate. If the Republican and Democratic parties are drifting too far to the outer edges of their ideological framework, then there is reason to consider a large, unrepresented, center.

The rationale behind the Top-Two system is to get to the heart of public sentiment. Instead of both major parties nominating the winners of their closed primaries, this process includes California’s independent voters. The number of California independents was already high enough for legislators to consider this legislation, and those figures only jumped when the state changes to the Top-Two system. Consider the following data from the Public Policy Institute of California, “The percentage of California voters registered as independent or decline-to-state voters as of the June 2014 primary was 21.2 percent—it has more than doubled since the November 1994 gubernatorial election (10.3 percent).”[^24]

The number of independents in the last twenty years had more than doubled. This is important because there is a particular moral question that goes along with changing a voting scheme. To change a system in order to engineer an outcome is not always a democratic principle. To change something in order to make it more inclusive, however, is democratic. The Top-Two system in California is an attempt to make the process more democratic—or at least more participatory.

Are more people voting in California since the inception of the Top-Two system? According to the state’s statistics, more people are voting now than just before the change, but the change is not significant. There are more independents voting since the inception of the California Top-Two system, Democratic and Republicans have not participated more.[^25]

The change in voters, the upswing, is not significant enough to make the argument that a Top-Two system is a cure for voter apathy. It does, however, show that voters were not dissuaded or turned off by the new system.

Changes in the electoral system are not the kind of change that generates a high-pitched enthusiasm. This is not voting in a time of war or a presidential race. This is the result of a change in the electoral process, which may eventually bear fruit in the way of voter turnout.

Critique of California’s Top-Two Primary System

California, it has often been said, could be divided into two states due to its size and population. As for voting preferences, it can be progressive or conservative statewide, having elected both Ronald Reagan and Jerry Brown governor in succession.

Would one party or persuasion benefit more from a Top-Two system in California? Harold Meyerson of the Washington Post explains that parties that field multiple candidates are actually at a disadvantage:

Precisely because California is so heavily Democratic, it’s often the case that more Democrats than Republicans will run for open seats. For that very reason, though, the process tends to give the advantage to Republicans, though the party’s relentlessly falling registration figures make clear that most Californians wish to steer clear of the party and its standard-bearers.[^26]

As Meyerson explains, the state of California, despite a history of producing known conservatives, has grown more Democratic. It is almost a certain Democratic lock in presidential races, having not gone to the Republican Party since 1988. California has also routinely elects progressives to the U.S. Senate. Meyerson sees this as a disadvantage in a Top-Two system; an opposite effect of the phrase “too big to fail”. In this case, the Republicans could tighten their smaller party and play off of the split votes. Whether that small party advantage is real is still a little unclear. Another way to look at this is that party leaders now have an important role to play; they have to work to see that fewer of their members seek office at the same time. It is a way to make leadership roles in parties more relevant.

The results of the Top-Two primary are still very new and this makes it difficult to gauge if the Top-Two system is accomplishing what voters expected when they voted for it. Moderates have not taken over the electoral process, however, as California still has passionate voters on all sides.[^27]

California voters, however, did not intend to make the entire state centrist in adopting this plan. Instead, the intent of the Top-Two system was to give candidates in the center of the spectrum a chance, according to Jamie Fuller:

Proposition 14, which legislated the election change in June 2012, was mostly focused on giving moderates a chance to get elected in state legislatures. Even if California managed to elect more moderates to Congress, it wouldn’t do much but change the composition of their delegation. Making the entire legislative branch bend to the will of their ballot measure was a bit too much to ask.[^28]

The adoption of the Top-Two primary may have less to do with pulling in state politics from the fringes and more to do with getting the explosion of independent voters into the process earlier. California voters in 2014 identified as “Middle of the Road,” by 39 percent, 28 percent identifying as liberal, and 33 percent identifying as conservative.[^29]

California Independents and Political Groups

California independent voters have not shown signs of a particular political allegiance, and what is more, they tend to eschew political organizations. The Top-Two system is designed to draw voters who are reluctant to join political parties and commit to affiliations. Critics of the Top-Two see it as the responsibility of parties to draw the independent voters in by offering policy positions that appeal to them. But even if independents are in agreement with particular parties on issues, they may still avoid joining a party—and thus, not be able to participate in a closed primary. In theory, parties would seek their own electoral success by taking stances that represent voters. That has not occurred as much as it once did, and independents are not being drawn in to the point where they are able to vote in primaries. We saw in an earlier figure that many independents are ideological. There is no conclusive evidence that independents are definitive centrist voters, they simply see their participation in this democracy as not having to go through parties.

This aversion to commit to political institutions goes beyond parties. Adding both political parties and one major grassroots organization to a poll, independents see many grassroots organizations as unfavorable as the parties themselves. The Public Policy Institute of California conducted research on how Californians feel about both parties and the Tea Party. The Democratic Party was considered favorable by 38 percent. The Republicans got 25 percent favorables, and the Tea Party was at 32 percent.[^30] In all fairness, non-major parties or organizations can experience waves of popularity, as the Tea Party has shown. Over the long haul, however, it is more of a challenge for the major parties to be seen favorably.

The California Top-Two System and Fundraising

The previous chapter explored the problems with parties and campaign financing. Because candidates are often left to their own devices when it comes to fundraising, big donors are often influential in the political process. What does a Top-Two system mean to raising money in California political campaigns? The Top-Two system makes managing campaigns more complex, because it could often involve a general election where two members of the same party are pitted against each other. Candidates that may have shared donors when closed primaries were finished will no longer do that. Business interests may now throw money behind a moderate Democrat than they would a likely losing Republican, for example.[^31]

Consultants, who have grown into a cottage industry with the old primary system, now have to operate differently. Steering campaigns is more complex because there are more people to woo when it comes to elections. A potential problem could be that many campaigns will essentially have to run against the same challenger twice. If two Democrats compete in the Top-Two primary and win, those same two candidates are facing each other in the general election. It would likely resemble one long campaign. That would not be enough to view the Top-Two as a bad idea, however.[^32]

Recent California Races: A Snapshot

What do California races resemble after the adoption of the Top-Two primary system? We can start with congressional races in California in 2012. This was the first major election cycle since the new system was employed. Here are eight congressional election results. Of the eight, five incumbents won the primary in the Top-Two system, but lost the general election; all five of them went from Republican seats to Democratic.

These races are telling in that incumbents are not as protected in a Top-Two system. The choices that voters are getting are more attractive than what were the results in the closed primaries. It does not suggest that this is going to be the way electoral results will be similar going forward, but these results show competitiveness. Dan Lundgren was a serious player in the Republican Party and a political figure once thought to be vice-presidential timber in GOP circles. He lost his seat in 2012. This is precisely what proponents of the Top-Two primary have suggested in that general elections outweigh primaries, and should therefore have the most sought after candidates.

California Races in 2014

One of the more watched races in 2014 was between incumbent Rep. Mike Honda and challenger Ro Khanna, both Democrats. In the Top-Two primary, they finished first and second respectively, with Honda garnering 49 percent of the vote and Khanna finishing with 27 percent.

In the general election in 2014, Representative Mike Honda defeated his fellow Democrat Ro Khanna, but the results showed a very competitive election (see Figure 5.4]]).

What a close election like this means is that every vote counts. Honda won by 4,708 votes, by no means a landslide in the district where he has been the representative since 2001. Honda won both Alameda and Santa Clara counties, but only by small margins. The race between the two Democrats was a heated one, and this raises an interesting point; with two members of the same party facing each other in a general election, there are fault lines in the party agenda that get exposed. Mollie Reilly, writing for The Huffington Post wrote “The contest between the two Democrats was one of this cycle’s most heated. Khanna billed himself as a tech-savvy alternative to Honda, a seven-term congressman, while the veteran Honda touted his commitment to his district’s working families.”[^33]

In California’s 4th congressional district, incumbent Republican Rep. Tom McClintock was challenged by West Point graduate Art Moore in the primary. Both McClintock and Moore faced each other in the general election. Like the race in the 17th district with Honda and Khanna, McClintock won the primary by a large margin, but then ran the risk of having Democratic voters throw their support behind Moore.

The election in California’s 4th congressional district between incumbent Tom McClintock and Art Moore was not as close as the Honda-Khanna race, with McClintock taking 60 percent of the vote.

In the case of McClintock vs. Moore, this race was not the closest or most competitive that McClintock has ever experiences. The Top-Two primary does not guarantee anything other than a better representation of candidates in relation to the district. Moore’s 40 percent was less than Democrat Charlie Brown’s 49.7 percent in 2008.

California Top-Two primary is a remedy, although not a solution, to capturing the party-less voter. Unless the political system embraces a responsible party system where parties take control of the process (with emphasis on financing campaigns), the Top-Two primary is quite useful. What can we make the California Top-Two primary, often referred to as the “Jungle Primary”? As the architect of the legislation that made the new system, former Lt. Governor of California Abel Maldonado has no regrets about the results of a jungle primary that ultimately did not wind up in his favor:

I’m very proud,” Maldonado told the Chronicle in an interview Thursday, just hours after he announced his decision to withdraw from the 2014 governor’s race at Santa Maria City Hall. “I really believe that when you give people a choice of whomever they want, we get (candidates) who are reasonable, open minded and pragmatic.[^34]

Whatever political system is developed, it is important that it is not rolled out in order to achieve particular results. The Top-Two primary system gets support from both sides. It was voted in on a landslide, but the people of California understand that statewide elections need to be a better representation of statewide sentiment.

We know that in even the most partisan states, there is a political center, and depending on that center is measured, it can often outweigh the fringes. California has taken a step to recognizing the large number of independent voters and the results are that there is more competitiveness which is beneficial to a democracy. In figure 5.5, we can see that the general election race between incumbent Republican Tom McClintock and Republican challenger Art Moore was, at the very least, more competitive than it may have if McClintock had faced a liberal Democrat.

REDISTRICTING

Another important area of the electorate that is often explored is redistricting. Redistricting, which occurs every ten years, can make districts either more or less competitive. Money in campaigns and district maps are essential to how American politics is steered. There are no greater influences in the political system than geography and the funding of campaigns.

The process of how districts are re-drawn is often controversial and debated at length. There is also the question as to whether redistricting matters in developing reform policy. On the process front, Tolbert, Smith, and Green have explored how voters often express a desire for reforming the process of redistricting, yet they do not always vote for that type of reform.[^35] Using Ohio and California as backdrops, they set out to explain why redistricting reform polled so well among voters in those two states and yet did so poorly at the ballot box. Both states had reforms as referendum items on their ballots in November of 2005.

Earlier in this chapter, it was discussed how a proposal to reform the primary system polled well in New York City, only to be soundly defeated at the ballot box. Tolbert, Smith, and Green examined Ohio and California and focused on two potential reasons for this kind of disconnect. For one, they found that voters may simply be averse to changing their system. This tendency to back away from real change has been mentioned in this research as well. Americans tend to move slowly when it comes to changing institutional frameworks. Caroline J. Tolbert, Daniel A. Smith, and John C. Green explain this aversion:

Institutional change is not easy. Scholars have found that alterations made to political institutions regulating electoral rules are relatively rare occurrences. One reason that institutional change occurs infrequently is that it is inherently risky for elites, especially for those who are (or at least perceive themselves to be) winners under the status quo.[^36]

In the case of Ohio’s Issue 4 or California’s Proposition 77, the public showed support of revamping the redistricting process. Redistricting, in most states, occurs through the state legislature. This obviously makes the process quite political. The majority party, if a party has a legislative advantage, can keep many of their seats safely protected from too much competitive opposition. What voters may feel skittish about is the protection that incumbents enjoy with legislative redistricting. The process is highly political. There is also the added notion of how certain elections near the ten-year mark take on a heightened significance. In New York State, there was a big push to keep GOP state senate seats safe (and make gains wherever possible) in order to control the redistricting process. Certain elections have greater significance because having a majority when districts are re-drawn is important. Thus, redistricting can cause elections at the end of a decade to be more critical. Certainly, some elections carry more heft than others due to the offices that are at stake, but redistricting may cause added political activity on the part of incumbents in order to protect their place in office.

The Ohio and California proposals asked voters if they would prefer an independent commission to be part of the process, hence, de-politicizing the process. Polls indicated great support for this; 3 to 1 support for the California proposal and 70 percent of support throughout the state of Ohio. Yet, these proposals were defeated with neither proposal getting more than 40 percent on Election Day. The reason for this disconnect was not because voters changed their opinions about the legislation.

ARIZONA STATE LEGISLATURE V. ARIZONA INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING COMMISSION (2015)

The solution of independent redistricting panels hit a wall in 2015 when the Supreme Court heard arguments from the Arizona state legislature citing constitutional language in a law that established an independent redistricting panel. The voters of the State of Arizona voted on Proposition 106, an initiative on the ballot in 2000 that would give an independent panel authority to re-draw districts every ten years. Normally, as this research has stated, this process is in the hands of the state legislature. As was also indicated here, the process can get messy with state elections. Those elections that take place closer to the end of a decade begin to take on more importance—which ideally should not be the case since law making is always important. The Arizona voters wanted to address this and elected to develop the Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission (AIRC). What became an issue was the following constitutional language:

The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations . . . .[^37]Art. I, § 4, cl. 1.

There is no mystery as to what the Arizona State Legislature argued; the language states that they would decide the manner of elections. As in the case of Citizens United, the Affordable Care Act, and many other cases, this becomes for some justices about the policy.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, giving the opinion of the Court, explained that while the language alludes to the elected legislature, there was nothing like “initiative and referendum” at the time of the Founders where they could have included it. She goes on to write that there were two questions that the parties (in the case) needed to ask: (1) Does the Arizona State Legislature have standing to contest the constitutionality of Proposition 106? (2) Do the Elections Clause of the U.S. Constitution and 2 U.S.C. §2a(c) permit Arizona’s use of a commission to adopt congressional districts? To these questions, the Court found that “yes” the legislature had standing and that “yes” the Constitution recognizes Arizona’s use of a commission:

We now affirm the District Court’s judgment. We hold, first, the Arizona Legislature, having lost the authority to draw congressional districts, had standing to contest the constitutionality of Proposition 106. Next, we hold that lawmaking power in Arizona includes the initiative process, and that both §2a(c) and the Elections Clause permit use of the AIRC in congressional districting in the same way the Commission is used on districting for Arizona’s own Legislature.[^38]

This interpretation was a stark contrast to what Chief Justice John Roberts offered in dissent:

Just over a century ago, Arizona became the second State in the Union to ratify the Seventeenth Amendment. The Amendment transferred power to choose United States Senators from “the Legislature” of each State, Art. 1, §3, to “the people thereof”. The Amendment resulted from an arduous, decades-long campaign in which reformers across the country worked hard to garner approval from Congress and three-quarters of the States.

What chumps! Didn’t they realize that all they had to do was interpret the constitutional term “the Legislature” to mean “the people”? The Court today performs such a magic trick with the Elections Clause.[^39]

What we see with Roberts’ dissent is that there are always going to be justices that look to the direct meaning of the language, just as there will be those who lean toward the policy. In this case, Ginsburg, like most of the people in Arizona, agreed with the policy.

The approval of Arizona’s Commission now means that these types of independent councils or commissions are constitutional. It means that districts do not have to be contingent on the state of affairs of particular state senate seats. Not every state has to have a commission, so the ability to continue the status quo is always an option.

IT’S ALL ABOUT WINNERS AND LOSERS

Tolbert, Smith, and Green explain that it has to do with the idea of electoral “winners” and “losers.” “Winners and losers” (as labels) describe voters who have been favorably served electorally and those who have not. In the case of the nonpartisan electoral proposal in New York City, for example, the city is heavily Democratic. New York City Democrats have an almost 5-to-1 advantage over registered Republicans. Although voters may feel that eliminating party labels is better than what already exists, they are being served well by the system that exists . . . because they are winners. Voters do not opt to lose more in the future despite the common sense of changing the system.

Scholars have traditionally measured the thoughts and opinions of elected officials on this matter. The winner and losers were often those who won or lost elections. When studying the electorate, however, the winners are those who are happy on Election Day. If there are more winners than losers, the chance of a change taking place when it comes to electoral reform, is almost nonexistent.[^40] Polls may show people’s basic sense of fairness. Voters may see redistricting as the fairest approach to countering incumbent protections. How people vote on these issues, however, differs from their initial sentiment expressed in polls. In the end, voters do not want to be losers, “When faced with uncertain substantive outcomes about how districts might be drawn, many voters in the two states may have disavowed their principled support for the reform measures, opting instead to vote instrumentally to preserve their party’s and their own representational interests,” explain Tolbert, Smith, and Green.[^41]

This theory of “winners and losers” explains a lot about why there is so little reform in areas where the elections are not competitive. New Yorkers may be frustrated with the party system. They may view the closed primary system as yielding extreme candidates. In the end, however, New York City has more than 3 million registered Democrats. This means that most of those voters have liked the results of most citywide elections. In other words, they are “winners.” Even if they think that elections should be more competitive in theory, why would they vote to end their successful run? What might appeal to voters’ sense of fairness and competitiveness does not necessarily trump being represented politically by one’s own party.

Whether electorates vote to change how states re-draw districts or not, the idea of legislatures having all of the power is highly political. Districts have been re-drawn for all kinds of reasons in the past. The first known effort was by Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts. Gerry drew a district as Governor that resembled a salamander. The term gerrymandering is a hybrid of his name and the reptilian description of the district.

Districts have been drawn to assure a basic representational proportion of racial minorities. Coming out of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, there needs to be a proportional amount of minority voters in order to make the potential outcome more diverse. In some cases, minority rights have been protected by redistricting, but because the process is often in the hands of the legislature, it is politicized.

Districts have been drawn for various reasons and political considerations. The area where there is room for reform is in the process of how districts get re-drawn. While various states consider the notion of independent bodies overseeing the process, there come other concerns. Professor Justin Levitt at Loyola Law School has suggested that while committees independent of elected officials come with benefits, there are also some drawbacks, “Potential upsides: though the process will still be political, in the sense that citizen redistricters will need to weigh and balance various conflicting representational values, it is unlikely to be driven by particular politicians’ narrow interests in retaining their seats or punishing their opponents.”[^42]

There may be no way to ensure that a redistricting process will make districts the most competitive and least political. By taking the reins away from incumbent officials, at least to some extent, there is a possibility of fairness.

WHAT DISTRICTS LOOK LIKE

If the redistricting process could be less politicized, what would the criteria be for drawing districts? Other than the population requirements, what would shape a district? There are all kinds of concerns that can influence the shape of a district; economic, racial, or geographic. All districts need to be either re-drawn or considered for re-drawing because of population changes. After ten years, it is possible that a district will have too many or too few people, and thus re-drawing is necessary. New York State took this into account when it developed the New York State Taskforce on Demographic Research and Reapportionment (LATFOR).

In 2011, with the issue of new districts being so controversial among the legislature, a federal court stepped in and decided on a redistricting plan that was quite close to the type of maps that Common Cause had suggested. The Court ruled against proposed plans that would have created certain districts based on ethnicity and returned the focus back to geographic concerns:

For the fourth decade in a row, the creation of New York’s congressional districts has landed in the federal courts. This time it might stay there, and that can only be for the good.

Unlike the three previous redistrictings, in which legislators compromised on their own maps at the last possible moment and forestalled implementation of the courts’ drawings, there appears to be little chance to untangle this year’s outlandish partisanship. The federal courts stepped into the process after it was clear the State Legislature’s task force, charged with drawing congressional districts based on the 2010 Census, could not produce maps both the Republican-led Senate and Democratic-led Assembly could agree on.[^43]

Redistricting, as a practice, is not necessarily a corrupt element of politics that requires fixing. There is room, however, to make the process more independent.

THE CASE FOR INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING COMMISSIONS

There are various types of “independent” commissions when it comes to a state’s redistricting process. The word independent in this case refers to the idea that the process would be out of the hands of the legislature. As per Baker v. Carr (1962) the federal government can order states to redistrict in a manner that creates balance.[^44] New York State, in 2011, had a federal court oversee the redistricting process because the legislature and the governor’s office could not come to terms on the best way to draw districts. If legislatures cannot come to agreements about how to best draw districts, it may be a process better served by a commission. As it stands, states determine what process they wish to use, so long as they follow certain guidelines as per the Voting Rights Act.

Most states have a legislative process when it comes to redistricting. States that use a state legislative process are Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. There are not many things that those states have in common, but how they draw their districts is one of them.[^45]

Some states use a combination of a legislative process and a commission. These are the states that have a combination of two entities in the process:

•Connecticut

•Indiana

•Mississippi

•Ohio

•Oklahoma

•Oregon

•Texas

No states have a strictly independent commission as their process. The ones that use commissions combine them with legislatures. To have an independent commission without some legislative input would cause constitutional problems.

States may be wise to consider a commission since the process is not only politicized at the legislative level, but it could also fall to ideology should it fall to a judge. As Michael P. McDonald explains, the state of Illinois faced that same problem in 2001 and 2002:

The potential for court action may structure any redistricting plan or compromise. In 2001–02, Illinois faced not only a divided state government, but also the loss of a congressional seat due to apportionment. Expectations were high that if legislative action failed, a Republican-friendly federal court would do congressional redistricting. Rather than risk court action and the adoption of a Republican map, the Democratically controlled state House passed a bipartisan incumbent protection plan negotiated between United States Representatives Hastert (R) and Lipinski (D) that made a concession to Republicans by collapsing a Democratic seat.[^46]

States that use commissions have various types of tie-breaker scenarios.

If there are shared values across all states when it comes to redistricting, there may be room to develop a set of standards. As it stands, however, states are unique in their process and in their criteria for drawing districts. The unique aspect is not something that endangers political participation, but the politicized nature of the process does make it more difficult for challengers.

Without redistricting, candidates emerged reflecting the unchanging pulse of the unchanged districts.[^47] With districts being re-drawn every ten years, there is a greater chance for a wider variety of candidates, as long as the districts are not drawn to assure the opposite effect. If the shape and boundaries of districts affects the kind of entrants to our political process, this issue is vital to participatory democracy.

As for “independent” commissions, it would be fanciful to assume any decision-making commissions would not reflect some semblance of politics. The concern is minimal political interference, however, out not get in the way of creating a better system. With all social and public policy, there can be elements of partisanship. If a system is so politicized that it discourages activity, however, the prudent step would be to act.

THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE: REVISITED

Perhaps the most useful and practical idea to making the political process more universal is to alter the Electoral College system, thus making more regions and districts more competitive. The importance of examining an alternative to the Electoral College system as it is now is that it could make parties more visible and districts more of a focus of candidates. Changing how the country looks at the Electoral College, along with campaign finance reform, is the most significant way to flush out the stagnant political system, especially when it comes to parties. The Red State-Blue State fascination is great for political scientists, but it makes most of the country completely irrelevant in presidential elections. One of the ways this can be reformed is through what is often referred to as a “district plan.”

The district plan, most recently debated in the state of Pennsylvania, means that each district would count as a single electoral vote in a presidential election. Academics have bandied about the idea for decades, but an idea like this may have important effects locally as well.

In an arrangement where presidential candidates are trying to win districts in all states, voters feel a greater sense of political efficacy. It is not uncommon for districts to vote for presidential candidates in one party and re-elect someone from the opposition party. With national candidates visiting these districts, there could be a new energy in the electorate. A comfortable district for a member of Congress may grow less comfortable with a popular national candidate passing through. The results of this may be that these districts would be “in play” on the local level as well as on the national level.

When former Vermont Governor Howard Dean was helming the Democratic National Committee, he used what he called a “50-State Strategy” to win the House of Representatives. The idea here was for the party to make a sincere effort in all places, not just in the areas that were good bets. This was a strategy that not all political actors supported, namely former Illinois congressman Rahm Emmanuel.

An Electoral College system that allows for each district’s one vote to count, puts more of the country “in play” in presidential contests. Some states, such as Maine and Nebraska use a congressional district plan where each district counts as one vote. The candidate that wins the popular vote of the entire state then gets two at large votes.[^48] This idea was endorsed by the APSA’s Committee for Party Reform and its executive director John Kenneth White:

Such a system would not only meet the public test of “fairness,” but would nationalize campaigns and encourage presidential nominee to campaign alongside congressional candidates. Permitting presidential candidates to win electors from congressional districts would encourage more national campaigning. Some recent examples make the case. In 1988, the Dukakis campaign left Florida at the end of September. Under my “October scenario,” Dukakis would have won electors from Miami and some surrounding areas, and would have been encourages to continue campaigning in the Sunshine State—especially the “swing” congressional districts.[^49]

White uses the state of Florida as an example because Dukakis could have kept campaigning in the state and picked up a few electoral votes. Had this system been in place, Dukakis also would have picked up a great deal of support in districts across California. Dukakis was the last Democrat to lose the state of California in a presidential race, and most of that is because he lost Orange County by so many votes that he lost the entire state.

This idea may get some traction in the coming years as it has been seriously considered in Pennsylvania. A plan like this would require heavy bipartisan support wherever it is adopted. Just as redistricting and nonpartisan election schemes have been popular in polls only to get rejected in Election Day, an idea like reforming the Electoral College would face that same fate. The winners, those who see their party victorious most of the time, could be slow to change a system that has rewarded them. The Pennsylvania Republicans who pushed for this plan were frustrated that their state’s 20 electoral votes were becoming safe bets for the Democratic Party in national elections. The “losers” in this case wanted change. The Democratic Party in Pennsylvania was fine with the system the way it is.

In 2008, John McCain won 49 of 67 counties in Pennsylvania. Counties are not congressional districts, but that says a lot about the winner-take-all system if a handful of populated counties can hand a candidate an entire state’s electoral votes. Figure 5.6]] shows how that trend continued for Republican nominee Mitt Romney in 2012 (the GOP won counties highlighted in red or light red).

Basically, Mitt Romney won most of the state of Pennsylvania, but lost the entire state to President Barack Obama because certain areas are more populated than others. Looking at a district map, it would appear that the state was more for the Republican candidate than the Democratic candidate. Figure 5.7]] shows a map of Florida following the 2012 presidential election. The results are similar to that of Pennsylvania, which only solidifies the argument that winning most of a state geographically does not always have a positive pay-off.

From a political science standpoint, a district plan would mean that states would give a truer representation of their politics. States would still be relevant in this process, as there would be two remaining votes that go to the state’s winner. Florida is a very sought after swing state. One of its districts, Manatee County, is one of those swing districts. In 1988, the district gave 65 percent of its votes to then-Vice President George H.W. Bush, with 35 percent going to Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. In 2000, the results we close, with George W. Bush capturing just north of 50 percent, and then-Vice President Al Gore getting just under 50 percent. The same was true when Senator John McCain faced off with Senator Barack Obama. The larger point is that this is a district that can go either way, which is not characteristic of most districts. Districts like this would matter a lot more in a district plan. As of now, however, they are blended into a state that is often theoretically committed to a party way in advance.

Florida is an interesting test population because the state is so competitive. In 2004, there were 8 districts decided my 10 percentage points or less. President George W. Bush won one district that was represented by a Democratic member of Congress (Florida’s 2nd) and Senator John Kerry won one district represented by a Republican member of Congress (Florida’s 22nd). If we look at a “safe state” for one of the two parties, we see that there is still room for candidates to gain ground. The state of Texas was safe ground for President George W. Bush in 2004. He won all but seven congressional districts in his home state. But those seven electoral votes would have helped Senator John Kerry at the end of the election. If swing states like Ohio, Florida, and Pennsylvania are so competitive, these added districts would make these races more competitive. It also means that part of the country, such as the El Paso section of Texas, might get more attention in major elections. El Paso was won by John Kerry, who got 56.11 percent of the vote. If every district mattered, El Paso would have seen both campaigns coming to town to win votes.

THE ADVANTAGE OF LESS RED TAPE

Another advantage to a district plan is that if the country liked this idea of changing the electoral process, it would require less constitutional tinkering. Switching to a popular vote, for example, would require there to be some changes to the constitution. A district plan, however, could be addressed at the state level, the same way it has been in Maine and Nebraska. Those two states have made the district plan work, and they have not shown it to be a dramatic change from the general feeling of the states politically. Maine tends to lean more Democratic in presidential elections, and Nebraska favors Republicans. Because of the district plan, however, districts are able to be more visible in presidential elections because their electoral votes count.

The importance of studying the district plan is less about what the results might be and more about how campaigns would change. This fits into this research about reform and voter participation. If national campaigns start to see these districts as more relevant, the voters in these districts could be more prone to get involved. Despite swing states like Florida and Ohio, there are not many areas where voters of either party would see their vote as having too much weight. In a district system, however, voters have more influence in their respective districts.

Looking at data from 1952 to 2012, most people elected president have won the popular vote, and they won the electoral vote. People often to point to the election of 1960, and how Richard Nixon did well in the popular vote, but lost the Electoral College. In 2000, George W. Bush lost the popular vote, but won the Electoral College. The voting public bridles at the notion that the popular vote is somehow discounted in favor of a system that many of them do not really understand. They feel that the popular is their true reflection, even though the Electoral College was designed to keep supermajorities from dominating the rest of the country. What should make voters more concerned is how often people are elected president without winning the majority of districts. There are 435 districts in the United States, and to be elected president, one only needs to win the popular vote in states that have the most districts. They do not, however, need to win the most districts. This should cause more of a stir in the populace, but it does not. It likely does not bother many voters because they simply accept the current system.

![[Stasi_Table-5.8_fmt.png]]

In 1952, Dwight Eisenhower won more than 80 percent of electoral districts. He received a little more than 50 percent of the popular vote. In other words, this election makes sense mathematically. In 1984, Reagan picked almost all districts in the United States, and close to 60 percent of the vote. That was a landslide election. The 2012 election, however, was a little different. President Barack Obama won a majority of the electoral votes, meaning that he won the states that delivered the most districts. He won the popular vote, although it was close. Republican challenger Mitt Romney, however, won the most districts.[^50]

The House of Representatives is known as the “people’s House,” and it consists of these 435 districts. Would giving the process back to the districts make national elections more democratic? It would require no constitutional tinkering and it would make more districts in the country relevant. There are more voters clustered into smaller pockets of the country, thus making districts around the country that are less populated less relevant in a winner-take-all system.

A district plan or a district system is often debated on a few fronts regarding feasibility. At first glance, the idea that there would be 435 results as opposed to 50 election results to watch seems more complex. It would appear that a system like that would be ripe for a greater number of contested results. The current system of winner-take-all has not really made our process less controversial, especially after the 2000 election.[^51] Even if a district system, or district plan, were to create a heightened environment of close and contested elections, it would not necessarily be any more complicated than the current system. Voter turnout has been very high in recent elections. The competitive race between Vice President Al Gore and Governor George W. Bush caused for a high voter turnout. The anguish over the first Bush term, namely the Iraq War, was cause for a high voter turnout as well. The election and re-election of the country’s first African American president was cause for our highest voter turnout in history. These elections were historic and they are not the norm. A district system would certainly be manageable in regard to voter turnout, since people would be voting in the same places where they vote currently. Congressional districts need to be just as prepared during presidential elections as they are in more local elections.

POLITICAL STRATEGY CHANGES WITH A DISTRICT SYSTEM

The point in focusing on a plan like a district system is that with increased visibility because of national elections, there stands the chance that voters would be more compelled to participate in congressional and local elections as well. The current system has presidential candidates from both parties competing in fewer states. Robert C. Turner explains that the original intent of the electoral system that we have today may not be carrying out original purpose:

One of the main arguments in favor of the Electoral College over the direct election alternative is that it encourages candidates to build broad geographical coalitions because it is the distribution of votes rather than the number of votes that matters. However, the practice of presidential campaigns suggests otherwise. The winner-take-all system rewards presidential campaigns that devote resources and tailor their campaign message to attract voters in the battleground states where they have a reasonable chance of winning, and write off “safe” states where one candidate has a significant lead in public support (Mayer et al. 2002; Shaw 1999; Longley and Peirce 1996).[^52]

The fact that the political nomenclature has changed to where we describe states as red or blue or purple is enough to make one think that the current system has become too gamed by both sides. If the electoral system that we have now were developed in part to allow the small states to have more relevance, there is now reason to doubt that. Wyoming has traditionally voted Republican, and Republican candidates can campaign less in that state. The same is true for Democrats in states like Delaware, where they are a reliable vote for the Democratic Party candidate.

The problem with the winner-take-all system is that campaigns become hyper-focused on a select group of states. They focus on the ones that matter to them winning. It means that a presidential campaign becomes more about winning than about governing. If a candidate runs for president and wins, how familiar is he with the states that he has not visited? How concerned will the new president be about states that do not have electoral relevancy?

Another issue that the winner-take-all system tends to be discouraging to voters in states that are not swing states. Do New Yorkers feel that their votes in presidential elections are really necessary? The Democratic Party can count on New York rather easily. Republicans and Democrats from New York both know that the winner-take-all system makes their state a foregone conclusion. The same might be said for Mississippi or Utah.[^53]

Research indicates that campaigns look at an electoral map and formulate two conclusions. They first look to see how many electoral votes a state would render (thus making smaller states less relevant). Second, they look at what it would take to win the state.[^54] In a district system, candidates would likely still weigh whether traveling to a district is worth the effort. There is no electoral system that guarantees that all areas of the country would be equally important in the eyes of political candidates on a national level. In this case, however, neighboring districts might be in play. If we look at the House of Representatives, we see it as the larger of the two houses. The House of Representatives is often more polarized because it is a clearer reflection of the political sentiments on a local level. A district system would make it easier from a political science perspective to gauge the political sentiments in different parts of the country. In a winner-take-all system, those districts that do not reflect the majority feelings of the state tend to get camouflaged into a larger, state election. With the exception of recent elections, namely Florida in 2000 and Ohio in 2004, close statewide elections are not the norm. It is common for voters to feel less efficacy in the process.[^55] A district system could change that.

If the House of Representatives is the people’ house, a district system would better resemble a people’s election. Presidents give the state of the union address in the larger house chamber, which hosts the House of Representatives because it is the larger of the two chambers. It could also be symbolic, however, to have the president address the country in the people’s House.

Candidates would still weigh the value of each district, and many of those districts would get less attention due to their predictable political nature. What the district system would do, however, is spread the campaigns of the two parties out across the country. El Paso, Texas, along with parts of its southern rim, is heavily Democratic. National campaigns may have little interest in campaigning and advertising in parts of a state that will not make the state winnable for them.

Campaigns measure strategy based on time and money. How much time and money it would take to win a state plays a large role in whether a campaign will make the effort to win there. As the novelist Chuck Palahniuk has written, “On a long enough time-line, the life expectancy for everyone drops to zero.” On a long enough time-line, a campaign could whittle away at a state’s electorate and try to win, but often campaigns decide in advance to either make an effort in a particular state or not.

It does not mean that a presidential campaign has no footprint in a particular state. Both major parties exist on a state level in every state, and to some degree, they push for their presidential candidate. An actual centralized campaign, however, does not have the resources to be a present in all fifty states in effort to win all fifty. There is a possibility that in a district system, with districts now being more important in presidential elections, that state and local party representatives would have a more vital role in a national campaign. It could spur more party activity at the local level. It could cause parties to look beyond their small primary elections and try harder to influence independent voters to come over to their side.

What does this mean to local politics, parties, and political reform? By putting more of the country in play during a critical election, more of the issues facing Americans come to the forefront. The Democratic candidate in a presidential election could just as easily not be concerned with those districts in Texas, and the needs of the people there. In a district system, however, there stands a chance that both candidates may have traveled through and there is an added sense of relevance as more of the country receives more attention.

The previous chapters discussed the rise of independent voters and why so many newer, younger Americans are averse to joining parties. Putting districts in play on a national level would give local parties more visibility. This is not to suggest that a district system would save the party system. In fact, in Nebraska and Maine, the two states with district systems, there is a level of independent voters that is comparable to the rest of the country. Forty-seven percent of Maine’s voters were in independent as of 2013. Nebraska is 20 percent independent.[^56] Parties in various parts of the country will have a chance to grow and build greater coalitions. If a district system was used nationwide, there could be more of a possibility of a national effort for parties to reunite.

THIRD PARTIES AND THE DISTRICT PLAN

Third parties have gotten little traction nationally due in part to the Electoral College system. Since many third parties are often focused on a single issue, it is interesting to see how a district system would affect parties (both mainstream and third parties). Some supporters of the current system view it a benefit that it stymies third party interference.[^57] Turner sees a district system as not much better for third parties.[^58]

Third parties, such as the Green Party or the independent candidacy of Ross Perot in 1992 (not so much in 1996) have affected national elections. The issue of the federal deficit was brought to the forefront due, in part, to third parties. Third parties have fought for particular areas of political reform throughout history. In a district system, whatever importance third parties bring to the discussion would likely not be greatly affected in either system. The one potential problem for third parties would be that instead of getting on the ballot in each state, they would need to be visible in all 435 districts. Being visible in all districts is easy for the two major parties, but for a party, such as a Right to Life Party, it would be more difficult to have people on the ground in all districts. It is less of a challenge for a party like that to be active in fifty states.

Turner feels that third parties in a district system would have less of an effect on national elections, “Moreover, the district system actually strengthens the two-party system by diminishing the impact of splinter third parties on the distribution of statewide electoral college voters. In the 2000 election, Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate whose supports consisted mostly of liberal Democrats, siphoned enough votes to deny Gore a plurality and this give Bush all of Florida’s twenty five electoral college votes.”[^59] One point that Turner omits, however, is how mainstream parties would react to third parties in a district system. The idea that third party candidates can affect swing districts more than they can affect swing states could grow into an issue, but the democratic process allows for people to run for office that are not necessarily part of the two party system.

CONCLUSION

E.J. Dionne made an important point about an honest, shared history as a vehicle to fixing polarization, but this chapter is a focus on systematic reform. While critics like Dionne may suggest that these are fixes that only touch the surface, they may be more realistic than changing the American philosophical narrative. A district plan is one way to make more districts relevant on a national scale. Although the House of Representatives is designed to be that body which is most closely linked to the people, modern politics suggests that people identify more with national politics.

This is the kind of reform that could come with little official constitutional tinkering, especially in wake of the Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission decision. The potential winners and losers are also not predictable, as is proven in states like Maine and Nebraska. Although Maine generally tilts to the left in typical New England fashion, and Nebraska follows most bread basket states to the right, they are both states with winnable sections for both major parties. Within the idea of making presidential campaigns more competitive and interesting comes the potential of parties being more vital in various parts of the country. This brings with it the potential of making districts around the country more competitive, according to John Kenneth White, “The change I propose can be accomplished without amending the U.S. Constitution—a simple alternation of state law would do. By targeting congressional districts and media markets, candidate would be encouraged to campaign alongside their congressional counterparts. This is quite different from the deliberate distancing from political parties that modern presidential politicking encourages.”[^60]

Campaign finance reform is another way to peel away barriers that make the process less inclusive. Nonpartisan elections would most likely not be useful nationally, but they can be utilized as a means to make local politics more competitive. What all of these ideas lead to is a hope that the two-party system can be revived as an institution in which voters show confidence.

Post Industrial America and Parties

Parties have undoubtedly have grown weaker in the latter half of the twentieth century. All one needs to do is look at the leading candidates for president in both parties, and it does not solely pertain to the 2016 election. This will be a continuing trend until parties get more involved and become actively engaged. If a Clinton, Trump, or whoever wins the presidency in any election ever decided not to take control of their party, how would that effect public policy? It just might make Congress more relevant, but that is not a realistic expectation. Presidents lead parties, and that does not make sense, since their shelf life is—at the most—eight years.

Weakness here is describing the lack of membership in party politics and the lack of significant presence that parties have shown in campaigns. There is clearly a difference between what the general voting public views as strong parties and what particular academics studying parties see as strong parties. The 1950 report from the American Political Science Association, Toward a More Responsible Two-Party System, describes what the problem with parties was . . . in 1950:

1.The Federal Basis. The two parties are organized on a federal basis. The national and state party organizations are largely independent of one another, without appreciable common approach to problems of party policy or strategy. The real issue is not over the federal form if organization but over the right balance of forces within this type of organization. A corollary of the kind of federalism now expressed in the party system is an excessive measure of internal separatism.

2.The Location of Leadership. Party organization does not vest leadership of the party as a whole in either a single person or a committee. There is at present no central figure or organ which could claim authority to take up party problems.

3.The Ambiguity of Membership. No understandings of rules or criteria exist with respect to membership in a party. Those who suggest that elections should deal with personalities but not with programs suggest at the same time that party membership should mean nothing all.[^1]

The report is an exploration of what a responsible system would look like with the two major parties in the United States. It is also a good example of what “strong parties” means to those who want to see a more ideologically rigid system. What is important about the above quote is that it illustrates the problem with parties, even as far back as 1950. If there is no discernable quality to what gives a party identity, it may be more difficult to draw wide-spread support, which is a more useful definition of a strong party.

Martin Wattenberg explains that although the conventional wisdom suggests that a decline in party membership is associated with dissatisfaction, there is evidence that this may not necessarily be true all the time.[^2] The decline in party partisanship does not necessarily mesh with the level of cynicism of respondents. Wattenberg concludes this observation by suggesting that cynicism and a lack of partisanship are not necessarily connected all the time:

Thus there is no evidence in this panel to suggest that the rise in cynicism had been responsible for the decline of party identification. It must be concluded that the growth of cynicism and nonpartisanship are roughly parallel trends that have little relationship to each other in both a static and a dynamic sense.[^3]

Wattenberg’s Decline of American Political Parties was first printed in 1984, and then again a number of times until 1999. This is a significant time period because even though President Clinton and the GOP Congress were working together, cynicism had grown among the middle 1990s. A 2011 Pew Research Poll is evidence of this cynicism, “But by roughly two-to-one (63% to 30%), most Americans think Republicans and Democrats will end up bickering and opposing one another more than usual this year. This is a far more pessimistic view than the public expressed two years ago.”[^4]

If cynicism is not why party membership is slowing, then there must be a different reason. Although cynicism may not count for most of the lack of party registration, it is fair to say that younger voters have a lost sense of confidence in the political system as evidenced by the increase on those registering as independents. This is not uncommon in times of war or prolonged economic sluggishness. What are traditional academics not seeing?

Wattenberg, Austin Ranney, E.E. Schattschneider, and other scholars point to the middle twentieth century as the starting point for the decline of party influence. The American economy was growing exponentially, yet parties were at a peak—meaning that they were about to decline. American culture changes following World War II, and the hypothesis here is that this change is important when exploring the decline of political parties.

CHANGES FOR PARTIES IN GOVERNMENT AND PARTIES IN THE ELECTORATE

The changes in the climate for parties in government are well documented. This polarization is a result of an absence of non-party affiliated voters. Despite the evidence that independent voters are often ideological, the party splits would be less wide with more voters as active participants in the early stages of elections.

There is a relationship between the influence that voters have and the level of participation in which they engage.[^5] William R. Schonfeld explains that although there is a relationship between influence and participation, there is a way to participate and still have little influence, “By implication, if there is something special about participation in democracies, it must be that citizens actually exert some real control. But we cannot assume that such influence automatically flows from participatory activities.”[^6] After all, it was Jean-Jacques Rousseau who wrote “The English people believe itself to be free, it is gravely mistaken; it is free only during the election of Members of Parliament; as soon as the Members are elected, the people is enslaved; it is nothing.” Maybe Americans have the political system that they allow, and the one that makes them feel democratic.

Even if we accept what Rousseau was suggesting, and that voting was the complete actualization of democratic participation, it is still a starting point. It is still a place where the process begins. In a modern sense, the expanding number of Americans who do not participate in primary elections (and even general elections) is cause to focus on that first step. Of course, policy makers will have more influence over law making than the average citizen; to suggest otherwise would be foolish. The first step of the democratic process needs to be a robust participation rate brought on by a system that is accessible.

In the modern sense, American politics is about spectacle. This was not always the case. Sure, national elections and the advent of television increased the sense of spectacle, but the electorate today expects and experiences an even heightened version of spectacle. The 2016 Republican and Democratic primaries have created more of a sense of spectacle than ever before. This is an added aspect to our politics for which, in years past, our system did not have to contend. The increased element of showmanship, and faux journalism, has made the process appear more divided than ever before.

Everett Carll Ladd explored partisanship through a lens of four different periods in American history; revolutionary, post-revolutionary, Industrial, and post-Industrial. This is a very over-looked reason as to why our politics today has grown so polarized and why parties are much weaker. Post-industrial America is rife with economic anxiety. As the country experienced a revolution, a reconstruction, an industrialized golden age, and a post-industrial period where the rest of the world caught up, the expectations that Americans had for parties and government changed. Why do Americans join parties with less frequency than ever before in modern political times? There is clearly a socio-economic change that has contributed to this phenomenon. As Robert Putnam has posited that Americans join organizations less than they once did, we can also put political parties in that same category. Americans behaved differently in the past. They looked at community-based organizations differently. Such change can also leak into how Americans view politics. A big contributor to weaker parties is simply a changing America. If America drifts from institutions, and parties are institutions, there is going to be a drift away from party politics.

The current climate sees more voters moving away from political parties. There is a link to the socio-economic changes that came with a new century, and parties took some of the brunt of that change. For Schonfeld, a true democracy has to include competitive elections:

to have a “real” democracy, there must be a competitive party system—that is, elections involving competitive elites. But polities and social units either have or do not have competitive, periodic elections—this is a category rather than a dimension. By conceiving of democratic participation in the way I have suggested, the confusion between categorical and dimensional theorizing can be avoided.[^7]

What this research has been targeting is the notion that competitive elections are the best way to gauge what the public is feeling when it comes to policy. The current system, with such polarization, is not making the process more inclusive.

Whether we agree or not that societal change has caused a shift in party politics, we know that participation in the democratic process has weakened. William J. Crotty explains that Ladd was on to something in breaking down political change into these four periods, “The adeptly drawn economic sketches, in particular, add a useful dimension to understanding the forces acting upon the parties.”[^8]

Ladd’s sketches are not perfect. There is no real science to understanding every nuance of sociology; and understanding how Americans react to stimuli is part science and part sociology. Millions of voters behave the way they do for a host of reasons; some of them are current and some are part of a longer trend. This tendency, however, to move away from organized politics is reflected in the same tendency to move away from other traditional communal behaviors.

POST-INDUSTRIAL AMERICAN POLITICS

The post-Industrial period is not something we can completely look back on yet. We are still living in it. The divides that exist are not only political. As this book has explained, there are geographical, ethnic, and ideological splits that are very wide. Americans are split on a host of important issues. The Pew Research Center has researched how telling those differences are among Americans in the last twenty five years. Figure 6.1]] illustrates the degree of polarization on a number of issues that often is considered in American politics.

The splits in our culture are playing out in our parties. The question is how divided are we as a society when it comes to our politics. Tom Price of Congressional Quarterly suggests that the differences, such as the ones in the Pew Research, are rather accurate:

The divide can be cultural as well as political. Market researchers, pollsters and political scientists have found that liberals and conservatives differ in what they drink, where they shop and what they choose for entertainment. Democrats like vodka, Republicans whiskey—or so the research suggests. Republicans drink Kendall-Jackson wines, Democrats Columbia Crest. Democrats shop at Whole Foods, Republicans at Walmart. Republicans watched Leno. Democrats prefer Letterman.[^9]

It is one thing for an electorate to be divided politically, but the current climate of polarization seems to have one side not even recognizing the other side as legitimate. Some of these differences are academic, and for the most part, elections are all different. Party membership is down on all fronts, however, and it is the onus of the political establishment to ensure that there is maximum access to the system.

Americans need the major political parties as a way to interpret such a complex political system. Most democracies utilize parties, but the two-party system is a very western approach to democracy. In order for this to continue, there needs to be a greater sense of participation from the electorate. If the trend is that many voters are not committing to joining the two parties the way they once did, it is up to the two parties and the political system to find ways to bring non-affiliated voters into the process at the primary stage.

As flawed and unloved at times as the party system may be, it is still a system that has worked for centuries. The party system in America is not simply useful to political scientists as an academic exercise, it has been a stable central place for voters to gain information about candidates and agendas. The electoral climate can go in any of three directions at this point. There is the option of leaving the current system the way it is, with parties lingering in the background of politics as outside funders and media push public sentiment to the extremes. There is a second possibility, which is the adoption of piecemeal reforms that address the large number of independent voters, such as the Top-Two primary. California has already gone in this direction, and the results are positive in the sense that once “safe” seats for incumbents are now more competitive. A third way to look at electoral reform is not through the legislature, but through the parties themselves in a responsible party system. A responsible party system would put the fundraising and agenda setting in the hands of party leadership. The entrepreneurial candidate would then be a part of a political system, which would make politics more identifiable to voters.

On July 21, 2014, New York Senator Charles “Chuck” Schumer penned an op-ed column in The New York Times in support of the Top-Two primary on a national level. Before recently, it was uncommon to hear political “winners,” those who are comfortable victorious in their political environment, advocating a change to the system. Sure, conservatives in New York City would want to see a change, but to see long time partisan progressive senator in favor of a Top-Two system signifies a change in attitude. Schumer was routinely re-elected to the House of Representatives until he unseated Senator Alfonse D’Amato in 1998. Since then, he has enjoyed re-elections to the Senate. So, what brings a former Harvard adjunct professor, congressman, and now member of the U.S. Senate to support an idea that would risk watering-down the cliquey might of his dominant party? Schumer sees a political system that is becoming more unworkable:

From 10,000 feet, the structure of our electorate looks to be healthy, with perhaps a third of the potential voters who are left-leaning Democrats, a third who are right-leaning Republicans and a third who are independents in the middle.

But primaries poison the health of that system and warp its natural balance, because the cast majority of Americans don’t typically vote in primaries. Instead, it is the “third of the third” most to the right or most to the left who come out to vote—the 10 percent at each of the two extremes of the political spectrum. Making things worse, in most states, laws prohibit independents—who are not registered in either party and who make up a goring proportion of the electorate—from voting in primaries at all.[^10]

Schumer begins his final sentence with “while there are no guarantees. . .” which is important since most of the criticism of the Top-Two system in California is centered on the imperfect nature of the system.

Good policy does not have to be 100% effective before it even starts. Electoral reform has to come from a basic premise that a good first step is worth trying, despite the imperfections.

Paul Herrnson has written about the candidate-centered nature of American politics, and how it has drifted away from parties. There are simply more actors in the political system that come from outside the parties, “It has introduced a new definition of the political party, explicated the relationships among the different actors associated with it, and demonstrated that research guided by this definition results in new insights into party election efforts.”[^11]

The situation that Paul Herrnson described as candidate-based, and no longer party-based, has only gotten more pronounced. Candidates, in the weak party era, are more entrepreneurial. They are basically on their own when it comes to developing a campaign and raising money. Parties are not that strong, and candidates who are new to the process, quickly learn this fact. More recently, however, candidates have gone from being entrepreneurial to being actual entrepreneurs. Steve Forbes of Forbes Magazine ran for president twice. Donald Trump won the nomination in 2016 for the Republican Party. Billionaire Michael Bloomberg, the former Mayor of New York City, continues to toy with the notion of running for president . . . someday . . . maybe. None of this means something is wrong with the system, since wealthy people are citizens just the same. What we can say is that in a time of weakened parties, the door is wide open for candidates who can run for office on their own money. In the past, this idea of a rich candidate running on their own money would likely cause voters to be skeptical. Today’s electorate, however, knows that there are often two choices: the wealthy candidate running on his or her own money or the candidate financed by some invisible PAC that they do not trust. Given that choice, voters might gravitate toward the well known wealthy candidate over the wealthy, and not well-known, political fundraising mechanism.

We’ve seen that the modern complexities of the system have not done any favors for American politics. John Aldrich has written that the party system as an exponent of how voters choose their political place on the spectrum:

Political parties are here understood as the result of choices made by rational political actors, most especially the ambitious office seekers and, only slightly less importantly, the associated benefit seekers. The rationality postulate assumes that actors have preferences and act to realize them. In this sense, rationality assumes self-interested behavior.[^12]

If parties are the result of rational political actors, what can be said of those who reject parties? Can we say that close to 800,000 non-affiliated voters in New York City are not rational?

Both parties are public utilities, regulated under federal, state, and local election law. Instead of viewing parties as not enticing enough consumers, it would be more useful to say that the public owns the parties, but has not made enough use of them in recent decades. The American voters already have ownership in the parties as they are governed through their candidates and almost always vote through the parties. They are a public trust, even when they are under-utilized and under-appreciated.

The changes that are proposed or suggested are piecemeal reforms that address modernity and do so without much constitutional debate. If the debate over the proper role of government is going to drive the political system as it has, one governmental responsibility that should be agreed upon is making the system more accessible, understandable, and inclusive. Parties may be the only vehicles that can get campaign financing under control, should they wish to do so. It would take a lot of work, and the two parties would need to agree to set up parallel rules. Lessig describes primary elections as “money elections,” stating that “in order to get to the general election, you have to do exceptionally well in the money election.”[^13] As long as primary elections are about money, and that money is coming from outside sources, there is no direction to our political process.

In 2010, with no national election but heavy mid-term activity, the number of people who gave more than $200 to a congressional candidate was 0.26 percent. Very few funders are considered relevant, and that irrelevance spills over into policy concerns.

One of the key selling points (a term that fits rather well here) for Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign is the cache independence of being self-financed. There may have been a time when a billionaire, paying for his own campaign expenses would reek of arrogance. It would tell voters, in no uncertain terms, that this was not a candidate to which they could relate. Today, however, the self-financed billionaire is more trusted than the candidate who takes money from PACs. At least voters know where the billionaire’s campaign money comes from, unlike a committee.

Although the disparity between the number of eligible voters and those who actually donate money to campaigns is large, the affirmation that politicians listen most intently to their biggest funders is hard to measure. Common sense may tell us that in order to be re-elected, they need to prioritize accordingly, but in the spirit of political science, political psychology is not easily measured.

What is measurable, however, is the amount of time that members of both houses spend in Washington legislating. In 2010, House members entered the Capitol on weekdays to the tune of 56 percent of the time, while Senators came to the Capitol 60 percent of non-holiday weekdays.[^14] A system, such as Lessig’s voucher system or Ackerman’s “patriot dollars” would lessen the need for fundraising events as citizens would be given money for federal campaign use only. It could (and there is no way to accurately predict this) result in members of Congress spending more time in Washington, D.C. working on issues.

The other point that is worth mentioning is that with all of the fundraising that goes on at the congressional level, when do representatives have time to govern? With a small amount of relevant funders, there is the potential for members to focus on what those funders desire, and less on what the general public may need. With the funding population spread out to more people, there could be a more representative pattern of priorities in Congress. This is similar to what nonpartisan election attempt to achieve. What nonpartisan elections aim to accomplish in voter participation, campaign vouchers aim to accomplish in funding campaigns.

The potential criticism of a plan like this is that it sounds fanciful. Changing how Americans approach institutions is rarely met with enthusiasm. The point of this research is to illustrate that some change or reform would come easier if there were more people involved in the electoral part of the democratic process. Be it the electoral process or most other institutions, Americans are slow to embrace change. Change, however, has come to Americans more rapidly in recent decades which lends itself to the possibility that a new way to donate money to campaigns could work. The idea of donating money to a federal campaign without having to type in credit card numbers to a website or dash off of a personal check seems like potential plus to would-be donors.

Systematic reform may offer helpful solutions that can make the electoral process more inclusive. Political theory may have its place on a list of priorities within teaching how we have arrived at polarization, but remedying polarization is much different. Polarization, if that is the true climate of the electorate is natural in an adversarial democracy. What is being discussed here, however, is polarization because of a shrinking electorate, namely in primary races. Stagnation may be a better word to explain why reform comes slowly if at all.

Although Schattschneider wrote Party Government almost six decades ago, he was right about their significance, and it is a good way to end this research, “The future of American politics is likely to be determined very largely be a triangular tug of war among the principal forms of political organization in the United States: (1) the presidential parties, (2) the local party bosses, and (3) the pressure groups.”[^15] Schattschneider was right about two of those points. Local party bosses are just not as influential as they once were. Numbers one and two, however, could not have grown more powerful from the time he first wrote that.

The two-party system in American politics is one of the most storied institutions in the United States. The voting public has expressed rather clearly that political parties are not connecting with the American people.

This project started as research about nonpartisan elections in areas where there was virtually no trace of a two-party system. Urban areas that rarely vote Republican and rural areas that rarely vote for Democratic candidates would sometimes vote differently when there was no party label at the ballot. That research led to interviews with party loyalists on both sides that adamantly defended this process. Ideological Democrats and ideological Republicans did not want to see that system change. Even Justice Antonin Scalia ruled in favor of closed-party elections in the face of the Connecticut Republican asking to hold nonpartisan primaries. The point of that original research paper was to see why voters were shying away from party politics. Closed primaries meant those voters in the middle who normally sat out primaries elections, and those independents who were unable to vote in primaries, were getting pre-packaged ideologues from which to choose.

What constitutes a strong party system is debatable. Some feel that parties that have a strict ideological code signals strength. The electorate, however, may see strong parties as those which are relevant in elections. This book focused on this debate. What are the major stumbling blocks in American democracy? Low voter turnouts, campaign finance reform issues, polarized electorates, are all problematic. If parties wished to be more involved in the process, some of these issues can be addressed.

Looking at the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, we see large voter turnouts. Those were periods of political abnormality. 2008 saw an economic crisis, a controversial war, and an African American candidate who emerged to unify a large portion of the country. For those reasons, 2008 is hard to match up against the theory that parties are not contributing factors in major elections. 2012 was not as historically significant, but we can add that year to 2008 as historically important. Candidates who are parts of American history, such as Barack Obama or Dwight Eisenhower, are difficult to defeat, regardless of how dynamic their challengers may be.

What we have seen in 2016 is exactly what this book describes as parties that have taken a back seat to the nomination process and the potential results of that lack of activity. Entrepreneurial candidates are discussed in this book, and more so by writers like Paul Herrnson, because they are a consequence of a political system that is less politicized. To the electorate, frustrated with closed-party politics, this frustration is actualized through candidates like Donald Trump, who is actually an entrepreneur.

This phenomenon of taking politics away from the people who know politics is almost unprecedented in professional life. How many people choose doctors who are “outsiders” with little medical experience? Few people commission homes to be built by novice developers who are not tarnished by the crooked construction business. David Frum, former speechwriter for President George W. Bush writes in The Atlantic:

White Middle Americans express heavy mistrust of every institution in American society: not only government, but corporations, unions, even the political party they typically vote for—the Republican Party of Romney, Ryan, and McConnell, which they despise as a sad crew of weaklings and sellouts. They are pissed off. And when Donald Trump came along, they were the people who told the pollsters, “That’s my guy.”[^1]

The interesting thing about Frum’s analysis is that it came before Trump started winning his primary races. Frum had a front row seat in the George W. Bush administration when the Republican Party squandered a chance to make serious inroads with the American public. What we are seeing is what the candidate pool can become when candidates have the dual ability to appeal to the anti-party electorate and self-finance campaigns.

Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders are not the sole flag bearers of candidacies that do not reflect the heart and soul of their party. Even the Democratic nominee in 2016, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, brings with her polling “negatives” that are almost unprecedented for Democrats. A CBS/New York Times poll on March 21, 2016 had 57 percent of Americans viewing him negatively, with 52 percent of Americans viewing Clinton the same way. Two candidates vying for the presidency, and both are viewed more negatively by a majority of the country. This book explains in detail the risks of the primary system, and how it creates polarizing candidates. The result of a closed primary system has now created two candidates where a majority of the country views them negatively.

If Clinton and Trump are viewed so negatively, how did they both get so many votes in their respective primaries? Party loyalists do not represent the majority of the country. In fact, a majority of the country does not participate in primaries. Even among the loyal primary voters, there is a tendency for voters to support a candidate they feel can defeat a candidate that they dislike even more.

What makes this different is that Americans have a sense of ownership of American politics, and thus feel they can identify when they are hearing the truth in campaigns. When a candidate from outside that system, like Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump, it provides the electorate with a chance to express dissatisfaction to parties. How that relates to American public policy is an entirely different matter.

The primary race in 2016 also makes teaching politics a challenge. Most of the norms and expectations have been turned sideways. The fallout, and what this all means for political parties going forward, is yet to be determined.
