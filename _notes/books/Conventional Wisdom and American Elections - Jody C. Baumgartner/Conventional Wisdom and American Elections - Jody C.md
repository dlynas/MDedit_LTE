## Preface

Elections, especially presidential elections, generate a seemingly limitless supply of theories, opinions, and predictions from journalists, scholars, and political pundits. The ideas put forth by these political observers then make their way into popular accounts about elections. Unfortunately, many of these ideas and accounts oversimplify complex subjects or over hype the latest political fads, and with ever-increasing venues for people to exchange political ideas, it is inevitable that some exaggerated assertions and misinformation become part of the conventional wisdom about American elections.

During both the 2004 and 2008 elections, for example, many commentators emphasized the negative tactics and practices of the campaigns of the presidential candidates. One observer called the 2004 election “the ugliest” presidential election in American history, while another referred to the 2008 election as the “meanest.” Such claims reflect a misunderstanding about the pervasive role that negative campaign tactics have always played in U.S. elections. For instance, critics of Thomas Jefferson stated that his election in 1800 would bring about legal prostitution and the burning of the Bible. Opponents of Andrew Jackson charged that he was a murderer and that his wife was a bigamist. Perhaps most scurrilous of all, Jackson’s opponents even accused his dead mother of being a prostitute. Fundraising and the importance of money in elections is another subject that many do not fully understand. A Gallup poll, for example, reported that 59 percent of Americans believe that elections are “generally for sale to the candidate who can raise the most money.” While fund-raising is undoubtedly important, almost a quarter of candidates to the U.S. Senate in recent election cycles were victorious despite spending less money than their opponents.

These and many other falsehoods about American elections persist in the minds of citizens. Based on our experience as college educators, we have identified twelve widely believed myths and misconceptions about elections in America. The conclusions that we draw are based largely on the most current political science research.1 In some instances, the literature is clear in debunking popular myths about American elections. On other issues, research findings are more mixed. In either case we clarify the issues such that readers can discern between those which scholars have largely resolved, and those in which honest debate remains.

### PLAN OF THE BOOK

The basis of any election campaign is to understand who voters are and what they want. The first section of the book is devoted to exploring three misunderstandings that have arisen in recent years about the voting public. In chapter 1, we expose the myth that voter turnout in the United States is steadily declining, pointing to the fact that the way most people measure voter turnout is faulty. Although turnout has declined somewhat in recent decades, the decline is not nearly as precipitous as some would have us believe. The chapter also examines the various factors that influence voter turnout. Finally, we add our own perspective to that of many others on the subject of youth voter turnout.

Chapter 2 focuses on various divisions among the American electorate. Although the idea that Americans are engaged in a culture war on the political front is a question of some debate, there are significant divisions among the electorate that relate to the idea that we may be divided culturally. This chapter explores the nuances of these divisions, along the way suggesting that they may be widening. Chapter 3 examines two groups of voters who are often portrayed as being quite similar, namely, the so-called independent and swing voters. These two groups receive a disproportionate amount of attention from the media throughout the campaign. This is true in spite of the fact that there is little consensus as to how to define either group, there are far fewer of either than is widely believed, and relatively few of them actually vote. Further, as the chapter makes clear, most people who do vote cast their votes in a partisan fashion most of the time.

Section two of the books shifts attention from voters to various aspects of campaigns themselves. In chapter 4, we look at several misconceptions about campaign finance reform, and in particular, what campaign finance regulations have and have not accomplished, in spite of hyperbole to the contrary. For example, despite the best intentions of reformers, campaign finance laws have failed to limit the growth of money in politics or to slow the influence of special interests in American elections. Nevertheless, there have been several underappreciated successes of campaign finance reform, which we discuss as well.

Chapter 5 deals with the “veepstakes,” a guessing game about who presidential candidates will choose as their running mates. The veeps-takes pervades media coverage of the campaign, but unfortunately, much of this coverage is less than completely informed about what presidential candidates look for in a running mate. The chapter looks beyond issues of balancing the ticket at the factors that have emerged in the past several decades as being important in vice presidential selection. In chapter 6 we take on the belief that presidential campaigns have become nastier in modern times. In addition to discussing what negative campaigning really is, focusing mainly on the difference between personal attack ads and ads that attack the opposition’s issue positions, we survey several of the truly vicious campaigns throughout our nation’s history.

Many Americans also hold misconceptions about public opinion polls. While some think that polling data paint a precise and error-free representation of American political opinion during presidential campaigns, others see polls as a form of modern-day voodoo. Both views miss the reality. Chapter 7 reviews the basics of public polling methodology and discusses potential problems with, and misuses of, polls. In chapter 8 we turn the spotlight on the popular idea that news organizations present a biased view of political reality. In fact, while there is a bias in the news, it is not based in partisanship, but rather the product of commercial considerations, or the need to make a profit. The final chapter in this section takes on the notion that the major political parties are very similar in their outlook on the political world. We highlight prominent issue positions of the major parties in the past few elections, demonstrating that while presidents typically campaign and govern from the middle, they represent parties that have significantly different ideas about the role of government in society.

The third section of the book is devoted to understanding the course and outcomes of modern campaigns. In chapter 10, we focus on the idea that image is everything in presidential campaigns. The reality is that charismatic candidates who do not execute a well-organized on-the-ground campaign will go down to defeat. This was seen clearly in 2008, where Barack Obama’s success was based both on his personal appeal and a well-run campaign.

Chapter 11 asks the provocative question of whether or not congressional elections, especially those to the House of Representatives, are meaningful contests. The chapter begins by establishing the fact that congressional elections are becoming increasingly less competitive and then provides insight into the various advantages incumbents have in congressional elections. In the final chapter we examine the myth that presidential campaigns are national contests. It is true that the president represents the entire country, and news about the campaign is certainly national in its scope and reach. But in reality, relatively few citizens are actually involved in the selection of the party candidates in any meaningful way. Moreover, the fall campaign is geared toward relatively few voters in a handful of battleground states.

## Vanishing Voters

## Misconceptions about Voter Turnout  
and the Youth Vote

Voting behavior is one of the most thoroughly studied subjects in political science. One could literally fill entire rooms with the amount of scholarship that has been devoted to understanding how and why voters and potential voters exercise their most fundamental of democratic freedoms. Nevertheless, despite decades of voluminous research, there are several commonly held assumptions about voting behavior that are problematic.

For example, conventional wisdom, as well as several academic studies, has long held that American voter turnout is in decline. While there is some truth to this assertion, the overall picture is more complex. Recent research suggests that the decline in American voter turnout might not be as steep as many observers suggest it is.1 Moreover, discussions about declining voter turnout in the United States typically ignore the fact that voter turnout has declined in most other established democracies as well. A second myth that pervades discussion about voter turnout is the idea that in any given election, young Americans (eighteen- to twenty-four-year-olds) will turn out in record numbers to decide the election. But while voter turnout within this age group increased in both 2004 and 2008, in neither year did it exceed the record set in 1972.

In the next section we will examine the factors that political science research has suggested can affect voter turnout, either negatively or positively. Following this we will examine in some detail the source of the myth of vanishing voters in the United States, namely, the way turnout figures are usually calculated and reported. We then examine voter turnout in the United States and other established democracies in the past several decades. In the final section we turn our attention to the question of youth voter turnout.

### FACTORS THAT AFFECT VOTER TURNOUT

Discussions about voting behavior in the United States often begin with the premise that Americans do not vote in numbers equal to the past or that they do not vote in numbers proportionate to citizens in other democracies. Most American government textbooks frame the discussion of voting in the United States in terms of low voter turnout, noting correctly that the United States ranks near the bottom of the world in voter turn-out.2 During the campaign of 2000, a number of stories covered subjects such as “why Americans don’t vote,” or predicted that “voter turnout may slip again.”3 The picture these accounts present, at least implicitly, is that our democracy is in decline.4

Many scholars echo similar sentiments. Works such as The Disappearing American Voter, Why Americans Don’t Vote, Why Americans Still Don’t Vote (emphasis added), Why America Stopped Voting, and Where Have All the Voters Gone? all suggest in their titles that American voter turnout is in decline.5 One author, for example, explicitly refers to “the turnout problem.”6 Another summarizes, “In ever larger numbers over the past three decades, Americans have been tuning out campaigns and staying home on Election Day. Turnout has fallen in virtually every type of American election.”7

There are a variety of explanations offered for the decline in voter turn-out in this research. We can divide these explanations into two broad categories, institutional and non-institutional factors. Institutional factors focus, simply, on the rules governing the administration of elections. The act of voting in the United States is more difficult than it is in other democracies, and this, it is theorized, drives turnout down. Borrowing from economists, some political scientists hold that individuals are “rational actors” who weigh the costs of voting against its perceived benefits. For example, traveling long distances to reach a polling place might be too much of a cost when compared with the difference (benefit) one vote might make. A second set of explanations deals with characteristics of individuals themselves that might make them less inclined to participate or how the campaign itself might motivate or mobilize people to vote.

#### Institutional Factors: The Rules

The first and most important thing to understand about the rules governing the administration of elections in the United States is that states make most of these rules. Beyond complying with anti-discrimination provisions contained in the Voting Rights Act of 1965, states are free to set their own standards for voter registration, determine the location of polling places, how long these polling places will be open, set absentee ballot requirements, and more.8 There is, for example, no universal answer to the question, “what do I have to do to register to vote?”

This said, several general aspects of election law in the United States are important to understand in a discussion of possible reasons why people do not vote. Many studies suggest that restrictive laws, such as registration laws, or in particular, deadlines that force citizens to register early in the election season, result in decreased levels of voter turnout.9 For example, in most states, people are required to register to vote before Election Day. The length of time varies from state to state, but it is usually at least a few weeks prior to the election.

This is not the case in most established democracies, where voter registration is the responsibility of the government. North Dakota does not require citizens to register to vote, and in 2008, nine other states allowed for Election Day registration (EDR). A recent study shows that states using EDR saw up to nine percentage points higher turnout than in non-EDR states.10 Some people, even the best intentioned, simply forget to register until it is too late or to re-register after moving.

In most other democracies in the world, voting takes place on weekends or special holidays dedicated to voting. In the United States, Election Day is on a Tuesday. This is significant because most people work on Tuesdays. In order to vote people have several inconvenient options. They can rise early and arrive at the polls before work, vote during a lunch break, ask the boss to vote during work, or vote after work. This additional inconvenience (or cost, in the language of rational choice theory) may reduce the likelihood of voting.

There are also more elections in the United States than in any other country. In most European democracies there are only a few elections (e.g., member of Parliament, representative to the European Union, and a scattering of local offices) held in any given four or five year period. By comparison, Americans are asked to vote in a bewildering array of elections almost every year. There are, for example, primary and general elections for the U.S. House of Representatives and other offices every two years (all even-numbered years). In addition, in some states and cities citizens vote in primary and general elections for governor, state legislature, mayor, city council, and so on, during odd-numbered years. Elections to decide on ballot propositions can occur in any year, as well, and at different times of the year. In some rare instances, citizens might even have to vote in a recall election. The point is that Americans are asked to vote with great frequency.

Voting in the United States is also a fairly complicated affair. In most democracies, citizens might be asked to cast a vote for a political party and maybe a single member of Parliament from their district, and perhaps a few other offices. The U.S. system of federalism and separated government means there are a multiplicity of offices that voters must decide on, from president down to county commissioner, local sheriff, circuit court judges, and more. In total, there are over one million elective offices in the United States, and ballots rarely simplify matters by giving voters the option of voting a straight-party ticket for all offices.11 It is the rare individual who has taken the time to research each candidate running for each office. The array of choices citizens face at the voting booth can be intimidating, especially to first-time voters, who are inexperienced and more likely to be lacking in information about the process and the choices facing them. In fact it may be so intimidating that they decide to stay home.

Finally, with respect to the rules governing elections, all elections for federal office in the United States are decided by plurality-winner rules in single-member districts. This is unlike electoral systems in most other democracies, which employ proportional representation winning rules, either completely, or combined with plurality-winner/single-member districts. Some research has suggested that voter turnout is lower in plurality-winner/single-member district systems because they tend to produce two-party systems. Citizens who seek an alternative may be so disenchanted with their choices that they do not participate.12

While rules may depress voter turnout, there have been several efforts in recent years to ease the burden on citizens to vote. The first, and perhaps most prominent, was the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (the Motor Voter Bill) that requires motor vehicle offices nationwide to accept voter registration applications and allows other government agencies and programs to do so as well. Mail-in voter registration also has become common in many states. Another recent change in voter registration requirements is the move, as noted earlier, toward Election Day registration.

In addition, many states seem to be doing more to reduce the burden of voting itself. All states have absentee ballots that allow individuals to vote from a location other than their designated polling place and at a time that is convenient to them. However, in 2008, thirty-two states allowed “no-excuse” absentee voting, allowing voters to request absentee ballots without justifying their request; of these, twenty-eight allowed absentee voting by mail. Thirty-two states now allow (no excuse) early voting. Finally, twenty-nine states require private businesses to give employees time off to vote (while thirty states mandate this for public employees).13

It should be noted that institutional reforms seem to have only marginally affected voter turnout.14 For example, the 1996 presidential election saw record-low turnout, and this after the Motor Voter Bill was passed. Part of the reason these efforts (EDR, early voting, or absentee voting) may not have as much of an effect on turnout as proponents hope is that citizens must still make an effort to cast a ballot. While 2008 saw yet another increase in voter turnout, it remains to be seen whether this can be credited to various institutional reforms.

#### Non-Institutional Factors

Beyond institutional arrangements, there are several other factors that research has suggested have an effect, either positive or negative, on voter turnout. The first set of factors deals with individuals themselves. For example, one argument is that voting is a habit: the more a person does it, the more likely he or she is to keep doing it.15 This helps explain why younger citizens are less likely to vote than their older counterparts.16 People who feel connected to their communities are also more likely to vote, if only because they have something to protect or advocate (e.g., lower property taxes for homeowners).

Another reason why people do not vote is that many are either not interested in, or are cynical about, government, politics, and politicians. Many, for example, complain that campaigns are too long, too negative, and focus too much on personality rather than on the issues. This is significant because these negative perceptions lead to cynicism about campaign politics, the political system, and the belief that voting has the potential to effect change. These feelings are important because an individual’s sense of political efficacy (the confidence an individual has in their own political understanding and abilities), trust in government, and sense of duty associated with citizenship are often significant predictors of voting.17 Along these lines, people who identify with, or feel attached to a political party are more apt to vote than people who claim they are independents.18

Related to these general attitudes about politics and the individual’s place in the political system is knowledge about politics. Those who are more knowledgeable about politics are more likely to vote. In fact, formal education itself has a similar effect on an individual’s likelihood of voting. The more educated one is in terms of formal schooling, the more likely that individual is to vote.19 This may be the result of the fact that our system of government, like the institutional arrangements governing elections, is fairly complex. Individuals can easily become confused about their choices and the implications of those choices. Moreover, in the midst of an election campaign, candidates and parties can often blur their differences in an attempt to capture the votes of the large numbers of citizens who see themselves as moderates. The point is that the choices facing citizens on Election Day may not seem as clear as they would like and they may become so intimidated that they decide not to vote.

A final set of factors that affect voter turnout has to do with the campaign itself. As it happens, competitive elections tend to experience higher voter turnout, quite likely because individuals are more likely to believe their vote will make a difference. This may be one reason why voter turnout was so low in 1996, a year few thought Bob Dole had a real chance to defeat the incumbent President Clinton. In addition, elections that generate more media coverage tend to stimulate greater interest, whichin turnleads to greater turnout.20 Similarly, candidates, parties, interest groups, and ordinary citizens can play a role in stimulating interest in the campaign as well, by talking to other citizens. One especially interesting recent research finding is that personalized campaign messages and appeals are a particularly effective method of generating increased turnout.21 This is especially true with regard to person-to-person contact, which can be extremely effective in getting people to vote. In other words, one person can make a difference by simply talking to friends, family, co-workers, or associates.22

In sum, there are multiple factors that affect whether individuals will exercise their most fundamental of democratic freedoms. These are important to understand because, as it happens, voter turnout has declined somewhat in the past half century. In the next section we turn our attention to the myth of the “vanishing voter,” focusing on how voter turnout is measured and reported.

### VOTER TURNOUT: A STATISTIC IN  
SEARCH OF A STANDARD

Determining voter turnout would seem to be a fairly straightforward calculation: the number of votes cast (the numerator) divided by the number of potential voters (the denominator). It is relatively easy to tabulate the number of votes counted in any given election. Tabulating the number of potential voters, on the other hand, is not as simple to do as one might think. Voter turnout statistics typically utilize census data, counting all those living in the United States who are age eighteen or older. This is referred to as the voting age population, or VAP.

Until recently the VAP measure was the accepted standard in calculating voter turnout rates. However, political scientists Michael McDonald and Samuel Popkin have noted that the VAP measure is problematic because it fails to tabulate the number of eligible voters. Age, they note, is not the only criterion to be eligible to vote. Noncitizens are ineligible to vote, as are prisoners and convicted felons in many states. Several states even prohibit ex-felons from voting after completing their criminal sentence. Most accounts of voter turnout throughout American history fail to consider the actual eligible population.

McDonald and Popkin suggest that the decline in voter turnout in the past fifty to sixty years has been systematically overestimated because of the increase in the number of those eighteen years of age or older who are noncitizens or felons. In addition, some states do not allow the mentally incompetent to vote, although this is only a tiny fraction of the population (perhaps one-tenth of one percent). McDonald and Popkin also examine residency requirements in various states, which they estimate disenfranchise approximately one percent of the voting age population in any given election.23 Finally, they note that the census has become more accurate over the past half century. In 1940, the Census Bureau estimated that their count missed approximately 5.8 percent of the population. Many of these “missed” citizens were likely to be poor and less educated, and therefore less likely to vote, resulting in potentially biased turnout statistics. This number shrank to 1.8 percent in 1990.

Their point is that the number of people incorrectly counted as potential voters—the voting age population—has grown relative to those who have reported voting. These discrepancies have collectively created a situation whereby the statistics have overestimated the number of people eligible to vote, thus underestimating voter turnout percentages.

To this point, we have discussed only one-half of the voter turnout equation—the number of eligible voters. A final aspect of our discussion centers on the calculation of the number of votes cast. Many experts believe that one of the reasons voter turnout was so high in the late 1800s is that there was a good deal of election fraud in various states and localities.24 For example, some research suggests that in certain areas of the country corrupt election officials “stuffed” ballot boxes or deliberately reported false returns, often inflating the vote totals for the candidate of the party in power.25 This would, of course, lead to inflated rates of voter turnout. Unfortunately, no complete data are available to estimate the effects of voting fraud on voter turnout.

McDonald and Popkin’s research points to another fact worth considering. The numerator in the voter turnout equation relies on the number of votes cast for president (during presidential election years) or the number of votes cast for members of Congress (during midterm election years). However, this method systematically undercounts the number of votes cast because some citizens, albeit a small percentage (approximately two percent), show up to the polls to vote for ballot propositions or local offices but abstain from casting votes for higher offices.26 This would not have been possible until the widespread adoption of the Australian ballot in the 1890s, a period that corresponds with yet another fairly sharp decline in turnout.27

Table 1.1 shows estimates of the turnout rate using the voting age population (VAP) as well as voting eligible population (VEP). Importantly, the VEP calculation only corrects for felons and noncitizens who are ineligible, not for the mentally incompetent, those disenfranchised by residency requirements, or census undercounting. In other words, the corrections are conservative. The final column shows a fairly significant increase in the difference using these two methods to calculate the turnout rate. The point is that while voter turnout is declining somewhat, VEP estimates of turnout suggest a less dramatic decline than do those based on VAP.

### FRAMING THE ISSUE: REPORTING AND  
DISCUSSING TURNOUT RATES

Regardless of whether one calculates voter turnout using VAP or VEP, it is still true that turnout in the United States has declined over the past century and remains lower when compared with turnout in other established democracies. However, the way in which some political observers present this fact often makes the situation appear bleaker than it actually is. For example, figure 1.1 presents turnout rates (using VAP) in the United States from 1824 to 2008. Here, the decline in voter turnout appears to be dramatic.

However, figure 1.2 presents data measuring voter turnout from 1920 (when the size of the electorate effectively doubled) to 2008. Here a decline is apparent as well, but a comparison of the trend lines in each figure suggests that the recent decline might be less serious than some portray it to be. In fact, since 1976, when turnout was 55.2 percent (using VAP statistics), it has hovered consistently in the low-50s percentage range. This only reinforces the point that voters do not appear to be “vanishing.”

While turnout has dropped modestly over the course of the past century or so, U.S. rates are consistently lower when measured against turn-out in other established democracies. However, it is also true that voter turnout has been declining in other nations over the past fifty years.28 As figure 1.3 indicates, average voter turnout from 1950 to 2009 has declined significantly in other established democracies as well. In fact, while U.S. voter turnout is lower than all of the others, the decline in the United States during this period is less than in any of these countries (see table 1.2).

To be clear, Americans are voting at lower rates than one hundred years ago or when compared with citizens of other countries. However, to suggest that voters in the United States are vanishing overstates the case. Turnout has remained relatively constant over the past few decades, and any decline in voter turnout in the United States is quite consistent with developments in other countries. Whether or not this is a problem is certainly debatable, and one could make a good case that it is. But, at a minimum, it is difficult to argue that voter turnout in the United States is at crisis levels.

### THE REAL STORY OF THE YOUTH VOTE

Heading into the 2008 election, predictions about how youth would turn out in record numbers abounded.29 Some observers went so far as to suggest that the youth vote would be decisive. One claimed that “if politically active twenty-somethings have their way, 2008 is going to be their year.”30 Similarly, in 2004, several pre-election polls suggested that young Americans (eighteen- to twenty-four-year-olds) would vote in near-record numbers.31 A May 2003 survey conducted by Harvard University’s Institute of Politics reported that an estimated 59 percent of eighteen- to twenty-four-year-olds claimed that they would “definitely be voting” and that an additional 27 percent would “probably be voting” in the 2004 election.32 Some 70 percent of Americans believed that youth voters potentially could be “very important” in defeating George W. Bush in 2004.33 Several celebrities added to these high expectations by making special efforts to increase turnout among young voters. Sean “P. Diddy” Combs and his “Vote or Die!” campaign drew perhaps the most attention and led Combs to predict boldly that young voters were “gonna come out in numbers you’ve never seen before.”34

This type of hyperbole is not new. In 1996, some speculated that the passage of the Motor Voter Bill, the rise of the Internet, and a growing number of youth organizations would lead to a larger-than-usual youth turnout.35 Despite those developments, a dismal 39 percent of young voters turned out to the polls in 1996.36 Even the 1992 election, which many consider a benchmark for youth participation, witnessed only a 51 percent turnout among eighteen- to twenty-four-year-olds.

To be fair, the youth vote did indeed increase in 2004 and again in 2008, and youth turnout in the 2008 primaries was at historically high levels.37 This was certainly due, in part, to massive efforts to register young voters and get them to vote. Rock the Vote, for example, almost tripled the number of youth voters they registered from the 2000 to the 2004 election cycle.38 Obama mobilized large numbers of youth with his efforts and presence on Facebook in 2008.

But in the end, the increase in the number of young voters accompanied an overall increase in turnout among voters from all age groups. Despite predictions that the eighteen- to twenty-four-year-old vote would play an especially significant role in the 2004 election, young voters comprised the same percentage of the electorate as they did in 2000.39 The fact is that turnout rates were still lowest for those between the ages of eighteen to twenty-four.40 The point is that the story line of high expectations for the youth vote followed by disappointing results seems to repeat itself in each election. This is puzzling, since research has long noted disparities in political participation, particularly in voter turnout, between younger citizens and their older counterparts.41

As seen in figure 1.4, youth voter turnout did indeed increase in 2004, and again in 2008. However, in neither case did it reach the high mark set in 1972 (54.6 percent), the first election in which eighteen- to twenty-four-year olds were eligible to vote.42 However, a higher percentage of older Americans (those over the age of twenty-four) went to the polls than did younger Americans. To be fair, the difference between under-twenty-four- and over-twenty-four-year-old voter turnout rates dropped from 28.4 percent in 2000 to 19.6 percent in 2004, and 17.3 percent in 2008. This is an encouraging sign, but still greater than the 16.3 percent differential in 1972.43

But the picture is less encouraging when examining turnout rates for midterm elections (congressional elections held in nonpresidential election years). Although participation of all Americans is lower in these elections than in presidential elections, the difference between under-twenty-four- and over-twenty-four-year-old voter turnout rates here is greater, averaging about 30 percent. Thus, in both presidential and midterm elections, turnout rates among young voters are consistently lower than they are among older Americans.

![[chpt_fig_007.png]]

So, why is it that more youth do not vote? One factor that may explain low voter turnout among youth is the fact that registration requirements probably disproportionately affect young people, many of whom move frequently and know less about the process than do citizens who vote on a regular basis. Youth are also less likely to perceive differences between the two major parties and are more likely to be dissatisfied with the choices being offered.44 Youth also report that parties and politicians do not address the issues they think are important and believe that they are being ignored; research confirms that they typically are.45 As noted earlier, individuals who meet or are contacted by a candidate are far more likely to get involved than are those who have not.46 In 1992, Bill Clinton made a concerted effort to address issues that matter to youth, and it resulted in one of the higher youth voter turnout rates in thirty years.

We saw a similar phenomenon in 2008 with the candidacy of Barack Obama. But in spite of his successful efforts to mobilize youth, and, despite claims to the contrary, the youth vote was not the decisive factor in Obama’s victory in 2008. Analyses have shown that even without the youth vote he would have been victorious.47

### CONCLUSION

Is nonvoting a cause for concern? Many maintain that it is not. Some argue that non-voting is an indication that people are content with their government and that most citizens desire to be less involved in political decision making.48 Others make the case that only people who care enough to learn about the candidates and issues during the campaign and make the effort to vote should have their voices heard. This argument suggests that good government and good policy depends on informed choices.49 Countering this argument is the idea that democratic citizenship is in many ways an acquired skill. People learn more and, importantly, appreciate the value of participation, by voting.50 Another perspective suggests that voting is a choice and citizens thus have the right not to vote. Countering this is the argument that democracy requires participation by its citizens, and as a result, all citizens have a duty to vote.51

What can be done about low voter turnout? Institutional reforms may have a limited, but only a limited, effect in raising turnout. One recent finding dealing with attempts to increase voter turnout is the re-discovery that person-to-person mobilization matters. When an individual is contacted by party officials, campaign organizations, or fellow citizens, he or she is more likely to vote. In fact, the model of synthesizing online technologies to create neighborhood campaign teams to get out the vote used by the Bush campaign in 2004 was based on this premise. Obama improved the model in 2008, adding, among other things, social networking websites to the mix in order to bring even more people into the fold (see chapter 10). Even without the recent gains attributed to the Obama campaign, American voter turnout has declined only modestly, and even less so when one applies McDonald and Popkin’s more precise measure that relies on the voting eligible population rather than voting age population in the denominator of the turnout statistic.

## A Polarized Nation? “The Culture War” and Divisions in American Politics

## “The Culture War” and Divisions in American Politics

In April of 2008, then–presidential candidate Barack Obama, while attending a private fundraiser in San Francisco, told an audience, “You go into these small towns in Pennsylvania, and . . . small towns in the Midwest, the jobs have been gone now for twenty-five years and nothing’s replaced them. . . . And it’s not surprising, then, they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren’t like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.”1 Obama’s comments triggered a rash of criticism from his political opponents who labeled his words “elitist” and “patronizing.”2 Yet the real controversy, according to one writer, was that it tapped into the cultural stereotype of the “liberal (who) looks down on average people, confident that he is a superior being.”3 “Bittergate,” as the event came to be known, was less about Obama’s gaffe and more about a larger “culture war” (i.e., divisions in American society based upon conflicting cultural values).

Well before Obama made headlines with his “bitter” comments, cultural divisions in American society had drawn the attention of scholars, journalists, and political leaders. Former speechwriter to President Richard Nixon and conservative commentator Pat Buchanan gave a speech at the Republican Party’s 1992 national convention in which he told the audience that conservatives were engaged in a “cultural war” for “the soul of America.”4 In 1996, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, the author of the dissenting opinion in Romer v. Evans (a case concerning discrimination and sexual orientation) wrote, “I think it no business of the courts (as opposed to the political branches) to take sides in this culture war [italics added].”5

In addition to Buchanan and Scalia, several political observers have noted the significance of cultural divisions in American politics, with a few exaggerating these differences to the point of being humorous. One account described the stereotypes of red state voters who supported George W. Bush in the 2004 presidential election as “ignorant, racist, fascist, knuckle-dragging, NASCAR-obsessed, cousin-marrying, road-kill-eating, tobacco-juice-dribbling, gun-fondling, religious fanatic, rednecks.”6 Another summary described Democratic voters’ perceptions of Republicans as “a collection of pampered rich people who selfishly seek to cut their own taxes, allied with religious fundamentalists who want to use government power to impose a narrow brand of Christianity on everyone else.”7

Stereotypes of blue state voters who supported John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election were no more flattering. One account summarized them as “godless, unpatriotic, pierced-nose, Volvo-driving, France-loving, leftwing Communist, latte-sucking, tofu-chomping, holistic-wacko, neurotic vegan, weenie perverts.”8 Another added that Republicans view Democrats as little more than “godless, overeducated elitists who sip lattes as they look down their noses at the moral values of ‘real Americans’ in ‘the heartland’ and ally themselves with ‘special interest groups’ that benefit from ‘big government.”’9

However, as the primacy of a culture war in American politics gained acceptance, several prominent scholars published books and articles that called this conventional wisdom into question.10 Press accounts soon followed that echoed the skeptical view of a polarized and politically divided public. In 2005, for instance, one observer suggested that “American politics is polarized but the American public is not. In fact, what may be the most striking feature of the contemporary American landscape—a surprise, given today’s bitterly adversarial politics—is not the culture war but the culture peace.”11 Another opined that polarization was at “the poles, not the center.”12 Still another declared that “The ‘culture war’ has become a pillar of the conventional wisdom. But is it real? . . . There is plenty of evidence that the very real disputes pushed by political activists and chair-throwing media yakkers—call this the Anger-Industrial Complex—are being carelessly extrapolated to include a far less vehement populace.”13

Despite numerous proclamations about the nonexistence of the culture war, the issue re-emerged during the 2008 election with Obama’s “bitter” comments, and later with Republican presidential nominee John McCain’s selection of Alaska governor Sarah Palin as his running mate. Some speculated that Palin’s small-town roots and reputation as a defender of socially conservative values would help the McCain campaign excite the base of the Republican Party by re-igniting the culture war. One pundit claimed that “Palin represents the reappearance of the one part of Bush that never died—the culture warrior. Democrats may have forgotten about the notorious red state–blue state divide, or hoped that the failures of the last eight years had made it go away. But it hasn’t. It’s been there all along.”14

As these various conflicting accounts make clear, there remains considerable debate about the relevance of the culture war and the political polarization (or lack thereof) of the American public. We will not settle this debate. What we can do is make some sense of the controversies surrounding this subject. Although there is no uniform agreement among social scientists about the importance of cultural issues and the extent of polarization among the electorate, there is consensus on a few points that we attempt to highlight in this chapter.

There are, for instance, significant gaps among the electorate that are reflective of at least some degree of polarization in the electorate and that may relate to the culture war argument. First, there has been a clustering or “big sort” of Americans into like-minded communities that has contributed to growing regional gaps in voting behavior—what one author has referred to as the “politics of place.”15 Second, there is increased partisanship with respect to voting behavior. Third, a religious gap has widened in recent years, which has obvious implications for any discussions about cultural politics in the United States. However, to begin to understand the debate that surrounds the so-called culture war and polarization, some background and perspective is in order.

### THE ORIGINS OF THE CULTURE WAR

The term “culture war” gained prominence in academic circles following the publication of sociologist James Davison Hunter’s 1991 book, Culture Wars: The Struggle to Define America. Hunter argued that Americans are deeply split by two competing worldviews: progressivism and orthodoxy. Those adhering to progressivism believe in policies that will bring about social change. In contrast, those adhering to orthodoxy oppose social change and are deeply committed to maintaining existing traditions. According to Hunter, these values are the source of fundamental divisions among Americans on a range of social and cultural issues including women’s rights, specifically abortion, school prayer, and homosexual rights.16

Many believe these divisions trace back to the social movements of the 1960s. Most, however, found their roots much earlier. For example, the debate over whether to teach evolution or creationism (known by some as “intelligent design”) in public schools was a source of controversy in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In 1844, for example, the city of Philadelphia experienced a series of violent protests and riots (the Philadelphia Nativist Riots) over which version of the Bible should be taught in public schools.17 Perhaps the best-known example is the “Scopes” or “Great Monkey” trial in which the state of Tennessee brought charges against John Scopes for teaching evolution in his science class in 1925.

Similarly, the women’s rights movement traces as far back as 1848 to the Seneca Falls Convention and the ensuing women’s suffrage movement. The abortion movement finds its roots in the century-old battle to reform birth control laws. In 1916, Margaret Sanger opened the first birth control clinic in the United States and shortly after formed the National Committee for Federal Legislation for Birth Control. She led the effort to legalize various forms of contraceptives and organized Planned Parenthood in 1942.18 Partly as the result of these efforts, the Supreme Court overturned a Connecticut law banning contraception in 1965 in the landmark case Griswold v. Connecticut. The Court’s decision in the case of Roe v. Wade, which legalized most abortions, was based in large part on the right to privacy established in Griswold.

In short, there is a long history of social and cultural divisions in the United States. In fact, the counterculture movement of the 1960s itself traces its roots back to an earlier period, drawing inspiration from the “beat” movement of the 1950s. Referred to as “beatniks,” members of the beat movement were sharply critical of traditional American values, especially what they perceived to be mainstream society’s preoccupation with materialistic concerns and other elements of the dominant culture, such as Christianity. Politically, they supported desegregation and civil rights for African Americans during a time when many white Americans did not.19 As one prominent political observer notes,

There is a hidden assumption that we were once a happy, homogenous nation that came apart only when hippies preached free love, the religious right rose, secularists became more assertive, the Supreme Court began issuing liberal decisions, talk-show hosts began yelling, and intelligent designers began lobbying school boards....we forget that the seeds of modern feminism were planted in Ozzie and Harriet’s day. ...We forget that the hippies of the 1960s were preceded by the Beats of the 1950s. . . . Before the battles in the 1960s and 1970s to legalize abortion, there were fights in the late 1940s to legalize birth control.20

This said, one reporter has described the 1960s as the “big bang” period in bringing about the social and cultural schisms of today.21 The major political issues of that time involved protests over civil rights and the Vietnam War. However, the unrest of the 1960s transcended politics. The decade of the 1960s also saw a rebellion against mainstream culture. This “counterculture” encouraged people to “turn on, tune in, and drop out” and reject traditional sexual mores (such as monogamy), experiment with illicit drug use, and disengage from mainstream society.

Other social movements further challenged traditional social norms, such as the role of women in society. Betty Friedan’s best-selling book, The Feminine Mystique, published in 1963, challenged the prevailing gender stereotypes that women could only discover true happiness in their role as a wife, mother, and homemaker. Feminists also pushed for reproductive freedom, campaigning to have state laws stricken that restricted access to birth control methods or that prohibited abortion.

In the 1970s, conservatives responded with counter-movements of their own. In Kanawha County, West Virginia, school board member Alice Moore (known as “Sweet” Alice), the wife of a fundamentalist preacher in rural St. Albans, West Virginia, helped spark a grassroots protest against sex education in the county public schools and books purchased by the school system’s superintendent. Residents picketed school buildings with signs carrying slogans, such as “Even Hillbillies Have Constitutional Rights.”22 The events in Kanawha County were a microcosm of a growing conservative backlash to the progressive social movements of the 1960s.

The protests in West Virginia coincided with the founding of the Moral Majority by the Reverend Jerry Falwell and Paul Weyrich in 1979. This organization pledged to defend traditional values and mobilize social conservatives to participate in the political process. A year later, the Moral Majority claimed credit for Ronald Reagan’s presidential victory and the defeat of six liberal U.S. senators. One study noted that more than onefifth of Moral Majority’s supporters who voted for Reagan had supported Jimmy Carter four years earlier in the 1976 presidential election.23

According to some experts these movements and counter-movements played a significant role in shaping contemporary cultural divisions. As one analyst summarizes, “Since the 1960s, the society and the culture have moved to the left, almost consistently, over the years, and as a result, Americans who have traditional views on social values have become increasingly alienated and even angry. That has now fully manifested itself in our politics.”24 (For a complete timeline of events related to the culture war since the 1960s, see box 2.1.). How these cultural divisions translate into politics is, as noted, a matter of some debate. We examine that debate next.

### THE DEBATE OVER THE IMPORTANCE  
OF CULTURAL POLITICS

While cultural battles in the United States have an extensive history, they have only recently been simplified and overlaid onto the colored-coded, red state/blue state maps used in presidential elections. Following the closely contested 2000 and 2004 presidential elections, one analyst summarized, “There is . . . a political and cultural divide that has turned America into a 50-50 nation . . . a seething cauldron of ‘red’ and ‘blue’ states, in the color-coded maps of network television analysts.”25 Yet, this geographic divide of red and blue states as a representation of the culture war has drawn criticism from scholars.26

One notable study concluded that residents in red states and blue states are only minimally divided on social and cultural issues. The results from the research demonstrated that most Americans are not polarized, but rather share moderate positions on most issues and are generally ambivalent in their political attitudes. According to the authors, the misunderstanding about polarization in red states and blue states derives from selective media coverage that tends to exaggerate differences between red and blue state voters. The study adds that the “myth” of a culture war also derives from confusion between politicians and political elites and average Americans. Political candidates, the authors contend, have become increasingly partisan in an attempt to “rally the base” with extremist language and overheated rhetoric.27

Although the red state–blue state divide does not reveal major differences between residents on social and cultural issues, there is research that finds cultural divisions have been significant in American politics. A recent study finds that one’s position on the abortion issue was a signifi-cant predictor of people who switched their party affiliation.28 Similarly, other research has shown that positions on abortion are a major determinant of vote choice.29 Several political scientists have concluded that evangelical Christians have emerged as the “base of the Republican vote” and that the “values divide” had widened in recent years.30

Some research further indicates that social and cultural issues have been important in helping the Republican Party capture the votes of the white working class. In the 1969 book The Emerging Republican Majority, Kevin Phillips argued that the Republican Party would build a successful coalition by winning over culturally disaffected working-class whites, many of whom were strongly opposed to civil rights and affirmative action programs.31 Later research reinforced Phillips’ predictions that the close relationship that developed between the working class and the Democratic Party during the New Deal era had disintegrated by the 1970s due to social and cultural issues.32 Indeed, a recent publication describes the Republican coalition as comprising “managers, executives, and business and farm owners with white middle-class and working-class Democrats [italics added], many of them Protestant evangelicals, who were alienated by their party’s support for civil rights and for the sixties counterculture.”33 Another account added that states with large white working-class populations have “become less Democratic in presidential voting,” as Americans have begun “placing more value on social and cultural issues and less on economic ones.”34

One of the more prominent recent works to highlight the importance of cultural politics is Thomas Frank’s What’s the Matter with Kansas? Frank writes of a “Great Backlash” in which the white working class, once a pillar of the New Deal coalition, left the Democratic Party and joined the Republican Party. According to Frank, the backlash against liberal policies and the Democratic Party occurred as a result of conservatism shifting its early emphasis on “fiscal sobriety” to its more recent emphasis on “explosive social issues” such as abortion and gun control.35 From Frank’s perspective, however, the conservative movement’s shift in emphasis to the “culture war” is little more than a front to pursue economic policies that are harmful to the working class. As he writes, “Cultural anger is marshaled to achieve economic ends. . . . Old-fashioned values may count when conservatives appear on the stump, but once conservatives are in office the only old-fashioned situation they care to revive is an economic regimen of low wages and lax regulations.”36 The end result of this development, according to Frank, has been a dominant political coalition of business and blue-collar workers.

Several scholars, however, challenge the premise that white working-class voters are preoccupied with social and cultural issues and have shifted their allegiance to the Republican Party.37 One study finds that “in the white working class, as in the electorate as a whole, net Republican gains since the 1950s have come entirely among middle- and upper-income voters, producing a substantial gap in partisanship and voting between predominantly Democratic lower income groups and predominantly Republican upper income groups.”38 It adds that any significant losses by the Democratic Party of white working-class voters in presidential elections have come primarily from the South, and that in general, cultural wedge issues are not very important to most white working-class voters.39

These different perspectives make it clear that there is debate surrounding the significance of cultural issues in American politics. However, there is greater agreement that there are growing gaps among the American electorate with respect to voting behavior. In particular, sharper and more consistent geographic, partisan, and religious differences have increased in recent years.

### POLITICAL DIVISIONS AND  
AMERICAN POLITICS

In spite of the fact that there does not seem to be a consensus about whether a culture war truly exists in American politics, there are several divisions among the electorate that exist, and may shed some light on the culture war argument. These include a growing tendency of Americans to settle in communities of politically like-minded individuals, and perhaps relatedly, a growing partisanship among, and increased role of religion for, many Americans. We investigate each of these trends briefly below.

#### Geographic “Sorting” and Polarization

Several works have noted that geographic divisions in the United States capture significant political differences within the electorate.40 Perhaps the most extensive work on the politics of geography (or the “politics of place”) comes from Bill Bishop’s The Big Sort. Bishop’s work shows that most counties in the United States have become increasingly partisan (see figure 2.1). In the nationally competitive presidential election of 1976, for instance, 26.8 percent of the public resided in a county where either Republican Gerald Ford or Democrat Jimmy Carter won by a landslide (more than 20 percentage points). However, in 2000 and 2004 the percentage of people living in a landslide county increased to 45.3 percent and 48.3 percent respectively (see table 2.1); in 2008, the percentage was 48.1 percent.

According to Bishop, as Americans have clustered into like-minded communities that share the same political and cultural values, divisions across different communities have grown.41 He notes, for example, that in Republican landslide counties in 2008, “there were five Anglos of voting age for every black or Hispanic” whereas in “Obama-landslide counties, there are 1.3 whites for every black or Hispanic. Obama counties and McCain counties are very different places.”42

Even at the state level, landslide results have become more common. In 1976, there was an average winning margin of ten percentage points in the fifty states and the District of Columbia. This increased to fifteen percentage points in 2000, sixteen percentage points in 2004, and then to seventeen percentage points in 2008. Likewise, there were only fourteen states where the presidential contest was decided by ten points or less in 2008 compared to thirty-one states in 1976. Political scientist Alan Abramowitz has concluded that, “the divide between the red states and blue states is deeper than at any time in the past sixty years.”43

A clear example of this is the fact that divisionsbetween ruraland urban America have grown. In 2008, Barack Obama’s urban Chicago background contrasted sharply with the rural Alaska background of Sarah Palin. Perhaps not surprisingly, the Democratic ticket performed best in urban communities and the Republican ticket best in rural communities. One possible explanation for the differences in the voting behavior of residents of rural and urban areas is that different value orientations develop in these regions based on lifestyle differences. For example, rural residents are more likely to be married than urban residents. This has political implications because those who are married exhibit different political attitudes and behavior than those who are single.44 In addition, rural residents are more likely to be homeowners than urban residents, which can direct their political interests toward issues such as property taxes, an issue that is less important to most urban residents whoare more likelytorent property.45 Rural residents are also more likely to be gun owners and, as a consequence, are less likely than others to support gun-control policies.46 Table 2.2 illustrates some of the differences in lifestyle characteristics of urban and rural Americans.

While it is little surprise that rural communities leaned Republican in 2008 (see figure 2.2), what is more interesting is that rural and urban divisions are increasing. The voting patterns of rural and urban residents differed only slightly in 1976. However, by 2004, George W. Bush dominated in rural America, winning roughly three of every five votes there. Obama performed slightly better than Kerry in rural counties in 2008, but he also increased the Democrats’ winning margin in urban counties. As Bishop’s latest research demonstrates, “Republican and Democratic counties were entirely different kinds of places. The average population of an Obama landslide county was 278,601. The average McCain landslide county had 37,475 people.”47 These aggregate patterns suggest that communities are growing more politically polarized. It would come as little surprise, then, to see some evidence of a culture war between urban and rural communities.

#### The Partisan Gap

Several studies note that partisan polarization has increased over the past several decades. Democrats and Republicans hold significantly different opinions on numerous political issues (see chapter 9). This partisan polarization even extends to evaluations of the president. According to one account, “Evaluations of presidential performance have become much more divided along party lines since the 1970s and evaluations of George W. Bush in 2004 were sharply divided along party lines. Ninety-two percent of Republican voters approved of Bush’s performance and 70 percent strongly approved; in contrast, 86 percent of Democratic voters disapproved of Bush’s performance and 69 percent strongly disapproved. Evaluations of George W. Bush were more divided along party lines than those of any president since the University of Michigan’s National Election Studies survey project began asking the presidential approval question in 1972.”48

Preferences of Democrats and Republicans also differ significantly on a number of issues, with Democratic voters expressing quite liberal views and Republican voters quite conservative views. Perhaps, most important, evidence indicates that these differences are not driven by a small group of party activists. As one study reports, “Active participants are not a small group of left-wing and right-wing extremists. They are a large minority of both parties’ primary voters.”49 Perhaps not surprisingly, Democrats and Republicans are also sharply divided on cultural issues. Democrats are significantly more likely than Republicans to support the legalization of abortion, gay rights, and an equal role for women in society.

The dominant explanation for the growing gap between Democrats and Republicans is the partisan realignment of the South. Conservative southerners, once a dominant bloc in the Democratic Party, began to drift to the Republican Party in the 1960s. Issues related to race (notably the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the 1965 Voting Rights Act, and the 1967 Open Housing Act) contributed to realignment, although some recent evidence also attributes the change to rising incomes in the region.50 As the South transformed, there began a steady decline in conservative southern Democrats. As southern conservatives moved into their more natural home in the Republican Party, another significant change also occurred in the South. Democrats gained African American voters in the South, who gained the vote following reforms, such as the Voting Rights Act of 1965. These changes fundamentally altered the base of the two parties. The Republican base became more conservative, and the Democratic base became more liberal.

Indeed, there is evidence that indicates the Democratic electoral coalition is more liberal and includes a greater percentage of minorities than in earlier decades (see table 2.3). The Republican coalition, in contrast, has become less moderate and more conservative. In the words of one scholar, “moderate-to-conservative whites made up 59 percent of Jimmy Carter’s electoral coalition, but they made up only 33 percent of Barack Obama’s electoral coalition. And conservative whites made up only 48 percent of Gerald Ford’s electoral coalition but they made up 61 percent of John McCain’s electoral coalition.”51

#### The Religion Gap

There are also significant religious differences across party lines. Since the 1980 presidential election, the Republican Party has become increasingly associated with religious conservatism and “moral traditionalism.”52 White Americans who attend church regularly or identify themselves as a born-again or evangelical Christian are far more likely to identify with the Republican Party and vote for that party’s presidential candidate. In fact, religious factors are more strongly correlated with party identification and voting behavior than income, education, gender, marital status, and union membership.53 As two prominent religious scholars declare, “The fact of the matter is that there is a religious gap in American voting behavior.”54

![[chpt_fig_012.png]]

Religious political divisions were once rooted in denominational differences. Catholics and Jews voted primarily for Democrats, while Protestants tended to vote Republican. However, by the 1980s, this began to change. Divisions within respective traditions between religious conservatives and religious liberals became a greater source of conflict.55 Religious scholars Steven Waldman and John Green have divided the electorate into what they call the “12 tribes,” three of which are strong Republicans:

1. The “Republican Right”: White evangelical Protestants, constituting 12.6 percent of the electorate. They are the most conservative on virtually all issues and are the core of the so-called values voters of the 2004 election. Almost 90 percent of these voters supported George W. Bush in 2004.56
2. The “Heartland Culture Warriors”: This bloc, although it is outside of the evangelical community, is also very conservative on moral issues, and are a healthy 11.4 percent of the electorate. More than seven out of ten supported Bush in 2004.
3. The “Moderate Evangelicals”: These individuals comprise 10.8 percent of the electorate. They are culturally conservative but moderate on economic issues.

As Waldman and Green summarize, “The three red tribes make up about 35 percent of the electorate, and although their members don’t vote exclusively on the basis of cultural issues, values are certainly a key ingredient in the glue that holds the three together.”57

The religious shades of the Democratic electorate are less well understood. The common stereotype perpetuated by conservative commentators, such as Ann Coulter, is that Democrats and liberals do not worship and are even hostile to religion. She writes, “Democrats revile religion but insist on faking a belief in God in front of the voters claiming to be ‘spiritual.”’58 This assessment of the religious attitudes of Democrats is too simplistic, if not wholly inaccurate. For example, black Protestants, Jews, and Muslims disproportionately identify themselves as Democrats. While seculars are disproportionately Democratic, they comprise just 10.7 percent of the electorate.

In addition, however, there exists “a deep-blue religious left [that] is almost exactly the same size as the religious right but receives much less attention. . . . Members . . . espouse a progressive theology (agreeing, for instance, that “all the world’s great religions are equally true”) and are very liberal on cultural issues such as abortion and gay marriage. About one-quarter attends church weekly. The religious left is somewhat liberal on economic policy and decidedly to the left on foreign policy.”59

In general, however, Democratic voters are not monolithic in their views on cultural issues. As Waldman and Green explain, “Indeed, while [Democrats] are fairly well united on economic and foreign-policy issues, they’re all over the map on cultural issues. Because the Democratic coalition includes highly religious tribes, non-religious tribes, and everything in between, talking about values can be perilous.”60

Of course, the debate over how moderate Americans really are misses an important point. Americans who are active in the political process and are the best organized almost always have an amplified voice in a democracy. Thus, a small minority, such as the Religious Right, can have a significant influence in American politics. During the 1980s and beyond, the Republican Party successfully mobilized Christian conservatives to support its candidates. In the process, this has heightened party differences on social and cultural issues.61 As Linda Feldman explains, “But even if most Americans are moderates, it’s the so-called religious right—a highly motivated coalition of Evangelical Protestants, conservative Catholics, and Orthodox Jews—that is feeling the momentum. . . . Of all the factions in the Republicans’ winning coalition, religious conservatives were the most organized and energized.”62

Of course, whether the religion gap translates into cultural and political polarization is perhaps a matter of how one defines the term polarization. Both parties include religious voters, yet church attendance and the religious “tribe” that one belongs to are significant predictors of one’s political positions. In many instances, these tribes can be quite polarized on a number of cultural issues, suggesting that at least on some level, deep divisions on cultural issues exist. At a minimum, these differences translated into a significant religious gap in presidential voting (see table 2.4). Of those who infrequently attend church (a few times a month, a few times a year, or never), for example, a majority supported Barack Obama. By comparison, John McCain won majorities from those who attend church once a week or more.

### CONCLUSION

Significant debate has emerged about whether a culture war rages in the United States. Certainly, as history suggests, cultural issues have long divided the nation and continue to divide at least some Americans today, particularly those who are active in politics. Whether these differences translate into a “war” involving most Americans is less clear. On the one hand, as Morris Fiorina observes, the United States does not resemble a nation in which the political battleground is dominated by “Maoist guerillas and right-wing death squads [that] shoot at each other.”63 Moreover, the 2008 election was dominated by the issue of the economy. Moral issues barely registered as a top issue in any survey or exit poll of the 2008 election.

On the other hand, there is evidence of polarization at the aggregate level and there are some clear gaps in individual-level voting behavior that divides large segments of the American population. Geographic, religious, and partisan gaps have grown over time. While these gaps do not prove the existence of a culture war, the geographic patterns and clustering of Americans into like-minded communities certainly raises the strong possibility that culture matters in American politics. As James Davison Hunter notes, “Politics is sexier than culture . . . but culture is more profound than politics. It’s prior to, and it leads, politics. And therefore it is more important than politics in tracking the nature of the social order, and its changes.”64

## The Myth of Independent and Swing Voters

Despite decades of political science research, many commonly held assumptions about voting are not as simple as some political observers portray them to be. For example, during each election cycle Americans are treated to any number of news accounts that discuss the growing numbers and power of two related species: the independent and the swing voter.1

The much-vaunted independent voters are those who have eschewed attachments to either of the two major parties. Popular accounts often portray these voters in a favorable light for shunning party labels and for making their voting decisions based on a thorough examination of the issues of the day and the candidates’ stands on them. The independent voter is therefore the virtuous citizen, voting in a manner consistent with the model presented in high school civics courses. Swing voters are typically portrayed in a similar way, waiting to make their voting decisions until the last minute, after all of the information from the campaign has been received and processed. They too are reluctant to allow partisanship to dictate their vote.

According to many media accounts, these voters comprise a growing percentage of the electorate. These same accounts typically focus on their lack of party attachments and the idea that they have the power to decide the election. However, when political scientists examine how people actually cast their votes, rather than how they see themselves, it is clear that partisanship within the electorate has actually increased in the past forty years. In other words, in terms of voting behavior, there are actually few “true” independents, or those that entirely disregard political parties when casting their vote. Moreover, to focus on the relatively small percentage of individuals who cast their vote independent of the influence of political parties is to ignore the overwhelming number of those who do consider party in their voting decision. In other words, to say independent and swing voters decide elections is misleading. In spite of hyperbole to the contrary, partisans decide elections.

### THE INDEPENDENT VOTER

A widely held tenet of American politics is that since the 1950s the numbers of independent voters have grown. News accounts of the partisan preferences of American voters routinely reflect this belief. Headlines proclaim that the number of “independent voters [is] burgeoning” and that “more voters are steering away from party labels.”2 Because they are growing in number these so-called independents are presumably the most important bloc of voters in any given election. One recent headline sums up the conventional wisdom: “Independent voters hold [the] key.”3

Not surprisingly, those who cover or study American politics frequently equate the increased numbers of independent voters with the decline of political parties. One well-known American government textbook is explicit, referring to the “decline of both parties and resultant upsurge of independents.”4 A book from the early 1970s sounded the alarmist note that “the party’s over.”5 One of the leading texts on party politics is a bit less dramatic but still suggests that “the American electorate is somewhat less partisan now than it was prior to” the 1960s.6

In fact, it is true that the number of people registering as independent has been increasing over the past fifty years.7 If we examine the traditional measurement of partisan identification, there has been a rise in independents since the 1950s. This is consistent with a trend toward what some refer to as partisan dealignment,8 or a growing movement away from attachment to parties within the electorate. A good deal of research suggests that political parties are increasingly seen as being less central to government and the political system. It is difficult for many people to see how political parties are relevant. Many, in other words, are not nonpartisans as much as they are apartisans.9

There is, however, more to the story. In 1952, the Survey Research Center and the Center for Political Studies of the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan conducted a wide-ranging national survey related to the presidential and congressional elections. They conducted similar surveys in the thirteen presidential and midterm elections that followed. In 1977, the National Science Foundation began funding these surveys and, in the process, established the National Election Studies (NES).10 The stated mission of the NES “is to inform explanations of election outcomes by providing data that support rich hypothesis testing, maximize methodological excellence, measure many variables, and promote comparisons across people, contexts, and time.”11

One of the many questions that the NES has asked over the years concerns partisan identification, or the psychological attachment, if any, an individual feels toward a political party. For most political scientists studying American elections, the data provided by the NES represent the gold standard. The interviewer asks respondents, “Generally speaking, do you usually think of yourself as a Republican, a Democrat, an Independent, or what?” Other choices include “other” and, starting in 1966, “no preference.” If the respondent answers either “Republican” or “Democrat,” there is a follow-up question: “Would you call yourself a strong (Republican/Democrat) or a not very strong (Republican/Democrat)?” If the respondent answers “independent,” “other,” or “no preference” to the first question, the question that follows is “Do you think of yourself as closer to the Republican or Democratic party?”12

The importance of the NES surveys for the study of voting behavior would be difficult to overstate. After an initial study produced in 1954, the research team in 1960 produced what is arguably the most important work in the study of American voting behavior, The American Voter.13 This book alone has spawned a veritable mountain of research since its publication, produced by several generations of scholars. Thousands of political scientists have used NES data and it is impossible to study American voting behavior without coming face to face with the theories and conclusions of The American Voter.

One of the primary findings of the book is that the majority of voters cast their ballots based on their partisan identification. While some have challenged the central role of partisan identification in vote choice,14 over time research has clearly demonstrated its powerful influence. This partisan identification develops primarily during childhood under the influence of one’s parents.15 While some have questioned the validity of the NES partisan identification measure,16 it has stood the test of time and is now a standard component of how political behavioralists model the study of voting. Other polling organizations (e.g., Gallup) ask similar questions measuring this concept.

The reason many claim that independent voters are growing in number and importance, is that the number of people answering “independent” to the first party identification question has increased, and fairly significantly, since 1952. Measured in this way, the percentage of independents has almost doubled (from 22.6 to 38.9 percent) in the past half century (see table 3.1).

However, if we examine this group of independents further and include their responses to the second question, we see that the percentage of people who claim to be closer to neither party is rather small. This fits with an intuitive understanding of what an independent actually is. Table 3.2 presents the data again but this time divides the independents into three categories: those who claim to “lean” toward one of the two major parties, as well as the “pure” independents. Although the percentage of these pure independents has fluctuated over the past fifty years, it has never constituted more than 14.6 percent (in 1976) of the electorate and currently hovers only near 8 percent. Figure 3.1 shows the mean percentage of partisans and leaners, and pure independents, by decade. Again, while there is an increase in the percentage of independents during this time, it is hardly dramatic.

![[chpt_fig_014.png]]

One conclusion to draw from these data is relatively straightforward: it is not necessarily the measure of partisan identification that is the culprit in propagating the myth of the independent voter but rather how some have used the data from this measurement. A second problem is that an understanding of how leaners and independents actually vote receives short shrift. For example, most leaners are actually partisans in their voting behavior. And as suggested earlier, partisans tend to be loyal to candidates from their own party. Table 3.3 shows, for example, that Democratic leaners actually increased their partisan loyalty in presidential elections from 1952 to 2004, with better than 70 percent voting with their party. While Republican leaners showed a decrease for the same period, they are far from independent, given that three-quarters vote Republican. In other words, partisanship clearly matters when it comes to voting.

![[chpt_fig_015.png]]

![[chpt_fig_016.png]]

![[chpt_fig_017.png]]

As for the true independents, there are significantly fewer of them than popular accounts typically portray. Moreover, the lessons of The American Voter, as well as subsequent analyses (e.g., Keith et al.’s Myth of the Independent Voter) need to be remembered. Research strongly suggests that many independent voters are neither attentive to, nor involved in, politics. While they might be independent, many are not politically active, and they vote at much lower rates than do partisans.17 It is a mistake, in other words, to focus too much on how these individuals might vote in any given election, because many simply will not.

### WHAT ABOUT SWING VOTERS?

Perhaps no other group of Americans is celebrated in news accounts throughout presidential campaigns more than the elusive18 and all-powerful swing voters. Accounts describe them as being nothing short of “supervoters,”19 or individuals “that decide national elections.”20 In 2008, one popular website went so far as to include an “interactive calculator” to help readers determine for themselves if they belonged in this category.21

There are several problems with this focus on so-called swing voters. First, there is no common, agreed-upon definition or understanding of what a swing voter is. “Political science has committed to neither a single term nor a common definition for this phenomenon.”22 Many, it seems, are actually the independents discussed earlier. Second, even using the most generous definition of a swing voter, they constitute only a minority of the voting public. Third, in terms of their actual voting behavior, many behave in a partisan manner. This too is consistent with the earlier discussion of independents. Finally, political science research strongly suggests that swing voters actually “decide” very few elections.

So, who are the swing voters? The little amount of research that has been done on the subject suggests that in terms of demographics, the answer to this question varies from election to election.23 It is, for example, entirely too simplistic to lump them into a single category like soccer moms, NASCAR dads, etc.

How is the concept defined? “For the layperson, a commonsense definition of swing voting would be voters whose candidate preference tends to be variable, and whose ultimate decisions will determine the outcome of the election.”24 New organizations, polling firms, and journalists typically favor the first formulation. In fact, in the past several election cycles the American public has been treated to numerous stories of specific types of swing voters, such as soccer moms, security moms, NASCAR dads, wired workers, and other groups who might vote for either candidate in a particular election.25 These types of stories hold high news value because of the clever labels they bestow on certain types of voters. But alone, these labels provide the foundation for shallow election analyses.

Political science does not provide an agreed-upon way to conceptualize a swing voter. A recent review of possible definitions includes individuals who are “relatively uncertain about who they will vote for,” “persuadable” or “potentially persuadable,” “up for grabs,” those who have “not developed a committed preference for one candidate,” and “undecided.”26 Political scientists have a few different concepts that seem to correspond, if only imperfectly, to this understanding. For example, Philip Converse identified a class of less-engaged, less-informed individuals he termed “floating voters,” or those who might be persuaded to vote for either party’s candidate.27 V. O. Key, Jr. identified a different group of (also less informed) voters he referred to as “party switchers,” or those who might cast their ballot for the candidate from one party in one election and the other party’s candidate in the next.28 These two possibilities illustrate one of the problems in coming to a common definition of a swing voter: does the concept refer to voting behavior in a single election (floating voters) or across multiple elections (party switchers)?

The way that most news organizations and polling firms define a swing voter is based on what are referred to as “strength of support” questions in pre-election polling. Since 1944, for example, Gallup has attempted to gauge the level of commitment poll respondents have toward their preferred (if any) candidate. For example, in 2004, those who expressed a preference for Bush in the standard question “if the election were held tomorrow, for whom would you cast your vote?” were then asked “are you certain now that you will vote for Bush for president, or do you think you may change your mind between now and the November election?” Those who claimed that their intention was to vote for Kerry were asked a similar question. Respondents who claimed that they might change their mind “between now and the November election” are usually classified as swing voters.29

It is also common to include as swing voters those who claim to be undecided at the time the question is asked, and, those who claim to be “leaning” toward one candidate or the other after expressing no preference. However, there is some evidence that the “undecided” vote may be over-reported, perhaps due to the fact that respondents may be reluctant to tell the interviewer what their preference is.30

Like the Gallup organization, the Pew Research Center first asks people their presidential preference. In 2004, those expressing support for a candidate (e.g., Bush) were asked a follow-up question measuring the strength of that support: “Do you think there is a chance you might vote for John Kerry in November, or have you definitely decided not to vote for him?”31 Here again, the same question was also asked of Kerry supporters. Supporters stating that there was a chance they might vote for the other candidate were typically classified as swing voters. Other polling organizations employ similar strategies to measure strength of support for a candidate throughout the campaign, with the idea being that the weakly committed might be considered swing voters.32 Here too, the undecided voters and those with no preference but who are leaning toward a particular candidate are often categorized as swing voters.

The point is that these strength of support questions help pollsters determine who the committed voters are. All others are treated as swing voters. By this measure, swing voters may make up as much as three-quarters of the electorate, depending on which election is examined and at what point during the campaign the question is asked. One problem is that this measure is so broad that it makes the concept almost meaningless. Swing voters cannot at the same time be a critical subgroup of the electorate and a majority of the electorate. Moreover, as noted, there is no consensus that this is the proper way to determine what a swing voter is. Recent research by two political scientists using a different method suggests that the actual percentage of “persuadable” voters (those not firmly committed to either candidate) from 1972 through 2004 might be closer to one-fifth of the electorate.33

In fact, research has shown that many of the so-called swing voters are self-identified independents,34 most of whom (as this chapter has shown) exhibit partisan voting patterns. Others have found that many of the so-called persuadable swing voters—those who express only soft support for their candidate—vote for their preferred candidate in the end.35 In 2004, as many as 85 percent of Bush supporters who said there was a chance they might vote for Kerry voted for Bush. The percentages for Kerry were similar.36 While the percentages of soft supporters voting for their preferred candidate have been lower in previous elections, research suggests that election campaigns reinforce existing preferences, as opposed to changing minds.37 Relatively few people, in other words, are actually persuaded—few minds are changed—during a campaign.

Finally, and this is perhaps the central question, do swing voters decide elections? As already noted, they are not a majority of the electorate, which means that numerically speaking it would be difficult to see how this might be the case. We also know that as a group, these voters are less engaged in politics in general, not to mention the campaign in particular,38 do not really start to focus on the campaign until the fall, and their numbers decrease as the campaign wears on. Finally, in the end, many do not even vote.39 In a fairly sophisticated analysis, a prominent political scientist who specializes in the dynamics of electoral choice and presidential elections determined that since 1952, the only winning presidential candidate that needed the swing vote bloc (as he defined and measured swing voters) to win was John Kennedy in 1960.40 Swing voters, it seems, only decide elections in rare circumstances.

### CONCLUSION

The conventional wisdom that independent and swing voters are a growing segment of the electorate and decide elections oversimplifies the more complex reality of American election campaigns. As this chapter has illustrated, despite increases in the percentage of self-identified independents, independent leaners are quite partisan at the polls, casting legitimate doubts as to whether independents are truly increasing in number and importance. Similarly, even if we could identify who swing voters were with any precision, there are probably fewer than is popularly believed, and, in almost all cases they do not, as a bloc, decide elections.

In short, two of the most widely discussed aspects about American voters—the rise of the independent voter and the importance of the swing voter—require several caveats and a more nuanced discussion than popular accounts typically provide. The plain fact is that most voters are influenced by political party preference, soft as it may be, in most elections. Parties still do, in other words, matter.

## Misconceptions about  
Campaign Finance Reform

## What Regulations Have and  
Have Not Accomplished

In 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court declared in McConnell v. FEC that “money, like water, will always find an outlet.”1 Nevertheless, the court upheld the constitutionality of campaign finance regulations enacted under the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) of 2002. The majority concluded, “What problems will arise, and how Congress responds, are concerns for another day.”2

In the aftermath of McConnell v. FEC, several political observers immediately hailed the decision as essential to protecting American democracy from the influence of big money and special interests. One reform organization declared that BCRA “helps ensure the removal of the corrupting influence of ‘soft money’ from federal elections” and that it “represents a home run when it comes to limiting the influence of special interests in our elections.”3 Another reform advocate added, “The Supreme Court decision [in McConnell v. FEC] to uphold the constitutionality of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) brought to an end the corrupt soft money system that had engulfed federal officeholders and the political parties for nearly two decades.”4

Yet, some have argued that BCRA has been largely unsuccessful in accomplishing its overriding objectives. One member of Congress declared BCRA a “failure.”5 Former Federal Election Commission Chairman Bradley A. Smith observed, “If one thought McCain-Feingold [BCRA] would reduce the time candidates spend raising money or that it would keep money—big money, soft money, corporate money, union money, little money or lots of money—out of politics, they were sadly mistaken. Moreover, few would dare to argue that McCain-Feingold has ‘cleaned up the system.’ The era of McCain-Feingold is the era of disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff, former Reps. Bob Ney (R-Ohio) and Duke Cunningham (R-Calif.), and cash in Rep. William Jefferson’s (D-La.) fridge.”6 Another prominent columnist went so far as to declare in the title of his article that “campaign finance reform enables corruption.”7 Even a noted and distinguished scholar on campaign finance concluded, “BCRA is bad politics, bad regulation, and bad democracy.”8

Despite reformers’ and opponents’ black-and-white assessments of BCRA, there is considerably more gray area when it comes to evaluating the success and failure of campaign finance reform. This chapter attempts to make some sense of what campaign finance reform has been able and unable to accomplish at the national level. We begin with a history of campaign finance reform and review the promises of reformers. Following that discussion, we examine each of the specific goals of reform efforts and examine whether reforms that eventually became law have met these goals or whether they have largely failed. We conclude with an overall assessment of the campaign finance system.

### HISTORY OF CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM

The role of money in American politics has long been a controversial subject. Stories about wealthy industrialists contributing vast sums of money to political candidates go back more than a century. William McKinley (who served as governor of Ohio from 1891–1895 and as president from 1897–1901), for instance, was helped throughout his political career by Ohio millionaire Mark Hanna. According to various accounts, Hanna contributed $100,000 to McKinley for his 1896 campaign for president (an amount worth more than $2.5 million in 2009).9 McKinley also had the financial backing of big corporations, business owners, and executives, including Standard Oil and J. P. Morgan, which each gave $250,000 ($6.3 million in 2009) to his campaign.10 The deep pockets of those with corporate interests reportedly helped McKinley outspend his opponent, William Jennings Bryan (a populist who held positions at odds with big business), by as much as ten to one.11 The excessive financial assistance to the McKinley campaign from the financial sector prompted some of the earliest calls for Congress to institute rules and restrictions on campaign finance.

Indeed, charges of vote buying and voter coercion were common in elections in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, as were allegations of graft in the legislative and policymaking process. Throughout this period, big business hired lobbyists (or what some derisively called lobby “barons”) who were reported to have “a well lined purse with which to entertain and to distribute money ‘where it would do the most good.”’12 Political cartoons frequently cast leading political figures from the period as corrupt. James G. Blaine, a U.S. senator and presidential contender, was famously depicted as a “tattooed man” with each tattoo representing an expression of corruption (see figure 4.1). Cartoonist Thomas Nast was well-known for his work highlighting bribery, fraud, and graft in government (see figure 4.2).

As political corruption worsened, investigative journalists, known as “muckrakers,” brought abuses to the public’s attention. In response to public outcry from the muckrakers’ stories, reformers, known as “progressives,” called for new federal laws to limit the power and influence of large corporations and industrialists. They advocated anti-trust laws as well as restrictions on corporate lobbying and campaign contributions from big business. Progressives also sought to empower citizens with reforms such as the referenda, the initiative, recall elections, secret ballots, and the expansion of the franchise to women.

Congress took its first major steps to reform the nation’s campaign finance system following charges that President Theodore Roosevelt (who replaced McKinley after McKinley’s assassination in 1901) exchanged favors with corporate and banking interests for their financial support of his 1904 presidential campaign.13 Unable to quell the suspicion of improper dealings, Roosevelt, in his address to Congress in 1905, proposed a federal law eliminating all corporate contributions, and requiring disclosure of campaign expenditures. Led by its sponsor Senator Ben Till-man of South Carolina, Congress responded by passing the Tillman Act of 1907, which banned corporations and interstate banks from contributing directly to federal candidates.

In later years, Congress passed further regulations on campaign contributions. The first federal disclosure requirements (i.e., public reporting of campaign contributions and expenditures) took effect in 1910 (for U.S. House elections) and in 1911 (for U.S. Senate elections). Congress also set limits on campaign expenditures for all congressional candidates. The Federal Corrupt Practices Act of 1925, which served as the primary law regulating federal campaign finance for much of the twentieth century, attempted to strengthen these disclosure requirements and expenditure limits.14

However, the reforms from the early 1900s never created a regulatory agency to monitor and enforce campaign finance rules and restrictions. Instead, the law relied on congressional oversight, which due to partisan pressures proved to be highly ineffective. Early reforms also failed to establish a clear and comprehensive set of penalties for those who violated the law. Candidates could avoid liability for violating the spending limit and disclosure requirements simply by claiming to have no knowledge of spending done on their behalf. Consequently, campaign finances remained effectively unregulated and lacked proper disclosure.

By the second half of the twentieth century, broadcast television advertising became the dominant means of campaign communication, creating increased demands on candidates to raise money. With costs escalating to campaign for federal office, Congress passed the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) in 1971 (along with the 1971 Revenue Act). The law, which took effect on April 7, 1972, required full reporting of campaign contributions and expenditures, as well as spending limits on campaign advertisements (which were later repealed) and an initial system of public financing of presidential elections. Unfortunately, Congress again failed to provide for a single, independent body to monitor and enforce the law.

Shortly after FECA’s passage, pressure once more built for Congress to strengthen campaign finance laws when news surfaced that Richard Nixon’s Committee to Re-Elect the President (CRP, or what some referred to as “CREEP”) laundered campaign funds to pay those responsible for breaking into the Democratic National Committee’s headquarters at the Watergate hotel in 1972.15 When it became known that President Nixon was involved in a direct cover-up of the scandal, Nixon was forced to resign from office in 1974. The totality of the Watergate scandal helped move Congress to strengthen FECA.

### THE 1974 AMENDMENTS TO THE FEDERAL  
ELECTION CAMPAIGN ACT

The modern structure for campaign finance regulations comes from a series of comprehensive amendments to FECA that Congress passed in 1974. As originally constructed, the 1974 law outlined five major provisions: (1) campaign contribution limits; (2) campaign spending limits; (3) disclosure of contributions and spending; (4) public financing in presidential elections; and (5) the creation of the Federal Election Commission to enforce the law.16

However, the Supreme Court weakened FECA’s restrictions on expenditure limits in 1976. The Court ruled in Buckley v. Valeo (1976), that while contribution limits were constitutional to help prevent corruption or the appearance of corruption, spending money was a form of free speech protected by the First Amendment. This invalidated most limits on campaign expenditures. The Buckley ruling, for instance, entitles political committees and individuals to spend unlimited amounts of their own money in federal elections if the expenditures are independent of the candidates’ campaign organizations.17

In 1979, Congress also allowed individuals and interest groups to give unlimited amounts to political parties for the purpose of party-building activities and to help state and local candidates. This unregulated “soft money” soon became a way for companies, labor unions, and wealthy individuals to make very large contributions that sometimes reached into the hundreds of thousands of dollars or more. Although donors did not give these contributions to any particular federal candidate, political parties often earmarked this money to particular races for issue advocacy and generic party advertising.18 (Soft money could also go to pay for a portion of the party organization’s overhead expenses, for construction and maintenance of party headquarters, and for transfers to state and local party committees.) When the Court ruled in Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. Federal Election Commission (1996) that political parties could make unlimited campaign expenditures provided that they were independent of the candidate, party leaders began aggressively soliciting soft money contributions from businesses and wealthy individuals.19

The Court later allowed interest groups to spend unlimited amounts to advocate issues, but only if the advertisements did not include “express advocacy” (defined by the Court as “explicit words of advocacy of election or defeat” such as “vote for,” “re-elect,” “help defeat”). In general, the Court has applied rather loose standards for what constitutes express advocacy. In FEC v. Christian Action Network (1992), for example, the Court found that an ad using President Bill Clinton’s face, which morphed into black and white, and stated that Clinton supported “militant homosexual” causes, was not express advocacy because it did not use the words, “vote for” and “vote against.” This meant that wealthy supporters, corporate profits, or membership dues could finance any advertisements if they avoided express advocacy. Interest groups began to rely on what appeared to be thinly-veiled campaign ads disguised as issue advocacy spots that carefully avoid the words “vote for” or “vote against.” These rulings effectively eroded contribution limits.20

Increasing sums of soft money began to flood federal elections in the 1990s. By the 2000 election, for example, Republican national party committees raised nearly $250 million in soft money—an increase of 81 percent from the previous presidential election. Likewise, Democratic national party committees raised $245 million in soft money—an increase of 98 percent from four years earlier.21 By 2000, soft money made up 47 percent of the funding of the Democratic national party committees and 35 percent of the Republican national party committees.22

Soft money contributions were often very large, which concerned groups and citizens argued had the capacity to influence the actions of Congress and distorted the equality of the political process. Critics of the system added that large soft money contributions, which average citizens could not afford to give, amplified the voices of the wealthiest Americans and created an environment ripe for corruption.23

Equally as troubling for reformers was the fact that many organized groups were using issue ads (instead of campaign ads), which avoided the law’s disclosure requirements. Additionally, some charitable organizations and political committees, known as 501(c) and 527 committees, rather than political action committees (PACs), often financed issue ads (for a description of PACs, 501(c), and 527groups, see box 4.1). These committees do not report to the FEC, but instead to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). This created disclosure problems because the IRS reporting forms were neither comprehensive nor timely. Critics also charged that issue ads were not transparent, because it was difficult and often impossible to trace who was funding them. Organized interests were able to create new organizations with innocuous-sounding names, such as Citizens for Reform.24

As more and more money poured into political campaigns during the 1990s, familiar arguments against the system once again surfaced. Critics charged that various court rulings, advisory opinions, and other developments had rendered FECA obsolete. Candidates continued to face intensifying pressure to raise funds, and with money again effectively unregulated and meaningful disclosure all but absent, pressure built on the need for a new round of reforms. This pressure grew especially strong following a serious financial scandal involving the corporation Enron. After the company’s collapse, reports surfaced that Enron and its executives had used soft money donations to help the company avoid federal regulations.25 By 2002, Congress acted to reform the campaign finance system by passing the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA).

BOX 4.1

WHAT IS A PAC, A 501(C), AND A 527 GROUP?

What is a PAC? A political action committee is a legal entity formed by an organized group (a corporation, union, interest group, citizen action group, etc.) whose purpose is to raise money for, and make contributions to, the campaigns of candidates for federal office.

What is a 501(c)(3) group? A 501(c)(3) group is a nonprofit organization that may not engage in partisan political activity, and lobbying cannot be their principal activity. Issue advocacy, voter registration, and voter mobilization are allowed, but only if these activities are nonpartisan. Contributions to these groups are tax-deductible.

What is a 501(c)(4) and 501(c)(6) group? Similar to 501(c)(3) groups, but they may engage in unlimited lobbying and partisan political activity provided that neither activity is their primary purpose. Contributions to these groups are not tax-deductible.

What is a 527 group? 527 groups are political committees, including political parties and candidate campaign committees. Some 527 organizations, however, avoid FEC regulations because they are focused on “issues” and not on electioneering activities. Contributions to these groups are not tax-deductible.

### THE BIPARTISAN CAMPAIGN REFORM ACT

One of BCRA’s major changes was to institute a ban on soft money contributions to political parties in an effort to eliminate the large six-figure donations that had become increasingly common throughout the 1990s. The new law also mandated that state and local parties fund their federal activities with hard money (i.e., regulated money). Limited exceptions, known as “Levin Amendment” funds, existed only for state and local parties to pay for voter registration and get-out-the-vote activities with soft money limited to $10,000 per source (if allowed under state law).26

BCRA also redefined what qualified as “electioneering communications” in an effort to close the loophole that had allowed for a surge of issue advocacy advertisements throughout the second half of the 1990s. Under the new definition, interest groups could run broadcast ads that name a federal candidate within thirty days of a primary or sixty days of a general election, but only if they now used funds that were subject to federal limits (PAC funds as opposed to treasury funds) to pay for the advertisements. However, the law still allowed for large contributions to various interest groups that could run issue ads, although there were limits on these ads, as well as new standards for identifying campaign ads. Under the new law, campaign ads included those that mentioned a candidate by name or appeared on television or radio during the period of intense campaigning before the election. PACs could still fund these ads as independent expenditures, but they could only do so with funds raised through hard money contributions.

While most of BCRA’s provisions tightened restrictions on money, the new law did increase the amount that individuals could give to federal candidates from $1,000 per election to $2,000 with the amount indexed for inflation ($2,400 for the 2009–2010 election cycle) to make it easier for candidates to raise money (and hence spend less time on the fundraising trail). The law also increased the amount that individuals could give to political parties and indexed the amount for inflation ($30,400 per calendar year in the 2009–2010 election cycle) to help compensate for the parties’ loss of soft money funds (for a complete listing of all contribution limits, see table 4.1). BCRA, however, did not ban large contributions to various interest groups that established 501(c) and 527 committees.

Critics of the law offered several dire forecasts immediately following BCRA’s passage. These included predictions that the ban on soft money would weaken political parties, and that BCRA’s ban on soft money would disproportionately harm the Democratic Party and its candidates. As it turns out, both predictions later proved incorrect. Nevertheless, other problems have emerged under BCRA. In the section that follows, we discuss what BCRA has and has not been able to accomplish.

### LIFE AFTER BCRA: SUCCESSES

As noted above, critics of BCRA made several immediate predictions, including one that BCRA would weaken political parties by making it more difficult for them to raise the funds they needed to communicate with voters. While the BCRA law increased the maximum hard money limit that an individual could contribute to a national party committee, it also banned soft money donations, which parties had become increasingly reliant upon throughout the 1990s. The loss of soft money to the parties seemed unlikely to offset any gains that would come from the increased hard-money limits. Indeed, litigants led by the Republican National Committee in the Supreme Court case McConnell v. FEC (2003) argued that parties would not only weaken, but that interest groups would likely fill the void and grow more powerful. According to the plaintiff’s principal brief, “BCRA will not only weaken political parties in absolute terms; it will weaken them relative to special interest groups like the NRA, the Sierra Club, and NARAL.”27

![[chpt_fig_020.png]]

However, in the two presidential elections since BCRA went into effect, the concerns that parties would struggle to raise funds and grow weaker has not happened. Hard money totals for the national party committees increased by amounts great enough in the BCRA era (2004 and 2008) to top the combined hard and soft money totals in 2000—the most recent pre-BCRA election (see table 4.2). Indeed, during the 2008 election, the national party committees raised an overall total of $1.239 billion compared to $1.09 billion in 2000—an overall increase of $149 million.28

Independent expenditures, which allow parties to carry out advertising campaigns in areas with competitive elections, also increased in 2008 from earlier pre-BCRA elections. Local, state, and national Democratic party committees spent a combined total of more than $156 million in independent expenditures in 2008 compared to just $2.3 million in 2000. Similarly, local, state, and national Republican party committees spent a combined total of more than $124 million in independent expenditures in 2008 compared to just $1.6 million in 2000.29

![[chpt_fig_021.png]]

National parties also have raised increasing sums of money from small donors. The amount raised by the national party committees in contributions of $200 or less increased by $129 million from 2000 to 2008.30 The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), for example, raised just $9.9 million in 2000 in contributions of $200 or less compared to $30.9 million in 2008—a three-fold increase.31 Likewise, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) saw its totals from small donations of $200 or less increase from $8.4 million in 2000 to $24.6 million in 2008.32 These figures illustrate that national party committees have returned to grassroots fundraising efforts. This represents a major success for BCRA reformers.

BCRA also did not disproportionately harm the Democratic Party as many predicted. The Democratic Party’s past dependence on large soft money donations suggested that it might struggle to raise money in the smaller hard money amounts required under BCRA. However, as table 4.2 shows, the combined receipts of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), DSCC, and DCCC in 2008 were $599.1 million—an amount $129.2 million more than the totals that these same party committees collected in 2000 when soft money was legal. Moreover, in 2008, the Republican national party committees’ traditional advantage over the Democratic national party committees shrunk considerably in 2004 and 2008 from 2000. Republican national party committees raised $149.8 million more than Democratic national party committees in 2000 ($619.7 million to $469.9 million).33 Yet without the ability to raise soft money, Democrats cut the Republican advantage to $70.8 million in 2004 ($657.1 million to $586.3 million) and to $41.2 million in 2008 ($640.3 million to $599.1 million).34

It also should be noted that the Republican Party’s advantage in 2008 may have been inflated by the fact that the Republican presidential nominee, John McCain, accepted public funds for the general election while the Democrats’ nominee, Barack Obama, did not. After McCain received the public grant and could no longer raise private donations, he encouraged Republican donors to contribute to the Republican National Committee (RNC). McCain also transferred roughly $18 million left over from his campaign to the RNC. Private donations on the Democratic side, by contrast, went mostly to the Obama campaign rather than the DNC. This dynamic resulted in a considerable monetary advantage for the RNC, which raised nearly $216 million more than the DNC.35 However, when one considers that the Obama campaign was able to raise $318 million in private donations during the short general election cycle, it seems plausible to speculate that Democratic Party totals would have been considerably higher and likely even topped those of the Republican national party committees in 2008.36

### LIFE AFTER BCRA: FAILURES

While BCRA did not experience many of the problems anticipated by opponents, it failed to resolve a number of issues that reformers had hoped to correct. Consistent with the “hydraulic theory” of campaign finance (i.e., “money, like water, will always find an outlet”), large contributions by wealthy donors continued to find their way into American elections despite BCRA’s campaign regulations. In 2004, for example, millionaire George Soros contributed $23.7 million to 527 organizations.37 Peter Lewis of Progressive Corp. and Steven Bing of Shangri-La Entertainment gave another $23.2 million and $13.9 million respectively to 527 groups in 2004.38 Research from the Campaign Finance Institute also revealed that nearly three-quarters of the funds that 527 committees raised in 2006 came in contributions of $100,000 or more.39 In 2008, thirteen individuals topped the $1 million or more mark in donations to 527 groups.40 These figures make clear that BCRA did little to slow the ability of wealthy individuals to invest their money in American elections.

BCRA also did little to affect the volume of advertising by interest groups or to curb the activity of so-called special interests. Under BCRA, 527 and 501(c) groups were quite active. In 2004, for example, a series of advertisements sponsored by the 527 organization Swift Boat Veterans for Truth generated enormous national attention for their attacks on Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry. Four years later, numerous pro-Republican 501(c) groups, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ($36.4 million), Freedom’s Watch ($30.2 million), and the Employee Freedom Action Committee ($20 million), campaigned against the presidential candidacy of Barack Obama in several battleground states.41 Advertisements from pro-Republican 501(c) groups included topics such as Obama’s supposed connection to William Ayers (an activist during the 1960s and 1970s who founded the radical left-wing organization the Weather-men, which bombed public buildings in an effort to end the Vietnam War) and Obama’s pastor, Jeremiah Wright, whose harsh criticism of American foreign policy and other political subjects drew significant public controversy.42

Democratic-leaning 527 groups were also very involved during the 2008 election. Two of the top three spenders among 527 groups in 2008 were labor groups: the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) ($32.9 million) and the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) ($27 million).43 The third top spender, America Votes ($17.6 million) was a coalition made up of various progressive groups, but with organized labor again playing a significant role.44 Other progressive groups, such as the pro-environment Sierra Club, the League of Conservation Voters, Defenders of Wildlife, and the Natural Resources Defense Council, as well as women’s and pro-choice groups such as Planned Parenthood, EMILY’s List, and NARAL Pro-Choice America worked closely together in support of Obama.

Overall, interest groups spent considerably more in 2004 and 2008 than in past presidential campaigns before BCRA. This included not only increased advertising expenditures, but also grassroots efforts. The AFLCIO and its fifty-six affiliated unions, for example, launched the largest mobilization program in history, spending a reported $250 million on a twenty-one state effort that included seventy-six million phone calls, fifty-seven million pieces of mail, and twenty-nine million flyers to prospective voters.45 Given this high level of activity and the significant amount of money spent by various organized interests, especially the Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO, BCRA fell well short of hitting a “home run” on limiting the influence of special interests in elections as some proponents of the law had predicted.

Finally, new problems emerged with the campaign finance system in 2008. While BCRA made several significant revisions to the original FECA law, it did not reform the public finance system for presidential candidates. Under the law, presidential candidates can accept partial funding of primary election campaigns and full funding of their general election campaigns. The system is funded through a $3 check-off box that taxpayers have the option to select when they file their federal income taxes.

To receive public funds in the primary (also known as matching funds), a candidate must: (1) seek nomination by a political party to the office of President; (2) raise more than $5,000 in each of at least twenty states; and (3) agree to spending limits. Candidates who qualify and wish to receive matching funds are eligible for a subsidy matching the first $250 of any contribution from an individual (e.g., a contribution of $50 is worth $100 whereas a contribution of $1,000 is worth $1,250).

As noted already, BCRA doubled the individual contribution limit from $1,000 to $2,000 and indexed the amount for inflation ($2,300 in 2008). The law, however, did not increase the portion of individual contributions matched by the federal government in presidential elections. While under FECA, the federal government matched the first $250 of contributions that were capped at $1,000, it matched only the first $250 of contributions capped at $2,300 in 2008, making matching funds slightly less attractive under BCRA.

The presidential public finance system also sets a maximum amount that candidates are able to receive in matching funds. In 2008, presidential primary candidates who accepted public funding had a maximum entitlement of just over $21 million. Candidates who accept matching funds must also agree to an overall spending limit (which is indexed for inflation). The expenditure limit was just over $50 million per candidate in 2008 including fundraising, legal, and accounting costs (with spending limits for each individual state that vary with the state’s population).

These limits, however, have failed to keep pace with the escalating costs of presidential campaigns. Moreover, in the event of a competitive primary, candidates run the risk of spending their entire allocated amount by the early spring of the election year, barring them from further spending until the late summer when the national parties hold their conventions. Undoubtedly, these strategic considerations played a role in the decision of nearly all of the major candidates for president in 2008 to refuse public funds, including Democrats Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, and Republicans Rudolph Giuliani, Mitt Romney, and John McCain.

The general election subsidy is available to the two major-party nominees (as well as the nominees of a minor party that earned at least 5 percent of the popular vote in the previous election). In 2008, the nominees of the Democratic Party and the Republican Party were eligible for a general grant of $84.1 million each. Every major-party candidate, from Ronald Reagan to George W. Bush to John Kerry, accepted the general election grant from the program’s inception in 1976 through 2004. This changed, however, when Barack Obama declined the public grant in the 2008 general election. The $318 million that Obama ultimately raised for the general election in private contributions gave him a considerable advantage in his contest with John McCain.

Obama’s overwhelming success casts some serious doubt on whether future presidential candidates will participate in the system. Oddly enough, the spending limits that Congress implemented to repair the damage of the Watergate scandal and to decrease the influence of wealthy donors, may ultimately prove to be the cause of the system’s undoing. Of course, there are some important differences between Obama’s 2008 campaign and Nixon’s 1972 campaign. Obama raised a record sum of money, but much of it came from modest-sized contributions, unlike the huge checks that the Nixon campaign received. Indeed, one could certainly argue that Obama attained a result consistent with the goal of many reformers—he democratized the campaign finance system not by limiting money, but ironically by adding much more of it from those making small and medium-sized donations.

### CONCLUSION

Campaign finance reform has been an important policy subject for more than a century. As history has shown, controlling the influence of wealthy donors and the flow of money in American elections has proven to be a challenge. The federal government’s most recent attempt with BCRA has already sparked significant controversy, with opponents and supporters of the law drawing very different conclusions about its successes and failures.

However, as this chapter has demonstrated, the full truth about BCRA is more complicated. To its credit, BCRA has succeeded in severing the direct link between the huge soft money donors who wrote six-figure checks and political parties. As BCRA co-sponsor Senator Russell Fein-gold explained, “The point [of BCRA] was to break the connection between the officeholders and the money.”46 By forcing political parties to raise hard money only, they have become less reliant on excessively wealthy donors and consequently have become more reliant on grass-roots fundraising. Much the opposite of what many scholars predicted, BCRA has made national party organizations stronger rather than weaker. BCRA also accomplished this without disproportionately harming the Democratic Party as some opponents claimed would result.

Nevertheless, BCRA has fallen short in several other areas. Wealthy donors continue to play a role in American elections through excessive contributions to 527 and 501(c) groups. These 527 and 501(c) groups continue to flood the airwaves with advertisements paid for with soft money, creating a situation not unlike the problems that plagued FECA in the late 1990s. Perhaps most alarming to supporters of regulating the campaign finance system, the 2008 election saw virtually every prominent presidential candidate opt out of the public finance system during the primary phase, and even saw a major-party nominee decline public funds in the general election for the first time since the public finance system went into effect. The overwhelming success of the Obama campaign likely spells the meaningful end of presidential public finance as constituted under FECA.

Undoubtedly, the axiom—“money, like water, will always find an outlet”—is consistent with the American experience with campaign finance reform. Campaigns constantly evolve and discover new ways to raise funds. To some, this reality simply represents another challenge for a new generation of reformers to tackle. To others, it only illustrates the continuing futility of campaign finance reform. While it is difficult to predict what the future ultimately may hold for the laws that govern the campaign finance system (especially in an era with a more conservative U.S. SupremeCourt), thelargerdebateabout thesuccesses andfailuresof campaign finance reform will certainly remain a controversial issue in American politics.

## The “Veepstakes”

## Balancing the Ticket and Other Myths  
about Vice Presidential Selection

Every four years political observers, commentators, and experts spill a great deal of ink predicting who the eventual winner of the presidential nomination will select as his or her vice presidential candidate. This exercise, known as the “veepstakes,” has become one of the most entertaining sideshows of the presidential election season. In fact it is so popular that speculation often starts a full year before the presidential nomination has been decided.1 In June of 2008, one writer counted over eighty names that had been mentioned as vice presidential possibles for either John McCain, Hillary Clinton, or Barack Obama in news articles, opinion pieces, and expert commentary—and this compilation ignored most blogs and other essays written by ordinary citizens.2

However, one observer, noting the sheer volume of articles on the subject and their largely speculative nature has labeled the veepstakes a “largely fact free parlor game.”3

To be fair, some veepstakes speculation is based on a fairly good understanding of the process of vice presidential selection. But much of this understanding, which constitutes the majority of the conventional wisdom on the subject, is rooted in a historical view of selecting a running mate. In fact, most of the conventional wisdom on this subject centers around the idea of balancing the presidential ticket. Historically this has meant selecting an individual from a larger state, in a different region of the country, and a different faction or ideological wing of the party (or both) from that of the presidential candidate.

However, in the past several decades the conventional wisdom about what matters in the selection of a presidential running mate has been discarded by presidential candidates and their advisers in favor of a much more complex model. And, while many observers understand this, it is difficult to factor in all of the favorable characteristics of a running mate into a short news story or op-ed piece. This is likely why most accounts continue to focus mainly on balancing the ticket with the vice presidential pick.

In the next section of this chapter we discuss this historical model of vice presidential selection. Following that we introduce the modern model. In each section the focus is the same: the method of selecting presidential running mates and what types of individuals are selected. We will see that in the modern era the process of making the choice is much more systematic, and the factors that presidential candidates seem to consider in making the choice are more numerous than in the historical era.

### THE HISTORICAL ERA OF  
VICE PRESIDENTIAL SELECTION

Until fairly recently the vice presidency was considered to be a consolation prize of sorts. The office had few formal or informal responsibilities, and as the result of this, few men aspired to the office. In fact, history is filled with examples of notable political leaders who refused the vice presidential nomination. In 1848, Daniel Webster declined to run on the Whig ticket with Zachary Taylor, saying “I do not propose to be buried until I am really dead and in my coffin.”4 Most individuals who did run and serve as vice president in the nineteenth century were decidedly mediocre in terms of their qualifications.5

Because the office was considered to be a political dead end prior to the middle of the twentieth century, little energy or effort was expended in the process of selecting the individual who would round out the ticket. One observer noted, “very little pains are bestowed on the election of a vice-president.”6 After the selection of the presidential candidate was made by delegates at the party national convention, attention turned to the selection of his running mate. The convention’s decision rarely took very long, and balloting for the vice presidential candidate hardly ever took more than one or two votes.

The overriding concern in the selection of a running mate during this period was how to best “balance” the ticket. Other factors, like the idea that a vice president should be somewhat compatible with the president, were not considered. In truth there have been any number of vice presidents who openly defied their presidents. John Calhoun, for example, actively worked in the Senate to oppose the policies of both of the presidents he served under (John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson), and George Clinton did not attend the inauguration of his president (James Madison). In fact, many vice presidents in the nineteenth century did not even live in Washington, and of those who did, many did not meet with their president more than a few times.7

The issue of competence was not considered during the selection process either. While vice presidents and vice presidential candidates in the historical era were not completely unqualified, they were generally not men of great stature or leadership caliber, at least when compared with other leaders of the time or with vice presidential candidates in the modern era.8 One authoritative account from the time noted:

The convention . . . usually [gave] the nomination to this post to a man in the second rank, sometimes as a consolation to a disappointed candidate for the presidential nomination, sometimes to a friend of such a disappointed candidate in order to “placate” his faction, sometimes to a person from whom large contributions to the campaign fund may be expected, sometimes as a compliment to an elderly leader who is personally popular.9

The overriding concern in the selection process during this period was political: How could the vice presidential selection help the ticket win? This is where the issue of balance came into play.

While there was no precise formula for balancing the ticket, there were several considerations that were almost always followed, all of which were designed to broaden the appeal of the ticket, as well as unify the party. First, the vice presidential candidate typically represented a state that was from a different region of the country than the home state of the presidential candidate. From 1804 through 2008, for example, only eleven of the major party presidential tickets have not been regionally balanced. The most recent of these was in 1992 when Bill Clinton of Arkansas selected Al Gore of Tennessee, another southerner. This was done in part to broaden the appeal of the ticket in the South, a region that Democratic presidential candidates have had difficulty winning since 1968.10

American political parties have always been broad-based coalitions of a variety of interests. This is inevitable with a two-party system in a country as large and diverse as the United States. The modern Republican Party is a loose coalition of southern evangelical Christians, fiscal conservatives, anti-government individuals hailing from the Intermountain West, and foreign policy hawks. Balancing the ticket regionally was frequently an attempt to add factional balance as well. Beyond broadening the appeal of the ticket, this was done to unify the party. Since the presidential nomination could only go to a representative of one faction of the party, the vice presidential nomination was used to mollify other wings or sects within the party. This practice can be seen in the modern era as well, and is often reduced to ensuring that the ticket has a certain ideological balance. The more liberal John Kennedy, for example, selected the more conservative Lyndon Johnson in 1960; Gerald Ford, a moderate, selected the more conservative Bob Dole in 1976.11

A final consideration in selecting a presidential running mate had little to do with balance, but was also politically motivated. Vice presidential candidates were usually selected from states that had a large share of Electoral College votes. This was done because it was assumed, or hoped, that the vice presidential candidate could help win the state for the ticket. New York state, which commanded anywhere from eight to fifteen percent of available Electoral College votes, fielded fourteen of the forty-eight vice presidential candidates from 1804 through 1896. Conversely, only two came from Maine: Hannibal Hamlin, Republican, in 1860 (2.6 percent of available Electoral College votes), and Arthur Sewall, Democrat, in 1896 (1.3 percent). Recent exceptions to this rule were the selection of Republican Dick Cheney in 2000, and Republican Sarah Palin and Democrat Joe Biden in 2008, each of whose home states (Wyoming, Alaska, and Delaware, respectively) have approximately one-half of one percent of available Electoral College votes.12 As a historical footnote, presidential tickets have only carried the vice presidential candidate’s home state approximately 50 percent of the time.13

In short, the main objective of the vice presidential pick in the historical era was to unify the party and ensure that the ticket had a broad appeal, in order to prevail in November. This translated into a desire to balance the ticket regionally and ideologically, and to select a candidate from a state rich in Electoral College votes. When pundits attempt to forecast the vice presidential pick, these factors play heavily into their predictions. However, in the modern era, the process of selecting a running mate has become far more complex. We turn to a discussion of the modern system next.

### THE MODERN ERA OF  
VICE PRESIDENTIAL SELECTION

Vice presidential selection has changed dramatically in the past fifty years. To begin with, while delegates at the party’s national convention still formally nominate and select the vice presidential candidate, this process only ratifies the choice that the presidential candidate has made. Second, the process by which the selection is made by presidential candidates is longer and more complicated. Finally, the qualities and characteristics of modern vice presidential candidates have changed as well. While the historical factors of balance and state size still matter, a number of other considerations, including experience in public office, enter into the decision-making process as well.

One of the reasons for this new focus on experience is the increased prominence of the office of the vice presidency. Starting in the middle part of the twentieth century, the vice president has come to be seen as a more important player in the American system of government. This change occurred slowly, mainly as the result of concerns over presidential succession. These concerns began when Harry Truman assumed the presidency after the death of Franklin Roosevelt in 1945 without knowing an atomic bomb was close to completion. President Dwight Eisenhower had a heart attack in 1955 and other health problems, and John Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. In 1972, Democrat George McGovern asked his vice presidential nominee, Thomas Eagleton, to withdraw from the ticket after it was discovered that he had undergone electric shock treatment. And in 1973, Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned in the face of corruption charges, followed by Richard Nixon’s resignation in 1974.14 All of these events served as high-profile reminders that the vice president is only “one heartbeat away” from the presidency.15

In large part because of these increased concerns over presidential succession, vice presidents began playing a more important role in their presidents’ administrations. Although the formal role of the vice president has not changed (he or she is the president of, and breaks tie votes in, the Senate, and assumes the presidency in the event of presidential vacancy), vice presidents, starting with Richard Nixon (1953–1961) began taking on a number of informal roles. These included traveling abroad to meet with foreign leaders, campaigning for the party’s congressional candidates in the mid-term elections, and acting as presidential spokesperson, presidential adviser, and other, more specialized tasks. Al Gore, for example, was charged with streamlining the federal bureaucracy with his “Reinventing Government” initiative; Dick Cheney was put in charge of crafting a new and comprehensive energy policy; and Joe Biden is responsible for ensuring that monies from the 2009 economic stimulus package are spent as intended.16

Changes in how vice presidential candidates are selected began in 1960, when for the first time, the presidential candidates (John Kennedy and Richard Nixon) selected their own running mates. Previously, as noted, this choice was made by the convention, although there had been some movement toward giving presidential candidates a say in the matter beginning with Franklin Roosevelt. Of course, candidates consult with any number of advisers and party and interest group leaders, but the choice is now theirs.17 The fact that the decision maker in the process has changed should, by itself, suggest that the model for understanding what types of candidates get selected has changed.

The selection process underwent another dramatic change in the 1970s. As the result of the shift to the primary system of selecting presidential candidates, the presidential nomination is now decided long before the party convention begins. This gives the presumptive presidential nominee a great deal of time to examine the experience, personal background, and political ramifications of his or her possible choices. Jimmy Carter was the first presidential candidate to engage in this lengthy vetting process in 1976, using the five weeks between the end of the primary season and the start of the convention to first narrow a list of four hundred possible candidates down to approximately twelve names. His chief pollster Pat Caddell “then tested the relative strengths of these names” and further narrowed the list of possibilities to seven. The campaign team then examined each of these extensively and Carter met with each to discover how compatible each would be with him, both in terms of policy and personality.18

If Carter’s eventual choice, Walter Mondale, had been a poor vice president, this method of selecting a running mate may have become a historical footnote. In fact, Mondale is widely acknowledged to have been an excellent vice president, the first example of the new model of active vice presidents.19 The Carter model of extensively vetting vice presidential possibles has become the new standard. What was formerly a hasty and haphazard process—at best—is now lengthy and fairly systematic. The vetting process is typically headed by someone who enjoys the complete trust of the presidential candidate. In 2000, for example, Warren Christopher, who had headed Bill Clinton’s search in 1992, headed Al Gore’s search, while Dick Cheney was in charge of the process for George W. Bush.20 Obama relied on Jim Johnson until he resigned over controversy surrounding his Washington insider status, while McCain’s search was headed by Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee.21

Finally, in terms of changes in the modern era, the list of characteristics considered when choosing a modern vice presidential candidate has expanded well beyond the historical factors discussed earlier. In part this is because of the increased visibility of the office. In addition, because presidential candidates are now the ones selecting their running mates, they can pay attention to more personal factors like compatibility. A lengthy vetting process allows more factors to be examined and considered, and the selection is made in context of a different social and political environment that forces presidential candidates to factor in characteristics once not considered important. So what qualities are modern presidential candidates looking for in their selection of a running mate? We turn to that question in the following section.

### VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES  
IN THE MODERN ERA

Given the amount of attention paid to the veepstakes by political observers, it is difficult to believe that the characteristics of vice presidential candidates have not been extensively studied. Perhaps this is because most observers are confident that the conventional wisdom about balancing the ticket is correct. Or, it might be the case that the poor reputation of the office and the men who occupied it for so many years made the subject seem unimportant. In either case, it remains the case that the subject is relatively understudied. It has only been in the past ten years or so that five studies have been published which systematically examine this question.22

It is important to note here that these few studies examine not only the characteristics of vice presidential candidates, but also those who were considered for the ticket but were not chosen. In other words, research on the selection of the running mate must take into account the entire field of serious possibilities for the selection, typically about a half-dozen people. The eventual nominee is being compared to these other individuals. Their names are usually leaked at some point just prior to the announcement of the selection, and confirmed in accounts written after the campaign has concluded. Table 5.1 lists the eventual nominees, the year they ran, and their presidential running mates from 1960 to 2008.

An examination of the characteristics of vice presidential nominees shows how complex this decision has become. Not every candidate possesses all of the qualities that statistical analyses suggest are important in the selection process. This is due to the fact that statistics rely on probabilities, not certainties. In other words, the best that a statistical analysis can tell us with regard to this question is what qualities are likely to be important to presidential candidates in their decision making.

We begin with what these studies have found with respect to the historical factors. Research has confirmed the idea that presidential candidates seek to balance their ticket regionally.23 In 2008, for example, the midwestern Obama (IL) selected the northeastern Joe Biden (DE), while John McCain (AZ), a westerner, selected Sarah Palin of Alaska. In fact, only two tickets since 1960 have not been regionally balanced: Republicans Gerald Ford (MI) and Bob Dole (KS) in 1976 (both midwesterners) and Democrats Bill Clinton (AR) and Al Gore (TN) in 1992 (southerners).

On the other hand, research suggests that in the modern era, ideological balance is no longer important in the ticket-balancing equation.24 While measuring the ideological orientation of a politician is not a precise science, there have been many instances in the past few decades where the presidential and vice presidential candidates were from the same ideological wing of the party. For example, the elections of 2000, 2004, and 2008 all featured ideologically unbalanced tickets. In 2008 both Obama and Biden could fairly be classified as relatively liberal. Likewise, Democrats John Kerry and John Edwards in 2004 were liberals; Al Gore and Joe Lieberman in 2000, moderates; George W. Bush and Dick Cheney in 2000, conservatives.25 In fact, a full 50 percent of the tickets since 1960 have not been ideologically balanced. Ideologically balancing the ticket still occurs (e.g., Republicans Bob Dole and Jack Kemp in 1996), but it is no longer as important as in years past, and is not significant from a statistical standpoint.

![[chpt_fig_022.png]]

Similarly, state size seems to matter less in the modern era as well. In 2008, for example, neither Joe Biden nor Sarah Palin offered more than three potential Electoral College votes to the ticket. A similar situation prevailed in 2000 with Dick Cheney, who registered in Wyoming (three votes). As it happens, the number of Electoral College votes in the candidate’s home state is less important than how competitive the state is.

As one expert notes:

Although presidential tickets have carried the home state of the vice presidential candidate 17 of 24 times (71%) since 1960, coming from either a safe state or a state the ticket has no chance of winning would seem to offer no electoral advantage. On the other hand, selecting a running mate from a competitive state might boost the ticket’s chances of winning that state.26

While there are different ways of determining which states are competitive, we can safely conclude that they are not states that the candidate is sure of winning or losing.

Having said this, not all vice presidential candidates come from competitive states. For example, the Obama campaign was probably not concerned about winning Biden’s Delaware, a state that had gone Democratic since 1992. Similarly, the last time Palin’s Alaska voted for a Democratic candidate was in 1964. Recent examples notwithstanding, statistical analysis confirms the idea that since 1960, the competitiveness of the vice presidential candidate’s home state matters.27 In 2004 John Kerry’s selection of John Edwards was in part made in an attempt to win North Carolina, although the last time the state had voted for a Democratic candidate was 1976 (for Jimmy Carter). In 1992, Clinton’s selection of Gore may have been a reflection of the fact that his home state of Tennessee was perceived to be competitive. In fact, the Democratic ticket carried Tennessee in both 1992 and 1996, reversing Republican wins in 1980, 1984, and 1988.

One of the more common misconceptions in the modern era is that the presidential candidate might select their main rival from the primary season for the nomination. This is simply not the case. In fact, the modern vice presidency is built around the premise that the vice president is the president’s loyal lieutenant. Because of this, a bitter primary struggle that leaves hard feelings all but precludes the nominee from selecting his main opponent. This, perhaps more than anything, was why Hillary Clinton was reportedly not even considered among the finalists for Obama’s eventual selection, or why George W. Bush’s main rival, John McCain, was never considered in 2000.28

On the other hand, if the nominee’s main opponent either withdraws from the race soon after it becomes obvious they will not win the nomination, or, stays in the race but does not campaign too aggressively, there is some chance of being selected. In 2004, for example, after it became clear that John Kerry would win the Democratic primary, John Edwards withdrew and began campaigning for him. Similarly, although Ronald Reagan’s main rival, George H.W. Bush, had earlier criticized Reagan, he withdrew from the race at an early stage and backed away from earlier criticism of him. Although Joe Biden was not Obama’s main opponent in 2008, he withdrew after the first contest without making any harsh public comments about Obama. The point is that doing well in the presidential primaries is no guarantee that one can eventually secure the vice presidential nomination.29

Having served in some capacity in the military seems to have been a significant factor in vice presidential selection since 1960, although this may be changing. Since 1960, only seven vice presidential candidates (of a total of twenty) have not served in the military, but only two of these ran prior to 2000 (Hubert Humphrey in 1964 and Geraldine Ferraro in 1984). Since 2000, all five vice presidential candidates (Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman, 2000; John Edwards, 2004; Sarah Palin and Joe Biden, 2008) had no military experience.30

In addition to military experience, youth seems to be a desirable factor in selecting a vice presidential candidate in the modern age. The average age of a vice presidential candidate since 1960 is fifty-four years. Joe Biden was older than this average at the time of his run in 2008 (sixty-six), but only nine years older than the average age of those who were being considered by Obama. Biden is the second-oldest vice presidential candidate in the modern era, behind Lloyd Bentsen, who ran with Democrat Michael Dukakis in 1988. At sixty-seven, Bentsen was twelve years older than the average age of those being considered by Dukakis. Sarah Palin, on the other hand, was forty-four years old, twelve years younger than McCain’s possible choices. The youngest candidate during this time period was Dan Quayle (Republican, 1988), who at the age of forty-one was eleven years younger than the average of all the candidates George H. W. Bush was considering. Al Gore was forty-three at the time he ran with Bill Clinton in 1992, also eleven years younger than the group average. In all, nine of the candidates from this period were younger than the average of the group that was being considered.31

There are two other important factors in the vice presidential selection process that have emerged in the modern era. The first is political experience. Despite the recent example of McCain selecting the relatively inexperienced Palin, the trend in this regard is to draw from a more experienced pool of individuals. For example, of the twenty vice presidential candidates since 1960, twelve have come from the U.S. Senate. Only two have come from the House of Representatives: William Miller, who ran with Republican Barry Goldwater in 1964, and Geraldine Ferraro, Democrat Walter Mondale’s running mate in 1984. Others have brought other high-level experience to the ticket (e.g., Dick Cheney was Secretary of Defense under George H. W. Bush).32 Only two candidates had only sub-national government experience (Spiro Agnew and Sarah Palin) before their run for vice president.

Unlike vice presidential selection in the historical era, political experience has become an important factor in the selection process. The good news here is that political experience may translate into competence or fitness to assume the presidency in the event of a presidential vacancy. In other words, modern vice presidential candidates are probably more qualified than their pre-modern counterparts. This is ironic. The original, pre–Twelfth Amendment system for selecting a vice president was to take the second-place winner in presidential balloting. This almost guaranteed that the vice president was of presidential caliber. The Twelfth Amendment relegated one candidate on the ticket to the second spot, all but ensuring that great leaders would not seek the position.33

The average candidate for vice presidential office in the modern era brought nineteen years of governmental experience to the ticket, of which only five were spent in sub-national (local and/or state government) office. Some few were exceedingly qualified. In 1960, Democrat Lyndon Johnson had twenty-five years of experience in national government, with twenty-three of those in Congress; his opponent, Henry Cabot Lodge brought twenty-three years of experience to the Republican ticket. Similarly, in 1964 the Democrat Hubert Humphrey boasted of twenty-one years’ experience, his opponent William Miller, eighteen years. In 2000, Dick Cheney could claim twenty-one years of public service, while his Democratic opponent Joe Lieberman had twenty-five years. The candidate with the most experience in the modern era was Joe Biden, who had thirty-eight years of experience in government, thirty-six of which were in the U.S. Senate.

Of course there are exceptions to this trend toward selecting more competent running mates. In 1968, for example, Richard Nixon selected the moderately well-known governor of Maryland, Spiro Agnew, as his running mate. Agnew had a total of nine years of government experience. Like the campaign against Sarah Palin in 2008, his inexperience was blatantly exploited throughout the campaign by the Democrats. After Thomas Eagleton withdrew from the Democratic ticket in 1972, George McGovern selected Sargent Shriver, who had seven years’ appointive experience in various national government agencies. In 1980 Ronald Reagan selected George H. W. Bush, who only had nine years of experience in government. In 1984, Walter Mondale selected little-known, three-term House member Geraldine Ferraro, who had a total of ten years of government experience. George H. W. Bush’s choice in 1988 was Dan Quayle, who had served two relatively undistinguished terms in the U.S. Senate. John Kerry’s choice in 2004 was John Edwards, a first-term U.S. Senator with no other political experience. And in 2008, John McCain selected Sarah Palin, who, in spite of having served for twelve years in local and state politics, was widely perceived to have been under-qualified.34

The point is that there is now a great deal of pressure to select a running mate capable of assuming the presidency. Presidential tickets that ignore this pay a heavy political price, as was the case with Nixon-Agnew in 1968, Bush-Quayle in 1988, or McCain-Palin in 2008. While it is true that Agnew and Quayle became vice president, the campaign worked overtime to counter claims they were not qualified.

A final factor that has emerged as significant in the selection process is attention from, or exposure in, the national media. This has become especially important in the Carter model of vice presidential selection, since presidential candidates must do extensive vetting of their possible choices. Allowing the media to do this, wittingly or otherwise, makes good sense.

No presidential candidate has the resources to fully research every aspect of a potential vice president’s background . . . [presidential] nominees have increasingly in recent years turned to . . . people who not only have been fully investigated but also have extensive experience dealing with the national media.35

Few candidates want a surprise similar to the one McGovern received in 1972 about Thomas Eagleton’s psychiatric history. It has been argued that one of the reasons Dan Quayle had the reputation for being less intelligent than some is the fact that the Bush campaign surprised the media by selecting a relative unknown and Quayle mishandled some early appearances.36 Regardless of how qualified and competent Sarah Palin may actually be, the McCain campaign’s biggest mistake was selecting someone unknown to most of the media elite. Conversely, Joe Biden (2008), John Edwards (2004), Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman (2000), Jack Kemp (1996), and Al Gore (1992) were all fairly well known by media elite, and had extensive experience with and exposure in the national media. This has become the norm.37

Table 5.2 summarizes the characteristics of the twenty non-incumbent vice presidential candidates since 1960. In the next section we summarize our discussion, rating several of the most recent choices according to the analysis presented here.

### CONCLUSION: RATING RECENT VICE  
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES

Analyses of vice presidential selections since 1960, comparing the ones who were chosen to those who were not, demonstrate that the old model of understanding the process no longer suffices. While regional balance is still important, ideological balance is not. Moreover, state size is less important than whether the vice president’s home state is perceived as being competitive. Youth, military service, political experience, and exposure in the national media are also important in the modern age. As a side note, various demographic factors like gender, race and ethnicity, and religion, while often discussed in terms of balancing the ticket, are not statistically significant factors in the selection process. This is likely because the eventual selections are no more or no less diverse than the ones who are not chosen.

![[chpt_fig_023.png]]

So what of recent selections? How well do they fit this model? Bill Clinton’s selection of Al Gore in 1992 flew in the face of both geographic considerations in that both were southerners, and Gore’s Tennessee was not an extremely competitive state for the Democrats (in spite of this, the Democrats did carry the state). Gore was younger, had military experience, only slightly less than average political experience, and enjoyed an average amount of exposure in the national media. Bob Dole’s selection of Jack Kemp in 1996 brought regional balance to the ticket, and Kemp came from New York, at the time a fairly competitive state. While slightly older, he also had military experience, a higher than average number of years in government, and exposure in the national media.

In 2000, both Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman brought regional balance to their respective tickets, but Cheney’s Wyoming was not a competitive state whereas Lieberman’s Connecticut was. Both men were slightly older, neither had military experience but both had an above average number of years of political experience. Of the two, Cheney had a great deal of exposure in the national media, while Lieberman had an average amount. John Edwards in 2004 provided the Democratic ticket with regional balance, and, North Carolina was somewhat competitive, although the ticket did not carry the state. He was young, but boasted no military service and little political experience. He did, however, have a higher than average level of exposure in the national media.

Finally, in 2008, Barack Obama selected Joe Biden, which balanced the ticket regionally, but with a non-competitive state that the ticket would surely have won otherwise. Biden is older, and he too lacks military experience. However, he brought a wealth of experience to the Democratic ticket, as well as a relatively high profile in the media. The selection of Sarah Palin by John McCain also added regional balance to the ticket, but with a state that was similarly non-competitive. She is young, but like Biden lacks military experience. However, unlike Biden, she had a relative lack of political experience, and virtually no exposure in the national media.

So why did McCain select Palin, especially given the controversy that the choice generated? One of the reasons why the veepstakes will never be a perfect science is that presidential candidates select their running mate in part to emphasize or de-emphasize a particular aspect of their own candidacy. These decisions are, almost by definition, idiosyncratic, and cannot be captured effectively in a statistical model.

For example, one of the reasons Bob Dole selected the energetic Jack Kemp was to offset the impression that Dole was dour. Al Gore’s selection of Joe Lieberman was made in part because Gore wanted to distance himself from the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, and Lieberman was the first Democratic senator to denounce Clinton publicly. John Kerry selected John Edwards in part to bring a charismatic personality to the ticket. McCain’s selection of Palin can be understood in this light. First, it was unconventional (to state it mildly), emphasizing his reputation as a “maverick.” Beyond this, it helped mobilize support from the previously lukewarm Republican base of evangelical Christians.

Whether this was a strategically sound move by McCain is open to debate. However, it does, along with the analysis presented here, highlight the idea that predicting vice presidential selection is rather complex, dependent on a number of factors. The notion of regional and ideological ticket balancing with a selection from a large state is a good way to understand vice presidential selection in a previous era, but no longer suffices.

## Myth or Reality?

## Presidential Campaigns  
Have Become Nastier

In almost every election, political observers comment on the declining quality of political campaigns. One of the most frequently made charges is that negative campaigning has grown worse over the years. In 2008, for instance, a political observer characterized the presidential election as history’s “longest, meanest and most expensive.”1 Opinion pieces flashed headlines with titles such as, “McCain Campaign is the Ugliest Ever.”2 Others involved in the campaign made accusations about the shrill content of their opponents’ campaign attacks. Cindy McCain, the wife of John McCain, commented to a newspaper in Tennessee that the Obama campaign had “waged the dirtiest campaign in American history.”3 Obama’s running mate, Joe Biden, countered that the McCain team was “running the most scurrilous campaign in modern history.”4

This reaction was due, at least in part, to some controversial attacks that surrounded the 2008 presidential election. Some charged that the McCain campaign was attempting to scare voters about Barack Obama using attacks akin to the “Swift Boat accusations of 2004” and the “racist Willie Horton ads of 1988.”5 Specifically, critics of the McCain campaign cited its efforts to label Obama as a socialist, a traitor, and as someone who “pals around with terrorists,” a desperate and even dangerous attempt that was “sowing the seeds of hatred and division.”6 Obama supporters noted that the McCain advertisements, such as those connecting Obama with 1960s radical Bill Ayers, had contributed to a hostile environment best illustrated by a McCain supporter who screamed “Kill him!” (in reference to Obama) at a rally led by McCain’s running mate, Sarah Palin.7

Republicans noted that the Obama campaign used “coded language” about McCain’s age and health (McCain was seventy-two years old as the campaign reached the general election phase and would have been the second oldest president to be inaugurated).8 Conservatives were especially upset with some of the harsh attacks by Obama supporters against Sarah Palin. A McCain campaign spokesman explained that the Obama campaign had “compared Palin to a Nazi sympathizer and called her a secessionist. . . . They’ve unfairly dug into her past . . . and attacked Palin’s family.”9 When asked to comment about Cindy McCain’s contention that the Obama campaign had “waged the dirtiest campaign in American history,” the same spokesman replied, “Mrs. McCain made an observation that is based on irrefutable truth. She’s entitled to it, and we stand behind it.”10

While few can dispute the fact that the McCain-Obama contest was replete with egregious examples of political attacks, it is highly debatable that the 2008 election was the dirtiest presidential election ever. Negative campaign tactics have always played a pervasive role in American presidential elections. Opponents of Thomas Jefferson suggested that his victory would lead to the rise of atheism and the burning of the Bible.11 Andrew Jackson had to endure attacks by his political opponents that his deceased mother was a prostitute.12 These and other examples illustrate that the mean-spirited, personal attacks of American campaigns are hardly new to the political landscape.

Of course, there is a subjective nature to evaluating just how negative a campaign is. Indeed, there are slightly different definitions in the literature about what exactly constitutes negativity in a campaign, although there is some agreement that it typically involves discrediting, criticizing, or publicizing the deficiencies of the opponent.13 Some political scientists suggest that negative campaigning has had a deleterious effect on American democracy. Their research finds that negative advertisements heighten political cynicism, depress voter turnout, and reduce political efficacy.14

Others argue that negative advertisements provide important information to voters, help draw clearer distinctions between candidates, and improve voters’ recall of information and memory of the ad.15 Moreover, there is good justification for the notion that in a political campaign some mention of the opponent’s background, experience, and public record should be part of the campaign discourse. Political ads that focus on these aspects are not negative but more properly thought of as comparative. These comparative ads bring or highlight some aspect of the opposition candidate’srecordorbackgroundthat the voting public should know before they make their decision about who will best serve their interests if elected.16

Nevertheless, our intent in this chapter is not to quantify whether one campaign was more negative than another. Instead, the point of the chapter is more basic: We wish to demonstrate to the reader that the personal attacks of modern elections have long been a part of American politics. We focus on presidential elections. Although state and local elections certainly can be very negative at times, presidential races are the “Super Bowl” of campaigns, and perceptions of American elections are most heavily shaped by these contests.

In the next section we briefly review three presidential elections from the nineteenth century that stand out as particularly negative. These historical examples cast some reasonable doubt on the repeated claims that “today’s campaigns are the most negative ever.” Following this, we examine some recent campaigns, illustrating that even the worst of these have been no more negative than campaigns in earlier times.

### NEGATIVE CAMPAIGNS IN  
THE NINETEENTH CENTURY

Scholar Kerwin Swint in his book, Mudslingers, examines the twenty-five dirtiest political campaigns in history. According to Swint, four of the five dirtiest campaigns occurred in the nineteenth century. We review three of the examples from his list: the presidential elections of 1800, 1828, and 1864.

#### The Election of 1800

The election of 1800 pitted the Federalist President John Adams against his Democratic-Republican Vice President Thomas Jefferson. Besides the election precipitating the passage of the Twelfth Amendment, the election was significant in that it set a standard for negativity and viciousness that would generate notice, even by today’s standards.17 While there were legitimate differences separating the two on many issues, supporters often focused their efforts on negative personal attacks.

Adams’ supporters spread stories that Jefferson had “cheated his British creditors, obtained property by fraud, robbed a widow of an estate worth ten thousand pounds, and behaved in a cowardly fashion as Governor of Virginia during the Revolution.”18 Another attack claimed Jefferson was “mean-spirited” and the “son of a half-breed Indian squaw, sired by a Virginia mulatto father.”19 One newspaper opined that a victory for Jefferson in 1800 would result in the teaching and practice of “murder, robbery, rape, adultery, and incest” and added that the “air will be rent with cries of the distressed, the soil will be soaked with blood, and the nation black with crimes.”20 The president of Yale University believed that Jefferson’s election would result in “the Bible [being] cast into a bonfire . . . our wives and daughters [becoming] the victims of legal prostitution.”21 Others attacked him as a dangerous rebel “who writes against the truths of God’s word” and “without so much as a decent external respect for the faith and worship of Christians.”22

Jefferson’s supporters attacked Adams as a “fool, hypocrite, criminal, and tyrant.”23 Jeffersonians also planted a rumor that Adams had intended to arrange a marriage between one of his sons and one of the daughters of King George III in a plot to reunite the United States and Great Britain. Another rumor suggested that Adams had sent his running mate, General Charles Pinckney, to England on a trip to secure four mistresses, two for each of them. To these charges, Adams famously retorted, “If this be true, [then] General Pinckney has kept them all for himself and cheated me out of two.”24

While negativity swirled in both directions, the political environment favored Jefferson in 1800. Adams would garner just 39 percent of the popular vote compared to 61 percent for Jefferson. In the Electoral College vote, however, Jefferson received seventy-three of the necessary seventy Electoral College votes to win the presidency, while Adams received sixty-five. However, because the Electoral College at the time did not distinguish between votes for president and vice president, Jefferson’s running mate, Aaron Burr, also received seventy-three Electoral College votes, creating a tie and moving the election to the House of Representatives. There, Jefferson was finally elected president on the thirty-sixth ballot.25

The Twelfth Amendment eventually altered the chaotic process that ensued following the tie between Jefferson and Burr, giving the election of 1800 special historical significance. The election of 1800 was also significant in that many credit it as the first seriously contested campaign for the presidency. This first campaign set a standard for negativity and viciousness that would generate notice even by today’s standards.26

#### The Election of 1828

The election of 1828 matched incumbent President John Quincy Adams (the son of former President John Adams) of the Whig Party against challenger Andrew Jackson, a Democrat and former army general who led American troops to a decisive victory over the British in the Battle of New Orleans during the War of 1812. The election was a rematch of sorts of the previous election, which had ended in bitter controversy.

In 1824 Jackson faced Adams, as well as William Crawford and Henry Clay. Jackson garnered 41 percent of the popular vote, ten percentage points more than Adams. However, all four received votes in the Electoral College: Jackson (99), Adams (84), Crawford (41), and Clay (37). Because no candidate received a majority of Electoral College votes, the election was thrust into the House of Representatives.27 In the House, Clay was disqualified for finishing fourth (the Twelfth Amendment stipulates that the House may consider only the top three finishers). However, as the Speaker of the House, Clay wielded considerable influence, and because he deeply disliked Jackson28 threw his support to Adams. The Adams win infuriated Jackson supporters because their candidate received the most popular and the most Electoral College votes. To add to the outrage, Adams named Clay his secretary of state, prompting critics to suggest that the two had struck a “corrupt bargain.”29 This set the stage for the bitter 1828 rematch.

Jackson supporters attacked Adams for his excesses, suggesting “King John the Second” lived in “kingly pomp and splendor.”30 The charge centered on Adams’ purchase of a billiards table, which Jacksonians falsely claimed was purchased at taxpayer expense. Jacksonians also questioned Adams’ religious sincerity, claiming he sometimes traveled on Sundays and had had “premarital relations” with his wife. These attacks came despite the fact that Adams was a Puritan and, by all reasonable accounts, a devout Christian. Most outrageous was the Jacksonian claim that, while serving as the minister to Russia, Adams handed over a young American girl to Czar Alexander I.31

The Adams campaign played equally dirty in attacking Jackson. A pro-Adams political handbook claimed Jackson was “wholly unqualified by education, habit and temper for the station of President,”32 but this was tame compared to other accusations. Adams’ supporters attacked Jackson with an endless barrage of scurrilous charges that included adultery, bigamy, gambling, drunkenness, theft, and even murder. The murder charge involved Jackson’s approval to execute six militiamen for desertion during the Creek War in 1813. A pro-Adams editor described the event as “the Bloody Deeds of General Jackson,” cold-blooded murder in which Jackson sanctioned killing innocent soldiers.33

Attacks against Jackson even extended to his family. One newspaper story was particularly vicious, attacking Jackson’s mother as a prostitute. According to the account, “General Jackson’s mother was a COMMON PROSTITUTE, brought to this country by the British soldiers. She afterward married a MULATO [sic] MAN, with whom she had several children, of which GENERAL JACKSON IS ONE!!!”34 Jackson also had to endure attacks against his wife. Adams supporters spread misleading stories that Jackson’s wife, Rachel, was an adulterer and a bigamist. The story underlying the charge, however, was more complicated. Jackson’s wife had been married previously and believed she had rightfully divorced her first husband when she began her relationship with Jackson. This, however, was not the case. By the time Jackson and Rachel became aware of this, the two had already married.35

In the end, Jackson defeated Adams in the 1828 election, winning 56 percent of the popular vote and 178 of the 261 Electoral College votes. However, the victory came at deep personal cost to Jackson. His wife, Rachel, died a month after the election in December 1828. Jackson blamed Adams’s supporters for their relentless attacks against his wife, referring to them as “murderers” and vowing never to forgive them. At her funeral, Jackson declared, “May God Almighty forgive her murderers, as I know she forgave them. I never can.”36

The 1828 election certainly rises to the highest levels of viciousness in American campaigns. In fact, many scholars consider the election of 1828 to be one of the dirtiest presidential contests in American history.37 As negative as modern campaigns can sometimes become, it seems difficult to argue that the 2008 election contained anything that surpassed the attacks of the 1828 election.

#### The Election of 1864

The two principal candidates in the 1864 presidential election were President Abraham Lincoln (Republican) and challenger General George McClellan (Democrat) of New Jersey. While Lincoln is revered today as one of the greatest presidents in American history, he was not nearly as popular in 1864. The Civil War was responsible for rising death tolls and mounting financial costs, which critics suggested was Lincoln’s fault. His opponents in the Democratic Party believed that this presented them with an opportunity to win the White House.

During the campaign, Lincoln’s opponents labeled him ignorant, incompetent, and corrupt. Others went further, referring to him as “Ignoramus Abe.” Additional pejorative descriptions of Lincoln included ape, gorilla, Old Scoundrel, despot, liar, perjurer, thief, swindler, robber, buffoon, monster, fiend, and butcher.38 One critic claimed the “idea that such a man as he should be president of such a country is a very ridiculous joke.”39 Another attack involved a false story that Lincoln demanded one of his officers sing him a song while passing the bodies of dead Union solders after the Battle of Antietam.40

Other anti-Lincoln groups relied on overtly racist appeals in their attempts to discredit Lincoln. One pamphlet labeled Lincoln as “Abraham Africanus the First” for his opposition to slavery (see figure 6.1). Another was titled “Miscegenation: The Theory of the Blending of the Races, Applied to the American White Man and Negro,” and claimed that Lincoln favored “race mixing” and actively encouraged and supported the “intermarriage” between whites and blacks. Many anti-Lincoln newspapers aggressively publicized the pamphlet.41

![[chpt_fig_024.png]]

Lincoln supporters attacked McClellan personally as well, labeling him a “coward” and criticizing his “defeatism” and “lack of patriotism.”42 Some even suggested that Democratic opposition to the war constituted treason. Republicans ridiculed McClellan as “Little Mac,” and attacked his military credentials as a general, noting that he had “nothing to offer but a tradition of defeat.”43 In Pennsylvania, Republicans warned in one poster that a McClellan victory would lead to anarchy, despotism, and the end of civilization (see figure 6.2).

The election concluded with a clear victory for Lincoln and had signifi-cant implications for American history. Lincoln’s presidency would also be remembered for its high ideals. However, even “Honest Abe” could not avoid negative campaigning in the election of 1864.

### MODERN “NEGATIVE” CAMPAIGNS

Extreme examples of negative campaigning exist in the modern era as well. Similar to the nineteenth century, modern campaigns have continued the practice of ruthlessly attacking the opposition. However, unlike the nineteenth century, modern campaigns could package negative messages into thirty-second television advertisements capable of reaching millions of citizens. Television also provides a “perfect medium” for tapping into voters’ “surface feelings.”44 The emotional appeals of television can have the effect of mobilizing citizens to vote and participate in the political process.45 In the television era, two campaigns stand out as particularly negative: the presidential elections of 1964 and 1988.46

![[chpt_fig_025.png]]

#### The Election of 1964

The presidential election of 1964 was a contest between two candidates with sharply different views about the proper role of government. The political ideologies of the incumbent president, Democrat Lyndon Johnson of Texas, and his Republican challenger, Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, could not have been more different. Johnson believed in an active role for government to combat poverty, racism, and other social ills, whereas Goldwater campaigned on a conservative platform that smaller government was essential to expanding individual freedom and liberty. Indeed, Goldwater himself promised voters a “choice rather than an echo.”47

As the incumbent president, Johnson faced little serious opposition for the Democratic nomination. However, Goldwater’s nomination divided the Republican Party. Moderates, led by governors Nelson Rockefeller of New York and George Romney of Michigan, refused to support Goldwater or campaign on his behalf. Goldwater alienated Dwight Eisenhower as well, referring to his presidential administration as a “dime store New Deal.”48 When asked about the presidential prospects of Eisenhower’s brother, Milton Eisenhower, Goldwater told Time Magazine, “One Eisenhower in a generation is enough.”49 Goldwater also exacerbated tensions with moderate Republicans in his acceptance speech at the Republican convention in San Francisco, famously remarking that “extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice... [and] that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.”50 Reacting to the speech, Senator Kenneth Keating of New York and others from the New York delegation walked out of the convention in protest.

Goldwater faced not only divisions within his own party, but also was up against his own tendency to provide colorful, highly controversial public statements, which the Johnson campaign exploited. In particular, the Johnson campaign made use of several Goldwater statements in its advertisements to paint him as a dangerous, pro-war candidate. In a short twenty-second television ad, viewers saw a nuclear explosion as an announcer recites: “On October 24, 1963, Barry Goldwater said of the nuclear bomb, ‘Merely another weapon.’ Merely another weapon? Vote for President Johnson. The stakes are too high for you to stay home.”51

The aforementioned advertisement, however, is less well-known than the so-called “Daisy commercial,” which one scholar dubbed “the Mother of all televised attack ads.”52 In this ad, a young girl plucks the petals of a daisy while the ad transitions into a nuclear countdown that ends in an atomic explosion. Although the ad never mentions Goldwater by name, it clearly makes a less than subtle suggestion that Republican challenger Barry Goldwater would lead the nation into nuclear war (see figure 6.3). Interestingly, while the “Daisy” ad would go on to become one of the most controversial commercials in presidential election history, it was only aired once (on CBS’ Monday Night at the Movies, September 7, 1964). However, because the ad generated near-instant controversy, all three networks replayed it the following day. The Goldwater campaign reacted in outrage at the ad and filed a complaint with the Fair Campaign Practices Committee. The attention that the ad generated helped more people see the ad and likely increased its effects.

Perhaps equally vicious was a Johnson spot that attacked Goldwater’s opposition to a treaty banning atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons. The so-called “Ice Cream” ad suggests that Goldwater’s opposition to a nuclear test ban treaty could lead to the poisoning—and even death—of innocent children. The sixty-second advertisement features a young girl licking an ice-cream cone, while a female announcer warns of Strontium 90 and Cesium 137 (present in nuclear fallout) and the potential dangers of electing Goldwater (see box 6.1).

The Johnson campaign also went after Goldwater for his opposition to the 1964 Civil Rights Act. One ad goes so far as to tie Goldwater to the Ku Klux Klan. As a cross burns with Ku Klux Klan members in the background, a narrator quotes Robert Creel, the leader of the Alabama Ku Klux Klan, who offers his support for Goldwater, stating: “I like Barry Goldwater. He needs our help.”53 Other Johnson spots suggested that Goldwater would destroy Social Security and that he harbored animosity toward Americans living on the east coast (with one ad quoting Goldwater as saying, “sometimes I think this country would be better off if we could just saw off the Eastern Seaboard and let it float out to sea”).54 The Johnson campaign added to the assault by altering Goldwater’s slogan of “In your heart, you know he’s right,” to “In your guts, you know he’s nuts.”55

The Goldwater campaign hit back at the Johnson campaign. Goldwater ran advertisements suggesting that Johnson was corrupt and morally deficient, noting his connections to disgraced figures such as Billy Sol Estes who was involved in a scam to swindle the Department of Agriculure out of millions of dollars. In one ad, Goldwater accuses Johnson directly of “running a country” by “buying and bludgeoning votes.”56 Goldwater also used his advertisements to make dire predictions. In an ad entitled “Moral Responsibility,” Goldwater himself tells the audience that the Johnson administration was “not far from the kind of moral decay that has brought on the fall of other nations and people. The philosophy of something for nothing . . . is an insidious cancer that will destroy us as a people unless we recognize it and root it out now.”57

BOX 6.1

TRANSCRIPT OF “ ICE CREAM” AD

Female Announcer: Do you know what people used to do? They used to explode atomic bombs in the air. Now children should have lots of Vitamin A and calcium, but they shouldn’t have any Strontium 90 or Cesium 137. These things come from atomic bombs and they’re radioactive. They can make you die. Do you know what people finally did? They got together and signed a nuclear test ban treaty, and then the radioactive poisons started to go away.

But now, there’s a man who wants to be president of the United States and he doesn’t like this treaty—he fought against it. He even voted against it. He wants to go on testing more bombs. His name is Barry Goldwater. And if he’s elected, they might start testing all over again.

Male Announcer: Vote for President Johnson on November 3. The stakes are too high for you to stay home.

Like Johnson, Goldwater was also willing to use children in his ads. In one ad, a boy rides a bicycle as an announcer tells the audience, “Don’t look now young man, but somebody has his hand in your pocket. It’s the hand of big government. It’s taking away about four months’ pay from what your daddy earns every year—one dollar out of every three in his paycheck. And it’s taking security out of your grandmother’s Social Security.”58

Despite Goldwater’s counter-attacks, Johnson went on to win the election easily. Johnson won forty-four states, amassing 486 Electoral College votes to 52 for Goldwater. Johnson also won 61 percent of the popular vote, marking one of the largest landslide victories in presidential election history. However, Johnson’s victory was only part of the story. Ultimately, the presidential election of 1964 marked what one scholar claimed was the “moment when the negative TV ad was born.”59 This pioneering election certainly set a negative tone that few campaigns have since reached.

#### The Election of 1988

Vice President George H.W. Bush faced Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis in the presidential election of 1988. The election followed the two-term presidency of Republican Ronald Reagan. Bush assumed the role as Reagan’s heir apparent and pledged to continue the “Reagan Revolution” of lower taxes, famously proclaiming at the Republican convention, “Read my lips, no new taxes.” In contrast, Dukakis campaigned on a platform to balance the federal budget, which increased significantly under Reagan, and to cut military spending for increased spending on education, health care, and other social programs.

In the early stages of the election, Dukakis led in most polls.60 However, with the assistance of political consultant Lee Atwater, the Bush campaign went on the attack, calling into question Dukakis’s patriotism, ability to lead the military, environmental record, and his commitment to fighting crime. The Bush attacks effectively cut into the Dukakis lead and ultimately propelled Bush to frontrunner status in the late stages of the election.

Perhaps the most memorable negative advertisements against Dukakis was the infamous “Willie Horton” spot, which suggested that Dukakis was ineffective in fighting violent crime during his time as governor of Massachusetts. The ad featured the picture of a convicted murderer, Willie Horton, who raped a Maryland woman during a weekend furlough from a Massachusetts prison, as an announcer tells viewers, “Dukakis not only opposes the death penalty, he allowed first-degree murderers to have weekend passes from prison.”61 Significant controversy followed, with critics making charges of racism because the ad featured an African American, which some claimed was an attempt to exploit “racist fears” about crime.62 A similarly themed ad, “Revolving Door,” also attacked Dukakis’s record on crime, although without the image of Willie Horton. The ad, nevertheless, suggests that a Dukakis victory was a “risk” for the nation (see box 6.2).

The Bush campaign attempted to paint Dukakis as not only weak on crime, but also on military and defense issues. Dukakis had attempted to address this perceived problem by visiting the General Dynamics plant in Michigan and then riding in an M1 Abrams tank for a campaign photo op. While riding in the tank, Dukakis wore a large helmet and grinned awkwardly. Instead of failing to dispel the attack against him as unfit to be commander-in-chief, the so-called “Dukakis in the tank” footage became synonymous with public relations disasters. The Bush campaign used this footage to reinforce its attacks that Dukakis was not a credible military leader (see box 6.3).

The attacks against Dukakis extended in other areas as well. The Bush campaign skewered Dukakis for his record on environmental pollution, citing problems with Boston Harbor (see box 6.4). There were also false rumors spread during the campaign that Dukakis received treatment for mental illness and that his wife, Kitty, burned an American flag in protest of the Vietnam War.

The Dukakis campaign was slow in responding to the attacks, which some believe contributed to his sharp declines in the polls as the election progressed. Dukakis ultimately fought back by questioning Bush’s honesty and claiming in one ad that Bush had taken a “furlough from the truth.”63 Other ads attacked Bush for his record in the war on drugs, blamed the Republicans for increasing the federal deficit, and poked fun at the selection of Bush’s running mate, Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana, who was perceived by some as too young and inexperienced to be president. There were also rumors spread by a member of the Dukakis staff that Bush had an affair with his secretary, Jennifer Fitzgerald. Dukakis, however, failed to regain his early lead and won just 111 Electoral College votes compared to 426 for Bush.

### CONCLUSION

As noted at the outset of this chapter, the 2008 presidential election had its fair share of negative attacks. Yet, while the 2008 election contained numerous examples of nasty personal attacks, it was probably not “the dirtiest” presidential election in American history. As the examples presented in this chapter make clear, vicious personal attacks and negative campaigning are virtually as old as the republic.

BOX 6.4

TRANSCRIPT OF “ HARBOR” AD

[Text appears on screen: “Harbor”]

Male Announcer: As a candidate, Michael Dukakis called Boston Harbor an open sewer. As governor, he had the opportunity to do something about it but chose not to. The Environmental Protection Agency called his lack of action the most expensive public policy mistake in the history of New England. Now Boston Harbor is the dirtiest harbor in America. It cost residents six billion dollars to clean. And Michael Dukakis promises to do for America what he’s done for Massachusetts.

There are certainly additional examples that one could note. One could even argue that the previous presidential election in 2004 was more negative than the presidential election was in 2008. Few Democrats have forgotten a series of advertisements sponsored by the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth that attacked Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry. In one of the ads, the organization claimed that Kerry had “not been honest about what happened in Vietnam”; that he “lied about his first Purple Heart”; that he “lied to get his bronze star”; that he “lacks the capacity to lead”; that he is “no war hero”; and that he “betrayed the men and women he served with.”64 On the other side of the political aisle, filmmaker Michael Moore released an anti-Bush documentary film entitled Fahrenheit 9/11 during the summer of 2004. The two-hour film makes the case that President Bush failed to address the threat of Islamic terrorism in the months leading up to the 9/11 attacks (one scene shows Bush casually playing golf as he answers a reporter’s question about the threat of terrorism). The film then takes sharp aim at Bush’s handling of the situation in the aftermath of the 9/11 attack. The documentary generated enormous publicity in the summer months preceding the November election, and was one of the most memorable anti-Bush pieces of the 2004 campaign.

As the 2004 contest and the other elections profiled in this chapter illustrate, negative campaigning has been and continues to be a part of presidential elections. Future elections will undoubtedly bring about the familiar calls that the current election is the “most negative ever.” Such lines certainly make for flashy headlines and provocative quotations; however, as the historical record rather plainly suggests, these claims come much closer to hyperbole than they do to reality.

## Science or Voodoo?

## Misconceptions about  
National Election Polls

I re-word Winston Churchill’s famous remarks about democracy and say, “Polls are the worst way of measuring public opinion . . . or of predicting elections—except for all of the others.”

—Humphrey Taylor, chairman of the Harris Poll.1

Public opinion polls are ubiquitous. Rarely does a day pass without a major newspaper, such as USA Today, featuring the results of some poll. The frequency of polls only increases during an election season, and this is especially true during a presidential election. However, many people do not understand enough about polling to be able to interpret polls accurately. To make matters worse, media outlets occasionally misrepre-sent the results of polls. Pollsters themselves also miss the mark from time to time, providing forecasts and predictions that fail to materialize. This raises a few questions: Can national election polls be trusted? Are poll-sters really able to gauge what Americans believe? One poll conducted in 2000 suggested that only 2 percent of Americans believe that national polls are “always right,” while almost 60 percent believe they are right “only some of the time” and 7 percent “hardly ever.”2

We offer a mixed answer to the question of whether people can trust polls throughout the election cycle. Our objective is less to dispel a particular myth than to give the reader a better understanding of the enterprise of public polling during an election. This understanding is crucial to following news stories throughout the campaign. Our goal is to give readers a set of guidelines on how to use—read, analyze, and interpret—polling results during an election.3 In the end, whether or not to trust a particular national opinion poll depends on a variety of factors.

### THE BASICS OF PUBLIC POLLING

Election polls have a long history in the United States. Since 1824, newspapers have conducted and reported the results of so-called straws, or straw polls, during presidential elections.4 Straw polls are informal polls taken to gauge public opinion (which way the wind is blowing the straw). During the nineteenth century, most newspapers were partisan publications. While newspapers purportedly used polls to give readers a sense of which candidate might be more likely to prevail, in actuality they were intended to advance the paper’s partisan agenda by giving the public the impression that the paper’s favored candidate was in the lead.

The methodology of nineteenth-century polls was hardly scientific. To conduct a poll, a journalist might ask questions of the passengers aboard a particular train or citizens attending a public gathering.5 For example, in 1876, the following story ran in the Chicago Tribune: “An excursion train containing some 200 people from Dayton, [Ohio], and neighboring towns, arrived last evening via the Pan Handle Road.... A vote was taken, resulting as follows: Hayes 65, Tilden 13, neutral 3, Cooper 2.”6

Straw polls grew in popularity throughout the nineteenth century and, by the early part of the twentieth century, had become a regular feature in newspaper coverage of presidential elections. However, as popular as they were, they were not very useful in predicting the outcome of presidential elections. This was in part because people who did not sympathize with a given paper’s partisan leanings would often refuse to return their questionnaires, leading to wildly biased estimates of the vote totals.

Among the many publications that conducted presidential polls was Literary Digest, which at the time was the most widely circulated general readership magazine in the nation. Starting in 1916, Literary Digest conducted polls predicting the presidential vote. While the magazine’s predicted vote totals were often inaccurate, it correctly predicted the winner in five consecutive elections (1916–1932). However, in 1936 it predicted that the Republican candidate for president, Alf Landon, would receive 57 percent of the vote to Franklin Roosevelt’s 43 percent. Of course, Roosevelt won, garnering 62.5 percent.7

The ushering in of the modern era of scientific polling began with the Digest’s failure in 1936. In addition to the fact that the magazine had incorrectly predicted Landon’s victory, three enterprising individuals with backgrounds in market research correctly predicted the outcome. George Gallup, Elmo Roper, and Archibald Crossley were able to do so by employing more systematic methods of sampling.8 To understand how Gallup, Roper, and Crossley correctly predicted the winner, and how the Digest did not, it is important to examine what pollsters do and how they do it.

A poll is a device used to measure what a group of people thinks about a particular subject or question. Because it is almost impossible to ask all of the people in a particular group (e.g., registered voters) what they think about a particular topic and because such an effort would be too time consuming or costly to be practical, a pollster asks a smaller group of people, or a sample. From this sample, pollsters then estimate what the larger group thinks.

To understand this process better, imagine trying to predict how a large lecture hall with five hundred students will vote in a presidential election. One approach would be to ask all five hundred students: by the time one handed out, collected, and counted all of the ballots, however, the class would be over. Is it reasonable to believe that one could estimate the likely vote outcome by polling only fifty people? Under the right circumstances, the answer is yes.

The reason for this is that polling is based in part on a branch of mathematics known as probability theory, which attempts to quantify how likely it is that a certain event will occur.9 Probability theory (in particular, the central limit theorem) suggests that if one flips a coin one hundred times, it is likely that heads will land face up about fifty times. However, to make a sound prediction, one would first need to flip the coin a certain number of times. In other words, a certain number of actual observations are required. Probability theory allows pollsters to infer what Americans think based on the actual answers given by approximately 1,500 people, sometimes less.10

Before applying the theories of probability to predicting vote outcomes, at least one condition needs to be specified. Based on previous research, we know that women are more likely to vote Democratic, and men are more likely to vote Republican. Using the example of the class of five hundred, we would want to make sure that the poll sampled women and men in roughly similar proportions to their numbers in the whole class. If our class was evenly divided by gender (250 women, 250 men), we would want to poll approximately twenty-five women and twenty-five men. Furthermore, we know that people who frequently attend church vote differently than those who do not, that the more affluent cast their ballots differently than those who are less economically fortunate, and so on. Thus, to have any confidence that the results from our fifty-person sample would correctly predict the vote of all five hundred students, we would want to ensure that the fifty students polled were broadly representative of the entire class.

How is a representative sample identified by a pollster? There are four main strategies for doing this, all of which rely—in some way—on randomly selecting the individuals who take the poll. In the language of survey research these are known as “probability samples,” a reference to the fact that randomness—or random selection of the cases used to make the prediction—plays a central role in theories of probability.

The first strategy is random sampling. In a simple random sample, each person in the larger group, or population, has an equal chance of being selected. For example, if everyone in our hypothetical class of five hundred had a seat number, we could put slips of paper numbered one to five hundred in a basket, shuffle them around, and pick fifty. If conducted fairly (e.g., all sheets of paper are of equal size, folded in half to hide the number, sufficiently shuffled or mixed), the process would provide an equal chance for each student to be selected.

A second strategy, a variant of the first, is systematic sampling. Instead of selecting individuals strictly at random, systematic sampling involves moving through a list and selecting names according to a preset strategy. The list itself is assumed to be randomly distributed. For example, in systematic sampling, we could go through our alphabetical class roster and select every tenth name in order to create a fifty-person sample.

Another technique is stratified sampling. Here, the pollster divides the sampling frame, or the entire group, into strata, or smaller groups. Within each stratum (group), the pollster selects a sample using simple random or systematic sampling. This helps to ensure that the sample sufficiently represents all relevant subgroups. If our class has three hundred men and two hundred women, we would select a sample of thirty men and twenty women.

Multistage cluster sampling follows a similar principle, although here, rather than use subgroup characteristics as the initial basis for sampling, geography is used instead. A pollster could first select a geographic unit (say, a state), and within that unit, select a smaller unit (a county), and within that unit, choose an even smaller one (a neighborhood) and then select potential respondents—at random—from the smallest unit. This process reduces costs for the polling firm by concentrating efforts in several small areas. In our class example, we might think about selecting every fifth row of students, then randomly selecting respondents from each.

The important point with respect to sampling, regardless of the technique used, is that the respondents must be representative of the population that the pollster or researcher examines. Probability sampling rests on an assumption that if selected randomly, a sample will be representative of the population. Box 7.1 summarizes these four techniques.

This admittedly simplistic explanation of sampling allows us to understand why the Literary Digest poll failed to predict Roosevelt’s victory correctly in 1936. The magazine sent out over ten million questionnaires, and over 2.3 million people filled out and returned these surveys. This was more than a sufficient number upon which to base a prediction of how the American public would vote. However, the list of people the magazine used in mailing the questionnaire was produced from automobile registration and telephone number lists. The problem with this was that in 1936, people who owned automobiles or had telephones in their home were more likely to have been Republicans (thus, Landon voters) rather than Democrats (Roosevelt supporters). In addition, subsequent research has shown that Landon voters were more likely to return their questionnaires. Coupled together, this produced a sample that was biased, or not representative of the general population.11

In sum, assuming that researchers administer a survey to a sufficiently large and representative sample, and assuming that the questions they ask are fairly worded, most polls can be trusted. However, not all polls are created equal. In particular, presidential campaign polls have some common pitfalls worth noting.

BOX 7.1

TECHNIQUES FOR SELECTING A PROBABILITY  
SAMPLE

Random: Individuals are selected from the entire sampling frame by chance.

Systematic: Individuals are selected from the entire sampling frame according to a set strategy.

Stratified: The sampling frame is divided into subgroups, and within each, a certain number of individuals are selected either randomly or systematically.

Multistage Cluster: A number of geographic areas are identified, and within each, individuals are selected either randomly or systematically.

### THE PROBLEM OF PSEUDO POLLS

There are many reputable polling firms, as well as countless research institutions and university professors around the country that conduct scientifically grounded polls. In general, the results of these polls are trustworthy, if one uses a certain amount of discretion in interpreting the results. However, anyone can write and administer a poll. As noted earlier, a variety of different sources present us with various poll results every day. Which polls should we trust, or more to the point, which should we not trust?

“Pseudo polls” are one general category of polls to disregard, especially in understanding the dynamics of a presidential campaign. Web sites (including blogs), local news organizations, talk radio, college newspapers, and others often administer these types of polls. The major problem with pseudo polls is that they typically rely on what are referred to as “convenience,” or non-probability samples. Here, poll administrators simply invite people to participate in the poll and then tabulate the results. The individuals who take the survey are, in other words, self-selected—not randomly selected. CNN’s “QuickVote” was a good example of these types of polls, and while they included a disclaimer stating that the poll results were not representative of the general public, it is unclear whether the average viewer understands what this means.12

The problems with polls that rely on self-selected samples are twofold. First, not everyone has a chance to participate. For example, in the case of Internet polls, the sample includes only those who visit the poll’s web site. Moreover, many of these organizations cater to a specific type of person (e.g., most talk radio listeners tend to be conservative).13 Another problem with this sampling technique is that people who are motivated to respond to the poll usually have more extreme views than the general population. The end result is that the samples in pseudo polls are not representative of the population at large, nor are the views expressed in these polls representative of the views of the population at large.14

### HOW TO DETERMINE LIKELY VOTERS?

A reliable poll of presidential preference should probably sample only those people who will actually vote. To understand the scope of this problem, consider that in 2004 there were approximately 197 million citizens over the age of eighteen in the United States. Of these, roughly 142 million (72.1 percent) were registered to vote, and only 125 million (63.8 percent of citizens over the age of eighteen) actually voted.15

How should a polling organization construct a sample of people who will vote, or who will be likely to vote? Unfortunately, there is no reliable or accepted way to determine whether an individual will exercise this most basic of political freedoms. Simply asking a person if they are likely to vote will not help identify likely voters. Most people, based on ideas about good citizenship, are reluctant to admit they might not vote. Thus, voter turnout is typically substantially lower than the percentage of people who say they are likely to vote. For example, the Pew Research Center conducted a survey prior to the 1996 election asking respondents about their intention to vote. Of those responding, 69 percent said they were “absolutely certain” they would vote, and another 18 percent replied they were “fairly certain.” In actuality, voter turnout in 1996 was 49 percent.16

Most polling firms will use at least one, and typically several, screening questions in their attempt to narrow their sample down so it only includes likely voters. The first stage of this screening is almost always to ask whether the respondent is a registered voter. From those who respond in the affirmative, the polling firm will ask additional questions in an attempt to gauge how likely the individual is to vote. For example, the Gallup Organization has asked whether respondents are likely to vote, how often they have voted in the past, whether they know where their polling place is, their level of interest in politics, their interest in a particular campaign, and their level of commitment to a particular candidate. Most of the reputable national polling organizations use some combination of questions similar to Gallup’s to gauge whether an individual is likely to vote.17

In a presidential preference poll, especially one conducted close to the election, the sample should consist of only those who are registered and likely to vote. How well the polling firm constructs the sample in this regard can have a direct effect on the results. For example, a Harris Poll from October of 2004 suggested that President Bush was leading Senator John Kerry by two percentage points according to one measure of likely voters. A second method had Bush ahead by eight points (51 percent to 43 percent).18

Therefore, it seems prudent to take note of whether the poll bases its results on responses from registered or likely voters. Most major news organizations will include this information somewhere in the story. A Washington Post story from early August 2004 reported that John Kerry had “the support of 50 percent of all registered voters.” Another story from late October 2004 suggested that Bush led Kerry “by 51% to 46% among likely voters” (emphasis added).19

### WHAT ABOUT UNDECIDED VOTERS?

As complicated as it is to ensure that a poll sample includes only those voters most likely to vote, another issue is how to count the people who say they are undecided. In most presidential campaigns, the number of “undecideds” is as high as 15 percent, and although this percentage drops as the campaign nears its end, it can still be as high as 5 percent in the days prior to Election Day. While it would be a simple matter for a news organization to report the percentage of undecideds in addition to the percentage that favor each candidate, most do not, because it makes for less interesting reading if the poll numbers present an uncertain picture. One strategy to deal with undecided voters is to have a follow-up question asking the respondent if he or she “leans” toward, or favors, either candidate.20 While this reduces the number of undecideds, it paints an inaccurate portrait of voter preferences, given that many of these people might change their minds.21 This was one of the factors responsible for the Gallup Organization mistakenly calling the 1948 election for Thomas Dewey (morning newspapers proclaimed that Dewey won, when in fact, Harry Truman was the victor).22 Another way to reduce the number of undecideds is to present respondents with a secret ballot, but this requires face-to-face interviewing, a rather costly method.

A more common strategy is to allocate the undecideds to one candidate or the other, based on some formula. For example, one way to allocate them would be to assign them in proportion to each candidate’s strength. If 46 percent of those who responded have expressed a preference for Candidate A, the pollster might allocate 46 percent of the undecided vote to Candidate A. This strategy, however, poses considerable risks given that the closer Election Day looms, the more likely it is that momentum can shift, disproportionately favoring one candidate over the other. There are other formulas for allocating undecideds as well, including using the respondent’s past voting record or partisan identification (if any) as a clue for future voting intentions, whether there is an incumbent in the race (undecideds are generally thought to be anti-incumbent), as well as other, more complex solutions.

Additional ways to address this issue are to continue polling as close to Election Day as is feasible. This reduces the number of undecided voters in the poll. However, this strategy too can result in less than perfect results. In fact, there is a fair degree of error in many of the pre-election polls conducted by major polling firms when compared to the actual vote totals. Table 7.1 lists the actual vote margin between the two candidates and the margin taken from the least accurate major poll, and the difference between these two figures, from each election cycle from 1980 to 2008.

To be fair, the track record also shows that with the exception of one year, at least one of the major polling firms projected the outcome either exactly or correctly to within one percentage point, and in only one case (the election of 2000) did any firm project the winner incorrectly. In 1980, all of the major firms underestimated Ronald Reagan’s margin of victory over Jimmy Carter (NBC/AP came within three percentage points of the correct margin). Seven organizations called the election for George W. Bush and two for Al Gore in 2000, while the actual vote was virtually even (Gore actually polled one-half of a percentage point more than Bush). Table 7.1 illustrates the reality that many voters make their decision in the final days of the campaign, after the completion of the last polls. It also highlights the difficulties polling organizations have in dealing with late-deciding voters.

### THE PROBLEM OF TIMING:  
PHASES OF THE CAMPAIGN

Polls taken and released during certain periods of time during the campaign can be misleading, giving a false impression of a candidate’s strength or weakness. Readers of these polls need to interpret them cautiously. This is especially true with respect to polls taken during the pre-primary phase of the campaign, immediately after each party convention, and after the debates.

Preprimary polls, or those taken before the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, have in the past been a fairly good predictor of who will win the party nomination. From 1980 to 2000, all but one candidate (Gary Hart, in 1988) who was leading in the Gallup poll of party identifiers immediately prior to the Iowa caucuses has won their party’s nomination.23 This said, there is considerable fluctuation in these poll numbers before January of the election year. In 2003, several candidates, including Joe Lieberman, Dick Gephardt, Wesley Clark, and the eventual presumed front-runner, Howard Dean, led in these preprimary polls.24 John Kerry was the eventual winner of the Democratic nomination. In fact, in 2008, neither of the two candidates who led in the final poll before Iowa (Hillary Clinton and Rudy Giuliani) went on to secure their party’s nomination.

These “trial heat” polls are not measuring actual preferences as much as they track name recognition or simple familiarity with the name of the individual.25 In addition, these polls are sensitive to the news cycle. Before Wesley Clark’s formal entrance into the race on September 17, 2003, most polls showed other Democratic candidates leading the field. However, in the month following his announcement to enter the race, Clark consistently ranked among the top tier of candidates. One can only assume this was at least partly the result of the media coverage generated by his announcement, because he won only one Democratic primary.26 Republican Senator Fred Thompson, who also starred in the television series Law and Order for five seasons, announced his candidacy in early September of 2007 and polled between 15 and 20 percent throughout the remainder of the year. He did not, however, win a single primary. While polls taken immediately prior to the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary are a good indicator of who will be the eventual nominee, polls taken much earlier than November or December of the year prior to the election year are not very reliable.

In a similar way, polls taken immediately after each candidate’s party convention typically do not measure actual candidate strength. While there are exceptions (e.g., 1984, 1996), it is very common for each party candidate’s numbers to go up 5 to 10 percent after the convention. Many political observers commonly refer to this as the post-convention bump or bounce. Typically, challengers benefit more than incumbents from the post-convention bounce because they are less well known to the general public. However, convention bounces for either candidate can dissipate quickly, as was the case with Al Gore in 2000 or John McCain in 2008, but they can also be a prelude to a strong fall campaign, as happened for Bill Clinton in 1992.27 In short, one should treat polls taken immediately after the conventions with caution.

Polls following presidential debates are similarly volatile. This is partly a function of the fact that firms must hastily conduct post-debate polls, using smaller than normal samples (about six hundred people). In addition, post-debate polls are sensitive to media coverage of the debate.28 Often different organizations report somewhat contradictory—or at least differing—results. For example, after the first presidential debate in 2004 (on September 30), one poll had Kerry winning the debate by a margin of forty-two percentage points (sixty-one to nineteen), another by thirty-two, (fifty-eight to twenty-six), and yet another by only sixteen (fifty-three to thirty-seven).29 All clearly suggested that Kerry won but by varying margins. And, all reported that Bush’s slim lead going into the debate remained largely intact.30 In other words, post-debate polls might suggest something about how voters viewed the candidates’ performances in the debates, but they are a poor indicator of how well a particular candidate is doing in the campaign.31

Taken in isolation, few of these polls (preprimary, post-convention, post-debate) are good indicators of candidate strength. Moreover, as suggested above, there is often considerable variation in candidate strength as Election Day approaches. The closer to Election Day that one conducts a poll, the more likely it is to be accurate.

### SAMPLES, DATA, AND REPORTING

As we have stressed throughout this chapter, most polls that major news organizations report are well designed and administered. However, sometimes they do not fully explain the results. For example, as previously mentioned, some stories might not indicate whether their sample consisted of registered or likely voters. It is more common to misrepresent what a poll actually means, especially with respect to the margin separating the candidates. This leads to a discussion of the margin of error of polls.

In discussing sampling, it is possible to infer what a population thinks by relying on the responses of a properly constructed probability sample. It is important to remember, however, that the theory driving this inference is one of probability, not certainty. If we flip a coin one hundred times, it is probable that heads will land face up about fifty times. However, common sense suggests that it might be as many as fifty-three times, or as few as forty-seven. Probability theory suggests that if one repeated the coin flip twenty times, heads would come up approximately 50 percent of the time in nineteen cases.32 The difference between the expected outcome (heads fifty times, or 50 percent) and what repeated tests would actually yield is known as the margin of error.33

Most news organizations report the sampling error of a given poll by telling consumers that a poll is accurate to within a certain percentage. This number is given in plus or minus terms ( / )and is variously referred to as the margin of error, sampling error, or the poll’s error margin. One story from 2004 reported that 42 percent of the people who watched the last presidential debate believed Kerry was the winner and that the poll “results have a 4.5 percent error margin.”34 Translated, this means that as few as 37.5 (42 minus 4.5) percent, and as many as 46.5 (42 plus 4.5) percent thought Kerry performed better than Bush in the debate.

This is important to understand because headlines and news stories sometimes misrepresent what is actually happening in election polls with respect to sampling error.35 Although the story qualified the claims, one Harris Poll report from October 2000 claimed that “Bush Leads Gore by Five Points,” 48 to 43 percent. However, with the survey’s margin of error (3 percent) factored in, Bush could have had as little as 45 percent, and Gore as much as 46 percent.36 CBS News reported in 2000 that Gore won the last presidential debate by five percentage points over Bush (45 to 40 percent), but the margin of error for this poll was 4 percent—almost as much as the difference between the two.37 Margin of error matters, especially if the two candidates are in a competitive race, which is usually the case in presidential elections.

Another point is that the media often report the poll numbers of various subgroups in pre-election presidential polls as well. In these polls, a reliable sample size is sometimes a problem. A national poll based on responses from one thousand individuals would have a 3 percent margin of error associated with it. If there was a split in the sample according to gender, there would be a subsample of approximately 490 men. The margin of error would be greater for this subsample. If there was a split in the sample for men according to their party identification, the sample would split further into three more categories: one each for Republicans, Democrats, and independents. The sample would continue to grow smaller with further divisions along race, income, or other socioeconomic characteristics. With each division, the sample becomes smaller and therefore associated with a greater margin of error. As such, group analyses of presidential polling data need to be treated with caution given that subgroups have higher margins of error associated with them.38

### APPLYING NATIONAL POLLING RESULTS  
TO A STATE-BY-STATE CONTEST

This particular problem with pre-election presidential polls is centered on the fact that most of the pre-election polls the national news organizations report are national polls. If done well, the results mirror the outcome one would expect to find in a national vote for the president. However, the United States does not have a national vote for president. Electoral College votes are allocated on a state-by-state basis, dependent (in all but two states) on the winner of the popular vote in that state. Only once in the past one hundred years has the loser of the popular vote been selected president, in the election of 2000. Interestingly, most pre-election polls during that campaign season had George W. Bush—the eventual loser of the popular vote and winner of the Electoral College vote—ahead.39

For those who are only passively interested in following presidential campaigns, tracking national polls will probably suffice. However, if one is truly interested in the dynamics of the campaign, watching state polling results is a better answer. Fortunately, in the age of the World Wide Web, this has become fairly convenient. Several web sites collate such information into easily accessible pages.40 This approach is especially important in close races (as it was in 2000 and 2004) when it is known in advance that the outcome might hinge on the results from a few key “battleground” states (states with a fairly large number of Electoral College votes that could realistically swing to either candidate). Watching state polls allows one a more nuanced—and accurate—view of how each candidate is doing and, more importantly, where each candidate is doing well or poorly.

### CONCLUSION

So, is polling an art, a science, or some form of modern voodoo? As we hope our discussion has made clear, polling is a science but hardly an exact science. Table 7.1 is a good example of this point. One objective of this chapter was to provide the tools to become better consumers of pre-election presidential polls. Box 7.2 summarizes the various points made throughout the chapter in short question form. While it is not necessary to study every poll intensively, moving mentally through this checklist is a helpful way to understand what the polls are really telling us.

## “It’s the Ratings, Stupid”

## Misconceptions about Media Bias

Many Americans believe there is a bias, either liberal or conservative, in the mass media’s coverage of politics. According to a recent survey, a majority (53 percent) of people “believe that news organizations are politically biased, while just 29 percent say they are careful to remove bias from their reports.”1 In another poll, 67 percent agreed with the following statement: “In dealing with political and social issues, news organizations tend to favor one side.”2 Yet another report found that “78 percent of adults agree with the assessment that there is bias in the news media,”3 and one showed that almost two-thirds (64 percent) disagreed with the idea that “the news media try to report the news without bias.”4 Most Americans (51 percent) describe news organizations as “liberal,” while a smaller segment of the public perceives the press as “conservative” (26 percent), and an even smaller group believes the press is neither liberal nor conservative (14 percent).5 Still, in one poll, 46 percent of respondents viewed their newspaper as more liberal than they are, while 36 percent perceived their newspaper to be more conservative than they are.6 In short, healthy percentages of Americans see ideological bias in the news.

Does the perception that news is biased match reality? More interesting for our purposes, does news coverage of campaigns favor one candidate or the other? How objective has reporting been in recent elections? In this chapter, we explore these questions. First, we briefly review the legal environment in which the press operates in the United States and the emergence of objective journalism as a professional norm, highlighting the idea that for the first one hundred years or so of the republic it was accepted that news carried with it a partisan slant. Next we examine the forms, or possible sources of bias in news coverage of campaigns, as well as what researchers have found with respect to charges of partisan bias in the media. In the end we suggest that bias in the media is primarily commercial in nature, reflecting the fact that news organizations are forprofit enterprises that are forced to consider the bottom line in their campaign coverage. We then explore the forms this commercial bias takes during coverage of a presidential campaign.

### FREEDOM OF THE PRESS AND ITS  
IMPLICATIONS FOR NEWS

The U.S. Constitution does not prohibit the press from presenting the news in a biased fashion. Quite the contrary; the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution clearly states that “Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.” Many people associate this constitutional provision with the ability to say or write whatever they wish (with the exceptions of libel and slander). However, this provision also has powerful implications for the organization of the media. In particular, if the law specifies that Congress cannot abridge press freedom, it is also saying that government cannot control the media. This obviously applies to issues of censorship, but, by extension, to ownership of media outlets as well. As the old adage goes, “He who pays the piper calls the tune.” If government owned and operated the media, it could control the news we receive.

This is why the media environment in the United States is mainly characterized by private ownership. In most other constitutional democracies, there is both private and public (government) ownership of media outlets, especially broadcast (radio and television) media.7 There are very few government-owned or government-sponsored media outlets in this country. Partial exceptions exist, but these are restricted mainly to foreign broadcast services (e.g., the Voice of America), which cannot air in the United States. So-called public broadcasting (National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting System) are actually joint ventures funded by federal, state, and local governments, universities, private sponsors and foundations, and individual citizens.8

Publicly owned media outlets are, to some extent, free from the pressures of making money. Conversely, private media outlets are continually under pressure to make money. In the case of newspapers and magazines, this translates into selling copy; for television and radio, it means selling airtime to advertisers. The greater number of viewers or listeners a television or radio station or network has, the more it can charge for its advertising time. In the end, television and radio stations attempt to attract viewers, much in the same way that newspapers and magazines try to sell copy. All media outlets are thus under pressure to make money by orienting their product toward what consumers (viewers, listeners, readers) want. Commercial considerations, which are inevitable products of the First Amendment, are never far from the minds of those responsible for news production in the United States.

### THE EMERGENCE OF OBJECTIVE JOURNALISM  
AS A PROFESSIONAL NORM

In colonial times the expectation of journalistic objectivity did not exist. The original newspapers were produced by printers, who were small businessmen. These individuals were interested in selling papers, and therefore attempted to maintain editorial neutrality in order to avoid controversy. The “news” they printed was mainly foreign news, which because of its distance from local affairs, was less controversial. This began to change as conflict with England intensified during the Revolutionary War period. Following independence from England, Federalist sympathizers controlled most newspapers, meaning that much of the news that was printed during this period was pro-government—hardly unbiased. Antigovernment opinion was further suppressed by anti-treason and sedition laws in several states, as well as the federal Sedition Act of 1789. The act expired in 1800, but most editors and printers still did not subscribe to the idea of press objectivity or neutrality.9

This became even more evident in the nineteenth century, when most newspapers had an identifiable partisan bias. For example, the Albany Argus was the newspaper of the nation’s first political machine, the Albany Regency (the Democratic Party machine).10 While the Argus prided itself in the accuracy of its reporting, coverage of political campaigns remained selective at best. This was true of many other newspapers during the golden age of political parties, a time when politics meant party politics, and the party machine was a powerfully influential political institution, at least at the local level.11

The demise of the partisan press began with improvements in printing technology, which made it possible to mass produce newspapers at a low price. New urban centers provided potential markets for these “penny papers,” and as a business, many thrived, attracting major advertising dollars. By the late 1800s, owners and editors began to understand that partisan presentation of news effectively cut them off from half of their potential market. Republicans, for example, would not buy a Democrat-leaning newspaper, and vice versa. The notion of presenting the news impartially was therefore not a high-minded ideal but rather a response to commercial considerations.

As the century progressed, newspapers began to feature more local news stories in a further attempt to increase sales.12 This helped usher in the era of yellow journalism. Somewhat similar to the contemporary era of news production, as one account explains, “stories of crime, sex, and violence captured the headlines and sold papers. . . . Joseph Pulitzer’s New York World and William Hearst’s New York Journal set the standards for this era of highly competitive ‘yellow journalism.”’13 Driven by sales, this focus on local stories meant that newspapers began to employ more reporters. One report suggests that by 1895 the New York World employed 1,200 people, scores of whom were reporters.

It was perhaps natural that as the number of reporters increased, so did the development of “journalism as an occupational culture.” Reporters began frequenting the same clubs, restaurants, and taverns. The Missouri School of Journalism, the world’s first, opened in 1908. Joseph Pulitzer endowed the Columbia University School of Journalism, where classes started in 1913, for the purpose of raising “journalism to the rank of a learned profession.” Within a few decades other schools had begun programs as well. These schools began to inculcate in their students a “self-conscious ethic of objectivity.”14 By the 1920s, these journalists and others began to articulate this ethic as a professional norm. The American Society of Newspaper Editors, formed in 1922, adopted the “Canons of Journalism,” one of which was impartiality. Other newly formed professional associations (e.g., the Newspaper Guild, formed in 1933) followed.15

The norm of objectivity thus emerged in part because of the commercial nature of news production. As newspaper production technology improved, supply increased and prices dropped, while at the same time demand and competition grew. Part of the increased demand included a desire on the part of readers for more local news, rather than stories about foreign affairs previously printed in London or elsewhere. The desire for local news created a need for more reporters, who, as they increased in numbers, began to see themselves as professionals with their own code of ethics. This code of ethics included the notion that journalists report their stories fully and accurately, devoid of value judgments.

Further driving a move toward impartiality was the emergence of, and reliance of newspapers on, the national wire services. Following the same commercial logic that drove local papers away from partisan presentation of the news, the Associated Press and United Press wire services understood that neutrality in reporting was necessary for them to sell stories.16 In short, the development of news as an industry and as big business helped drive the emergence and acceptance of objectivity as a journalistic norm.

### BIAS

Before proceeding any further in our discussion of bias in the news we should make two points in order to clarify the discussion. First, we should be clear about what we mean by the word bias. As it relates to news, bias refers to the idea that the selection and presentation of a particular story explicitly or implicitly reflects the political views of some person or persons involved in the news production process. In other words, bias in the news results in a presentation that does not adequately or completely reflect reality.

Second, when we talk about news bias, we are not talking about political commentary given by individuals on television or radio political talk shows, or essays that appear in the editorial and opinion pages of the newspapers. They are, by definition, biased, because they are the opinions (informed or otherwise) of individuals.

When we refer to bias in campaign news, we are typically referring to unequal coverage or treatment of one or the other candidate or party. The notion that election news should be impartial is based on the idea that voting should be an informed choice, and the only way for citizens to make an informed choice is to have facts, not value judgments or opinions, at their disposal. Therefore the standard that news organizations adhere to and that citizens use to evaluate them is one of objectivity.

It should be noted here that by 2008 the cable news market had segmented into distinct partisan camps, perhaps reminiscent of the nineteenth century era of the partisan press. Fox News Channel began in 1996 in response to a perceived need by conservative Americans for a counterbalance to the dominant liberal media establishment. Programming on Fox is generally acknowledged to be more conservative in nature, in spite of their claim to be “fair and balanced.” MSNBC, also launched in 1996, took a sharp turn to the left in 2007, in order to capture more of a share of the cable news market. However, even these two exceptions demonstrate that profit motives drive news coverage in that both are supplying a product to a “niche” market.17

There are many possible sources of bias in the news. Many, for example, point to the political leanings of those responsible for news production, like editors, producers, reporters, and so on. Studies conducted in the past two decades show that newspaper reporters are more liberal than the average citizen. Similar studies (surveys of reporters) also show that reporters tend to vote Democratic.18 Other research has demonstrated that the owners of media organizations tend to be more conservative and vote Republican.19

Do these tendencies manifest themselves into an ideological or partisan slant in the news? If there was bias in news coverage of presidential campaigns, what form would it take? The following list outlines several possibilities:

- One of the candidates might be the subject of more news stories than the other, resulting in a greater amount of coverage;
- Alternatively, stories about one of the candidate’s campaign effort might consistently be longer or shorter than the others, also resulting in a greater amount of coverage;
- Regardless of the amount of coverage a candidate receives, one or the other candidate might consistently be cast in a more positive or negative light (for example, a focus on a scandal of some sort);
- Stories about one of the candidate’s campaign effort might consistently be placed more prominently (for example, on the front page of the newspaper, or the lead story in a news broadcast) than those of the other;
- The focus of the story or stories of one of the candidates might be consistently accompanied by pictures or video casting the candidate in either a positive (cheering crowds in the background) or negative (worried or harried look on their face) light.

Can these, or any other patterns, be detected in news coverage of presidential campaigns? Is news coverage of presidential campaigns biased, or less than adequate or complete? Fortunately, there is an abundance of research informing us on this subject. Most scholars have concluded that there is no convincing evidence of media bias in either a liberal or a conservative direction. One recent and comprehensive study found no ideological or partisan bias in newspapers, and a slight, but statistically insignificant (meaning the authors question the findings) Republican bias in news magazines and Democratic bias on television.20 In fact, some suggest that because reporters tend to be more liberal they overcompensate to some extent in their treatment of political candidates, slightly favoring Republicans.21 Does the fact that there is no discernable ideological or partisan bias in the news mean that we always get the complete story? The answer is, decidedly not. In the next section we illustrate that the true bias in news coverage of campaigns is of a commercial nature.

### COMMERCIAL BIAS IN CAMPAIGN COVERAGE

“News” is the product of a series of decisions made by owners, editors, producers, reporters, and journalists. While the masthead of the New York Times claims the paper presents “all the news that’s fit to print,” in actuality there are any number of newsworthy events that occur in a given day that go unreported or underreported. The individuals working in news organizations decide what stories are worthy of attention and how to present them. Commercial factors also balance these considerations. Editors, for instance, are more likely to choose stories that will capture the average news consumer’s attention. This explains why there is so much celebrity news, or why scandal and sex are often prominently featured in the news.

The need to make a profit naturally puts pressure on news organizations to keep costs down and sales up. This manifests itself clearly in national coverage of political campaigns, which displays a distinct commercial bias.22 Below, we discuss some of the ways that this commercial bias is evident in national news coverage of presidential campaigns.

#### Horse Race Coverage

Most campaign coverage falls into the category of what political scientist and media scholar Thomas Patterson labels “horse race” coverage.23 Most stories focus on or are framed around the competitive or strategic aspect of the campaign: who is leading, who fell behind, and why. This type of coverage dominates news about the campaign from the preprimary season through Election Day.24 According to authoritative sources, approximately two-thirds of all coverage throughout the 2008 campaign were stories focused on the horse race.25 Conversely, substantive (issue-oriented) stories accounted for only 18 percent of the coverage on the three major television networks (ABC, CBS, and NBC) in 2004. This was down from 22 percent in 2000 and compares with an overall average of 26 percent from 1988 to 2004.26

The reason horse race coverage dominates campaign news is rather straightforward: it makes for a more exciting story, and all other things being equal, more exciting stories sell better. Of course, news organizations can only present a certain number of stories in any given day, and therefore, horse race coverage pushes out other types of stories, which include an examination of issues, policy positions of the candidates and parties, qualifications, and so on. This horse race coverage, as we will show, affects campaign coverage in other ways as well.

#### The Press as Kingmaker or Winnower

The decisions that news organizations makeabout thedeploymentof their resources and the stories that they run often have a profound impact on who will eventually win the party nomination. In part, this is because most people do not know much, if anything, about many of the aspirants for their party’s nomination. This is especially true in years when there are many candidates vying for the nomination. In the year preceding the election, media organizations make decisions about which candidates they will and will not cover. These decisions translate directly into the amount of coverage a given candidate receives in print or on television. Here, the rule of thumb is that better-known candidates are more likely to be the subject of a story than their lesser-known opponents.

This is partly due to simple economics. In a crowded field of aspirants, media organizations must make decisions about how to deploy scant resources. News organizations simply cannot assign a reporter to cover every candidate and every campaign event. In 2004, the cable television network MSNBC assigned an “embedded” journalist to travel with and cover each of the nine Democratic hopefuls, but this was an exception to the rule.27 Generally, news organizations focus primarily on candidates who are leading in early preprimary polls (those taken the year prior to the Iowa caucuses). This, of course, means that candidates who are not doing well in public opinion polls receive less attention in the news, thus making it more difficult for them to raise their public profile, attract campaign contributions, and ultimately, do well. To overstate the case somewhat, many of the hidden decisions made by news organizations about whom to cover, in effect, become self-fulfilling prophecies.28

The candidates leading in the polls as 2007 drew to a close included Democrats Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and John Edwards, and Republicans John McCain, Mitt Romney, Rudy Giuliani, and Mike Huck-abee. Not surprisingly, these individuals captured most of the press attention in coverage throughout the primary season.29 In 2003, Howard Dean, Wesley Clark, John Kerry, and Joseph Lieberman were the focus of most of the television news stories about the Democratic hopefuls. They were also, not coincidently, leading in the preprimary polls throughout the year.30 After January 1st, the pattern of coverage shifted to account for John Edwards’s increased popularity and Joseph Lieberman’s decreased popularity (as well as the fact that he did not compete in Iowa).31 Similarly, in 1999, Al Gore and George W. Bush had more than double the television news coverage than their main rivals for the nomination (Bill Bradley and John McCain, respectively) combined. Although coverage was much more even-handed as the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary approached, it became even more lopsided afterward, with more than quadruple the number of stories about Gore and Bush than their opponents.32

Winnowing also occurs in the substance of the coverage. One analysis of articles by several leading political pundits in early 2004 suggests that Democratic candidates Carol Moseley Braun, Dennis Kucinich, and Al Sharpton were all but dismissed in analyses by these writers.33 Few were as blunt as Ted Koppel, the host of ABC’s Nightline, who hosted a Democratic debate in Durham, New Hampshire, on December 9, 2003. In preparation before the debate, Koppel asked staffers,

How did Dennis Kucinich and Al Sharpton and Carol Moseley Braun get into this thing [the debate]? Nobody seems to know. Some candidates who are perceived as serious are gasping for air, and what little oxygen there is on the stage will be taken up by one-third of the people who do not have a snowball’s chance in hell of winning the nomination.

During the debate Koppel asked provocative questions of each of these three candidates and, at one point, asked directly whether they would eventually “drop out” or continue their “vanity” candidacies.34 Koppel’s apparent resentment of the minor candidates and their dismissal by others is related to the fact that news organizations have limited resources with which to cover the campaign. Moreover, likely losers usually do not make for good stories.

The amount and substance of news coverage toward presumed front-runners has the effect of forcing lesser-known candidates to withdraw from the race earlier than they otherwise might. While it is highly unlikely that Democrats Joe Biden, Chris Dodd, Bill Richardson, Mike Gravel, Dennis Kucinich, or Tom Vilsak, or Republicans Sam Brownback, Duncan Hunter, Ron Paul, Tom Tancredo, Fred Thompson, or Tommy Thompson would have been able to secure their party’s nomination in 2008, each was a recognized candidate whose inclusion in the race added something to the democratic process. Whether intentional or not, bias in the form of noncoverage or less than favorable coverage contributed, at least slightly, to their early withdrawal, and thus detracted from the campaign.

#### The Expectations Game

In addition to helping winnow the field of primary candidates early by way of devoting less coverage to those who are doing poorly in the polls, the press handicaps the primaries. The expectations game actually starts long before the primaries begin, escalating during the fall of the year prior to the Iowa caucuses. Pundits regularly report on who is leading in the polls, who is raising how much money, who is endorsing which candidate, and more. Based on this, they typically anoint a front-runner who is therefore expected to win either the Iowa caucuses, the New Hampshire primary, or both. If the presumed front-runner loses either, the resulting story line is typically framed in terms of the uphill battle faced by the candidate in upcoming contests. Interestingly, however, if the front-runner wins, but does worse than expected, the story is framed in terms of a loss or setback.

In 1992, for example, George H. W. Bush, who was expected to win in New Hampshire, was declared the loser after placing first, only sixteen percentage points ahead of Pat Buchanan. This was the result of Bush falling short of expectations and Buchanan exceeding them. A similar situation occurred in that year’s Democratic primary in New Hampshire when Bill Clinton finished ahead of previous front-runner Paul Tsongas. In 1996, the Republican nominee Bob Dole lost a few early and unimportant primaries, and his candidacy was declared dead. In 2000 John McCain’s victory in the New Hampshire primary over favored George W. Bush propelled him to front-page news, while Al Gore defeated his Democratic rival Bill Bradley in what one source called an “uncomfortably tight race.”35 While the victories of McCain and Bradley were indeed newsworthy, few observers believed that given their financial and organizational resources they could actually secure the nomination.

In addition, because the primary season begins early, the media often pay a disproportionate amount of positive attention to the underdog, or candidate trailing in the race. For example, long after it was apparent that John McCain would secure the Republican nomination in 2008, the press paid a great deal of attention, most of it positive, to the candidacy of rival Mike Huckabee.36 During the latter part of 2003, when Howard Dean was the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, he was the recipient of much negative press. Shortly after his loss in Iowa, however, coverage became more favorable.37 John McCain was the media favorite throughout the 2000 Republican primary season, in part because he was trailing Bush. The reason for this focus on the underdog is simply that it makes for a more exciting and compelling story.

#### Focus on the Negative

Similar to its ability to anoint a winner, the press can also help drive candidates from the field with a focus on mistakes, scandals, and gaffes. This is especially true during the primary season. In 1988, Democratic candidate Senator Joseph Biden was charged with plagiarizing parts of his speeches. He withdrew from the primary race after a flurry of negative media attention. That same year the Democrat Gary Hart dropped out of the race after a widely publicized sex scandal.

George H. W. Bush delivered a campaign speech in 1988 in which he mistakenly referred to September 7 as the anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor (the actual date is December 7). His audience caught the mistake, and based on their reaction, he quickly corrected himself. While the audience seemed to pay no further attention to the incident, all three television networks featured a story about it that evening. Their coverage was less than flattering. Dan Rather of CBS News, for example, told viewers that “Bush’s talk to audiences in Louisville was overshadowed by a strange happening.”38

In addition to simple gaffes, the media often focus on more salacious stories. An inordinate amount of coverage in 1992 centered on charges that Bill Clinton had been unfaithful to his wife, had experimented with marijuana, was a draft dodger, and had burned an American flag while a student in England.39 Of course Clinton was able to overcome this focus on the negative and secure the Democratic nomination. This negative focus on simple mistakes, scandals, and so forth, is part of a pattern in American journalism referred to by Larry Sabato as “attack journalism.” Sabato uses the metaphor of a “feeding frenzy” to describe how the press is drawn to, highlights, and repeats negative news from the campaign trail.40

Often the focus on the negative is not scandal-related, but simply mistakes made on the campaign trail. In 2000, for example, days of coverage were devoted to an alleged subliminal message (“rats”) found in a George W. Bush campaign ad or the fact that Bush, thinking his microphone was off, referred to long-time reporter Adam Clymer as a “major league a**hole.” In 2004, media organizations ran numerous stories about John Kerry’s testimony to the Senate after his service in Vietnam, whether President Bush had lied about his National Guard service, the fact that Kerry mentioned Vice President Dick Cheney’s gay daughter Lynn during the final presidential debate, and more. Similarly, in 2008, an inordinate amount of attention was paid to the fact that Obama stopped wearing his American flag lapel pin or to a comment Michelle Obama made about her husband’s candidacy being the first time as an adult she was proud of her country.41

According to one study, in 1968 there was only one instance where a television network newscast took notice of a “minor incident unrelated to the content of the campaign.”42 The reason for the change is best summarized by the “orchestra pit” theory of politics coined by former Republican media consultant and now-president of Fox News Channel, Roger Ailes. As Ailes explained, “If you have two guys on stage and one says, ‘I have a solution to the Middle East problem,’ and the other guy falls into the orchestra pit, who do you think is going to be on the evening news?”43

#### Pack Journalism

Exacerbating the commercial patterns of campaign coverage noted above is a phenomenon known by many as “pack journalism.” A term originally coined by Timothy Crouse in his 1973 account of the Nixon campaign,44 it refers to the fact that much of what appears in the news media is remarkably homogenous. Crouse argued this was because reporters who spend a great deal of time together (on the campaign trail) end up with similar ideas, but the homogeneity of news coverage has other sources as well. For example, the competitive pressure of knowing another network or newspaper is running a particular story exerts pressure on producers and editors to do the same.45

The pressure to meet deadlines also contributes to uniformity in the news, as reporters have less time to explore a story. Smaller media organizations tend to take their cues from more prestigious outlets (New York Times, Washington Post) and, in many cases, subscribe to the same wire service stories (Associated Press, Reuters). The end result is uniformity in campaign coverage. If the aforementioned commercial biases were not operative, this might not be problematic. However, pack journalism only multiplies these biases as each story repeats itself.

#### Other Commercial Biases

There are several other patterns evident in the news coverage of presidential primaries that reflect a commercial bias in the media. One is a focus on attractive personalities. In particular, there is a tendency for the media to give attractive personalities more positive press, especially during the primary season. This particular bias was apparent in 2004. The highly telegenic and upbeat John Edwards received the best press of any major candidate since 1988. A full 96 percent of the coverage of Edwards by the three major television networks (ABC, CBS, and NBC) from January 1 through March 1, 2004, was positive.46 Barack Obama probably benefited from this focus on attractive personalities in 2008 as well (more on this below).

Another pattern, evident during both the primary and general election season, is an anti-incumbency bias. This is because sitting presidents (or vice presidents, in the case of George H. W. Bush in 1988 or Al Gore in 2000) are not fresh “news.” Challengers add something new to the race, thus making it more attractive to news consumers. While Bill Clinton received more favorable coverage than challenger Bob Dole in 1996, virtually all incumbents since Jimmy Carter in 1980 have been the recipients of negative press during their reelection campaign. This also holds true for the incumbent vice presidents George H. W. Bush in 1988 and Al Gore in 2000. In 2004, coverage of the incumbent George W. Bush on the three broadcast networks from September through November was only 37 percent positive, as compared with John Kerry’s 59 percent. In addition, Bush was the target of almost twice as many jokes on late night television as was Kerry.47

### CONCLUSION

Criticizing the media has become something of a national pastime. However, in a media environment dominated by private ownership, news organizations must attract viewers or readers. This makes commercial bias inevitable. Of course, this is a welcome trade-off to government ownership of the media, which is anathema to the First Amendment and to a free and independent press.

By way of a postscript, it should be mentioned that there is some consensus and considerable evidence to suggest that in 2008, Barack Obama was the clear favorite of news organizations and that this favoritism was reflected in biased reporting. Obama, for example, was the recipient of positive press in 75 percent of the stories about his candidacy throughout the primary season, while others saw their coverage evenly matched. During the fall campaign season, he received 68 percent more coverage than McCain, and the ratio of positive to negative coverage was 2:1, while McCain’s was 2:1 negative.48 While we will not seek to justify this, we will note again that research suggests this is the exception rather than the rule.

However, because of the need to attract viewers, attack journalism has become a norm in newsrooms. The sharp and sometimes unfair criticisms of political candidates frequently bring about charges of ideological bias in the media. Yet despite a good deal of research on the subject, there is no clear consensus to support those charges. Generally speaking, campaign coverage during a presidential election campaign is fairly objective in terms of its partisan or ideological orientation. Instead, the pressure for profit, rather than some broad left-wing or right-wing conspiracy, is what predominantly shapes media coverage of American elections and campaigns.

## A “Dime’s Worth of Difference”?

## Political Parties and the Myth of  
Tweedledum and Tweedledee

In 1968, former Alabama governor George Wallace ran for president as candidate of the American Independent Party, famously declaring that “there’s not a dime’s worth of difference” between the Democratic and Republican Parties.1 A recent book uses Wallace’s statement in its title,2 and presidential candidate Ralph Nader repeated this claim during his 2000 and 2004 campaigns.3 Nader, among others, is known for referring to the two major parties as “Tweedledum and Tweedledee,” a reference to the twins in Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There.4

Many Americans agree with this assessment of the two major political parties in America. In one survey, 39 percent of respondents agreed with the statement, “There is little difference between the candidates and policies of the Republican Party and the candidates and policies of the Democratic Party.”5 In another survey, 43 percent of nonvoters claimed they saw no difference between the two parties.6

This chapter dispels the notion that both major political parties in America are similar. To do this, we compare prominent issue positions contained in the Republican and Democratic Party platforms, demonstrating that each has significantly different ideas about the role of government in society. Next, we examine how the campaign environment in the United States contributes to the creation of this myth. The fact is that the campaign environment makes it possible and strategically wise for candidates to stray from the party line in their messages on the campaign trail. In other words, presidential candidates’ more moderate rhetoric on the campaign trail is often quite different from their party’s platforms. Finally, we discuss the idea that more moderate campaign rhetoric does not translate into middle-of-the-road governance, especially in Congress. In short, there are indeed differences between the parties.

### THE DIFFERENCES, IN THEIR OWN WORDS

The two major American political parties are, in fact, quite different from each other in terms of the positions they take on any variety of issues. However, the differences between the Republicans and the Democrats are not as great as the differences between major parties in some other democracies. Most democracies have multi-party systems, and parties in these systems represent a broader range of the ideological spectrum. In most European democracies there is a significant socialist or social democratic party on the left. Great Britain has the Labour Party, France has its Socialist Party, and Germany has the Social Democratic Party.7 These same countries also have conservative or Christian democratic parties that oppose them from the right side of the ideological spectrum. Examples include Great Britain’s Conservative Party, France’s Rally for the Republic, and Germany’s Christian Democratic Union (with their smaller sister party, the Christian Socialist Union). In addition to these main parties of the left and right, most European democracies (as well as other established democracies) have minor parties that win a significant share of the vote in national and local elections (for a listing of some of these parties, see table 9.1).8 A recent show of minor party strength occurred in France where ultranationalist candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen of the National Front Party finished a surprising second in the presidential election of 2002.

American political parties occupy a relatively small space on the spectrum of major political ideologies of the world. To be more specific, both American political parties come from the same classic liberal tradition. Both embrace, as a matter of faith, classic liberal ideas about individual freedoms. These ideas find acceptance in the economic realm of a market economy and in the political realm of democratic governance. In this narrow sense, it is true that there is not a “dime’s worth of difference” between the Republican and Democratic parties.

![[chpt_fig_028.png]]

It is within this relatively small ideological slice of classic liberalism that American politics takes place. However, there is a wide gulf separating the two parties when it comes to their prescriptions for American society. Party activists, members, and supporters hold sharply different opinions on most issues of public policy. Members of Congress have grown more polarized over time as well, suggesting that elites in the two parties find few issues on which to agree.

This gulf is evident in the party platforms adopted at the national conventions every four years. A party platform is a document that outlines, often very specifically, the positions the party takes on a variety of issues. However, the first thing that should be understood about party platforms is that while many individuals and groups contribute, presidential candidates have always been central to the process of drafting these documents.9 This is in part due to how party platforms were conceived.

The first party platform was written in 1832 when the first Democratic National Convention met to re-nominate Andrew Jackson.10 The document was actually written as an address for Jackson to deliver to the convention. It was, in other words, a very candidate-specific document. This has been the case throughout history, but, during the past several decades “party platforms [have become even] more of a presidential campaign document” than was previously the case.11

Because direct primaries and caucuses effectively decide the party nomination, the presidential nominee is known several months before the convention begins. In fact, an increasing number of states have moved their primary or caucus election to an earlier date in the calendar. This “front-loading” of contests means that the party’s presidential nomination battle can be decided as early as March of the election year (as it was for John Kerry in 2004 and John McCain in 2008), some six months before the convention takes place. This provides the nominee with ample opportunity to become involved in shaping the party platform.

For example, Michael Dukakis’ campaign team heavily influenced the 1988 Democratic Party platform. Similarly, George H. W. Bush’s organization selected the team that drafted the 1992 Republican Party platform. During his 1996 reelection effort, Bill Clinton, along with the Democratic Leadership Council, dominated the process of drafting the Democratic Party platform. His opponent, Bob Dole, effectively had veto power over the language adopted in the Republican Party platform dealing with the party’s most contentious issue, abortion.12 In fact the language contained in party platforms clearly suggests that they are candidate-centered documents. In 2000, the Democratic Party platform contained ninety-nine references to Al Gore. George W. Bush was mentioned in the 2000 Republican Party platform forty-four times. Similarly, in 2004, John Kerry’s name appeared in the Democratic Party platform twenty-two times, and the Republican Party platform contained a whopping 250 references to George W. Bush.

The point is that because the platforms are tailored to the candidates, they are to some extent free to ignore them on the campaign trail if and when it becomes expedient. This happens with great frequency. A rather obvious example occurred in 1996, when Republican presidential hopeful Bob Dole freely admitted that he had not even read the Republican platform.13

This said, the platform is the party’s official policy document. It outlines the parties’ positions on all of the major issues of the day, and it is here that we can see numerous differences between the parties themselves. Drawing on statements taken from the 2000, 2004, and 2008 party platforms, table 9.2 compares the positions of the two parties on a variety of selected issues. The table clearly illustrates that there is more than a “dime’s worth of difference” between the two parties.

Much of the difference between the two parties in the past two decades is in the positions each takes on social and cultural issues, such as abortion and civil rights.14 The Republican Party has consistently held the more conservative or traditional positions on these so-called cultural issues. For example, Republicans generally oppose abortion in cases in which the mother’s life is not at stake, gay marriage, gays in the military, and embryonic stem-cell research, and favor school prayer. Most Democrats, conversely, favor a woman’s right to choose an abortion (even if it means that the state would have to pay for it), civil unions, gays in the military, and embryonic stem-cell research, and oppose school prayer.

Many Republicans oppose affirmative action, while a large percentage of Democrats favor programs that serve to redress past discrimination. Democrats usually support hate crime legislation, while Republicans typically (with some exceptions, such as when President George H. W. Bush signed the Hate Crimes Statistic Act in 1990) oppose it. Additionally, many Democrats favor legislation regulating certain aspects of gun ownership (e.g., waiting periods for the purchase of handguns). Most Republicans perceive these laws as an infringement on their Second Amendment rights and oppose them.

On issues related to education, Democrats generally advocate putting more money into public schools, whereas a large number of Republicans believe that the problem of failing schools should be addressed by some measure of privatization (namely, school vouchers). Democrats are more likely to be in favor of legislation and regulation to protect the environment, Republicans less so. The Bush administration’s withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol on greenhouse gas emissions, and Al Gore’s scathing criticism of this decision in his documentary An Inconvenient Truth, are examples of this difference. Democrats are generally in favor of greater government involvement in the realm of health care in order to reduce the number of uninsured and underinsured. Republicans typically oppose government involvement in managing the nation’s health care system.

![[chpt_fig_029.png]]

![[chpt_fig_030.png]]

In economic matters, Republicans tend to favor policies that emphasize individual initiative and responsibility, while Democrats are more inclined to see a role for the federal government. For example, Republicans are generally in favor of tax cuts (broadly defined) while many Democrats prefer using tax revenues to reduce the federal deficit or to increase federal spending on programs addressing social needs. Democrats often call for increases in the minimum wage to assist the working poor. Many Republicans believe that this is harmful to business and ultimately to workers since wage increases may force business to cut costs with layoffs. Finally, Republicans have historically been the party that takes a more hawkish stand on foreign policy disputes and favor greater military spending when compared to those in the Democratic Party. In 2008, the Democratic Party was in favor of more immediate troop withdrawal from Iraq, while the Republicans were committed to “staying the course.”

In short, there are sharp differences between the issue positions of the two parties. Importantly, however, these differences may not always be evident on the campaign trail. As previously noted, candidates sometimes stray from the official party line. We turn to why this is the case next.

### THE CAMPAIGN ENVIRONMENT AND  
CANDIDATES’ RESPONSES

The notion that there are few discernable differences between the two major parties is based on the fact that candidates sometimes moderate their party’s policy positions when campaigning for office. This is in large part a result of the electoral environment in the United States. The fact that all national elections in the United States are single-member district contests decided by plurality-winner rules, that there is a stable two-party system, and the fact that American public opinion lacks the extremism found in many other countries, together combine to moderate candidate positions during campaigns. We discuss each of these factors next.

#### Single-Member Districts

Electoral systems must address two main concerns: how many winners will there be, and, how will winners be determined? Focusing first on the question of how many winners there will be, a number of alternatives may be used. For example, city councils are often decided in at-large elections. Under this system, voters select a list of candidates for all of the seats on the council, and the seats are then awarded to those individuals who receive the most votes. Alternatively, some city and town councils, and even a few state legislatures, have so-called multi-member districts, where voters elect at least two candidates to represent the district. Philadelphia, Cincinnati, and Seattle are a few cities that use an at-large system to select their city councils, while the state of Maryland uses the multi-member district system to select members to the state legislature.15

However, in most elections in the United States, including all elections to federal office, there is only one election winner per district. In U.S. House elections, only one candidate wins a seat in Congress in each of the 435 districts. Similarly, while each state has two senators, elections to the Senate are staggered so that no state elects both its senators in the same election year. Finally, in every state except Maine and Nebraska, the winner of the popular vote receives all of the Electoral College votes awarded to that state.16 This system, where only one winner is selected from each election district, is known as a single-member district (SMD) system.

#### Plurality-Winner Rules

A second aspect of the electoral system that is important to understand is the winning rules. How much of the vote does a candidate (or party) need to get in order to be declared the winner? In parliamentary systems it is common to select multiple representatives from the entire country or a region according to the principle of proportionality. Under this system, known as proportional representation, citizens vote for a party. Each party then receives seats in parliament based on the proportion of votes it earns in the election. For example, in a national legislature with one hundred seats, a party that receives 30 percent of the vote would win thirty seats. The formulas governing proportional representation rules are typically much more complex,17 but the proportional principle still applies.

In the United States, plurality-winner rules determine the winners in federal elections. Referred to by some political scientists as “winner takes all” or “first past the post,” the winner is the candidate who receives the most votes, even if no candidate receives a majority of the votes. In a three-candidate race, for instance, one candidate can win with 38 percent of the vote, assuming that the other two candidates receive less than that amount. With the exception of Louisiana, plurality-winner rules apply to all elections to the U.S. House and Senate.

#### Two-Party System

Another aspect of the U.S. electoral environment that leads to moderation on the campaign trail is the existence of a stable two-party system. In fact, the same two political parties have dominated national politics since 1860. Several theories have been advanced to explain the stability of the two-party system in the United States. Political scientist V. O. Key suggests that there is a lasting duality of interests in American society that, while shifting (East-West, North-South, urban-rural), naturally coalesces to form a two-party system.18 Another theory is the social consensus theory, which suggests that because America did not have a feudal past, there has historically been agreement on the basic values that provide the foundation for the republic (democratic government, a market economy). Therefore, two parties have always been needed to forge compromise.19 These theories are centered primarily on the idea that parties are an outgrowth of social forces.

The most common explanation for the emergence and stability of the two-party system is Duverger’s Law. In an influential book, French political scientist Maurice Duverger suggested that countries with SMD, plurality-winner electoral systems tend to have two-party systems.20 There are some exceptions. While the British use an SMD, plurality-winner electoral system, there is a significant third party (the Liberal Democrats) and several significant regional parties (the Scottish National Party, the Welsh Plaid Cymru).

Despite these exceptions, third parties typically struggle to remain viable in SMD, plurality-winner electoral systems. To illustrate the difficulties that third parties confront, consider the following hypothetical example in which there are three political parties. Two of the parties are clearly stronger than the third: Party One commands 45 percent of the vote; Party Two, 44 percent; and Party Three, 11 percent. In a straight three-party race, Party One would win, but only by a plurality (45 percent). Given the relatively close margin of victory, Party One might try to align itself with Party Three in order to bolster its strength. Party Two might also attempt to do the same thing in order to gain a majority. Importantly, Parties One and Two are unlikely to try and align with each other. This is explained by the “minimal winning coalition” rule posited by William Riker: parties or groups have no incentive to build a majority that is larger than necessary to win.21

On the other hand, there would be a variety of incentives for Party Three to allow itself to be absorbed by one of the larger two parties. First, it faces an obvious choice: align with a major party and share power, or, remain independent and be consigned to last place. In other words, it has no prospect of gaining any power otherwise. Second, the larger parties could offer incentives to Party Three to join forces. These might include selecting Party Three’s leaders for prominent positions in the administration or adopting an issue position important to Party Three.

The point is that after repeated elections, the weakest party will eventually die. Voters, candidates, and supporters begin to see that it is politically expedient and strategically wise to align with one of the larger two parties. Duverger’s Law suggests that in SMD, plurality-winner electoral systems, third parties are practically squeezed out of these systems. He refers to this as the “mechanical effect” of the electoral system. Duverger also identifies what he calls a “psychological factor” which pushes third parties out. According to this explanation, voters do not want to waste or “throw away” their votes on a likely loser. These two forces ultimately explain why SMD, plurality-winner electoral systems erode the ability of third parties to compete and survive.

#### A Comparatively Moderate Electorate

A final element that explains the tendency of candidates to moderate their messages on the campaign trail is the fact that the American electorate is moderate in comparison to citizens in many other nations.22 Although some issues, such as abortion or gay marriage, can be fairly divisive (see chapter 2), relatively few people claim to be extremely liberal or extremely conservative on most issues.23

If we accept that aggregate opinion is moderate on most issues, it can be depicted as a bell-shaped curve, or normal distribution (see figure 9.1). In figure 9.1, the horizontal axis represents the hypothetical positions that can be taken on any given issue, ranging from extremely liberal (Democratic) on the left to extremely conservative (Republican) on the right. The vertical axis represents the number of people who take these positions. For example, at the extreme right end of the x-axis, there are relatively few individuals classified as extremely conservative Republicans. A majority clustered in the middle area of the spectrum indicates that most people are relatively moderate. The shaded area of the figure represents the number of voters who are one standard deviation off the mean, or the midpoint, and are the individuals who are closest to the middle. This shaded area represents 68.3 percent of the distribution, or the total area of the figure—a clear majority.

### MODERATION ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL:  
PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER WITH THE  
“MEDIAN VOTER THEORY”

Candidates from two parties competing for votes among a moderate electorate in which there will be only one winner will attempt to moderate their campaign message, or move to the middle, in order to capture the greatest number of votes. This is known as the “median voter theory.”

Originally the work of economists, it was first articulated in an article by Duncan Black and subsequently expanded upon in Anthony Downs’s influential An Economic Theory of Democracy.24 Downs’s theorem suggests individuals will vote for the party or candidate that is closest to them on the ideological spectrum. Because voters in the United States cluster in the middle of the spectrum (in statistical terms, are normally distributed), there are only two parties, and only one winner will be selected from these parties, parties and candidates have an incentive to avoid taking and articulating extreme issue positions during the campaign. Instead, they moderate their message and “move to the center.” As candidates from both parties moderate their messages or issue positions, their resulting messages will appear to be, or might actually be, quite similar. This then explains the myth of Tweedledum and Tweedledee.

Of course, “the middle of the spectrum” takes on a different meaning in the primary election than it does in the general election. Because primary voters tend to be more ideologically extreme than the general election electorate, the median primary voter is considerably less moderate.25 Thus, candidates must first adopt positions that satisfy their party’s base. This often complicates a candidate’s ability to move to the middle of the spectrum in the general election. In addition, political donors and party activists, who are critical to a candidate’s ability to wage a competitive campaign, are also more ideologically extreme, further complicating a candidate’s move to the middle during the general election.26

Examples of this movement to more moderate positions from the primary to the general election campaigns are not hard to find. In August of 2008 Barack Obama reversed his opposition to offshore drilling for oil and releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve after a spike in gas prices. He was also in favor of immediate withdrawal from Iraq, but throughout the course of the campaign added qualifiers that allowed for some troops to be left in the country. In the summer of 2008 Obama also reversed course on his opposition to wiretapping provisions contained in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a position that had endeared him to many “netroot” activists throughout the primary. He was fully supportive of Reverend Jeremiah Wright until public controversy forced him to disavow him in early summer. John McCain had his own share of policy reversals (opposition to Bush tax cuts, enhanced interrogation, more), but most of these occurred prior to the primary season—in an attempt to win primary voters.27

During the general election season, presidential candidates can and do blur the lines of difference between the two parties. This is both possible and strategically sound because of the electoral environment in the United States. However, this blurring of the line should not lead one to conclude that the parties themselves are similar.

#### Blurring the Lines and Candidate-Centered Campaigns

This electoral environment provides candidates with an incentive to blur the differences between their parties in pursuit of moderate voters. When this occurs, critics such as Ralph Nader often seize on this as confirmation that the two major parties are fundamentally similar. But the question might arise, why is it that parties do not stop candidates from straying from the party platform?

The short answer is that because candidates are responsible for the conduct of their own campaigns, they can easily ignore the party platform. Candidates, for example, build their own campaign organizations in order to win the party nomination, as competition for the nomination is intraparty, and they cannot rely on personnel or other resources that the party has available for the campaign. People loyal to the candidate become staff, and campaign professionals are hired to work for the candidate. Also, candidates actively go outside the party to seek endorsements and support from interest groups and prominent individuals. Candidates are largely responsible for raising the funds necessary to conduct their campaigns, and current campaign finance laws aid candidates rather than parties. This allows the candidate to have the final say in how campaign funds are spent.28

Among other things, this means that candidates can, and do, craft campaign messages that are often at odds with the policy positions contained in the party platform. If candidates, especially presidential candidates, stray too far from the party platform, the party has little if any power to sanction the candidate. The party cannot control important endorsements from outside groups or political notables, can only marginally affect a candidate’s financial base, and most importantly, cannot deny a candidate the ultimate prize, the party nomination.

### POST-ELECTION DIFFERENCES: GOVERNING

While presidential candidates on the general election campaign trail often blur the lines between the parties, most research overwhelmingly demonstrates that the moderate rhetoric of presidential candidates is a poor indicator of how members of the two parties actually govern, especially in the U.S. Congress. Increasingly, the evidence shows that Democrats and Republicans find very little upon which to agree when casting their roll-call votes on legislation in Congress.

Partisan differences among members of the U.S. Congress have always been present, although, contrary to the myth of Tweedledum and Tweedledee, polarization has increased in recent years. At the turn of the twentieth century, Democrats and Republicans held rather distinct ideological positions, with Republicans voting in a consistently conservative direction and Democrats voting in a more liberal direction. However, both Democrats and Republicans began to vote in a moderate direction during mid-century. Indeed, throughout the early 1970s, there was “considerable overlap” among Democrats and Republicans in terms of their congressional voting patterns.29 By the 1980s and 1990s that pattern had reversed, with both parties moving increasingly apart.

The dominant explanation for this development is the partisan realignment of the South. Southern conservatives joined the Republican Party, while African Americans affiliated with the Democratic Party. This significantly altered the ideological base of the two parties (see chapter 2 for more information and an explanation for this development).30 Also, as noted earlier, the bases of the two parties are comprised of more ideologically extreme members. Political activists, individual donors, and interest groups all exert pressure on elected officials to stand firm on certain core party principles, making moderation more difficult.31

Another explanation credits the redistricting process for polarization in Congress (see also chapter 11). Every ten years, each state determines its congressional district boundaries through what is usually a highly political process. In many instances, “bipartisan” redistricting schemes are adopted in which both parties cooperate with one another to protect their respective incumbents. As a result, elected officials often represent districts with heavy concentrations of voters from their own political parties, creating little incentive to reach across party lines and develop a more pragmatic approach to governing.32

Not surprisingly, ideologically moderate members of Congress have declined in number over the past several decades, leaving behind what is now best described as a “polarized, unidimensional Congress.”33 According to political scientist Keith Poole, “Moderates have virtually disappeared during the thirty years between the 93rd and 108th Congresses and the parties have pulled apart.”34 The result is growing polarization in Congress and perhaps clearer and more pronounced differences between the parties than at any time in recent memory. Indeed, researchers have concluded that polarization during the 109th Congress reached a post-Reconstruction high in the U.S. Senate and ranked third highest in the U.S. House over a 120-year period.35 In sum, the evidence coming from roll-call data in Congress makes clear that the Democratic and Republican parties do not look alike, as some have suggested.36

### CONCLUSION

The rhetoric on the presidential campaign trail can make it appear as if candidates from both parties are taking the same positions on the issues. A recent example occurred in the second presidential debate of 2000, between Al Gore and George W. Bush, as the candidates agreed with each other on 37 percent of the issues, leaving Bush to describe the debate as “a great lovefest.”37 In fact, the word “agree” was used thirty-one times throughout the debate (see box 9.1).

While this example is extreme, there was some evidence of this agreement and blurring of the lines between the two candidates in the first debate of 2008 as well. Referencing John McCain’s statements about Russia’s relationship with Georgia and Ukraine, Barack Obama responded, “I think Senator McCain and I agree for the most part on these issues.” On the issue of accountability in Washington and on Wall Street, he claimed that “Senator McCain [is] absolutely right that we need more responsibility.” With regard to earmarks and congressional spending he again stated that “Senator McCain is absolutely right that the earmarks process has been abused . . . And he’s also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests.”38 To be fair, there is generally little disagreement about these issues among the American public, but to hear opposing presidential candidates agree like this helps create the impression that little separates them.

BOX 9.1

THE “GREAT LOVEFEST” OF 2000: AL GORE AND GEORGE W. BUSH

Gore: We ought to recognize the value to our children and grandchildren of taking steps that preserve the environment in a way that’s good for them.

Bush: If we’re a humble nation [other countries will] respect us.

Gore: I agree with that.

Moderator: There was no U.S. intervention [in Rwanda] . . . Was that a mistake not to intervene?

Bush: I think the [Clinton] administration did the right thing.

Gore: I think [hate crimes are] intended to stigmatize and dehumanize a whole group of people.

Moderator: You have a different view of that?

Bush: No, I don’t really.

Bush: A marriage should be between a man and a woman.

Moderator: Vice President Gore?

This said, the main point here is that the statements of candidates should not be confused with the positions of the parties they claim to represent. Candidates are not parties. There is a party line (or to be more precise, two party lines), even if candidates do not always follow that party line. Each party’s platform reflects fundamental differences in the positions of both parties.

It is also important to remember that these differences are not simply words in some irrelevant party platform that are ignored by elected officials. In the halls of Congress, party differences are clear, as roll-call data increasingly demonstrate. Members of the two major parties do govern differently—even if the rhetoric of their presidential candidates can sometimes make the parties seem very similar.

## Selling the President

## The “Image is Everything” Myth

Can presidential candidates be successfully marketed, packaged, and sold? With sufficient funding, can a team of professional campaign managers take any reasonably attractive, well-spoken individual, craft an image for him or her, and win the Oval Office? While it is often only implied and understated, this myth suggests that the success of modern presidential candidates depends primarily on their ability to “sell” themselves.

This notion formally originated with Joe McGinniss’ Selling of the President in 1969, an account of how Richard Nixon was remade by campaign and advertising professionals in order to capture the White House in 1968.1 McGinniss, who joined the campaign as an observer, presents a fairly cynical picture of what politicians will do in order to win elective office. The theme of the book is that the public face of the candidate is all that really matters, whether genuine or not. One of the implications of the “selling of the president” metaphor (or marketing myth) is that slick campaigns and candidates can easily fool the American electorate. Many believe that this was a central element to Obama’s success in 2008.

Journalists, political observers, and many scholars have adopted the “selling of the president” metaphor. One of the classics in presidential campaign literature remains Theodore White’s Making of the President series, the first of which appeared in 1961. Although published before McGinniss’ book, the title clearly suggests that campaign management is the critical ingredient to a winning campaign.2 One well-known account of the 1980 presidential election, Blue Smoke and Mirrors, suggested that the presidential campaign of Ronald Reagan hoodwinked the public.3 A recent text focused on the financial aspect of the marketing myth, adopting the provocative title The Buying of the President 2004.4 A Gallup poll also reported that 59 percent of Americans believe that elections are “generally for sale to the candidate who can raise the most money.” Another well-known study of presidential campaign advertising discusses the idea of Packaging the Presidency.5 Other recent scholarship focuses on various aspects of presidential image making, political marketing, and how television advertising presents presidential candidates,6 as well as the role of ad agencies and image specialists in presidential campaigns and the handling of the candidate on the campaign trail.7

Presidential candidates themselves might believe in the marketing myth as well. One of the reasons that McGinniss’ book made such an impact was that in Nixon’s previous presidential campaign (in 1960) he had refused a proposal by a major advertising firm to manage his campaign using the latest marketing and media techniques.8 Nixon also reportedly refused to wear makeup to improve his skin color in his first debate with John F. Kennedy in 1960. Many accounts suggest that this hurt Nixon. According to one summary:

In substance, the candidates were much more evenly matched. Indeed, those who heard the first debate on the radio pronounced Nixon the winner. But the 70 million who watched television saw a candidate still sickly and obviously discomforted by Kennedy’s smooth delivery and charisma. Those television viewers focused on what they saw, not what they heard. Studies of the audience indicated that, among television viewers, Kennedy was perceived the winner of the first debate by a very large margin.9

The poor reaction to Nixon’s television debate performance led many to conclude that image and physical appearance were most critical in the modern television age. Indeed, after viewing the 1972 Robert Redford film The Candidate, Dan Quayle concluded that not only was he more attractive than the popular actor, but with the assistance of the right campaign professionals he could one day make a serious run for the White House.10 Senator Henry Jackson of Washington might provide the best example of how this prevailing wisdom began to affect politicians. Jackson had plastic surgery, lost twenty pounds, purchased a new wardrobe, and even hired speech instructors to improve his public speaking skills.11 Likewise, Al Gore, in the months leading up to his 2000 candidacy for the presidency, consulted Naomi Wolf, former actor, and image consultant Michael Sheehan on body language, intonation, and wardrobe.12

The “selling of the president” metaphor suggests that the presidency is a commodity to be packaged and sold to an unwitting public. Explicit in McGinniss’ account of the 1968 campaign is that the marketing of presidential candidates is something new to the television mass-marketing age. The truth is slightly more nuanced. Successful presidential campaigns focus to some degree on image, and this has been true throughout the history of the nation. It is also true that presidential image making has become more scientific and sophisticated with the advent of new technologies. Related to this development is the emergence of a class of campaign professionals, men and women whose job it is to manage all aspects of political campaigns. Much of this management revolves around the crafting, presentation, and preservation of candidate image.

However, like all metaphors, the “selling of the president” captures only part of the reality of a presidential campaign. Even in the television age, campaign organization matters. Behind the scenes of television advertising are campaign organizations, political party organizations, interest groups, unions, citizen groups, and individual citizens that attempt to persuade others to vote for their candidate.

This chapter will explore the marketing myth by deconstructing the “selling of the president” metaphor. First, we present a review of image making in presidential campaigns prior to the television age, illustrating that presidential campaigns have always been elite-driven, managed affairs that place a great emphasis on image. Next, we examine the emergence, growth, and specialization of a class of individuals engaged in the business of campaign management. We then focus on foot soldiers, or the organization of presidential campaigns, and what they do. A successful presidential campaign relies on equal parts image and campaign organization.

### PRESIDENTIAL IMAGE MAKING  
IN THE PRE-TELEVISION ERA

While campaign management has evolved into a highly specialized and lucrative profession, it was not simplistic or even primitive in the pre-television era. Politics is a high-stakes game, and presidential campaigns are the championship round. A focus on crafting a presidential image is certainly not new to the television age.13

There were three aspects to presidential image making in the pre-television era. The first was the image makers themselves. Who was responsible for crafting and presenting the candidate’s image to the voting public? Who were the campaign managers? Second, how did these managers present the candidate’s image? This question involves a discussion of the modes and content of campaign communication, as well as the basics of presidential electioneering practices in the pre-television era. Finally, what were some of the presidential candidate _resources/books//Conventional Wisdom and American Elections - Jody C. Baumgartner presented to the public? A brief discussion of each of these elements illustrates that presidential image making mattered in the pre-television era.

With regard to personnel, presidential image making in the nineteenth century was largely the domain of professional politicians and party leaders. Typically this meant a good number of government officials, elected or otherwise. Campaign organizations were formed immediately after the national party convention and usually included a representative from each state. This ensured that the campaign within each state ran efficiently and the national campaign was a coordinated effort. Because the technology of political communication was limited to the written and spoken word, campaign managers during this period were less specialized. The term, as such, consisted of those responsible for the crafting of the candidate’s image, while the presentation—the implementation—was left to newspaper writers (editors and journalists), cartoonists, pamphleteers, and other authors, as well as orators (speech makers).

Presidential candidates in the nineteenth century generally did not campaign on their own behalf because it was considered to be unseemly, or unpresidential.14 If a candidate did so, it typically meant he was trailing his opponent.15 Furthermore, campaign managers and parties feared the candidate might make statements that would damage the candidate’s image or election effort. Keeping the candidate out of the public spotlight and off the campaign trail was especially important for poor public speakers. In a letter written during the campaign of 1872, Ulysses S. Grant wrote,

My judgment is that it will be better that I should not attend any convention or political meeting during the campaign. It has been done, so far as I remember, but by two presidential candidates heretofore, and both of them were public speakers, and both were beaten. I am no speaker, and don’t want to be beaten.16

A good example of keeping a candidate off the campaign trail was the “front porch campaign” of Republican James Garfield in 1880. Most of his involvement in the campaign was in the form of receiving thousands of visitors on the front porch of his farm in Mentor, Ohio. This strategy was adopted in spite of the fact that many people considered Garfield to be one of the better public speakers of his time.17 Because political campaigns emulate what works in previous campaigns, Benjamin Harrison (in 1888) and William McKinley (in 1896) modeled their campaigns after Garfield’s.

Even in the early days of presidential elections, campaign managers worked hard to protect the image of their candidates. These campaign managers were individuals who led the efforts to build party support for the candidate before and during the national convention to secure the nomination. This was mainly a back room effort. They also directed the overall direction of the campaign during the general election season and managed the details of the ground campaign. John J. Beckley managed the 1796 campaign of Thomas Jefferson,18 Martin Van Buren the 1828 campaign of Andrew Jackson,19 and Illinois judge David Davis managed the 1860 campaign of Abraham Lincoln.20 Mark Hanna directed the campaign of William McKinley in 1896, bringing new-style advertising techniques to presidential campaigning.21 Ohio political boss Harry M. Daugherty arranged Warren Harding’s nomination and served as his campaign manager in 1920.22 James A. Farley and Louis Howe managed Franklin Roosevelt’s 1932 campaign.23

Before the era of electronic media, the communication or presentation of a presidential image was done either orally or in print. Speeches made by party leaders, notables, and orators served to garnish the presidential candidate’s image. Printed materials included pamphlets that both created and propagated the image the candidate was trying to portray, short treatises by or letters from the candidate on particular issues, and the candidate’s biography. Another popular form of campaign literature was the campaign textbook, which consisted of various editorials, cartoons, and issue tracts that the party used to promote the candidate’s image and a common campaign theme. Campaign slogans contributed to the candidate’s image making. Newspapers also helped by printing favorable articles, editorials, and political cartoons. In addition, banners, buttons, hats, flags, clothing, and other campaign materials were printed with the candidate’s or party’s name, campaign slogan, or theme.24

Finally, the campaign would commission songs, shouts, chants, and poems to build and spread the image of the candidate. For example, in 1840,William Henry Harrison’s supporters sang (all to popular tunes) various short songs entitled “The Soldier of Tippecanoe,” “The Farmer of North Bend,” “The Log Cabin Song,” “Old Tip and the Log Cabin Boys,” and more.25 In 1864, crowds of Lincoln supporters might have been heard singing to the following:

Old Abe Lincoln came out of the wilderness,  
Out of the wilderness, out of the wilderness,  
Old Abe Lincoln came out of the wilderness,  
Down in Illinois.26

The evolution of presidential image making tied in closely to developments in communications technology. Presidential campaigns have always taken advantage of the latest technological advances. William Jennings Bryan recorded a speech on a phonograph record (in 1900) and was the first to appear in a campaign movie short (in 1908). Both parties used radio in the presidential campaign of 1924, and by the 1940s, radio advertising accounted for up to one-third of the budget of presidential campaigns. Alf Landon was the first to produce a candidate biography film in 1936.27

Presidential image making is no simple affair. Crafting a presidential image is the art of building on certain characteristics of the candidate in order to portray him or her as a capable, positive, strong leader. Typically, presidential candidates also attempt to convey the idea that they are trustworthy and understand the problems of the average citizen.28 This was true even in the pre-television era. Box 10.1 illustrates selected _resources/books//Conventional Wisdom and American Elections - Jody C. Baumgartner and their origins from the pre-television era.

The art and science of packaging presidential candidates was well developed by the early part of the twentieth century. By creatively using the available communications technologies of the day, presidential campaigns paid a great deal of attention to crafting an image for their candidate. The “packaging the president” metaphor came about with the invention and widespread penetration of electronic media and the development of more advanced marketing techniques. However, the emergence of a new class of campaign specialists was especially important in this regard.

### IMAGE SPECIALISTS:  
THE NEW “ELECTION MEN”

In 1973, David Rosenbloom published a book entitled, The Election Men, describing a new breed of professional campaign management specialists.29 As previously noted, campaign managers are not new to presidential campaigning. However, the emergence and development of a profession in which increasingly specialized individuals, independent of party, sell their services to candidates at all levels is relatively new. As Robert Agranoff observed in 1976, “The party professional has given way to a different type of professional—the advertising and public relations man, the management specialist, the media specialist, the pollster—who performs services for the candidates based on skills he has acquired in nonpolitical fields.”30

The birth of political consultancy as a business is credited to two Californians, Clem Whitaker, a political reporter, and Leone Baxter, a public relations worker for the local Redding, California, chamber of commerce. In 1933, both worked on a local initiative campaign and the following year formed Campaigns, Inc., a political consultant business. Their firm applied mass-marketing techniques to politics. In 1936, Republican presidential candidate Alf Landon employed an ad agency to help conduct his campaign. Over the next two decades, other presidential candidates did so as well, using various agencies to produce television advertisements. During this time, public opinion polling became an established industry, and campaign professionals explored its applications to campaign strategy. Early pioneers of the industry of campaign management include Joe Napolitan, Clif White, Matt Reese, Bill Roberts, Stu Spencer, Joe Cerrell, Bill Hamilton, Bob Squier, and Walter deVries, all of whom began working in the field during the 1950s.

BOX 10.1

PRESIDENTIAL IMAGES FROM THE PRE-TELEVISION ERA

Andrew Jackson (1828): “Stonewall Jackson,” and “Hero of New Orleans,” in reference to his victory over the British in 1815. Also known as “Old Hickory,” a reference to his robust nature and common roots.

William Henry Harrison (1840): “Old Buckeye,” a reference to his common Ohio roots as well as a take-off of “Old Hickory.” Better known was the campaign slogan, “Tippecanoe and Tyler Too.” This was a reference to the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811, in which Harrison defeated the Shawnee chief Tecumseh, as well as his running mate, John Tyler.

Abraham Lincoln (1860): The image of Lincoln as a “Rail Splitter” highlighted his roots as a hard working, common man. The term “Honest Old Abe” refers to his integrity, another common characteristic in presidential image making.

Ulysses S. Grant (1868): Grant parlayed his success as the victorious Union general into an image of someone equally capable of leading the nation.

James Garfield (1880): “Boatman Jim” was portrayed as a commonsense man of the people, highlighted also by the front porch campaign in his hometown of Mentor, Ohio.

Theodore Roosevelt (1904): The “Rough Rider” image drew attention to his energetic, adventurous, and vigorous spirit, implying that he would bring these qualities to the White House.

Woodrow Wilson (1916): The campaign slogan “He kept us out of the war” (and others) drew attention to the fact that, until that point, Wilson had been steadfast in keeping the United States out of the European war.

Dwight D. Eisenhower (1952, 1956): “Ike” was painted as a nonpartisan choice who, by virtue of his military record of leading the allies to victory in Europe in World War II, would be the best choice to lead the country.

John Kennedy’s 1960 campaign proved to be a turning point for professional campaign management in that he assembled one of the largest teams of consultants, strategists, pollsters, and media advisors to that point.31 By 1969, the American Association of Political Consultants (AAPC) formed, originally numbering only twenty-five members. Since then, membership in the association has exploded, with several thousand active members and many nonmembers in the business as well. It is now almost impossible to run successfully for federal office without employing the services of these campaign professionals.

Not only has the business grown, but it has also become increasingly specialized. Campaigns and Elections, the trade magazine for the AAPC, depicts nearly every type of campaign activity in articles, features, and advertisements. This includes “fund raising, polling, electoral mobilization, accounting and compliance, research, the production and distribution of audio-visual advertising, direct mail and literature, internet services,” and more.32 A good deal of the specialization in the industry has come as the result of developments in technology. Computer-assisted telephone dialing, the Internet, database technology, and satellite teleconferencing are just a few technologies that have emerged that demand specialists who are capable of using them.33

Crafting and producing a presidential image—much of which is done via television—is integral to the specialization of campaign management. Image specialists include pollsters who pretest and posttest _resources/books//Conventional Wisdom and American Elections - Jody C. Baumgartner on voters and potential voters and inform others in the campaign on what seems to work. Also included are all the individuals involved in the production of television ads (meaning writers, producers, etc.). After ad production, the campaign distributes ads to broadcast and cable television networks and stations. This requires ad buyers as well as voter and media market researchers and pollsters to target the image to the right audience.

In fact, presidential campaigns spend a majority of their money on media-related products or services. While all television advertising is not necessarily image-based advertising, it is essential to maintain the correct image in any ad. An analysis from the 2004 presidential campaign suggests that:

the two largest consultants . . . were the media consultants for the Bush and Kerry presidential campaigns. The media group that created the president’s television commercials, Maverick Media, was paid a combined $177 million by the Bush campaign and the Republican National Committee. Riverfront Media, the group led by consultant Bob Shrum, worked on John Kerry’s media campaign and was paid $150 million by his campaign and the Democratic National Committee.34

Presidential candidate image making is now a specialized, big business. This is mainly a product of the television age and is likely the reason that the idea of the packaged presidency emerged and has become a popularly accepted myth. However, image making is not exclusively a product of the modern era, nor is it the only ingredient for a successful campaign. In the next section, we look at the “ground war” in presidential campaigns. In the television age, the ground war (as opposed to the televised “Air War”35) is as crucial to winning the White House as it was in the previous era.

### THE GROUND WARS: THEN AND NOW

A less noticed, but central, element of any campaign is the effort to mobilize voters and potential voters. In particular, campaigns expend a great deal of energy registering new voters and motivating citizens to vote. It does a candidate little good to persuade people that they are the right person for the job if these supporters have not taken the time to register to vote or stay home on Election Day. In the pre-television era, this grass-roots mobilization was done in person.

Martin Van Buren developed one of the first models for efficient grass-roots mobilization for the New York Democratic Party (“The Democracy,” as it was referred to) in preparation for the 1828 presidential campaign of Andrew Jackson. He divided responsibility for the state campaign among other party leaders at the local level, who in turn recruited other volunteers. Other states organized in a similar manner. Local volunteers, called “Hurra Boys,” planted hickory trees or handed out hickory sticks at campaign rallies in honor of Jackson, whose nickname was “Old Hickory.” In this model, mobilization of volunteers was efficient, often organized into clubs:

[They] usually bear the candidates’ names [and are] formed on every imaginable basis, that of locality, of race, of trade or professions, of university affiliation. There are Irish clubs, Italian clubs, German clubs, Scandinavian clubs, Polish clubs . . . young men’s clubs, lawyer’s clubs, dry-goods clubs, insurance men’s clubs, shoe and leather clubs . . . [and] clubs of the graduates of various colleges.36

These clubs performed many functions. In some cases they marched the streets, often accompanied by a marching band, charged with whipping up support for the candidate.37

The ground game was elaborately and systematically organized, what one campaign historian has referred to as “army style” organization.38 During the 1880 campaign of James Garfield, the canvassing effort in New York City centered around a list of three hundred thousand voters, organized by precinct.39 The ground campaign was so important to parties that they did not rely on volunteers alone. Paid workers, sometimes numbering in the thousands, distributed campaign materials and canvassed voters in the attempt to build support.40 Parties hosted picnics, clambakes, and barbeques, attempting to generate enthusiasm for the candidate. In 1880, Standard Oil mobilized two thousand of its employees in the state of Indiana for the Garfield campaign and counted on the active support of better than twenty-five thousand of the candidate’s fellow church members.41

As Election Day neared, campaigns directed their efforts to ensuring that people would turn out to vote. Get-out-the-vote (GOTV) efforts in this era were extremely aggressive. Party leaders went to any lengths to produce the number of votes needed for victory. For example, if the infamous Tammany Hall machine in New York City needed extra votes to put their candidate over the top, they would import extra voters from New Jersey or Pennsylvania.42 Parties were also not averse to buying votes. Stephen Dorsey, one of the campaign managers of the 1880 Garfield campaign, reportedly bought thirty thousand votes in Indiana for two dollars apiece.43

As with other aspects of political campaigns, voter mobilization efforts are more systematic and sophisticated today. Party organizations mainly fund these efforts and conduct them at the state and local levels, and these efforts are an important element of the campaign. Research demonstrates that voters are more likely to vote if they are contacted by political parties, candidate organizations, or other interested groups,44 and voter turnout can be the critical difference in an election outcome. In 1968, for example, the Democratic Party did not heal its wounds after its bitter and divisive national convention until late October. This resulted in fewer Democrats registering and, thus, fewer votes for the party’s presidential nominee Hubert Humphrey. The Democrats in 1976, with the help of organized labor (which plays a central role in Democratic GOTV efforts),45 registered more voters than Republicans. Jimmy Carter’s 1976 win was also attributed to the party’s successful drive to register African Americans. Republicans, who rely on volunteers, housewives, small business owners, and retirees,46 mounted a sophisticated, and largely successful, effort to increase turnout in 1984, contributing to Reagan’s victory.47

In 2000, both parties engaged in intensive turnout efforts in battleground states. The Democratic Party had an estimated forty thousand volunteers making personal contacts with voters, in addition to sending an estimated fifty million pieces of mail. Several key interest groups aided this effort. For example, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) actively raised voter awareness among African Americans in Florida, whose turnout in 2000 was almost double what it was in 1996. Their campaign included recorded telephone messages from President Clinton and African American leaders urging people to vote, as well as reminders from the ministers of black churches of the importance of voting. Republicans were active as well. In the last week of the campaign they made approximately eighty-five million telephone calls and sent over 110 million pieces of mail. During the final two weeks, they distributed roughly sixteen million pieces of campaign literature to people’s doors, 1.2 million yard signs, and over one million bumper stickers. The National Rifle Association, pro-life organizations, and other groups helped in this effort.48

Still, according to Bush’s main strategist Karl Rove, some four million conservative voters stayed home in 2000. Rove subsequently built a GOTV operation designed to increase turnout in 2004. The effort focused on districts “where Republican candidates underperformed against the Democratic profile of the district.”49 The effort started with the purchase of commercial databases to pinpoint voters based on, among other things, shopping habits and magazine subscriptions. Gun owners, for example, were targets, as were subscribers to magazines like Christianity Today.50 Republicans tested the operation in the 2002 congressional elections and increased turnout over 1998 by five million voters (as opposed to only two million for Democrats).51 The commercial databases allowed the campaign to target appeals to members of thirty-two different subgroups in 2004.52

Rove also focused on increasing registration.53 To mobilize young adults Republicans dispatched a fifty-six-foot, eighteen-wheeled mobile voter registration center named Reggie the Registration Rig to various youth-oriented events such as MTV’s “Total Request Live.”54 The Bush team registered approximately 3.4 million voters who had recently moved, also focusing on roughly seven million identified Republicans who did not consistently vote and another ten million unaffiliated voters.55 In all, the campaign allocated approximately 125 million dollars for voter mobilization, more than three times the amount spent in 2000, and other groups (e.g., Progress for America Voter Fund,56 various churches57) assisted in the effort as well.

As important as the more traditional registration efforts was the aggressive and innovative use of new technologies the Bush campaign made in 2004, using the Internet to build networks of people who canvassed neighborhoods and built other networks.58 This “one-on-one politics” effort was a throwback to an earlier era, with a modern twist. On the Bush web site individuals could type in their zip code and receive directions to their polling places, a list of five people in their immediate area, and directions to their homes. One person would volunteer to recruit a few people, each of whom in turn recruited several more, resulting in a network of volunteers connected by e-mail to the national campaign organization. This resulted in approximately 1.4 million volunteers in key battleground states.59 Daily messages and communications from national team leaders encouraged these local leaders and kept them informed.60 The web site also provided links to local talk radio, boilerplate letters to the editor, and other campaign materials.

Taken together, the Bush campaignreported they made as manyas eighteen million attempts to contact voters in battleground states in the last four days of the campaign.61 Democrats were active as well. The Kerry campaign reportedly spent sixty million dollars in voter mobilization efforts, more than twice the amount spent by Democrats in 2000. In addition, the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) spent forty-five million dollars in sixteen battleground states and America Coming Together employed 2,500 people to register and contact new voters. They claim to have alone made approximately sixteen million telephone calls in the last three weeks of the campaign, sent twenty-three million pieces of mail, and delivered eleven million flyers.

Although Barack Obama had an enormous amount of personal appeal he also understood that the presidency is not won by image, but on the ground. From the perspective of campaign mechanics the Obama effort was unprecedented in organization, execution, and scope. Although based on the model Rove employed in 2004, it went, according to one account, “well beyond even what Rove built. . . . [using] its record-breaking fundraising to open more than 700 offices in more than a dozen battleground states, pay several thousand organizers, and manage tens of thousands of volunteers.”62 In a summer 2008 editorial, Rove himself called Obama’s ground game “brilliant.”63

Like the Bush campaign, Obama also harnessed the Internet to recruit and organize an enormous army of volunteers. His advantage over McCain in this regard was due to the fact that he had four times as many supporters than McCain on social networking sites like MySpace and Facebook.64 In any case, Internet mobilization translated into a systematic effort on the ground. For example, Ohio was broken down into 1,231 “neighborhoods” which contained 8–10 precincts, and importantly, also included rural areas that Kerry ignored in 2004. He gave neighborhood team leaders a great deal of latitude in organizing their neighborhood networks as they saw fit, also encouraging them to spend the summer recruiting more volunteers rather than immediately start voter contact.65 In fact, the campaign reported that they had as many as six million volunteers by Election Day, which if true, is a staggering number considering that only 130 million people voted.66

Obama was the first candidate in recent history to outline a fifty-state strategy. He was the first top-tier Democratic candidate, for example, to visit Idaho during the primaries.67 The organization he built in forty-eight states in order to win the Democratic nomination was already in place and expanded on for the fall campaign. The campaign had paid staffers in every state in the union, and the campaign targeted twenty-two critical states for “large-scale operations.” The campaign spent $4.3 million on rent and utilities for field offices in the month of August alone.68 For many campaigns in years past, this would have been a respectable amount of money spent on television advertising. As one source noted, Obama employed “the largest full-time paid [campaign] staff in presidential history . . . well over twice the size of the Bush reelection campaign staff in 2004 and nearly three times the size of McCain’s.” By the end of May the amount of money Obama paid in staff salary was triple that of McCain.69 One report further suggests that the Obama campaign contacted more voters than McCain nationally, as well as in sixteen of seventeen critical battleground states.70

### CONCLUSION

Packaging, marketing, selling, or otherwise crafting and propagating presidential candidate _resources/books//Conventional Wisdom and American Elections - Jody C. Baumgartner are not new to the television era. It is an old practice in presidential campaigns. What has changed with the rise of television are the tools with which a new breed of highly specialized election people, or campaign managers, can craft and sell these _resources/books//Conventional Wisdom and American Elections - Jody C. Baumgartner to the public, using highly specialized election people, or campaign managers. This has most assuredly made image making in the television era more sophisticated, but this is a far cry from implying or intimating, by way of metaphor or otherwise, that the practice is new.

In addition, while image building has its importance, it should not detract from the fact that political campaigns are largely fought on the ground. In short, all of the slick advertisements designed to persuade voters are pointless if no one votes. This is not to suggest that image is irrelevant. Certainly in a close election, such Bush-Gore in 2000, every vote counts, and even the smallest details could potentially mean the difference between victory or defeat for a candidate, as the literature on campaign effects suggests.71 Nevertheless, it is important to remember that behind every campaign are volunteers, workers, and other individuals who carry their message to others and remind people of the importance of their vote. In recent election cycles, turnout has been a prime determinant of victory. The Bush 2004 and Obama 2008 campaigns made innovative and aggressive use of information technology to mobilize supporters. This resulted in a national network of committed supporters who encouraged, cajoled, and otherwise persuaded others to register and vote for their candidate. The sales job was personal—one on one—and, in both cases, effective.

## The Illusion of Competitive  
Congressional Elections

If a group of planners sat down and tried to design a pair of assemblies with the goal of serving members’ reelection needs year in and year out, they would be hard pressed to improve on what exists [in the U.S. Congress].

—David R. Mayhew1

Democratic theory specifies that in a democracy, citizens elect most of their leaders in free, fair, and regular elections.2 The notion that these elections should be competitive is almost self-evident. There would be little reason to hold an election if the outcome was a foregone conclusion. Interestingly, and perhaps not surprisingly, most Americans believe that congressional elections are competitive. According to a poll conducted prior to the 2006 mid-term elections, more than 71 percent of those who had an opinion on the question anticipated a “close” contest in their district for the U.S. House.3

However, a significantly smaller percentage of congressional races actually are competitive. This chapter examines this lack of electoral competitiveness in congressional elections. We begin by showing that congressional elections have become less competitive in recent years, especially elections to the House of Representatives. In particular, we illustrate that incumbents rarely lose in their bids for reelection. As Ronald Reagan once quipped, there was more turnover in the former Soviet Union’s presidium than in the U.S. Congress.4 In addition to winning, incumbents are doing so by greater margins.

In the following section we examine the advantages incumbents have in their bids for reelection. First, there are various institutional factors associated with the job that give them an advantage. These include an organizational base for their campaign in the form of offices and staffers, a greater ability to easily communicate with voters and potential voters, as well as being in a position to solve problems constituents might be having with the federal bureaucracy. In addition, certain legislative norms in Congress itself help members enhance their reputations, and they have greater access to interest groups and political action committees (PACs) to help finance their campaigns. This greater ability to raise funds contributes to a “scare-off” effect, which in turn helps depress the entrance of adequately funded quality challengers. Finally, recent trends in congressional redistricting, greater name recognition, and voter loyalty advantage incumbents as well.

In the final section of the chapter we shift gears, discussing how incumbents can lose. We focus on the fact that the “scare-off” effect does not always work, on how presidential politics affect congressional elections, and on the occasional effect of “national tides” on what are essentially local congressional elections. We conclude that while American elections satisfy most of the conditions for a democracy, the lack of competitiveness in congressional elections poses some problems for a healthy democratic system.

### BACKGROUND

For many years Congress was not considered a career. Until the 1900s it was quite common for a member of Congress, especially in the House, to serve only one or two terms (senators were not directly elected until after the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913). There were a relatively high number of incumbents who did not seek reelection each election cycle. There are typically three general explanations given for this.

First, in earlier times, the notion of a “career” in Congress was not desirable to most ambitious professionals. Mediocre salaries, hot and humid summers in Washington, D.C., long stretches of time away from home, and the rather limited responsibilities of the federal government all combined to make the job of a U.S. Congressman less attractive than it is today. Second, even those who wished to stay in Washington for multiple terms were hard pressed to do so. Most congressional elections were highly contested, close races. Third, many members were prevented from running for more than one or two terms. In many states, especially non-southern states, party organizations had informal term limits that prevented members from seeking the nomination more than one or two times (during this time, political parties controlled the nomination process).5

However, as the century progressed, the percentage of House incumbents running for reelection increased, and the percentage of those retiring—voluntarily or otherwise—decreased. Table 11.1 shows that over time, considerably more House incumbents ran for reelection and a much smaller percentage opted to retire. Another way to look at this would be to track the number of first-term members (freshmen) in the House or the average number of terms served by House members over time.6 As seen in table 11.2, the percentage of freshmen in the House dropped more than thirty percentage points (from 51.3 to 20.4), and the average number of terms that members served more than doubled (from 1.88 to 4.34) in the century after 1850. Together, tables 11.1 and 11.2 display a pattern of steadily increasing tenure in the House from the mid-1800s forward.

![[chpt_fig_032.png]]

The pattern of increased numbers of incumbents running for and winning elections accelerated in the post–World War II era (see table 11.3). Since 1946, an average of 91.4 percent of House incumbents have sought reelection per election cycle, and the percentage of those seeking reelection has dipped below 87 percent only once. This occurred in 1992, in the aftermath of a major check-writing scandal, when only 84.6 percent of House incumbents sought reelection. During this period, very few of those seeking reelection were defeated in either the primary or general elections. An average of 1.7 percent of incumbents per election cycle did not win their party’s primary, and the average number defeated in the general election was just 6 percent.

![[chpt_fig_033.png]]

![[chpt_fig_034.png]]

Most incumbents who survive their primaries win in the general election. In only six elections since World War II has the percentage of incumbents winning reelection fallen below 90 percent, and in the past four decades, the number has not fallen below 88 percent. Ninety-eight percent of incumbents seeking reelection won their races in 1998 and 2000; only six were not reelected. Even in 1974, a bad year for Republicans tainted with the scandal of Watergate, a full 77 percent of the Republicans seeking reelection were returned to office.7 From 1982 through 2002, an average of 15.4 percent of incumbents faced no major-party opposition in the general election (see table 11.4). In 1998, almost one in four incumbents (23.4 percent) had no major-party opposition. Races like these are clearly uncompetitive.

While the House returns a very high percentage of incumbents, the Senate is slightly more competitive. In the post–World War II era, 82.7 percent of Senate incumbents sought reelection (see table 11.5). Approximately one in twenty (4.8 percent) lost their primary bids, and of those who gained their party nomination and stood in the general election, less than one in five (17.7 percent) lost. Taken together, 79.1 percent of incumbent senators seeking reelection were successful. While there is more variation in reelection rates than in House races, the general trend of elections becoming less competitive is similar. For example, in the eleven election cycles from 1982 to 2002, only 3 of 306 Senate incumbents lost in their party’s primary.

![[chpt_fig_035.png]]

![[chpt_fig_036.png]]

![[chpt_fig_037.png]]

![[chpt_fig_038.png]]

Congressional incumbents are not only winning, but they are doing so by larger margins. In 1974, political scientist David Mayhew noted that fewer elections in the postwar era could be classified as competitive. Mayhew dubbed this trend “the case of the vanishing marginals,” a reference to the fact that close races in the House were becoming rare (Senate races tend to be more competitive, for reasons we will discuss shortly).8

As figure 11.1 shows, this trend has become more pronounced over time, especially in the House. The dotted line in the figure represents the percentage of House races in which the winner received more than 60 percent of the vote (traditionally defined as an uncompetitive election). It shows, for example, that the winning candidate received more than 60 percent of the vote in an astonishing 80 percent of all U.S. House elections in 2002—a high for the post-Watergate era. In addition, 18 percent of all U.S. House elections were uncontested in 2002—equaling the high mark set in 1988 during the post-Watergate era.9

To be fair, it is worth noting that open-seat elections to Congress are in fact quite competitive. But, not only are more incumbents running, they are winning, and doing so by greater margins. Some scholars have attempted to quantify the value of incumbency in an election. Various measures suggest that incumbency in the House was worth between 2.1 to 3.3 percent of the vote from 1946 to 1966 and jumped to between 7 and 8.6 percent from 1968 to 2000. In the Senate, from 1914 to 1960, incumbency was worth a bit more than 2 percent of the vote and jumped to 7 percent from 1962 to 1992.10

Why are congressional elections so noncompetitive? There are several contributing factors, most of which revolve around the various advantages incumbents enjoy by virtue of being the current officeholder. This is the subject of the next section.

### THE ELECTORAL ADVANTAGES  
OF INCUMBENCY

Our discussion of the advantages of incumbency is divided into several sections. The first section deals with various institutional factors, or perks, of the office. These advantages include a large staff working for members of Congress as well as office space, computers, and so on. In addition, members of Congress employ various ways to communicate with their constituents at the taxpayer’s expense. Incumbents also aggressively solve various bureaucratic problems for members of their district in hopes that these favors will be returned on Election Day. Finally, there are certain norms guiding legislative activity itself that favor incumbents, allowing them to build and present their record in a favorable light.

In addition to these institutional advantages, there are other aspects of incumbency that give incumbents an edge over challengers. One is an overwhelming edge in raising campaign funds, which can sometimes scare off quality challengers.11 Congressional redistricting efforts have also helped incumbents in recent years. Finally, the criteria that people use to make their voting decisions favor incumbents as well. Together, these factors provide the current officeholder with an enormous edge in a reelection bid.

#### Office and Staff

Institutional advantages are those associated with doing the job of a congressperson. Congressional office comes with various perks, often referred to (e.g., in American government textbooks) as “in kind” advantages, some of which aid in the reelection efforts of members. One advantage is the fact that each member of Congress has a staff that also serves as the nucleus of a permanent campaign organization, and the number of these staffers has increased dramatically in the past century.

The number of employees in the House of Representatives has increased approximately sevenfold since 1930. In 1950, the House employed slightly fewer than two thousand staffers. By 1990, that number exceeded 7,500. Individually, the average member has fourteen employees (staffers) but is allowed eighteen full-time and four part-time employees.12 Total staff growth of the Senate has been slightly less. In 1955, there were approximately one thousand staffers in the Senate and, by 1990, four thousand. However, the average is thirty-four staffers per senator, from as few as thirteen to as many as seventy-one. There are no limits to the number of staffers a senator may employ.13 Beyond serving as an unofficial nucleus for their campaign organization, members of Congress use staffers for casework in their home districts, especially if it looks to be a tight race. The percentage of total staff working for House members in their districts nearly doubled from 1972 to 1992 (22 to 42 percent), and for senators the percentage almost tripled during the same period (from 12 to 32 percent).14

Members of Congress are also given allowances for “travel, communications, office rental, stationery, computer services, and mail.”15 House members average about 2.3 offices in their districts, while senators average four offices per district (state).16 All of this comes at the expense of the taxpayer. While these staffers technically cannot be used for the campaign, the member’s press secretary is especially important helping to generate favorable news about the congressperson at the local level.17 In addition, staffers help with constituency service, which creates a favorable impression that may translate into a vote on Election Day.

#### Direct Communications

Members of Congress take full advantage of what is known as the “franking” privilege. This is the right of members of Congress to send letters to their constituents informing them about what is happening in Washington, at government expense. The rationale for this is straightforward. The health of a representative democracy depends in part on an informed citizenry, and central to this is knowing what our representative is doing in government. In fact, the precedent for this practice dates back to 1660 in the British House of Commons and was granted by the Continental Congress to members in 1775. Subsequently, the first U.S. Congress passed a law granting its members the privilege in 1789.18

One widely circulated account suggests that new members are urged to “use the frank,”19 and by all accounts, they do so. Members of Congress send mass newsletters to all constituents as well as more narrowly tailored messages to different segments of their electorate. Often recipients are invited in these messages to send their thoughts to their member of Congress. Estimates suggest that from the mid-1960s to 1990, the volume of franked mail has at least tripled and perhaps quadrupled. Importantly, the amount of franked mail is higher during election years.20 In 1990, Congress enacted new regulations limiting the amount of franked mail to one piece per address per state for a senator and three pieces per address per House district. Other regulations, such as prohibiting personal photographs of or references to the member and integrating franking costs into the members’ office expenses were added. However, at a minimum, these communications keep the incumbent’s name fresh in voters’ minds and present a favorable image of him or her.

#### Bureaucratic Ombudsmanship: Casework in the District

It is not unusual for an ordinary citizen to need assistance from time to time navigating or circumventing the bureaucracy that makes up modern government. Citizens might contact their member of Congress for any number of reasons, which could include requests or questions about an expired passport only days before a planned trip or a tax problem with the Internal Revenue Service. Here, the member would be acting in a capacity analogous to that of an ombudsman (or ombudsperson), a government-appointed individual who looks after the rights and needs of citizens in disputes with government. Originally a Scandinavian concept, ombudsmen are found in virtually all modern bureaucracies (including some larger corporations). Members of Congress take this type of work—referred to as casework—very seriously.

Each member of Congress receives thousands of such requests each year. While it is impossible for members to handle each request personally, much of the staff work handled in district offices is devoted to resolving citizens’ problems and answering requests. This is an extremely effective way to win the loyalty and votes of citizens and others. A favor done for a constituent makes it more likely that he or she will repay the kindness come election time—and perhaps even tell others. This type of interpersonal, word-of-mouth advertising is invaluable.21

#### Favorable Local Media

Incumbents have certain advantages with various media that make it easier to boost name recognition among their constituents as well as communicate and cultivate a favorable view among supporters and potential supporters. First, all members of Congress have their own web sites, which allow interested parties to learn about what they are doing in Washington.22 The government pays for these web sites, and members use them to publicize their achievements, downplay their shortcomings, and invite visitors to send comments and feedback.

Second, both parties in each house of Congress, as well as the chambers themselves, have state-of-the-art audiovisual studios. Members can produce short statements to the press, interviews, and other types of programming. Along with satellite link technology, this allows incumbents to feed the local media, which is always looking for story material, especially on 90- or 120-minute evening newscasts.23 Some members are regular guests on various local programs; others have their own local programs (e.g., a call-in show). Almost all produce press releases on a fairly regular basis that local news organizations print or air unedited, presenting them as news.

The link with local media outlets is important because studies show that local news organizations are rarely as confrontational as the national press. When members are featured in a thirty-second spot answering a few questions, the questions are rarely difficult and the answers rarely challenged. This is in part because the news organizations in question (typically the electronic media) are in need of material and want to make sure they have access in the future, so they work at not offending the member. In addition, local reporters are often less well prepared for the interview or versed in national politics in general. The result is generally favorable coverage in local media, which is especially helpful for members of the House, who mainly run on local issues.24

#### Legislative Norms

In a representative democracy, an assumption exists that there is a link between what people want and what elected officials work to accomplish. Members of Congress understand this, and understand that this is what people expect. Therefore, it is not surprising that their legislative activity is geared toward working—or at least appearing to work—for the people in their district. With so many decentralized committees and subcommittees in Congress, new members have almost no trouble seeking out and receiving an assignment on a committee that deals with policy concerns important to their district. For example, if the legislator is from Washington state, he or she might seek assignment on the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee; if from the Midwest, on agriculture. Because the details of most policy is worked out in committees, this allows the legislator to go back to the district and claim to be doing something for the district.25

Another legislative norm is that a member is not required or expected to vote with his or her party if that vote will damage them electorally. Weak party discipline allows members to protect themselves if the party’s position contradicts what constituents expect. Finally, most members cooperate with other members when it comes to distributive legislation. If there is “pork” (government projects that benefit a specific locale) to be spread around, everyone gets a piece to take home to the district. Additionally, a member will support another member’s bill with the expectation of reciprocity. This reciprocity is referred to as “logrolling,” and allows members at the end to claim credit for passing legislation that is popular back home.

#### Financial Advantages

Congressional elections cost a great deal of money. One estimate suggested that in 2008 congressional elections would cost a total of approximately $2.9 billion.26 In three of the most competitive House races in 2008, candidates alone raised an average of $10 million. In the Senate, candidates in three of the most competitive races raised an average of $34 million.27 Unlike other incumbent advantages, financial aspects of congressional campaigns are easy to quantify, and a good deal has been written on this subject.28 Since the 1970s, the United States has had the most transparent campaign finance system in the world.29 This provides a detailed understanding of the financial advantage incumbents have over their challengers.

Most incumbents start their campaigns with money left over from the previous campaign. This is referred to as their “war chest.” In 2002, the average returning House member had three hundred thousand dollars left in their campaign coffers after the election.30 But even with this advantage, incumbents continue to raise enormous sums of money. They do this because reelection is never a certainty,31 and raising large amounts of cash can scare off challengers.

Beyond having a head start in the money race, incumbents can raise money more easily than most challengers. This is especially true when soliciting funds from Washington-based PACs (see chapter 4), who are six times more likely to give to an incumbent.32 One reason for this is that PACs know that incumbents are more likely to win, and they want to ensure future congressional access by backing the winning candidate. Incumbents also have financial backing from congressional party campaign committees (one for each party, in each chamber of Congress), as well as access to money from state party organizations. In addition, individual donors who give large sums of money are more likely to give to incumbents. The point is that most campaign dollars go to incumbents, making it difficult for challengers to raise the necessary resources to be competitive.

During the past two decades, the financial advantages of incumbency have grown tremendously. In 1990, for example, House incumbents had a four-to-one financial advantage over challengers, while in the Senate the ratio was two-to-one. By 2004, that ratio had grown to almost six-to-one in the House and almost nine-to-one in the Senate (see table 11.6 for 2008 figures).

#### Lack of Quality Challengers

Another reason why incumbents enjoy high reelection rates is the lack of quality challengers. A quality challenger is an individual who can mount a viable campaign and possesses a combination of characteristics that can convince voters that he or she is qualified to be their representative. These qualities include, but are not limited to, having previously held public office (either elective or otherwise), being a celebrity (show business, sports, etc.), or being a prominent local business, religious, or community leader. At minimum, a quality challenger usually enjoys some name recognition in the community (or district/state) and has enough ties to support fundraising efforts to raise the money necessary to challenge a congressional incumbent.33 A quality challenger usually possesses some political experience as well.

Most challengers in congressional elections are amateurs, or lesser-quality candidates. They lack some, or all, of the various characteristics, background, and experience mentioned above. Importantly, experienced politicians or prominent leaders—potential quality challengers—have enough political savvy to know that the chances of beating an incumbent member of Congress are slim. Generally, open-seat races are more likely to attract quality candidates, leaving most incumbents to face off against relative amateurs. Fundraising efforts by incumbents further deter quality candidates. Raising early money, as well as being active in the district, goes a long way toward deterring potential challengers. This is the so-called “scare-off” effect,34 and while it is clear that anything can happen in a campaign, most challengers pose little threat to incumbents.35

#### Congressional Redistricting

House district boundaries in almost every state are redrawn every ten years following the census. This ensures that districts within each state contain approximately equal numbers of people. Few voters know about or pay much attention to this process.36 Redistricting is a very contentious exercise because it almost always gives an advantage to a certain party or group.

To illustrate how districting could advantage one group over others, imagine a state with twelve equal geographic divisions (for example, counties), with each division containing equal numbers of straight partisan voters. In other words, all voters in each geographic division vote the party line in every election. From this state, four congressional districts, each containing roughly equal numbers of voters and three of these geographic divisions, is drawn. Box 11.1 shows this, as well as which geographic divisions belong to which party (D Democrat, R Republican) in the left-most column, under “Partisan Distribution.” In “Districting Plan 1,” Democrats and Republicans will each win in two districts. However, if district lines are drawn slightly differently, as seen in “Districting Plan 2,” Democrats win in only one district, while Republicans win in three.37

Drawing district lines to maximize the electoral advantage of a group, party, or faction is known as “gerrymandering.” The term, first used in 1812, characterized the salamander-like redistricting plan drawn up by Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry. Partisan gerrymandering, or redistricting that favors a specific party, enjoys a long history in the United States. While not an exact science, since the 1990s gerrymandering has evolved into a practice of incumbent-based, or “sweetheart,” gerry-mandering. This is a true bipartisan effort where district lines are drawn to ensure that there is a high concentration of each party’s supporters in “their” respective districts.38 Thus, the status quo (incumbents of each party) is protected. While some recent research suggests that the effect is minimal, many suggest that incumbent-based districts lead to a decline in the number of competitive elections, at least in the House, as more districts are “packed” on a partisan basis.39

#### Voting Behavior

To round out our discussion, we should also note something about voting behavior, or how people vote. A few aspects of voting in congressional elections are important with respect to incumbent advantages. First, the electorate usually knows the incumbent better than the challenger. Second, with more campaign funding, incumbents can advertise more, beyond the free advertising they receive from franking, local media, and so on.

In House elections from 1980 to 2002, on average, respondents were almost twice as likely to recognize the incumbent’s name as opposed to the challenger’s name (92 to 53 percent) and more than twice as likely to be able to recall—unprompted—the incumbent’s rather than the challenger’s name (46 to 17 percent). For Senate candidates, the percentages are more even, but incumbent names are recognized and recalled more than those of their challengers (97 to 77 percent recognition, 58 to 35 percent recall). While people do not always cast their votes for the better-known candidate, the converse of this is probably a fair assumption: people are less likely to vote for an unknown candidate.40 This is especially true in midterm elections where interest is lower than in presidential election years. For example, turnout in midterm elections of the voting age population has decreased from approximately 47 to 37 percent from 1962 to 2006.41 Generally, lower turnout benefits incumbents.

Another factor favoring incumbents is the party loyalty of voters. Ticket splitting, or casting one’s vote for the presidential candidate of one party while voting for the congressional candidate of the other party, increased consistently throughout the middle part of the past century. This trend seems to have reversed itself. In 1972, 192 districts split their votes in this way. In 2000, only 86 did so. In 2004, the number fell to 59, the lowest number since World War II (it rose again to 83 in 2008).42 In short, voters, who are packed into increasingly partisan-leaning districts are voting to support their party. But since recent redistricting efforts have generally protected incumbents, “their party” is more likely to be the party of the incumbent.

Finally, it should be noted that members of Congress pay special attention throughout their careers, and especially during the campaign, to the way in which they present themselves. Here, the landmark study of Richard Fenno is informative.43 Fenno followed and observed a number of House members, concluding that they self-consciously adopted a style or persona that was compatible with the culture of their district. He labeled this their “home style.” For example, a House member from rural Georgia would be hard pressed to win an election if he traveled the district in a three-piece Brooks Brothers suit. In a district like this, a candidate would likely present himself as a common member of the local community, hoping to establish a connection with the majority of voters. This example is a bit exaggerated, but according to Fenno’s work, not by much. And it seems to pay off.

To conclude this section, we will simply restate what has become clear: incumbents have any variety of advantages in their bid to be returned to Washington. The next section briefly reviews some of the situations that might contribute to an incumbent defeat andofferssomeconcluding thoughts.

### CONCLUSION: CAN INCUMBENTS LOSE?

Challengers clearly face uphill battles. However, there are some factors that make it more likely that a challenger can be competitive. First, the scare-off effect does not always work.44 Incumbents sometimes show signs of weakness or are weakened by circumstance. This can be the result of any number of factors including unfavorable redistricting, a small war chest, press criticism, or scandal. All of these can make incumbents look vulnerable, attracting quality challengers to the fray. Or, more simply, any of these factors can actually make an incumbent more vulnerable, giving challengers a better chance to win.

Second, presidential politics sometimes affect congressional elections. The two most obvious ways in which this occurs are either the “coat-tail” effects of a popular presidential candidate or the historic tendency for a president’s party to lose seats in midterm elections. In the first case, an extremely popular presidential candidate can increase the popularity—and thus the chances for victory—of the congressional candidates in his party. This happened, for example, in 1980, when Ronald Reagan’s popularity helped the Republicans win control of the Senate for the first time since 1954. Many Democratic candidates were helped by Obama’s popularity in 2008.

Alternatively, it is also historically the case that the president’s party loses seats in the midterm elections (see table 11.7). Some midterm elections bring greater losses than others, but in most, a fairly significant number of the president’s party loses. Some of these losses are inevitably suffered by incumbents. In 2006, Republicans lost their majorities in both the U.S. House and Senate, in part because of their association with President George W. Bush whose popularity gradually and steadily dropped following his reelection in 2004.

The final factor is the occasional effect of what scholars refer to as “national tides” on congressional elections. Local elections generally favor incumbents. Congressional elections are primarily local affairs, more so in the House than in the Senate. However, sometimes congressional elections are influenced by national political factors, favoring one party over the other. This was the case, for example, in 1974, when an anti-Watergate sentiment swept the country, and the Democrats made large gains. In 1980, anti-Carter sentiment and a national recession helped produce a significant number of victories for Republicans. Anti-incumbent and anti-congressional feelings in 1992 (surrounding various congressional scandals and the Clarence Thomas hearings) helped 110 newcomers win election to Congress. Republicans won both houses of Congress for the first time in more than four decades in 1994, partly as the result of an anti-Congress and anti-Clinton mood prevailing in the country. In 1998, anti-impeachment sentiment helped the Democrats reverse historical trends and gain seats, and in 2002, national security concerns helped Republicans do the same. In all of these cases, a prevailing mood in the country overcame local concerns to help oust a significant number of incumbents.

![[chpt_fig_041.png]]

In short, incumbents rarely lose, although challengers can sometimes capitalize on national conditions that might be in their favor (as in 1994 and 2006). The word “campaign” was originally used to refer to military operations and adopted for political use later. To use this metaphor, challengers face an overwhelming disadvantage given that their opponents have been gearing up for months, are already on the field, and have an arsenal in place.

Certainly, we are not the first observers to note that congressional elections have become less competitive over the course of the last century.45 However, many Americans do not realize or appreciate how uncompetitive congressional elections have become. While the high rate of incumbent victories might, to some degree, equate to voter satisfaction, it more likely reflects the numerous advantages that incumbents have. This has undoubtedly increased the number of noncompetitive congressional contests, which, as noted earlier, has democratic consequences.

## “Kingmaker” and  
Battleground States and  
the Myth of National  
Presidential Elections

The idea that presidential candidates wage a national campaign to win the presidency is likely shared by most citizens. In many respects the race for the White House is a national campaign. Presidential candidates and their parties fund, build, and mobilize campaign organizations in literally hundreds of locations throughout the country. Candidates and their surrogates (wives, children, parents, and more) take the campaign message to countless towns, villages, and hamlets. They, their parties, and other groups craft messages designed to persuade voters and air these messages on national media. National news organizations spend enormous amounts of money gathering news about the campaign and reporting it to a national audience. Indeed, presidential campaigns seem to be as national an event as the celebration of Independence Day.

In other respects, however, presidential campaigns fall short of being truly national contests. As we will illustrate in this chapter, presidential campaigns in both the primary and general election season focus their efforts on a handful of states and relatively few voters. The chapter is divided into two main sections. The first deals with presidential nominations. After a brief history of presidential nomination systems our focus will turn to the primary system of presidential nominations. Although far more participatory than previous nomination systems, relatively few citizens vote in primaries or participate in caucuses. We then turn to a discussion of the general election season, which is geared to and reaches only a limited audience. The Electoral College system all but forces presidential campaigns to spend disproportionately greater resources on a minority of voters in only a few battleground states.

### THE NOMINATION: A BRIEF HISTORY OF  
PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARIES AND CAUCUSES

There have been three systems for selecting presidential nominees throughout our history, each more democratic or inclusive than the previous. The first, the legislative caucus, functioned by having legislators from each party select their presidential candidate. The second, the convention system, allowed party leaders and party regulars to select the nominee. The third and current method, the primary system, permits voters to select their party’s presidential nominee.1

During the colonial period and immediately following ratification of the Constitution, state legislators selected their party’s candidates for local and state offices. Shortly after the ratification of the Constitution, many state legislative caucuses began selecting party candidates for national offices as well. Although they were not identifiable as parties, two informal national caucuses emerged in Congress in 1796. The first, a pro-administration faction, supported the presidential candidacy of John Adams, while the second, an anti-administration faction, backed Thomas Jefferson. In 1800, the same informal caucuses supported each of these candidates again. Following the ratification of the Twelfth Amendment in 1804, congressional caucuses began to nominate tickets comprising both a presidential and a vice-presidential candidate. This system, known as “King Caucus,” was used to nominate presidential candidates until 1824.

In 1824, the splintering of the dominant Democratic-Republican Party led to a contested nomination between William Crawford, Andrew Jackson, John Quincy Adams, and Henry Clay. This was the beginning of the end of King Caucus. By 1828 there was no discernable nomination system in place. This, as well as growing pressure for increased popular participation in the nomination process, led to the first national party nominating convention. In 1831, leaders of the Anti-Masonic Party met in convention in Baltimore to choose their presidential candidate. The two major parties (the Democrats and the Whigs) adopted the practice shortly thereafter, and the convention system of presidential nominations was born.

One objective of the convention system was to widen the circle of participation in the nomination process. Under this system, state party leaders, party activists, and party regulars gathered in the summer of the presidential election year in a national meeting lasting several days. The main function of the meeting was to select the party’s presidential candidate. Parties used this system well into the twentieth century. But, since relatively few party leaders seemed to control conventions, the system had its detractors.

One alternative that promised greater participation was the state nominating caucus. Started in 1846 in Iowa, a presidential nominating caucus is actually a series of caucuses held to select delegates to the national convention. The first round is held at the local level at schools, public buildings, and in some cases, private homes. Winners of this first round participate in the next round, which in Iowa is at the county level, and those winners go on to the next round at the congressional district level. The final caucus is a state-level caucus. Because the evolution of state-level presidential nominating caucuses is less important to our story of nominating systems than primaries, our focus will be on primaries.

Another alternative that emerged was the party primary, where voters directly or indirectly select their party’s candidates. The first primary was held in 1842 by the Democratic Party of Crawford County, Pennsylvania, as a way of mollifying party members who wanted more say within the party. The “Crawford County System,” as it became known, spread to other states, including California, Virginia, Ohio, and New York, but were not as yet used to select presidential candidates.

By the start of the twentieth century parties in several states held presidential primaries. Some were non-binding presidential preference votes, while in others, convention delegates who pledged to vote for a particular presidential candidate were selected. In 1912, five more states held primaries as the result of the Republican Party nomination battle between former president Theodore Roosevelt and then-president William Howard Taft. By 1916 the number of states holding primaries peaked at twenty. For the next sixty years candidates selectively used primaries to demonstrate their popularity and electability to their party. For example, in 1944, dark-horse Republican candidate Wendell Willkie used this strategy to help secure the nomination, as did Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 and John F. Kennedy in 1960. Kennedy’s decision to enter the primary in heavily Protestant West Virginia was a strategic move designed to demonstrate that he, a Catholic, could win in a Protestant state.2 Even though party leaders were leaning toward Lyndon Johnson, Kennedy’s strong showing helped him secure the nomination.

The pivotal year in the move from the convention to the primary system was 1968. By the time the Democratic convention convened in Chicago the country had experienced growing protest against the Vietnam War and the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Senator Robert Kennedy of New York. Both Kennedy and Senator Eugene McCarthy from Minnesota had entered and won several primaries that spring. Vice President Hubert Humphrey, on the other hand, had not entered a single primary, but was the favorite of party leaders, and subsequently secured the nomination. Protest erupted in the convention hall and in the streets, and Chicago police responded with violence in their attempt to control the situation. The convention, in short, went poorly.

In order to unite the party for the general election party leaders agreed to reform their nominating procedures. To this end, the McGovern-Fraser commission recommended increasing the number of primaries. This led to six more states adopting primaries for the 1972 election season, bringing the total number of states holding primaries that year to twenty-one (including most of the more populous states). This made 1972 the first year that the majority of convention delegates (roughly two-thirds) pledged to support a particular candidate were selected by primaries. This effectively took the power to nominate presidential and other candidates out of the hands of party leaders and gave it to the party electorate.

Because the objective of a party primary is to win the pledged support of delegates attending the national convention, it is now impossible to capture the presidential nomination without competing in and winning presidential primaries and caucuses in many states. Almost all of the delegates to the national conventions in both parties are selected in primaries and caucuses.

The exact number of primaries and caucuses vary from one election year to the next. This is because states are responsible for conducting elections, and the national party organizations give state parties some latitude with respect to how they select their delegations to the national convention. In 2008 there were thirty-seven primaries and fourteen caucuses.3 From these events, the Republican Party selected approximately 2,380 delegates. Of the 4,257 delegates to the Democratic convention, about 80 percent (3,434) were selected in primaries or caucuses.4 The remaining 823 delegates were the so-called superdelegates, typically elected officials or other party leaders who come to the convention officially uncommitted to any particular candidate.5

There are three types of primaries and caucuses, distinguished according to which voters are allowed to participate.6 In a closed primary or caucus, only those registered with the party may vote. For example, only registered Republicans are allowed to vote in a closed Republican primary. An open primary or caucus is open to any registered voter, and that voter may vote for either party’s (but only one party’s) candidates. Semi-closed primaries allow party members and independents to participate in the party primaries. Under these rules, only registered Republicans and independents may vote in a Republican primary, while only registered Democrats and independents may vote in a Democratic primary.7

### PRIMARIES AND REPRESENTATION

While more citizens are now involved in the nomination process under the primary system than in King Caucus or the convention system, relatively few actually participate in any meaningful way. There are three main aspects of the system that make it less than fully representative: the disproportionate influence of the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary on the outcome of the race, the primary-caucus calendar, and the small number of citizens who actually vote in the process.

#### The Effect of the Iowa Caucuses and the New  
Hampshire Primary

Since 1972 the Iowa caucuses have been the first delegate selection event of the year. New Hampshire held its first primary in 1916 and has been the first primary of the nomination season since 1920. Democratic Party rules guarantee these prime positions on the nominating calendar for both states, and the Republican Party follows suit. Together, the delegate selection events of these two states are the first tests for those aspiring to the presidency, and doing well in at least one of these states is critical. Therefore, candidates pay an extraordinary amount of attention to each.

In 1987 the major-party candidates spent an average of fifty days in Iowa and thirty-seven days in New Hampshire.8 From mid-March 1999 through July of 1999, fourteen presidential aspirants (from both parties) devoted approximately 35 percent of their campaign time to these two states.9 From 2001 to 2002, 10 Democratic candidates spent a combined total of sixty-five days campaigning in New Hampshire and 300 days in 2003.10 John Kerry spent seventy-three days campaigning in Iowa from January 2003 to January 19, 2004. Howard Dean spent approximately three million dollars in television advertising in Iowa in 2003 and early 2004.

National news organizations also pay an inordinate amount of attention to these two events. One analysis of the 1980 campaign by United Press International and CBS News suggested that 14 percent of the coverage of the nomination season was devoted to the Iowa caucuses. The New York Times ran approximately 120 stories in 1987 and 1988 about the Iowa caucuses. An analysis of the coverage by ABC, CBS, NBC, and CNN from January 1995 through June 1996 found that the 1996 Republican New Hampshire primary received one-fourth of the total coverage during the primary season.11

The results of the Iowa and New Hampshire contests tend to affect subsequent contests, and thus the nomination itself. From 1972 to 2008, the winner of the sixteen contested nominations won in New Hampshire ten times and placed second six times. During that same time period, eleven of the sixteen nominees finished first or second in Iowa.12 George McGovern (1972), Michael Dukakis (1988), George H. W. Bush (1988), and Bill Clinton (1992) placed third, and, John McCain won his party’s nomination after finishing fourth in Iowa in 2008.

Doing poorly in either or both of these contests can effectively end a campaign. No candidate placing third or lower in New Hampshire since 1972 ever went on to win the nomination. In 2004, Dick Gephardt withdrew immediately after the Iowa caucuses, after finishing fourth with 11.2 percent of the vote. Joseph Lieberman, who did not enter the Iowa caucuses, finished fourth in New Hampshire with 8.6 percent of the vote, and did not win a single one of the five primaries held one week later. He withdrew immediately afterward. Rudy Giuliani’s biggest mistake in 2008 was deciding not to seriously compete in either Iowa or New Hampshire’s events. In fact, given the history of presidential nominations since 1976, this strategy was incomprehensible.

Given their relative weight in the overall electoral process, it is arguably undemocratic that these states have such power over the nomination. Iowa and New Hampshire combined have a total of eleven electoral votes (Iowa, seven; New Hampshire, four). New Hampshire primary voters are responsible for choosing less than 1 percent of delegates to the Democratic Party convention. The relative number of votes that determine the winners in these events is even smaller. In 1976, Democratic nominee Jimmy Carter won thirty-five thousand votes in Iowa and New Hampshire, which as one account explains is “fewer than it takes to be elected city councilman in Cincinnati.”13 Carter’s margin of victory in New Hampshire over second-place finisher Morris Udall was a mere 4,663 votes. That same year, Gerald Ford, the Republican nominee, received only 1,587 more votes than Ronald Reagan. In 2000, Al Gore defeated Bill Bradley in the New Hampshire primary by 6,395 votes.14

#### The Primary-Caucus Calendar

Although New Hampshire and Iowa may have a disproportionate influence on the nomination, geographic inequities among the nominating electorate do not end there. Many primaries and caucuses are actually held after the nomination has effectively been decided. One analyst divided states according to their role in the nominating process. “King-makers,” the states holding the earliest primaries and caucuses, have the most influence. “Confirmers” come next, both chronologically and in terms of influence. In these states, leaders solidify their positions. The final category, “rubber stamps,” speaks for itself. These states are the last to hold primaries and caucuses, held after the nomination has in effect been decided.

Twenty-six states were classified as “rubber stamps” in 2000, with delegate selection events held after March 7. This number declined to eighteen in 2004, but there were an additional twelve “confirmers” that held their events on the same day (March 2). In recent election cycles voters in as many as half of the states have no say whatever in the presidential nomination process. “Rubber stamp” state voters might participate in their state’s nominating event, but they have no say in who their party’s nominee will be.

A second less-than-democratic aspect of the nomination calendar is the increased tendency of states to “frontload,” or schedule nominating events earlier in the primary season. In 1968, New Hampshire was the only state that held its primary before the end of March, but in 1988, twenty states did so. In 2008, thirty-six held nominating events (twenty-four primaries and twelve caucuses) prior to the end of February. Twenty-four of these states held their nominating event on February 5, dubbed “Super Tuesday.”

This has tended to make the nominating season shorter. For example, Robert Dole had the Republican nomination secured by March 13 of 1996. Al Gore and George W. Bush effectively secured their nominations in the third week of March by winning greater than 50 percent of the pledged delegates in 2000. In 2004, John Kerry had the Democratic nomination cinched by March 3, and John McCain had all but won the Republican nomination in 2008 by February 5.

This dynamic exacerbates the winnowing effect of Iowa and New Hampshire and results in early withdrawals by many candidates. In 1988, only Pat Robertson remained to challenge George H. W. Bush for the Republican nomination after the end of March. In 1992 three of the five Democratic contenders had withdrawn by the end of the third week of March. In 2000, John McCain and Bill Bradley, the only serious challengers remaining for their respective party’s nomination, withdrew on March 9. In 2004 it was essentially a two-man race between John Kerry and John Edwards for the Democratic nomination by February. The 2008 nomination season saw a similar dynamic. By the end of January all but two Democrats (Clinton and Obama) remained in the race, from an original field of seven. From a field of six Republican candidates, only McCain and Mike Huckabee remained after Mitt Romney withdrew on February 7; Huckabee ended his campaign on March 4.

The point here is simple. Whether we focus on the fact that only some states have a meaningful say in the nomination, or that the compressed schedule forces early withdrawals, it is fair to say that the nomination schedule results in a less than meaningful choice.

#### The Nominating Electorate

Our final point about the representativeness of the nomination process focuses on citizens. With the exception of New Hampshire, voter turnout in the primary season is low, even in states where participation has an effect on the outcome. Because these events are held in the late winter/ early spring, relatively few people have given much thought to the presidential race. In addition, voting in a primary is more challenging than in the general election, since the general election presents a choice between two candidates from different parties. The choice in a primary is between candidates of the same party. In order to choose, voters have to take time to learn something about each one.15 Participation in caucuses is even lower because caucus participation can take several hours, and prior to the caucus, individuals typically spend time acquainting themselves with candidates and issues.

Voter turnout in primaries actually hovers at about 15 percent of eligible voters. While this seems low, not all of these 15 percent actually influence the outcome. For example, barely four million voters who participated in the Democratic and Republican presidential primaries in 2000 were “kingmakers.” Almost fourteen million were “confirmers,” and nearly fourteen million more voters were “rubber stamps.” Put another way, 12.9 percent of those who cast primary ballots in 2000 had a major role in affecting the Democratic and Republican contests; 43.6 percent had bit parts; and 43.5 percent had no part at all. They were little more than spectators.16

Only one in three general-election voters in 2000 voted in a primary or participated in a caucus, and only one in six did so in the first six weeks, when their vote actually mattered. Only one in twenty-five could be considered “kingmakers,” and one in two hundred participated in the influential Iowa or New Hampshire delegate selection events.17 In other words, very few voters, from very few states, have much of a say about who the presidential nominees will be.

In addition, citizens who vote in primaries and participate in caucuses are less representative of the general public. They are generally better educated, come from higher income brackets, are more politically knowledgeable and interested, and are slightly older than the broader electorate. Furthermore, these voters are more ideologically extreme than the average voter. Democratic primary voters tend to be more liberal than the average Democratic voter in the general election. Republican primary voters tend to be more conservative than the typical Republican voter.18

To summarize this section about the modern presidential nominating system, we face a conundrum. Desire for greater public participation in presidential nominations created the primary-caucus system. Even if “only” thirty million people vote in primaries or participate in caucuses, this is many more than the several thousand that previously decided presidential nominations at the national party conventions. The process is clearly more open than it was previously.

However, full and equitable participation has not been attained. The influence of two states (Iowa and New Hampshire) on the outcomes is highly disproportionate to their population. After the delegate selection events in these two states, the nomination contest is effectively fixed so that a number of candidates cannot meaningfully compete. The compressed nominating season exacerbates this winnowing effect and dramatically reduces the number of states that actually have a voice in the process. Finally, of the citizens who do vote, few are actually participating in the decision of who will become the nominee, and even these are hardly representative of the electorate as a whole.

Of course this discussion about low voter turnout in presidential primaries ignores what happened in 2008. In most states that held primaries, voters, especially Democratic voters, showed up in record numbers to cast their ballots. Voter turnout nationally fell just short of breaking the record set in 1972, the first year that primaries decided the party nominations. This said, more than sixty million people voted in nominating contests in 2008, or almost 46 percent of the better than 131 million who voted in November.19 By May 19, turnout records had been set in a total of twenty-three of the states that held primaries for both parties. In all but one state that held a primary, voter turnout exceeded numbers recorded in 2004. Turnout was also higher in states that held caucuses, especially Democratic caucuses.20

But in spite of the fact that it may sound pessimistic, there is ample reason to believe that 2008 was an anomaly in terms of voter turnout in presidential primaries and caucuses. High turnout in 2008 can largely be explained by the fact that Democrats were much more likely to participate in primaries and caucuses than their Republican counterparts. Average turnout in Democratic primaries was almost double that in Republican primaries (20.7 as opposed to 10.4 percent).21 We can point to three reasons for this.

First, there was widespread dissatisfaction, especially among Democrats, with President Bush. Democrats, in general, were mobilized by the idea that Bush’s term would soon be ending, and as importantly, that their party might be able to re-capture the White House. Second, many of these same Democrats were attracted to, and energized by, Barack Obama. This was especially true with younger voters. 22 The freshman senator from Illinois was exceptionally charismatic, delivered stirring speeches, and hammered home a message of change that resonated powerfully with Democratic voters. Finally, the Democratic nomination was not decided until Hillary Clinton withdrew on June 7, 2008, after the final primaries had been held. It was, in spite of the rhetoric and hyperbole that surrounded the nomination struggle, a competition until the end. This also makes the 2008 Democratic nomination an exception to the discussion above about short nomination races. Political science has long recognized that competitive races tend to see higher levels of voter turnout.23

The point is that it may be some time before factors converge again to produce such high participation in nominating contests.24 Few presidents leave office as unpopular as Bush did; a politician like Obama might come along once in a generation; and few nominating contests are as close as the Democratic contest of 2008.

In the next section we take up the matter of the general election campaign. The focus here is on campaign strategy and organization. In particular, we examine how the logic of the Electoral College again skews the campaign toward a few voters in a few states.

### ELECTORAL COLLEGE STRATEGY

“A presidential campaign, like a military campaign, relies on sound strategy.”25 One of the main elements of a sound campaign strategy is where to campaign. To what regions of the country should the campaign travel? What groups should the campaign attempt to persuade? At first the answer might appear to be straightforward: everywhere and everyone. Given limited resources, however, this would be foolish.

Campaigns group voters into three general categories. There is one group that will never vote for a particular candidate under any circumstances. These voters are typically hard-core or solid opposition partisans, people who strongly identify with the other party. Then there are those upon whose vote a candidate can likely depend on. These are the people who strongly identify with the candidate’s party. These “base” voters are unlikely to vote for the candidate of the other party. The third group, known variously as “swing” or moderate voters (see chapter 3), is the group that campaigns try to persuade. How do these voting categories affect a campaign’s strategy? Part of the answer relies on an understanding of how the Electoral College works.

Under the Electoral College system, each state has the same number of electors (votes) as it has members of Congress. For example, in 2008 North Carolina had thirteen members in the House of Representatives and two senators, giving North Carolina fifteen Electoral College votes. The District of Columbia is awarded three electors, two for the senators and one for the member of the House that they would have if they had representation in Congress. Forty-eight states (and D.C.) award all of their Electoral College votes to the candidate who wins (according to plurality winner rules) the popular vote in the state.26 The candidate who wins the majority (not the plurality) of Electoral College votes wins the presidency. There are a total of 538 Electoral College votes, so a candidate must receive 270 Electoral College votes to win.

In terms of campaign strategy, it is not necessary to win the popular vote in every state or the popular vote in the country in order to win the election. In fact, a candidate can win the presidency by barely winning in eleven states, provided these are the states that have the largest number of Electoral College votes. This means that a candidate can lose, and lose by a wide margin, in the other thirty-nine states (and D.C.).

Table 12.1 is a hypothetical outcome of what this scenario might look like, using the actual number of votes cast in each state in 2008. Here the Democratic candidate received a bare majority (50.01 to 49.99 percent) of popular votes in the “Big Eleven,” or the states with the most Electoral College votes. This gave the Democratic candidate all of the Electoral College votes in each of those states, while the Republican candidate received none. The Republican candidate got a larger margin of victory (55 to 45 percent) in the “Other Forty” Electoral College units, giving the Republican candidate every Electoral College vote in each of these forty. The net result, seen in the last row, is that the Democratic candidate wins the presidency with 271 Electoral College votes, with a margin of victory of only 1/10 of 1 percent in each of only eleven states. However, the Democratic candidate loses the nationwide popular vote (47.8 to 52.2 percent).

Of course, it is not likely that the eleven states that are richest in Electoral College votes would select the same candidate. The point is that a reasonable move by a campaign might be to target some states for more attention and others for less, based on (1) how competitive they might be and (2) how many Electoral College votes are at stake. The history of how different states have voted in the past suggests that putting too much emphasis on certain states is a potential waste of resources. Each party can typically count on certain states for electoral support. Table 12.2 is a very rough measure of this. It shows how many times each party has won in each state in the past five elections, and, in parentheses, the number of consecutive wins the party has had, starting with 2008 and moving backward in time.

![[chpt_fig_042.png]]

Based on the electoral history of each state, state polling data, conditions within the state, and other factors, campaign strategists make a determination of how likely it is that a particular state will vote for the candidate. These states are classified as “safe.” Table 12.3 (p. 192) is another simple measure of safe states for each party. It is derived by averaging the margin of victory for the winner for the previous three presidential elections. If the margin of victory is greater than 10 percent, we classified the state as safe for that party.

Using this measure, the Democrats have a slight advantage in Electoral College votes from safe states. In part this is because two states (California and New York) give the Democrats almost 32 percent of the 270 votes needed to win.

Beyond understanding where the base (of safe states) is located, there are a few general rules that guide an Electoral College strategy. First, small states, especially those in which the candidate has virtually no chance of winning, can be all but ignored. It makes little sense for a Democratic candidate to spend much time campaigning in Alaska, given (1) that the state has gone Republican in the past seven elections, and (2) there are only three Electoral College votes at stake. Similarly, a Republican candidate could safely leave Delaware and Rhode Island out of their campaign strategy.

A second rule is that large states (California, Texas, New York, Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio) almost always get at least some attention from both party’s candidates. For example, in 1976, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford targeted seven of the same eight states. Despite the fact that Bob Dole knew that he had no chance of winning in California in 1996, he spent a good deal of time (and approximately four million dollars) during the last three weeks of his campaign in the state.27 Presidential candidates cannot afford to ignore large states completely. This is because of the large number of Electoral College votes in these states and because there is a desire to ensure the party stays competitive in these states in the future. However, it is generally pointless to spend much time in states where the candidate has little chance of winning.

![[chpt_fig_043.png]]

![[chpt_fig_044.png]]

Although some time must be spent bolstering support in areas where the candidate is likely to do well, the central element of presidential campaign strategy consists of identifying states where the candidate has some chance of victory and focusing efforts there. In 1964, Barry Goldwater devoted most of his resources to campaign in the Midwest and West, while all but ignoring the Northeast. Richard Nixon, in 1968, focused on New Jersey, Wisconsin, and Missouri where he thought he had a chance of defeating Hubert Humphrey, as well as in five border-South states to compete with George Wallace for the southern vote.

The decision on where to focus the campaign is fairly nuanced. Jimmy Carter’s campaign manager, Hamilton Jordan, developed a complex formula that factored in state size, previous and existing Democratic support (based on control of elective offices), and state turnout. After identifying important states, each day of the campaign was scheduled according to state scores and the predetermined value of a Carter, Mondale, or a family member visit.28 For example, “Carter’s scheduler Eliot Cutler, convinced that Ohio was the key to the race, scheduled 65% of vice-presidential candidate Walter Mondale’s time there in the last two weeks of the campaign (Carter won Ohio by 8,000 votes).”29 In 1996, Clinton pollster Mark Penn devised a seven-variable model that he used to allocate television advertising dollars, including electoral history, advertising costs, number of persuadable voters, and impact of prospective ads on House and Senate races.30

Political scientist Daron Shaw examined the electoral strategies of Democratic and Republican presidential candidates from 1988 to 2004, tracking the states that campaign managers considered to be important to their effort. States are divided into five categories: base Republican or Democrat, “lean” Republican or Democrat, or battleground. Base states, which correspond to safe states discussed above, require little attention from either party candidate’s campaign. Each campaign focuses most of its efforts on the battleground states and those that lean toward one party or the other. Table 12.4 lists these states. What stands out in this table is that although the relative number of battleground and marginal states varies from one campaign to the next, there are only about fifteen states identified in each campaign year as being relatively competitive, and therefore important to the campaign.

How does this focus translate into campaign effort? Using various data, Shaw shows that from September 1 through Election Day during the campaigns of 1988 through 1996, the average amount of spending for campaign advertising in battleground states for three election cycles was more than quadruple that for each party’s respective base states. Spending in leaning Democratic or Republican states was almost double that for spending in base states. Additionally, both Democratic and Republican candidates made more appearances in battleground or leaning states than in their base states. While the data show variation between election cycles and parties, a pattern of resources allocation favoring battleground or marginal states is clear.

A similar pattern emerges in 2000 and 2004. Table 12.5 (p. 195) shows data for spending for campaign ads and candidate appearances by presidential and vice presidential candidates during the fall campaigns of 2000 and 2004. In 2000, total spending on television ads was three to five times greater in battleground and marginal states than in the other thirty-six states combined. Presidential and vice presidential candidates visited battleground and marginal states two to three times more often than the other thirty-six. No money whatever was spent by the campaign for television advertising in a total of twenty-six states; thirty-two states received no visits from the Republican candidates; and twenty-three states did not see either Democratic candidate during the campaign.

Differences were more pronounced in 2004. Here, spending on television ads in battleground and marginal states exceeded that in the other thirty-six states by more than a factor of twenty. In fact, three states alone (Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania) accounted for approximately half of the spending on television ads in each party. Candidates visited the fifteen battleground and marginal states three to five times more than the other thirty-six states combined. In 2004 there was no campaign spending for television ads in more than half the states (twenty-six Republican, twenty-seven Democrat). Republican candidates ignored thirty-four states and Democratic candidates twenty-four in terms of campaign stops.

![[chpt_fig_045.png]]

While there is a fair amount of variation between battleground and marginal states, the pattern is clear. The fall campaign is not a true national campaign but rather an effort disproportionately targeted to a few voters in a relatively small number of states. Other studies confirm this as well.31

![[chpt_fig_046.png]]

### CONCLUSION

To be clear, there are some truly national aspects of presidential campaigns worth acknowledging. First, news about the primary campaign is certainly national in its scope and reach. Second, reporting the results of national polls about presidential preferences likely has some impact on voters in the early primary states. Third, during the fall campaign, all Americans are aware of, and can access information about, what the presidential candidates are saying. By this point in the campaign, news stories about the campaign are ubiquitous.

Our point, however, is that some are more equal than others with respect to the campaign. Attention and resources are maldistributed in the primary season and are heavily weighted toward the earliest delegate selection events. In the fall campaign, battleground states dominate. In short, while all citizens can participate, some have greater opportunities for meaningful participation.

## Notes

### PREFACE

1. There are, of course, a plethora of books that cover campaigns and elections in the United States. Focusing only on presidential elections, there is a fairly long tradition of journalistic accounts of specific elections that date back to Theodore White’s The Making of the President, 1960 (Cutchogue, N.Y.: Buccaneer Books, 1961). This tradition relies on the journalist (or a team of journalists) who are on the inside of the campaign traveling with the candidate. White’s books present a detailed chronology of the campaign, relating many interesting anecdotes about the candidate, his family, entourage, etc. While others have made contributions using this approach (e.g., Timothy Crouse, The Boys on the Bus, Toronto, Canada: Random House, 1973), White was the pioneer, and continued the tradition for several election cycles.

More recently, various writers for Newsweek magazine have followed a similar approach (e.g., Jack W. Germond and Jules Witcover, Blue Smoke and Mirrors: How Reagan Won & Carter Lost the Election of 1980 [N.Y.: Penguin Group, 1981]; Thomas M. Defrank and others, Quest for the Presidency, 1992 [College Station, Tex.: Texas A&M University Press, 1994]; Evan Thomas, Eleanor Clift, and the Staff of Newsweek, Election 2004: How Bush Won And What You Can Expect In The Future [New York: Public Affairs, 2005]). All of these accounts are informative and interesting, but they contain a level of detail best suited for the most politically interested.

Another approach to the study of campaigns and elections is what some term the “practitioner approach.” This approach is similar to the journalistic tradition inasmuch as it relies on insider perspectives. The best example of this is the series sponsored by the John F. Kennedy School of Government Institute of Politics. The Kennedy School invites campaign managers to a symposium for what amounts to a de-briefing about the strategies and tactics they employed during the previous campaign. The first of these books, titled Campaign for President: The Managers Look at 1976 (Jonathan Moore and Janet Fraser, Cambridge, Mass.: Ballinger, 1977), was published in 1977 and has been produced every four years since. These books are also geared toward the politically interested and are also excellent insider accounts.

A final approach to the study of presidential campaigns and elections comes from the scholarly community. Many of these books are also produced immediately after a presidential election, and attempt to make some sense of what happened and why. Unlike the previous two traditions, the scholarly tradition is geared more toward scientific explanation rather than anecdotal and impressionistic conclusions. Most are, again, post-election quadrennial publications. James Ceaser and Andrew Busch have been authoring a post-election book since 1993 (Upside Down and Inside Out: The 1992 Elections and American Politics [Lanham, Md.: Rowman & Littlefield, 1993]). Many are edited volumes. Michael Nelson has been editing a post-election collection every four years since 1985 (the latest, The Elections of 2008 [Washington, D.C.: CQ Press, 2009]). Other edited volumes include Gerald Pomper’s collections (the last of which was The Election of 2000: Reports and Interpretations [New York: Seven Bridges, 2001]), relative newcomer Larry Sabato (The Year of Obama: How Barack Obama Won the White House [New York: Longman, 2009]), and William Crotty (Winning the Presidency 2008 [Boulder, Colo.: Paradigm, 2009]). Some texts focus on upcoming elections (e.g., Michael Goldstein, Guide to the 2004 Presidential Election [Washington, D.C.: CQ Press, 2003]).

Other books are non-election specific. The most notable of these are Polsby and Wildavsky’s Presidential Elections (Nelson Polsby and Aaron Wildavsky, Presidential Elections: Strategies and Structures of American Politics [Lanham, Md.: Rowman & Littlefield, 2007]), in its twelfth edition, and Stephen Wayne’s The Road to the White House (The Road to the White House 2008: The Politics of Presidential Elections, [Florence, Ky.: Wadsworth, 2007]), in its eighth edition. Yet other texts examine congressional elections, most notably, The Politics of Congressional Elections by Gary Jacobson (7th ed. [New York: Longman, 2008]) and Congressional Elections: Campaigning at Home and in Washington by Paul Herrnson (5th ed. [Washington, D.C.: CQ Press, 2007]).

All of the books in these traditions are similar in that they take a fairly comprehensive look at campaigns and elections. Other books examine more specific aspects of the electoral process. For example, William Mayer’s quadrennial edited book (The Making of the Presidential Candidates 2008 [Lanham, Md.: Rowman & Littlefield, 2007]) is an excellent text for understanding the presidential nomination process. Kathleen Hall Jamieson’s Packaging the Presidency (Packaging the Presidency: A History and Criticism of Presidential Campaign Advertising,3rd edition [New York: Oxford University, 1996]) is one of many that examine presidential campaign advertising. These, and many others not listed here, are excellent sources for further reading on the subject.

14. Anthony Downs, in An Economic Theory of Democracy (New York: Harper, 1957), suggested that citizens select candidates or parties based on proximity to their own preferences. V. O. Key, Jr., in The Responsible Electorate: Rationality in Presidential Voting 1936–1960 (Cambridge, Mass.: Belknap, 1966), argued that voters are more rational than The American Voter suggests. Samuel L. Popkin, in The Reasoning Voter: Communication and Persuasion in Presidential Campaigns (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991), updates Key’s theory with particular attention to the effects of the media. Morris P. Fiorina argued in Retrospective Voting in American National Elections (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1981) that citizens base their voting choices on the past performance of politicians and parties.

### CHAPTER 12

1. This section draws heavily on Jody Baumgartner, “Primary” and “Caucus,” in Encyclopedia of American Parties and Elections, ed. Larry J. Sabato and Howard R. Ernst (New York: Facts on File, 2006). See also Rhodes Cook, Race for the Presidency: Winning the 2004 Nomination (Washington, D.C.: CQ Press, 2004); William G. Mayer, ed., In Pursuit of the White House (Chatham, N.J.: Chatham House, 1996); William G. Mayer, ed., In Pursuit of the White House 2000: How We Choose Our Presidential Nominees (Chatham, N.J.: Chatham House, 2000); William G. Mayer, ed., The Making of the Presidential Candidates 2004 (Lanham, Md.: Rowman & Littlefield, 2004).

2. Kennedy was only the second Catholic to win his party’s nomination (Al Smith, a Democrat, was the first, in 1928). This is the result of a long history in the United States of anti-Catholicism and anti-Papism, specifically, a fear that a Catholic president would take direction from the pope.

3. These numbers do not include U.S. territories.

6. There is a fair amount of variation in how different analysts classify types of primaries; we rely on the typology offered by Cook, Race for the Presidency, vii–ix.

7. Beyond the question of who may participate, there are other differences in state primaries and caucuses as well. One is the formula used to allocate delegates to the winners. Republicans generally award all of a state’s delegates to the plurality winner, while Democrats use a proportional representation system (Democrats also mandate that a certain percentage of delegates be women and minorities).
