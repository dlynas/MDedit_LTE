DECODING SUBALTERN POLITICS

James C. Scott has researched and written on subaltern groups, and, in particular, peasants, rebellion, resistance, and agriculture, for over 35 years. Yet much of Scott’s most interesting work on the peasantry and the state, both conceptually and empirically, has never been published in book form. For the first time _Decoding Subaltern Politics: Ideology, disguise, and resistance in agrarian politics_ brings together some of his most important work in one volume.

The book covers three distinct yet interlinked bodies of work. The first lays out a framework for understanding peasant politics and rebellion, much of which is applicable to rural areas of the contemporary global south. Scott then goes on to develop his arguments regarding everyday forms of peasant resistance using the comparative example of the religious tithe in France and Malaysia, and tracing the forms of resistance that cover their own tracks and avoid direct clashes with authorities. For much of the world’s population, and for most of its history, this sort of politics was far more common than the violent clashes that dominate the history books, and in this book one can examine the anatomy of such resistance in rich comparative detail. Finally, Scott explores how the state’s increasing grip on its population, its identity, land-holding, income, and movements, is a precondition for political hegemony. Crucially, in examining the invention of state-mandated legal identities, especially the permanent patronym and the vagaries of its imposition on vernacular life, Scott lays bare the micro-processes of state-formation and resistance.

Written by one of the leading social theorists of our age, _Decoding Subaltern Politics: Ideology, disguise, and resistance in agrarian politics_ is an indispensable guide to the study of subaltern culture and politics and is essential reading for political scientists, anthropologists, sociologists, and historians alike.

Asia’s Transformations

Edited by Mark Selden, Cornell University, USA

The books in this series explore the political, social, economic and cultural consequences of Asia’s transformations in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The series emphasizes the tumultuous interplay of local, national, regional and global forces as Asia bids to become the hub of the world economy. While focusing on the contemporary, it also looks back to analyse the antecedents of Asia’s contested rise.

This series comprises several strands:

_Asia’s Great Cities_

Each volume aims to capture the heartbeat of the contemporary city from multiple perspectives emblematic of the authors’ own deep familiarity with the distinctive faces of the city, its history, society, culture, politics and economics, and its evolving position in national, regional and global frameworks. While most volumes emphasize urban developments since the Second World War, some pay close attention to the legacy of the longue durée in shaping the contemporary. Thematic and comparative volumes address such themes as urbanization, economic and financial linkages, architecture and space, wealth and power, gendered relationships, planning and anarchy, and ethnographies in national and regional perspective.

**INTRODUCTION**

Ideology, disguise, and resistance in agrarian society

The organization of this small volume traces at least three trajectories in my own work and perhaps also in the work of many of my fellow social scientists and ethnographers who have tried to understand agrarian society.

The first trajectory is one of disillusionment and dashed hopes in revolutionary change. This was a common enough experience for those who came to political consciousness in the 1960s in North America. For me and for many others, the 1960s were the high tide of what one might call the romance with peasant wars of national liberation. Given that much of the last half century has been a graveyard of dashed hopes for democracy, true national self-determination, and economic justice in most agrarian states, it is not easy to recapture the heady optimism that many felt at the time. The grip of the major colonial powers on their far flung empires was broken by the ravages of the Second World War; the meeting of the non-aligned powers in Bandung had proclaimed a Wilsonian future of new sovereign nations dealing with one another as equals; and revolutionary movements throughout the world seemed bent on erasing the crushing inequalities in land, wealth, and power (and hence in life-chances) that had blighted the lives of much of the world’s population. The civil rights movement of the 1960s in the United States as well as the social and cultural revolutions in France and Germany seemed part and parcel of a new political opening and possibilities for emancipation in the West as well.

I was, for a time, fully swept up in this moment of utopian possibilities. I followed with some awe and, in retrospect, a great deal of naiveté, the referendum for independence in Sekou Toure’s Guinea, the pan-African initiatives of Kwame Nkrumah, the early elections in Indonesia, the independence and first elections in Burma where I had spent a year, and, of course, the land reforms in revolutionary China and nationwide elections in India.

The intellectual and political context of the disillusionment is worth recalling briefly. I was teaching at the University of Wisconsin at the end of the 1960s. Madison was the scene of constant campus-wide demonstrations against the Vietnam War, beginning with the efforts to prevent Dow Chemical, manufacturer of napalm, from recruiting on campus. With my colleague and mentor Edward Friedman I was teaching a large lecture course on “peasant revolutions.” The class was packed with nearly 400 students for whom the stakes were not trivial, as the draft had begun in 1965. For much of the class, our lectures were insufficiently progressive. After each lecture there was a minor skirmish among the students for the microphones to question us, and dozens of students would huddle after each lecture to prepare a four or five page rebuttal of the lecture which would be distributed to all students as they arrived for the next class. Politics mattered and lecturing under these conditions was both exhilarating and, it seemed at the time, intimidating. It was, for both instructors and students, a “crash” course on revolution, with the emphasis on “crash.”

The disillusionment took two forms: historical inquiry and current events. It dawned on me, as it should have earlier, that virtually every major successful revolution ended by creating a state more powerful than the one it overthrew, a state that in turn was able to extract more resources from the very populations whom it was designed to serve. The French Revolution led to Thermador and then to the precocious and belligerent Napoleonic state. The October Revolution in Russia led to Lenin’s dictatorship of the vanguard party and then to the repression of striking seamen and workers at Kronstadt, collectivization, and the gulag. If the ancien regime had presided over a feudal inequality with brutality, the record of the revolutions made for similar melancholy reading. Not only was the revolutionary state able to batten itself more firmly than its predecessor on the society it ruled, but the popular aspirations that provided the energy and courage for the revolutionary victory were, on any long view, almost inevitably betrayed. The Mexican Revolution was a striking exception in the sense that the peasantry managed to hang on to the land they had seized from the haciendas.

Current events were no less disquieting when it came to what contemporary revolutions meant for the largest class in world history: the peasantry. The Viet Minh, rulers in the northern half of Vietnam following the Geneva Accords of 1954, had ruthlessly suppressed a popular rebellion of smallholders and petty landlords in the very areas that were the historical hotbeds of peasant rebellion. In China, it became clear that the Great Leap Forward during which Mao, his critics silenced, forced millions of peasants into large agrarian communes and dining halls was having catastrophic results. Scholars and statisticians still argue about the human toll between 1958 and 1962, but it is unlikely to have been less than 35 million people (roughly the current population of Canada). While the human toll of the Great Leap Forward was being recognized, ominous news of starvation and executions in Kampuchea under the Khmer Rouge completed the picture of peasant revolutions going lethally awry.

The disillusionment was thus not so much with the peasantry as with those who had seized power, often in their name and with their support, and then proceeded to impose utopian forms of collectivization upon them by force. Both the peasantry and revolutionary elites may have entertained utopian expectations of the new order but it was clear that their ideas of utopia were radically divergent.

Those familiar with this period will recall that it also represented the early high tide of development studies and the new field of development economics. If revolutionary elites imagined vast projects of social engineering in a collectivist vein, development specialists were no less certain of their ability to deliver economic growth by engineering property forms, promoting public health, investing in the infrastructure of markets, providing credit, and, when necessary to compete with left-wing revolutionaries, even (modestly) redistributing land. Practitioners of the development craft, though often personally animated by a desire to improve human well-being, were deployed in a worldwide Cold War counter-insurgency effort aimed at halting the spread of communism. The redistribution of land, the key to subsistence in poor countries, is normally anathema to liberal economies and was only resorted to in extremis in the Cold War. It is diagnostic that once the Berlin Wall was breached and the socialist bloc crumbled, land reform disappeared completely from the agenda of USAID and the World Bank. Having been under few illusions, at the outset, about the purpose and limits of development economics, it would be hard to say that I was disillusioned.

**What do peasants want?**

Having hurled myself at understanding peasant wars of national liberation, I found myself reading more and more about peasant life, village organization, folk beliefs, feudalism, smallholder agriculture, kinship, land tenure, share-cropping and tenancy, and peasant religion. In a sense, I then drew the logical conclusion traced by my intellectual trajectory. Having little faith in the revolutionary state or the development establishment to serve the interests and aspirations of peasants, I concluded that I might devote my time to a close study of the peasantry in Southeast Asia and elsewhere.

It seemed a worthy aim: a scholarly career centered on an understanding of peasants and farmers. Not only were they, then, the majority of humankind but even today they represent the most numerous class in virtually every poor country. Despite unprecedented rates of urbanization, there are more peasants alive today than there were a half century ago. The peasantry, even when referred to by revolutionaries as the peasant “masses,” as if all that mattered was their sheer numerical weight, were presumed to represent the soul of the nation, the carrier of its culture, its spirit, and its future. Rhetoric aside, if revolutions failed to meet their aspirations and needs, then there wasn’t much to be said for them. The welfare and dignity of the peasantry, I reasoned, ought to be the basic point of departure for the evaluation of any economic and political order. On this premise, I set out to understand rebellions and revolutions, as nearly as I could, from the perspective of the peasantry. Happily, help was at hand from many great scholars of agrarian life and peasant movements at whose feet I continue to sit. Among them are Marc Bloch, A. V. Chayanov, Barrington Moore, Jr., E. P. Thompson, Eric Wolf, Fei Xiaotung, Eric Hobsbawm, Clifford Geertz, Carl Landé, R. H. Tawney, and Charles Tilly. Much of my work is deeply indebted to their insight and the questions they posed.

One cannot immerse oneself in this literature without concluding that there is a great gulf between the politics of urban elites on the one hand and rural cultivators on the other. Even when they share a language and a broad culture, it is as if they speak mutually unintelligible dialects. Even when they nominally come together in a nationalist movement, a religious faith, a political party, or a revolution, their stakes, interests, and understandings are likely to diverge widely. Historians and journalists, for the most part, write history from the large urban centers and from the perspective of literate elites. The rural population is generally treated as the more-or-less passive recipient of projects hatched and implemented from above. They otherwise pop into view only when they breach the thin veneer of presumed tranquility in the form of rebellion, millennarian movements, land invasions, arson, and the like. Over the past twenty years or so there has been a great narrowing of the urban—rural “cosmopolitan gap” by massive domestic and international labor migration throughout the global south. When this new rural cosmopolitanism is openly politically mobilized as it was in the July 2011 victory of the rural-based opposition in Thailand, it serves only to highlight the tensions between the popular rural and urban classes on the one hand and the elites of the capital city on the other.

The second trajectory of my work was to try to draw out carefully the actual differences in style, practice, values, and interests between the sphere of village politics and the sphere of urban elites. No two places are alike, just as no two cultures are the same, and therefore sketching the precise contours of rural politics, broadly considered, requires careful ethnography. There are, however, some generic differences between agrarian, village communities and urban conglomerations. Specifying a few of these major differences sensitizes us to their texture and why many of the conceptual tools of social analysis that serve well enough in industrialized societies may mislead us when applied to rural villages.

Villages are face-to-face communities and, as such, resist abstractions. Class relations, which are painfully real enough in most rural settings, are experienced less as categories—e.g., the landlords and the peasants—than as persons with unique histories, families, values, quirks, and physiques. The peasants well know that there are other landowners who have class interests in common, but this _particular_ landlord is unique and his relationship with his tenant or laborer is likely to be _particular_ as well. They know his entire family including parents and grandparents, who are likely to have a collective reputation in the village; they know his past deeds and misdeeds; they know how he regards them; he is far more a personality (however liked or disliked) than a representative of his class. They may have nicknames for him and make fun of him behind his back. The landlord as well, of course, knows his tenants “in the round” and not as abstractions. Mutually, they know far more about one another than factory hands and mill owners. Like the French villagers depicted in Zola’s _La Terre_, they are likely to know how much someone is worth down to the last piece of bed linen. One cannot talk about class relations and conflict in such a community without reckoning that class relations are profoundly inflected by deep personal histories that have shaped them.

In much of the global south, agriculturalists live perilously close to the margin of subsistence. They have little or nothing in the way of reserves or savings that could serve as insurance against a run of bad luck. The death of a plough animal, an incapacitating illness during the work season, a crop failure, or a large drop in the price of the crop they grow can send them over the edge. At worst it meant malnutrition and perhaps starvation; at best it traditionally meant the loss of land and falling into an often lifetime dependence on a relative, a landlord, a patron for subsistence and protection. Misfortune, then as today, also threatened the temporary or permanent breakup of the family. Today it often means migration to another continent.

The potentially catastrophic results of a bad season mean that the situation of much of the rural population is, in Tawney’s memorable phrase, like “that of a man standing permanently up to the neck in water, so that even a ripple is sufficient to drown him.”[^1] This means, in brief, that farmers in this situation are particularly risk averse; they strive to minimize the danger of a life-threatening economic failure. The consequences for their social and economic behavior are pervasive. They are likely to plant several different crops in different fields to minimize the effects of the failure of one; they will choose crops that have a steady if modest yield rather than those whose yields are higher on average but prone to failure; they ordinarily prefer crops that can be eaten as well as sold. They would rather be smallholders than tenants and, similarly, tenants rather than day laborers as each step down represents a loss of subsistence security even though, in a good year, it might pay better. Socially, this subsistence ethic means trying to stay on the good side of kin, neighbors, landlords, patrons, and friends who might, in a pinch, come to your aid. Conversely it means, when possible, extending such assistance to others and recognizing that, the next time, the shoe might be on the other foot.

When it comes to understanding the politics of agriculturalists living near the knife edge of subsistence, the subsistence ethic means that social and economic arrangements are judged more by how well they protect against the most catastrophic outcomes than by how quantitatively exploitive (e.g., how much of the harvest a landlord takes) they are. Thus, an onerous system of land tenure that, in a bad year, lowers the rent and extends credit is likely to be more stable than a tenure system that is less onerous in a good year but implacable in a crop failure. Thus, a tax system that calibrates its take according to the varying crop yield and income of the population is likely to be less resented than a tax system, such as a fixed head-tax, that makes no allowance for a bad year. Any form of appropriation, other things being equal, that violates the subsistence ethic is more politically explosive than forms of extraction, however burdensome, that moderate their take in a poor season and thereby avoid the worst social consequences. One of the reasons why colonial states were often confronted with peasant rebellions was precisely because they fostered capitalist relations of production and fixed-revenue fiscal policies that replaced an exploitive, but necessarily (owing to the weakness of the pre-colonial state) more supple, system of extraction with one that made no allowance for subsistence needs.

The importance of the subsistence ethic in poor agrarian settings is a theme I developed in some detail in my _The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia_. It would be misleading, however, to leave the reader with the sense that we understand the political implications of dire poverty as purely a matter of calories and cash and the calculations of risk that they impel. We cannot, I think, successfully understand subaltern politics of this kind unless we see them also as a _local_ claim for dignity and respect.[^2]

Just as there is no purely abstract experience of class in a small face-to-face community, there is no experience of poverty that is not socially and culturally embedded. In every community there are rituals that mark one’s standing and that of one’s family. For weddings, funerals, coming-of-age rituals, annual religious ceremonies there are minimal standards of culturally acceptable conduct. To fall short of this minimum is not merely to reveal one’s poverty; it is to fall below the minimum level of cultural citizenship and standing. It is, in a sense, a loss of face and of full membership in the community. In the Malay rice-farming community in which I lived, the most important collective holiday was the celebration of the end of the Islamic fasting month, marked, in comfortable households, by lavish feasts to which all relatives and neighbors were invited. The deepest humiliation for the poorest villagers was that they could never afford to hold such a feast, that they were perpetually guests, never hosts, and could not reciprocate. Many of them stayed at home rather than face the humiliation of accepting food on these terms. Marriages and especially funerals, because they were unpredictable, were occasions of potential status building or social despair. There was, everyone understood, a minimally decent wedding, a minimally acceptable funeral ceremony, casket, and feast. To fall below this standard was to be publicly shamed and quietly ridiculed—or, alternatively, to take out a ruinous loan or to sell land in order to live up to expectations. One understands why, therefore, in Christian settings where Christmas gifts are a mark of standing, poor families will often go deeply into debt in order to provide their children with presents that are an assertion of cultural standing even though ruinous economically. In a larger sense, owning some land, being economically independent are, like culturally acceptable feasts, not just an index to one’s income but a mark of standing, dignity, and of non-servile status. The goal of economic action for most of the poor is a modicum of comfort and, above all, cultural dignity and self-respect, not maximizing the return on each transaction.

The purpose of “The ‘way’ of peasant politics—agrarian revolt and the little tradition” is to examine the particularity of class, culture, and economy in poor agrarian settings. Understanding some of the basic differences between rural subaltern politics and urban elite politics, I try to show, also helps us grasp what happens when elites and the peasantry come into contact as allies or enemies in political movements.2

**THE “WAY” OF PEASANT POLITICS—AGRARIAN REVOLT AND THE LITTLE TRADITION**

The religious dimension

Introduction

Missionaries of “great traditions,” whether that tradition be religious or political, commonly find themselves in a poignant dilemma when they attempt to carry the message to the peasantry. If the message and its bearer are accepted at all, they are assimilated into an existing set of meanings, symbols, and practices which frequently do great violence to the message as understood by its high priests in the capital city. This cognitive abyss may be inconsequential so long as “body counts” are more important than ideological orthodoxy. After all, the social power of a church or a political party may well rest as much on the number of its nominal adherents as on the success with which they have absorbed its catechism. But when it comes to the _quality_ of beliefs—that is to say, their orthodoxy as measured by formal doctrine—the peasantry has sorely tried the patience of archbishops and commissars alike.

Much of the history of Catholicism, for example, could be written in terms of the tension between ecclesiastical orthodoxy and folk heterodoxy, not to say heresy, to which its expansion gave rise. Cries of despair at what has happened to the faith in the course of its propagation would be a part of that history. Typical of the tone is this complaint about the use of Catholic prayers and saints by Haitian voodooists: “It is not we who have got hold of people to christianize them, but they who have been making superstitions out of us.”[^1] Lest we take this example as particularly exotic, we do well to recall that in Western Europe a whole host of pre-Christian beliefs and practices not only survived among the peasantry but permeated folk Christianity well into the modern era.[^2] The resistance of the rural population to orthodox Christianity was such a thorn in the side of early churchmen that the very origin of the word “pagan” (derived from _paganus_, meaning country dweller) is associated with the peasantry. Awed by the tenacity of older belief systems, Sir James Frazer was led virtually to conclude that the great traditions of Islam and Christianity were, over the long haul, ephemeral while folk beliefs were forever. His assessment merits quotation both for its celebration of the little tradition and for its prose:

Thus it happens that, while the fine flower of religious consciousness in myth, ritual, and art is fleeting and evanescent, its simpler forms are comparatively stable and permanent, being rooted deep in those principles of common minds which bid fair to outlive all the splendid but transient creation of genius. It may be that the elaborate theologies, the solemn rites, the stately temples which now attract the reverence or the wonder of mankind are destined themselves to pass away like “all Olympus’ faded hierarchy” and that simple folk will still cherish the simple faiths of their nameless and dateless forefathers, will still believe in witches and fairies, in ghosts and hobgoblins, will still mumble the old spells and make the old magic passes when the muezzin shall have ceased to call the faithful to prayer from the minarets of St. Sophia, and when worshippers shall gather no more in the long drawn aisles of Notre Dame and under the Dome of St. Peters.[^3]

Much the same gap or slippage may be observed within any major world religion between its written, codified doctrine and its folk variants in the countryside. The slippage is presumably far greater when the religion is itself a cultural import, as, say, Islam in Southeast Asia, than when it is an elaboration of local beliefs, as, say, Hinduism in India. Nevertheless, some slippage is to be expected merely by virtue of the fact that the “folk” adherents of Hinduism or Islam create, in part, their own religious meanings and practices in line with their local experience, their social structure, their history, and their cosmology.

Political creeds, particularly in the modern world, are not unlike religious creeds, in the sense that they too are elaborated at the urban centers of civilization by intellectual “high-priests” and then propagated in the countryside. In the course of their propagation they undergo a comparable transformation; some themes are lost, new ones are added, symbols acquire new meanings and are put to new purposes. Nowhere is this transformation more apparent than in the luxuriant heterodoxy that typifies “folk” communism.

Two brief examples from twentieth century Southeast Asia will suggest something of the slippage involved. In late 1926 a faction of the fledgling Communist Party of Indonesia and its Islamic allies launched a large but abortive revolution in West Java and West Sumatra. Despite the presence of what passed as modern and secular leadership at the top, the result did little credit to its great tradition sponsors. Membership cards were taken to be exemptions from the poll tax, the goal of the rebellion varied from district to district according to local grievances and beliefs, utopian dreams were openly entertained.[^4] As the ideas of the leadership percolated down to their rural following, they seemed to lose their original features and take on the coloration of the local social environment; efforts to close the cognitive gap were to no avail:

In spite of careful pedagogic planning, the lecture courses ran to seed. Their content matter, also because of the many foreign words, was beyond the grasp of the listeners. The usual procedure in those courses was that after the leader had finished his presentation the members had to repeat what they had heard; blackboard diagrams were used to illustrate the spoken word; the material was again and yet again repeated. The course disintegrated, in spite of the fact that the members united in singing the Internationale, the song of _Saja Marianna Poletar_…In spite of all this the participants fell asleep, the courses petered out, the membership decreased, and contributions could not be collected.[^5]

It was not simply a question of resistance to party ideas, it was rather the fashion in which those ideas were infused with a variety of “folk” meanings that often flew in the face of party doctrine.

Four years later in Annam (Central Vietnam) a communist revolt bearing a strong family resemblance to the 1926—27 Indonesian uprising eliminated French control in parts of two provinces for nearly a year.[^6] Known as the Nghe-Tinh Soviets, the movement was initiated by, but never entirely under the control of, trained party cadres. Once the French recovered from the initial shock, however, they decimated the ranks of trained cadres; thenceforth the revolutionary initiative passed largely into the hands of the local peasantry. A new stage of the rebellion began, for while the peasantry shared with the cadre a desire to eliminate the French, punish corrupt officials, and abolish the hated “body tax,” it had other designs which were not at all in keeping with party policy. Specifically, the peasant rebels ignored the party’s effort to effect a broad coalition and attacked rich and middle peasants, local notables, and Vietnamese with French schooling. They took grain by force from neighboring villages, burned Catholic churches, school buildings, tax rolls, and land records. The official party history of the rebellion makes it clear that these excesses were attributable to the loss of party direction—that is to say, to popular initiative: “Following the breaking of contact [with the central committee], the local cadres, left to themselves, let themselves be led by the masses and fell into a policy of adventurism.”[^7]

As in the 1926–27 uprising in Indonesia, the Nghe-Tinh Soviets had gotten out of hand; as in Indonesia much of the great tradition’s radical doctrine had become garbled and reinterpreted in translation to its little tradition clientele. From the perspective of the party elite, a coherent doctrine and tactics had been tragically transformed into a jacquerie without purpose or direction.

My contention in this essay will be that there is something systematic about this slippage between religious and political ideas as understood and practiced in the city and their little tradition variants in the countryside. This slippage, I argue, is scarcely random or accidental—quite simply because the social characteristics of an idea’s great tradition adherents differ in clear and identifiable ways from the social characteristics of its little tradition adherents. The former, taken broadly, live in large differentiated cities where much of their life is governed by impersonal legal norms, are generally middle or upper class, and are masters of a written tradition. The latter, also taken broadly, live in small, relatively homogeneous villages where much of their life is governed by local custom, are generally lower-class subsistence-oriented producers, and are part of an oral tradition. To the extent that this gross characterization has any validity, it alerts us to the fact that religious and political ideas may each be transformed in comparable ways as they reach the peasantry. If folk Catholicism is to the New Testament and St. Peter as folk communism is to _Das Kapital_ and Lenin, we may then be able to say something meaningful about folk variants of great tradition ideas and practices in general.

I believe that, despite wide variations, there is something which could be described as a distinct vernacular perspective that is more than simply a parochial version of cosmopolitan forms and values. This perspective is cast in stark relief in peasant religious and political dissidence and, most notably, when a rebellion set in motion by the intelligentsia becomes, in part, the property of its peasant following. Two of the most instructive historical cases in this regard are the English and French Revolutions whose folk components have been richly described by Christopher Hill and Richard Cobb.[^8] On such occasions one can often discern, within the peasantry’s tradition, what amounts to a “shadow society”—a pattern of structural, stylistic, and normative opposition to the politico-religious tradition of ruling elites. Furthermore, this pattern of opposition may pit the peasantry against radical elites as well, insofar as such elites may simply propagate another variant of a cosmopolitan tradition. In what follows, I outline in a preliminary way the constituent features of this shadow society.

The political dimensions of vernacular local rural traditions seem to merit attention for two reasons. First, far too much scholarly labor has been expended on the precipitants of peasant rebellion and far too little on the shared values and goals which find expression through rebellion. We need to know more about why peasants rebel than we can learn from statistics of taxes, harvests, and hunger. Second, it seems clear that, compared with, say, the proletariat, the political culture of the peasantry is strongly influenced by factors which are not purely a consequence of its relationship to the means of production. To put it somewhat differently, the proletariat has to create its class subculture in a new environment, while the peasantry, like traditional artisans, inherits a far greater residue of custom, community, and values which influences its behavior. Theories of peasant politics that do not take this cultural dimension into account are likely to misconstrue the meaning of both peasant passivity and peasant jacqueries.

Much of the evidence and argument which follows concerns Southeast Asia. The choice of such a wide terrain necessarily entails a loss of variation and detail. If the broad lines of the analysis make sense, however, the details will enrich it; if they do not make sense, we can move on. I have also made reference, where it seemed appropriate, to other areas, particularly Western Europe, since what I have read suggests that the relationship I am describing is not unique to Southeast Asia.

**Great tradition and little tradition: symbiosis and conflict**

**_Elite vs. mass beliefs_**

The disparity in belief and practice from the great to the little tradition is, of course, to be expected. Any transfer of ideas or institutions from one group to another entails a shift in meaning and, in this sense, the disparity is but a special case of a more general process. The particular category of cases which concerns us is that of the transfer of ideas _within_ the same society: from elites to non-elites, from the city to the countryside, from the center (socially and spatially) to the periphery.

We might do well to recall, in this context, the striking differences social scientists have discovered between the character of political beliefs among elites and non-elites in contemporary industrial nations. In an influential article, Converse has shown that as we move down the social scale in the United States, ideas that were “remote, generic, and abstract” become increasingly “simple and concrete.”[^9] Ideological principles are replaced most often by an identification (positive or negative) with concrete social groups and by political reasoning from the immediate experience of family, job, and friends. For example, what might be a socialist elite belief in the redistribution of the social product to benefit labor becomes, in a working-class family, a demand for a $20 a week raise and lower milk prices. Nonelite beliefs also tend to be more fragmented and less internally consistent; one rarely finds a cluster of central beliefs which “organize” or determine an individual’s position on other issues. Regardless of how these differences are accounted for,[^10] they clearly have important consequences. For example, some issues which may be the focus of intense debate among elites may pass virtually unnoticed by the larger public.[^11] Another notable consequence is that one cannot necessarily infer a consensus of beliefs among elites and non-elites from their participation in the same movement. As Converse observes, “the true motivations and comprehensions of the supporters may have little or nothing to do with the distinctive beliefs of the endorsed elite.”[^12]

The gulf between elite and mass beliefs, Converse argues, is due in part to the relative distance of non-elite beliefs from what we might call the elite, urban, scriptural tradition.

The broad contours of elite decisions over time can depend in a vital way upon currents in what is loosely called “the history of ideas.” These decisions in turn have effects upon the mass of more common citizens. But, of any direct participation in this history of ideas and the behavior it shapes, the mass is remarkably innocent.[^13]

The entire matter was put much more directly, and less condescendingly, by George Orwell in his account of the meaning of socialism among the English working class during the Depression:

The first thing that must strike any outside observer is that socialism in its developed form is a theory confined entirely to the middle class. For it must be remembered that a working man…is seldom or never a socialist in the complete logically consistent sense…To the ordinary working man, the sort you would meet in any pub on Saturday night, socialism does not mean much more than better wages and shorter hours and nobody bossing you about. To the more revolutionary type who is a hunger-marcher and is blacklisted by employers, the word is a sort of rallying cry against the forces of oppression, a vague threat of future violence…But I have yet to meet a working miner, steelworker, cottonweaver, docker, navvy, or whatever who was “ideologically” sound. One of the analogies between Communism and Roman Catholicism is that only the educated are completely orthodox.[^14]

If the sharp distinctions to which Converse and Orwell point exist in advanced industrial nations, we might reasonably expect a far greater disparity in belief systems in more traditional agrarian societies. The former, with their national media, high rates of physical mobility, and nationwide markets, would, other things being equal, tend to foster social experience and hence social thought that is more homogeneous, though it might be far from harmonious.[^15] In the absence of these integrating factors, the contours of non-elite beliefs are likely to diverge more strikingly from elite beliefs and the variety of beliefs _among_ non-elites is also likely to be greater.

There are thus at least two dimensions of latent conflict that are reflected in this comparison of belief systems. The first, and most remarked upon, is the steady erosion of faith in the normative order of ruling elites as one moves down the ladder of stratification.[^16] Whether this is measured by the frequency of votes cast for opposition parties, by abstention from the religious institutions of the ruling class,[^17] or by overt acts of dissidence, it is a firmly established social fact, even if historically it has not been so decisive as socialists had hoped. The second dimension, which Orwell describes and with which we are concerned, is no less a dimension of class. In this case, however, something of a popular culture or vernacular tradition is arrayed against the ideology and institutions of urban elites, both conservative and radical. Where the vernacular tradition has been sharply attenuated, as in the industrialized world, this dimension of conflict is confined to a few backward areas or exists as a minor irritant in the relations between the leadership of a national organization and its local affiliates. Historically, of course, the little tradition has been strongly represented in what are often collectively described as populist movements. Educated socialists have had a justifiable horror of those themes because they can be, and so often have been, manipulated to serve the interests of fascism and racism. It is worth recalling, however, that much the same ideological cleavage has also helped to animate the rural anarchist movement in the Spanish Civil War as well as Mao Tse-tung’s variant of communism.

**_Elite vs. mass beliefs in agrarian society_**

The terms “little tradition” and “great tradition” were coined by Robert Redfield in his essay “Peasant Society and Culture.”[^18] They are intended to distinguish the beliefs and practices of the folk strata of an agrarian civilization from those of its elite. More or less in keeping with Redfield’s concepts, we may define the little tradition as “the distinctive patterns of belief and behavior which are valued by the peasantry of an agrarian society”; the great tradition is the corresponding patterns among the society’s elite. Our concerns, however, are slightly divergent. Redfield’s main focus was on religion, ritual, and myth, while I would extend our concerns more directly to issues of economic organization, statecraft, and political authority. I have also added the word “valued” to the definition in recognition of the fact that much peasant behavior may be largely coerced and thus not represent a part of the peasantry’s normative culture.

The apparent assumptions behind this definition raise some questions. One of the first concerns the unitary nature of the great or little tradition. For Redfield’s purposes, it seemed reasonable to assume that classical civilizations had a single great tradition, although he was well aware that this great tradition changed over time and that factions of the elite must have vied to make _their_ orthodoxy prevail over others. The assumption of a unitary great tradition is unwarranted in most instances. For example, the Javanese population of Indonesia is divided along the fault lines of two great traditions: an older Hinduized court culture and a more recent Islamic culture. Both fault lines extend into rural Java to define folk variants, often mutually hostile, of each cultural stream.[^19]

The uniformity of the little tradition in a given society is, if anything, more problematic. By virtue of the _relative_ isolation of its carriers from one another, we may expect the little tradition to display more variety than the great tradition, each village having its own local deities, customs, and history.[^20] The peasantry of each village is not, however, a world unto itself as in primitive communities, but part of a larger complex society. For this reason, the little traditions have each borrowed from, and contributed to, a common larger tradition. In the villages of southern Europe, for example, one finds not only some common forms of folk Catholicism but also a stratum of beliefs and ritual which can be traced to pre-Christian Roman cults. Moreover, the economic patterns of peasant society tend to create a shared cultural heritage which follows lines of market integration. Skinner has argued convincingly that the unit of cultural integration in peasant society is not the village but the marketing region which defines an area of regular and intense interaction between villages.[^21] Patterns of buying and selling, personal acquaintance, marriage alliances, the travels of specialists (e.g., storytellers, blacksmiths, tooth artists, healers, astrologers, tinkers) operate to culturally integrate the hinterland of a given market center.

Finally, and perhaps most important, the existential base of peasant life itself might be expected to foster something of a shared cultural perspective. Subsistence-oriented cultivators all growing similar crops, all subject to a capricious nature, and all enmeshed in a wider state with its economic and political demands may well develop similar solutions to common problems. The shared rituals of rice cultivation and the belief in a rice spirit which are found in many Southeast Asian little traditions represent a minor example of this parallelism in peasant culture.

The actual degree of homogeneity in vernacular traditions is, of course, an empirical question, but there are enough centripetal tendencies in peasant culture to compensate, at least in part, for the fragmented nature of peasant social structure.

Another important question involves the strength and cohesiveness of the vernacular tradition _within_ the village community. While the answer will vary widely from region to region and from village to village, it seems reasonable to expect that the social cohesiveness of a village will strongly condition its moral and cultural tone. Thus an older village that is nucleated, that must exchange labor internally, that holds land in common, that is unified by kinship, that is not sharply stratified, and that must meet its corvée and tax obligations collectively would probably constitute more of a moral community than a village which lacks these ties of history, blood, property, and obligation. The closed corporate communities of northern and Central Vietnam or those of Java would fall near the cohesive end of the spectrum.[^22] At the other end one might place the newly settled frontier villages of southern Vietnam or Lower Burma in the first decades of this century. The essential distinction here is between communities with powerful internal social sanctions and those without such sanctions.[^23]

Implicit in the use of the terms little tradition and great tradition is the assumption that each represents a _distinct_ pattern of belief and practice. Just how distinctive they are—just how much cultural distance separates them—becomes a very important analytic question. In a comparatively simple economy that entails only a rudimentary division of labor and little stratification, the cultural distance will probably be correspondingly small. In more complex societies, by contrast, where a permanent economic surplus has permitted the growth of urban centers and/or a court culture, the scope for the development of a distinctive urban-elite tradition is far greater. Establishing some rough estimate of cultural distance involves comparisons in styles of life: differences in income, language, consumption patterns, residence, dress, religious practice, education, ritual, jural status, ethnicity, and so forth. A certain distinctiveness occurs by definition since one group is a rural cultivating class while the other is a non-farming elite. Beyond this irreducible gap, however, disparities in culture may vary tremendously—from the mere provincialism of rural classes in what is often called post-peasant society, to societies in which peasantry and elite constitute highly distinctive cultural worlds. The gap in culture, when it is large, may represent a sharp break, or it may be bridged by many cultural intermediaries—e.g., lesser gentry, lower clergy.

The closeness of an elite’s culture to that of its peasantry depends, in large part, upon how its great tradition developed. Broadly, we may distinguish between what Marriott[^24] calls an “indigenous” civilization that largely represents an elaboration or “dignification” of elements already present within its little tradition (e.g., India and China) and a “borrowing” civilization in which much of the elite culture is based on outside models (e.g., much of Southeast Asia). The latter is most glaring when conquering groups, such as the Normans in England, impose themselves on preexisting local traditions, but it is not confined to conquest alone. In early Southeast Asia, for example, the use of Hindu cosmogony and court Brahmins to elaborate a theocratic state was in sharp contrast to the beliefs of the subordinate population.[^25]

Historians agree that under an Indian veneer, most of the population preserved the essentials of their own culture…Sutterheim tells us that Hinduism has already been and still is the culture of the upper classes, but never became completely that of the masses, who were attached to Indonesian animism and to the ancestor cult.[^26]

Colonial conquest produced, if anything, a much sharper cleavage between the little tradition and elite culture. In the Philippines, it fostered the growth of a mestizo elite, the illustrados, made up of Spanish, Chinese, and Filipino elements. This elite was so racially identifiable as to lead peasants to refer proudly to themselves as “Filipinos de corazon y cara” (Filipinos in heart and face) as compared to their foreign-looking social betters.[^27] Culturally, this elite took on the dress, language, and style of their colonizers and gravitated increasingly from the hacienda to the provincial towns where their new style of life could be more easily maintained. Much the same process of cultural emulation could be observed in the growth of a Francophile landowning and office-holding elite in colonial southern Vietnam as well.[^28] One might even say that the elite of the trading cities of colonial Southeast Asia was at least as far removed culturally from the cultivating class as was the nineteenth century French-speaking court of St. Petersburg from its peasantry. In colonial Rangoon in 1930, the Burman population was less than a third of the city’s inhabitants.

The volatile mix of collaboration and tension which marks the relationship between peasantry and elite arises from the fact that each represents a part-society and a part-culture. In the context of Southeast Asia, no one has captured this ambiguity as well as Clifford Geertz in his _The Religion of Java_:

In a fully developed non-industrial civilization, then, there is typically a ruling class of literates and a ruled class of illiterates (although both groups may be further internally differentiated), the two facing one another across an at best only sporadically bridgeable chasm of class. Those who can write provide the ideal model for those who cannot, and the latter ape the former as best they can from a distance which is usually great. The gentry represents the Great Tradition as the peasant represents the Little; and although both may have been heavily stimulated by outside influences, as they were in Java by Hindu-Buddhism and Islam, they grow in time so close as to become distorted _resources/books//Decoding Subaltern Politics_ Ideology, Dis - James C. Scott of one another, alternately repelled by and attracted to each other. In the peasant the gentleman sees both a disturbingly barbaric parody of his own carefully controlled behavior and an attractive spontaneity and animal power which tempt him from the infinite boredom of his own constricted politesse. In the gentleman the peasant sees both a summation of all that he wishes he could be…and a kind of self-important stuffiness and genteel fastidiousness which, he feels, must surely take most of the joy out of life.[^29]

For almost any element of Javanese culture one can identify a “low” form and a “high” form corresponding to the little and great traditions. The appellations “high” and “low” (in Java _alus_ or “refined” and _kasar_ or “crude”) not only express how the elite sees things but are, to some extent (although the exceptions are critical), accepted by the peasantry as well. _Alus_ is used to refer to language, dress, behavior, occupations, theater, or objects which are “pure, refined, polished, polite, exquisite, ethereal, subtle, civilized, smooth.” “_Kasar_ is merely the opposite: impolite, rough, uncivilized; a badly played piece of music, a stupid joke, a cheap piece of cloth.”[^30] The elite (_prijaji_, in this case) has differentiated itself linguistically to the point where, as in other court cultures, the words for eating, sleeping, and walking differ systematically depending on whether a _prijaji_ or a peasant is doing it. Both elite and peasantry also have their own characteristic entertainment, music, poetry, and dancing.[^31] Despite these sharp distinctions between cultural worlds, neither complex can be understood without reference to its counterpart. Depending upon one’s vantage point, one may see much of _prijaji_ tradition as an elaboration of the pre-existing, original little tradition or, conversely, the little tradition as a “vulgarization” of elite culture.

But in Java, as elsewhere, folk culture is not simply a crude version of its own great tradition. It functions also, both in form and content, as a symbolic criticism of elite values and beliefs. For the most part, this criticism is muted within a context of subordination. Thus the character Semar in Javanese puppet theater, for example, is often taken to represent the peasant in some generic sense; he ridicules _prijaji_ language and pretense and, in popular drama, tends to usurp the role of hero altogether.[^32] Yet he is faintly ridiculous himself and impotent (symbolically domesticated?) at the same time. Under certain circumstances, however, such forms of symbolic conflict may become manifest and amount to a political or religious mobilization of the little tradition. Evidence of this mobilization is apparent in the millennial traditions of Javanese agrarian radicalism in which the normal social order was to be reversed.[^33] At another level, quietistic movements of resistance to colonial authority also made use of the little tradition. The rural Saminists at the turn of the century, for example, not only resisted taxes but also insisted on using _ngoko_ or low Javanese when addressing officials whom they called “brother” (_sedular_).[^34]

Most little traditions, like that of the Javanese, are thus two-faced. Whether the themes of subordination or of conflict prevail depends in large part, as we shall see, on the material relations between peasantry and the elite.

**_Symbiosis and negotiated subordination_**

The cultural dependence of the little tradition on the great tradition is a commonplace of anthropological scholarship. According to functionalist models of society, it is this alignment of the subject population with the values of elites which constitutes the working basis of social action. Though I believe it represents a partial and misleading truth, the consensual model has important social consequences which bear emphasis.

Evidence that much (but not all) of what passes as folk culture in fact originated in earlier elite traditions is pervasive. For example, Foster has shown that many of the distinctive folk traits of Latin America—including pottery designs, the clothing of Andean Indians, the conceptual basis of folk medicine, the institution of _compadrazgo_ or godparenthood, not to mention Catholicism—may be traced back to Spain.[^35] In the course of its transmission this cultural material was naturally reworked and parochialized, but it is by no means the residue of pre-conquest culture. Much the same analysis would apply to the little tradition in Southeast Asia. Popular theater borrows prodigiously from the Hindu great tradition, particularly the epic stories of the _Ramayana_ and _Mahabharata_ as diffused from the court cultures of South India. Legions of folk deities are also recognizably imported from the Hindu pantheon. In Vietnam, the borrowing is from the Chinese tradition but the relationship is similar.

The cultural dependence, if we may call it that, of the little tradition represents not only a spatial relationship between center and periphery but a temporal relationship as well. Typically, the patterns which peasants emulate are the great tradition orthodoxies of an earlier time.[^36] Thus we find lower-class Hindus Sanskritizing their culture to improve their ritual status, while contemporary Brahmins are busily becoming westernized.[^37] Foster calls this lag “time to simmer” and regards it as a constituent feature of folk culture. The reverse process, in which parts of the indigeneous little tradition are elaborated and incorporated into the great tradition, is also common—but perhaps less so in Southeast Asia than elsewhere since so much of elite culture has been taken from foreign models.

The little tradition is dependent upon the great tradition in still another sense. To the extent that elite culture represents an idealized and more elaborate formulation of folk culture, it also becomes an object of admiration if not aspiration. As one moves up in what peasants generally acknowledge to be a cultural hierarchy, one moves closer to many of the ideals which are manifest in the shared culture of the society. To be closer to the center of a great tradition is to be closer to its secret mysteries, its power, its institutional charisma—whether these mysteries are embodied in religious doctrine, literary traditions, or legal codes. The importance of ritual contact with the center in Islam, for example, takes the form of the _hadj_, or pilgrimage, to Mecca which is a nearly universal goal among believers. Brahmins who sit atop the caste hierarchy of India owe their status to the belief that they alone are empowered to perform the central rituals of Hindu life. Thus the recognition by peasants of a superordinate tradition of which their practices are but a local variant implies a stratification of culture and, consequently, a relationship of cultural dependence, if not inferiority.[^38]

In nearly all complex societies, moreover, the stratification of culture reflects a stratification of power and wealth as well. The representatives par excellence of the great tradition are the gentry, nobility, officials, and high priests who collectively form a ruling elite as well as a cultural elite. They inspire awe as much for their secular power as for their cultural enlightenment. Cultural dependence and subordination are thus often inextricably linked with political and economic dependence.

The classic model of cooperative relations between the great and little traditions—a model which emphasizes collaboration, mutuality, and complementarity—is the social ideology of patronage. In its various guises, patronage gives concrete structural form to the cultural and political dependence of the little tradition while, at the same time, it serves to justify that dependence. Its intended effect is twofold. First, it legitimizes inequalities in material and cultural resources as fore-ordained. Within the context of these inequalities, subordinate classes are expected to be deferential and loyal, while the elite is expected to serve both the collective and individual interests of its clientele. Second, it celebrates, as does much of functionalist social science, the positive value of stratification. A hierarchy is seen to provide coherence and order which are necessary for such collective tasks as defense, internal peace, water control, and works of religious merit in addition to providing a link with the realm of supernatural power.

Almost without exception this relationship is likened to the kinship tie between father and son—the model of benevolent authority. Within Southeast Asia one finds strong elements of this social idea in the link between nobles and commoners (_nai_ and _phrai_ in traditional Thailand, _prijaji_ and _abangan_ in Java), in the link between a religious teacher/prophet and his students/disciples, and, to a limited extent, in the Confucian ideology of the mandarin system in Vietnam. The official or noble in each case expected deference as well as labor and grain from commoners. In return, he was responsible for political order and the welfare of his subjects. Dependence extended to religious and cultural matters as well, for the role of these elites often included patronizing religious festivals, organizing important rituals, constructing pagodas and temples, and overseeing classical education. Elites were thus not only secular powerholders but also, in more general terms, the representatives of a superordinate tradition to the periphery. At the apex of this system in the Indianized states of Southeast Asia sat the divine king. The welfare of his subjects was held to depend on the alignment of palace architecture, ritual, and conduct with the sacred cosmology of the universe. In quite literal terms, the king was the sacred center of the kingdom as Mt. Meru was the center of the world.

Even within the context of patronage and hierarchy, however, the social order is not self-legitimating. A basis for conflict and tension arises from the very political myths which justify inequalities in the first place. For it is largely by reference to its contribution to group welfare that power seeks to become authority—i.e., to legitimate itself. Thus the king may be responsible for bringing rain or for the first ceremonial plowing which assures good crops. The process by which power is rationalized thus inevitably creates moral principles of performance by which it may be judged and found wanting. As Berger and Luckmann observe:

every putative actor of role x can be held responsible for abiding by the standards which can be taught as part of the institutional tradition and used to verify the credentials of all performers and, by the same token, serve as controls.[^39]

These obligations of power have practical consequences in society: kings might be killed if the crops failed to ripen; Russian priests, we are told, were beaten if the rains did not come;[^40] emperors lost the “mandate of heaven” when famine stalked the land. The same principle may be seen at work in the linguistic shift in meaning of the term “_cacique_” in colonial Philippine history. As the gap between _illustrado_ and peasant widened and as the former abrogated earlier privileges, the word “_cacique,_” previously an honorific, became a term of opprobrium.[^41] The common tao generally had little choice but to knuckle under to the new dispensation, but the legitimacy of the landowner was clearly undermined.

Elites naturally tend to define what they do for their subjects as privileges which they may or may not provide as it suits them. On the other hand, the phrase “noblesse oblige” carries a far stronger meaning. Moreover, by a curious metamorphosis—one which there is good reason to believe is universal—subjects tend to turn privileges into rights. In his masterful analysis of paternalism in the North American slave economy, Genovese indicates how slaves fashioned their own understanding of paternalism:

The slaves had turned the dependency relationship to their own advantage. Their version of paternalistic dependency stressed reciprocity…From their point of view, the genuine acts of kindness and material support to which they were by no means insensible, were, in fact, their due—payment, as it were, for services loyally rendered…If the master had a duty to provide for his people and to behave like a decent human being, then his duty had to become the slave’s right.[^42]

Even when elite control is as pervasive as it was in the slave system, dominant classes are not completely successful in imposing their definition of reality on subordinate classes. What they achieve, at best, is what Parkin has called “an uneasy compromise between rejection and full endorsement of the dominant order.”[^43] As one would expect, when we move down the stratification ladder we encounter growing skepticism. The terms of subordination to a great tradition and its representatives are in this sense negotiated, not imposed.

There is still another major source of tension between the great and little tradition which follows directly from the fact that the carriers of each tradition represent classes whose interests are, in some respects, diametrically opposed. The literate exponents of the great tradition in an agrarian society live essentially on the surplus value which they extract from the peasantry in such forms as taxes, tribute, corvée, tithes, and land rent. When the economic surplus claimed by elites as a matter of right violates custom or imposes great hardships on the peasantry, it is likely to be resisted as unjust. Thus, even within the framework of subordination, there are very severe limits to the willingness of a peasantry to underwrite, with its resources, the elaboration of a great tradition. The fact that elite culture, its pattern of consumption, dress, entertainment, is created quite literally at the expense of the peasantry, is bound to make the relationship an uneasy one.

Custom and the subsistence needs of villagers thus establish moral ceilings on the economic claims which the great tradition may impose on subordinate classes. A breach of these ceilings has historically threatened the relationship of subordination itself. As Hilton, writing of medieval peasant uprisings in England and Europe, explains:

the immediate causes for some of the most serious of the mass movements were actions by landowners or governments or both together, which altered the customary relationships or disappointed normal expectations to the detriment of the peasant class as a whole…This strain is normally seen by peasants from an apparently conservative standpoint. They cannot accept the abandonment of traditional roles by any one of the orders of the society—whose basic structure they do not, to begin with, challenge.[^44]

The same principle in Southeast Asia is evident in the alacrity with which commoners in traditional Thailand fled from noble lords who abused their power, or in the frequently quoted Vietnamese folk saying: “The law of the emperor stops at the hedge of the village.” Economically as well as culturally, the subordination of the peasantry is a negotiated subordination with definite moral limits. These limits, as we shall see later in more detail, have important political consequences.

**_The cultural basis of radical conflict_**

There is another dimension to most folk cultures that is more dramatically at odds with the great tradition. In this “counterpoint to the leading melody,” as Wertheim has described it,[^45] many of the central values of elite culture are symbolically rejected or stood on their head. Such symbolic opposition finds expression in diverse ways: in local institutions, in religious meaning and ritual practice, in folklore and myths, in popular entertainment, and in language. For the most part this pattern of symbolic contrast remains latent but, under certain circumstances, it may provide the cultural basis for movements of political and cultural dissent.

Apart from the class interests which may pit peasants against elites, there are other reasons why the little tradition should contain elements of radical dissent. The most obvious reason is the fact that the existing cultural hierarchy inevitably relegates the peasantry and its culture to a status of permanent inferiority. As Shils puts it, “Submission to the ascendancy of the center and to the standards which affirm it is painful because the indignity of inferiority is painful.”[^46] The great tradition holds out a model of behavior for civilized man which the peasantry lacks the cultural and material resources to emulate. Whether it is a matter of knowing the sacred texts, of speaking and dressing properly, of performing the elaborate ceremonies of initiation, marriage, or burial, peasants are asked, in effect, to revere a standard which is impossible for them to achieve. In traditional China, for example, literacy was a critical means of stratification and implied, as a Sung encyclopaedist pointed out, “that people who know ideographs are wise and worthy, whereas those who do not know ideographs are simple and stupid.”[^47] In the same spirit, inscriptions at the Khmer Kingdom of Ankor refer to the retainers of the nobility not by name but by epithets such as “dog,” “cat,” “despicable,” “stinking.”[^48]

The scorn for the little tradition which a great tradition by definition implies is unlikely to be shared with quite the same fervor by commoners. No matter how stratified a society’s culture, there has perhaps always been the feeling that, at some level, human beings (all members of the same species) are conceptually equal. Thus it is not surprising that “all the golden ages, all the utopias, all the paradises created by the human imagination are egalitarian.”[^49] In fact, it is inequality that requires justification, a justification which in the Christian tradition is provided by the myth of The Fall. The theme of a world without class distinctions, however, has always been an integral part of popular Christianity and millennial movements in the West.[^50] Southeast Asia is no exception to this pattern. Persistent beliefs in a golden age or in the return of a just king have supplied the ideological basis for many rebellions.[^51] Rebels have often made use of the egalitarian strains within the major religions of Islam, Buddhism, and Christianity to confront a social order in which all believers were decidedly not equal. The hierarchy engendered by the great tradition thus seems everywhere to encourage its own antithesis within the little tradition. Just as “every religious ceremony creates the possibility of a black mass,”[^52] it would appear that every social hierarchy creates the possibility of a world turned upside down.

The little tradition’s latent dissent may also derive from the fact that its social base, the peasant community, is both historically and functionally prior to cities and to the great tradition. While it is possible to imagine a class of agriculturists living outside a large state or society—anthropologists call such peoples primitive or tribal—it is not possible to imagine a great tradition or a non-cultivating elite without a subordinate producing class by which it is sustained. From this asymmetrical dependence, the physiocrats and others deduced the primacy of the food-producing classes over the food-consuming classes, who rule. Oswald Spengler touched an important truth when he claimed that the “peasant is the eternal man, independent of every culture that ensconces itself in the cities. He precedes it, he outlives it… [He is] the origin and ever-flowing source of the blood that makes world-history in the cities.”[^53] Historically, many peasantries have provided the “host” economy for a series of great traditions. Each of these episodes has undoubtedly left an indelible mark, both culturally and materially, but while the collapse of an agrarian kingdom may have only minor consequences for its peasant communities, the collapse of peasant food surpluses plunges the agrarian kingdom into a grave crisis.

The _idea_ of a peasant community existing independently and owing no allegiance to a wider civilization has been very much alive in Southeast Asian history. It is seen most graphically in Leach’s description of the alternative models of social organization among the Kachin of Burma.[^54] Depending upon the resources available, Kachin society oscillates between a feudal, hierarchical model imitative of the Shan system of classes and regional chieftancy (_gumsa_), on the one hand, and a republican ideal of autonomous villages without hereditary distinctions among lineages (_gumlao_) on the other. Each model is linguistically and religiously distinctive. The _gumlao_ model of local autonomy provides a viable alternative to feudal dependence and thereby sets normative limits on the exactions of would-be regional chiefs.

So long as land was plentiful in traditional Southeast Asia, the possibility of fleeing subordination has helped to restrain the appetite of the traditional state. The art of Thai and Burmese statecraft was devoted, in large part, to the problem of preventing the kingdom’s tax base from evaporating. In the Philippines, those who “fled the bells” were called _remontados_, and their life outside colonial law always represented a latent threat to organized, lowland society.[^55] Where escape was more difficult, the idea of autonomy might, as we shall see later in more detail, take the form of refusals to pay taxes and attacks on the agents of the wider society.

Nowhere is this tension between subordination and autonomy more evident than in the actual behavior of peasantry and elite during rebellions. The elite, by and large, abandons the countryside and moves for protection into the provincial towns or the capital itself where the coercive power of the state is concentrated. The peasantry often leaves the village and heads for the hills, at the farthest possible remove from the state. It is as if the tenuous compromise of civil society comes undone: the peasantry retreating “back” down a rung of civilization to the independence of primitive society, the elite retreating “up” a rung of civilization where its interests are best defended.

There are, doubtless, many other reasons why the little tradition embodies elements of symbolic opposition to dominant values. What matters for our purposes, however, is that the material and symbolic hegemony normally exercised by ruling institutions does not preclude, but rather engenders, a set of contrary values which represent in their entirety a kind of “shadow society.” As Wertheim points out, these values are not simply epiphenomena:

In their most embryonic shape, these counterpoints only manifest themselves under disguise. In more primitive societies they mostly appear as tales, jokes, and myths which give expression to deviant sets of values… The contrapuntal value systems remain virulent, though they are dormant—and bide their time. Under circumstances favorable to them, they may produce a basic change within the dominant structures.[^56]

The remainder of this essay is devoted to the religious and political dimensions of such “deviant values.” Here I wish merely to suggest some of the ways in which they may find cultural expression.

Religiously, the peasantry of most societies is, nominally at least, of the same faith as the elite.[^57] Within this shared great tradition, however, peasant beliefs may fly directly in the face of what passes as orthodoxy. For example, there is likely to be an entire stratum of religious experience including magic, animism, local cults and deities, household and clan rituals, and the residue of previous great tradition religions which has left its mark on the rural population. Much of this religious tradition may be quite compatible with, say, Buddhism or Catholicism. In other respects, however, the two may be antagonistic; Catholic prayer and shamanistic exorcism may represent alternative therapies for the same illness; local prophetism may conflict with churchly authority. As long as great tradition religion is not particularly doctrinaire or intrusive, this competition may, over time, produce a stable syncretism. But when the agents of the superordinate tradition do not tolerate petty heresy, the conflict may take the form of open resistance. A classic example of such religious “warfare” is the conflict between popular sects, on the one hand, and Puritanism and churchly religion in general, on the other, during the English Civil War. Members of the former were found baptizing pigs, pulling down altar rails, blaspheming God publicly, singing the pleasures of the flesh, and rejecting categorically the interference of the clergy in lower-class life. All of these “counterpoints” could be traced to pre-existing popular culture but in the exceptional turmoil of the English Revolution they found organized and defiant expression.

Millennial dreams, as we noted earlier, provide another vehicle for radical religious and social values. Without exception, the utopia which is envisioned is a mirror image of existing social inequities and privations—e.g., a bountiful world where there are no classes, private property, or exploitation. Often the existing ruling class must be brought down as a prelude to the new world. Historically, the mobilizing capacity of such millennial visions has perhaps provided the single most important normative basis for popular rebellions.

Deviant values may also commonly be found in popular theater, folktales, folk sayings, myths, poetry, jokes, and songs. An illustrative example might be the Brer Rabbit stories of American slave culture and the related mousedeer folktales of the Malayo-Indonesian world. These stories celebrate the cunning of the weak who, in a world of danger, survive by appearing to submit while laying a trap for their enemies. At another level, there are popular culture heroes, such as Till Eulenspiegel tales of Europe and Semar in Indonesia, who mock the pretensions and manners of the elite and represent a stark contrast to “official” values.[^58] Finally, there are the social bandits and avengers such as Robin Hood or Jesse James whose exploits become the object of folk veneration in part because they defy the law and values of the larger society.[^59]

The cultural opposition we are describing is definitely not just a clash of ideas. For folk culture is represented by a whole series of specialized carriers—e.g., storytellers, bards, healers, shamans, local prophets, diviners, and the like—whose place in the peasant community is potentially threatened by the incursions of the great tradition. Inasmuch as the deviant tradition takes such organized forms as popular theater (_ludruk_ and _kledek_ in Indonesia, _cheo_ in Vietnam) and dance troupes, local cults, or sectarian religious schools, we may even speak of institutional opposition. Virtually every great tradition institution may find its “counterpoint” or “shadow” institution within the folk culture.

Pitt-Rivers finds precisely this pattern of structural and normative opposition in rural Spain:

The formally constituted institutions controlled by the ruling group or the state and the activities wherein the pueblo avoids them stand in opposition to one another. The latter spring from the network of interpersonal relations within the community and depend upon the memories and cultural traditions of the pueblo rather than on the written word. The former owe their existence to authority delegated by a central power. Pairing them together one can see, in place of the sanctions of law, the sanctions of the pueblos’s mockery; in place of the food control, the clandestine mills and black market; in place of the matriculated shops, the _revendonas_ and illicit traders; in place of the civil guard, the bandit and the smuggler. In place of the schools, the _maestros rurales_; in place of the doctor, vet and chemist, the _curanderos_; in place of the _practicanta_ (trained nurse), the _parteras_ (country midwives). And for the purposes of invoking the powers of religion in such matters, in place of the priest, the _sabia_ [wise woman].[^60]

Once again, there is nothing surprising about this tension; it is almost a diagnostic characteristic of folk society. While the cultural distance between the little and great tradition may vary from society to society and over time, there is no reason why this cultural distance _per se_ should engender open conflict. It is perhaps only when the agents of the great tradition attempt to impose their definition of reality on the peasantry or when their claim on peasant resources violates customary subsistence rights that we may expect a clash.[^61] When rural mobilization does occur, however, the distinctiveness of the little tradition is likely to strongly color the style and goals of the peasant movement.

**_Themes of little tradition religion_**

If folk religion differs systematically from great tradition religion, it is largely because its adherents are sociologically distinctive. In particular, they represent at the same time a community, the village, and a class, the peasantry. This nexus of community and class is the principle of transformation as great tradition religion makes its way to the countryside and reaches a more or less uneasy _modus vivendi_ with the preexisting beliefs and practices it finds there.

Thus the doctrines of Buddhism, or Islam, or Catholicism are bound to be affected by the fact that they encounter a small, face-to-face community with its own _oral_ tradition, its own local customs, its own local deities, its own religious practitioners, its own sense of the supernatural world. This community religious tradition is also necessarily influenced by the fact that its folk adherents are, in large part, a class of cultivators. At a minimum this fact is likely to imply a variety of agricultural rites and, perhaps, a distinctive attitude toward nature. It may also entail, as we shall see, a set of beliefs which express, latently or not so latently, an antagonism both to those of superior social status and to the values they represent. Happily for the peasantry, cultural meanings cannot be coerced in quite the same way as taxes or corvée may be, and so local meanings will, to some degree at least, influence whatever synthesis emerges.

The following discussion is necessarily confined to a few of the more salient themes—localism, syncretism, and profanation—of little tradition religion. It is meant to be illustrative, not exhaustive. I take as my major example folk Buddhism and _nat_ worship in Burma, although other illustrations are introduced to suggest parallels in different cultural contexts.

_Localism_

Any “religion of the book” seeking peasant converts has always had to contend with a bewildering array of local gods and spirits.[^62] Such local cults represent, one might say, the _ur_ or primary religion of the little tradition inasmuch as they appear even in primitive societies where there is no center of great tradition diffusion. In their great variety, they are linked to virtually every social unit and every activity of the peasant community. Each dwelling is likely to have its own spirits—spirits of the hearth, the front door, the foundation post. Each family will have its own cult of ancestor worship or its own guardian spirit. Each lineage or clan has, in turn, its distinctive rites which link its members to a common ancestor and which express its distinctive place in the social structure. Each community too has its troupe of local spirits—a village genie perhaps, and spirits associated with nearby hills, trees, rocks, and fields—each with its own observances. This religious complex is local in more than one respect. It reflects the particularities of local geography and social groups; no claim is made for the universality of such cults, for their function is to differentiate as much as to integrate. Thus village rites express social solidarity in part by marking off the village, ritually, from neighboring settlements. The observance of local cults, moreover, is a matter of local tradition and organization and depends little, if at all, on outside institutions or doctrine.

Marriott’s study of religion in a North Indian village illustrates the significance of this substratum of local deities. While villagers worship roughly 90 gods, about half this pantheon falls outside _any_ vernacular literary tradition and is subjectively felt to have only local meaning:

In these little tradition deities, as in festivals, in caste rituals, and in kinship organization, we again come upon an area in which the little tradition feels itself to be and can be conceived as a partly distinctive and partly isolable nexus within greater communities.[^63]

Within the village the ratio of Sanskritic to non-Sanskritic deities drops markedly as one moves from the literate Brahmin elite of the village (45 percent) to the low and lowest castes (15 and 20 percent respectively).[^64] The distinctive little tradition religion appears to be, above all, the property of the less mobile, lower status members of the community.

Being Burman and being Buddhist are virtually synonymous in the view of Burma’s rural population. Yet one need not subscribe to the belief that Buddhism is but “a thin veneer of philosophy laid over the main structure of animistic beliefs”[^65] to recognize the rich stratum of non-Buddhist beliefs which characterizes rural religion in that country. Many local rituals such as the “Ceremony of the Nine Lords” to which a household invites its neighbors are an amalgam of Hindu and local beliefs which have little sanction or place within Theravada Buddhism.[^66] Local ogres and ghosts similarly fit uneasily into Buddhist doctrine.

Much of the non-Buddhist religious practice of the Burmese takes the form of _nat_ worship. While the worship of nats (supernatural spirits) does not necessarily contradict canonical Buddhism, which allows for lesser spirits,

Buddhism and the nat cultus have separate places of worship, separate days of worship, separate modes of worship, etc…._nat_ and _deva_, shaman and monk, nat festival and Buddhist holyday, spirit shrine and pagoda are separate and distinct in fact and in conception.[^67]

The term _nat_ refers to several classes of supernatural beings who may influence human affairs for good or ill.[^68] Only one such class, that of the _devas_, is thoroughly integrated into Buddhist cosmology. The other two classes of nats are “nature” nats and the “thirty-seven chief nats.”

Nature nats inhabit hills, fields, and trees in the neighborhood of every village; they must be propitiated with offerings of food, prayer, or music lest they bring harm to those who pass through their domain. Such offerings may be village-wide, as in the case of _Youkhazou_ who dwells in large trees, or they may be individual or familial, as in the case of the nats who influence the fertility of crops. Judging from the fact that the religious life of many non-Buddhist hill peoples is dominated by such nats, there is reason to believe that nature nats may represent the aboriginal religion of the Burman people. In any case, each village has its own supernatural geography of familial spirits whose domain is decidedly local.

The thirty-seven nats, the most important for our purposes, are the spirits of real historical persons, all of whom met violent or “green” deaths. “These nats are capricious, vicious, unruly, undependable, strong and jealous…power and quickness to resent injury or slight are their most prominent characteristics.”[^69] If propitiated, however, they may bring benefits. Each nat has its own special province. Min Mahagiri, for example, is the household nat who is honored by a coconut hung on the southeast corner pole of most homes and who is propitiated to keep the house safe against sickness or thieves. Each village, in turn, has its own guardian nat and a shrine at which he is worshipped by villagers. Often the villages of an entire district will have the same guardian nat, although his/her cult will be celebrated by each village at its local shrine. Finally, there are “mother’s-side” and “father’s-side” nats who are inherited—a practice which perhaps derives from an earlier pattern of regional nats to whom the descendants of the original inhabitants continue to owe fealty even after they have moved away. Any individual is thus likely to propitiate a number of different nats, based on his household, his village, and the origin of his parents. Propitiation is largely, though not entirely, confined to the family or local level while a class of shamans (_nat kadaws_ or “nat wives”) often play a leading role in the ritual.

Historically, there is good evidence that the traditional Burmese court attempted to bring order and hierarchy to nat worship in the interest of political consolidation. Thus the “official” list of thirty-seven nats may have evolved from the incorporation of local or regional cults of the subject population while the nat Min Mahagiri, whose cult had entered in the vicinity of Mt. Popa, was set above the rest as the house nat for all subjects within the kingdom. Centralizing kings, realizing the centrifugal potential of regional cults, endeavored either to bring them under the umbrella of Buddhism or, failing that, to extirpate them. The great eleventh century Buddhist king Anawrahta, having tried in vain to suppress nat worship, had the image of all thirty-seven installed in his new pagoda at Pagan as a symbol of their subordination.

Politically, the cult of the nats has always been at symbolic odds with the centralized court claiming spiritual and material domain over all its subjects. Nats are, after all, symbolic of regional or even local loyalties and, just as loyalty to a regional chief may conflict with loyalty to the king, so does nat worship potentially conflict with the national cult. More significantly, the myths of many individual nats, all of whom can be linked to historical figures, are in keeping with this interpretation. Quite a few nats were put to death in the wake of having disobeyed the king or having actually risen in rebellion. While the court has always attempted to turn their grisly fates into a lesson in the consequences of _lèse-majest_é, this has not been entirely successful. As Spiro comments:

the nats, as I have stressed, symbolize opposition to authority. Hence, in performing their cultus— and more especially their public cultus—the people are expressing their opposition to authority. But the nats symbolize opposition not only to political authority; they also symbolize opposition to religious authority.[^70]

It is thus not stretching matters much to link the indigenous form of animism, nat worship, with local loyalties and with anti-royal and anti-Buddhist sentiment. By contrast, Buddhism and the deified king of Hindu tradition are linked with the moral claims of the centralizing state.[^71] Thus, at least in the Burmese context, little tradition religion contains the seeds of political and spiritual dissidence.

It seems quite possible that the tension between the spirit localism of the little tradition and the national religious cults of the great tradition, which I have sketched for Burma, may characterize other Southeast Asian societies as well. The local spirit (_phii_) cults of Thailand, for example, appear to have a relationship to Buddhism which is analogous to the relationship between nat worship and Buddhism in Burma.[^72] In Java as well, what Geertz calls the _abangan_ religious complex, with its rituals of local solidarity (_selametan_) and its local spirits (e.g., _demit, danjang, lelembut_), contains many elements which both latently and explicitly foster a resistance to central authority, whether religious or political.[^73] Without elaborating further, I suggest that little tradition religion may never be fully incorporated and made subordinate to the broader purposes of the great tradition.

_Syncretism_

When the universal message of a world religion encounters the staggering variety of folk belief and practices, a hybrid religious complex emerges which often defies easy classification. Elements of the great tradition are “parochialized,” which Marriott has described as “a process of localization, of limitation upon the scope of intelligibility, of deprivation of literary form, of reduction to less systematic and less reflective dimensions.”[^74] Thus within folk Catholicism, for example, the story of Jesus’ birth and the parables may find a ready acceptance while the doctrine of original sin is ignored. The mass, communion, and the rosary are likely to acquire new and heterodox meanings in line with indigenous beliefs. If the form of devotion follows the formula of the great tradition, it is a fair bet that its meaning and use will be transformed. It is not just the new beliefs which are domesticated; much of the little tradition itself is reinterpreted and worked into the new synthesis. A local mythical hero or deity may take on saintly status while older rituals are incorporated into the new religion and given fresh sanction.

Left to itself, it would appear that folk religion is inherently syncretist. The eclectic tendencies of the little tradition are, to a large extent, the consequence of its oral culture. By their nature, oral traditions are plastic; they may be embroidered and transformed in accord with the needs of social groups and the vicissitudes of history. Since there is no original text to which reference can be made, the past may serve the present without any sense of heresy. Thus the distinction which an anthropologist or historian might make between the indigenous and imported elements in folk religion is not a distinction which the folk itself is in the habit of making. The religious tolerance (church fathers might have called it “promiscuity”) of the Catholic peasantry in Europe allowed local pagan and great tradition rituals to interpenetrate and form a distinctive folk Catholicism. Peasant Catholics elsewhere have made their own working blend without much concern for origins or contradictions, as Redfield has noted: “In the villages [Yucatan, Mexico] there is, to the native, no paganism to be distinguished from Catholicism. Only an outsider with a knowledge of history would make such a distinction.”[^75]

Much the same pattern holds for the folk variants of Buddhism and Islam. Vietnamese villagers under the tolerant eye of Mahayana Buddhism, for example, patronize local cults, ancestor shrines, fortune tellers, and exorcists in addition to worshipping the Buddha.[^76] “Buddhism, animism, ancestor worship and other such sophisticated classifications are not meaningful distinctions to the villager.”[^77]

Moreover, folk syncretism seems to have an additive quality to it. Imported elements are incorporated to find their place among existing practices, many of which are the residue of earlier borrowing. Local festivals in village India have this same quality of steady accretion; new practices have been adopted without replacing earlier patterns and “without rationalization of the accumulated and transformed elements.”[^78] The results of centuries of such borrowing may be a kind of religious archeological site in which each great tradition has left its layers of belief and ritual atop a bedrock of persisting local religion. Ignoring more subtle distinctions, one may thus detect in remote villages in Europe today the residue of pre-Christian Roman cults, not to mention the remnants of pagan agricultural rites and local spirit beliefs, beneath an ostensible Christian faith.

The coexistence between an imported great tradition and older deities is made possible, in part, by the formal subordination of the older gods to the new faith and by a specialization of function. When the Christian god was accepted by the European peasantry, pagan deities often lived on as saints; they appeared on the medieval stage as the retainers and ministers of God.[^79] Inasmuch as the world religions accepted by the peasantry have been concerned above all with salvation, they often left unattended a variety of mundane concerns about sickness, accidents, weather, and harvests which had been the classic domain of little tradition rites. The division of function was hardly a neat one, for the new religion was often made to serve mundane ends (e.g., praying to the Christian god for good crops), but frequently the older deities continued to specialize in the here-and-now while the new god specialized in the hereafter.

Folk Buddhism in Burma essentially follows the pattern I have described. It is a genuine compound of little and great traditions; the acceptance of Buddhism has not come at the expense of animism. As we would expect, some elements of Buddhism, such as the _jataka_ stories of Buddha’s former lives, have found a more enthusiastic popular reception than the Pali scriptures or the remote possibility of attaining nirvana. Virtually all elements, however, have been reworded in accord with the local cultural genius.

Festivals that in all probability predate Buddhism have continued under a patina of Buddhist sanction, such as the Water Festival, or _Thingyan_, which still retains marks of its origin as an agricultural rite linked to fertility and rainfall and to nats, although the water that is thrown about with great abandon is also now used to wash pagodas and is seen as a symbol of Buddhist purity. Even rites which are decidedly Buddhist in intent, such as the _Shinbyu_ or young man’s ordination, are put to wider purposes by villagers. Spiro observed one ordination that was almost swamped by a form of nat dancing quite out of keeping with Buddhist restraint.[^80] Throughout Burma the _Shinbyu_ is also an important occasion for merit making—a chance for the well-to-do to demonstrate their generosity by underwriting the expenses. Here the Buddhist doctrine of merit is joined to a secular norm of village life which enjoins the wealthy to put their resources at the service of the community.[^81]

Most observers of Buddhism in Burma have been struck by the extent to which it has been reinterpreted in line with persistent animist beliefs. Thus, for example, while doctrinal Buddhism explicitly rejects the existence of a soul, most Burmese peasants believe in a _leikpya_, or “butterfly spirit,” which is transferred from one birth to the next. At a more fundamental level, there is some question of how the Buddha is experienced, with one writer claiming that he is seen “as a sort of supreme nat or deity who can be petitioned or perhaps even propitiated in a manner not unlike the way in which other nats can be successfully dealt with.”[^82] While it is surely incorrect to conclude that “Buddhism as practiced here is a form of animism,”[^83] there is little doubt that much of Buddhism is taken as a system of magical techniques for mundane purposes. Buddhist prayers and the rosary, as in folk Catholicism, are treated as talismans; the Buddha is invoked to prevent or cure illness; and relics are valued for their healing properties. Buddhism is thus valued in part because its sacras represent a superior technology for handling the mundane problems to which animist ritual has always been addressed.[^84]

Perhaps one reason why the Buddhist—animist synthesis has been so thoroughgoing in Burma is the strong dependence of the local clergy (_pongyis_) on local alms and support. Lacking a centralized hierarchy which would train monks, pay them, and assign them to “parishes,” there are few structural pressures making for discipline and orthodoxy. On the contrary, there is every reason for pongyis to be tolerant of lay beliefs. One ex-monk explained to an anthropologist that pongyis refrain from criticizing nat worship for fear of losing lay support. It is not only a question of toleration; many monks have built reputations less on the basis of their piety than on their knowledge of magic and the charms which they dispense.[^85] The very structure of the Theravada clergy appears to favor this close rapprochement between the great tradition and its folk adherents.

For the layman, Buddhism and nat worship have a hierarchical relationship to one another. The superior power of Buddhism is reflected in the belief that monks are immune to the pernicious influence of nats. When exorcists are called, they typically invoke Buddhist spirits to defeat the nats who have possessed their patients. To some extent, the two cults are also functionally specialized. As one informant put it, “when we do something for Buddha, we do it for the next life, and when we do something for the nats, we do it to help us in this life.”[^86] This division of labor may be due to the fact that Theravada Buddhism, as a particularly austere salvation religion, deals little with the problem of immediate suffering which, as Max Weber reminds us, is “always decisive for the psychological character of religion of the masses.”[^87] The problem of immediate needs may thus help explain not only why animism continues to flourish but also why Buddhism is so readily put to animist use.

_Profanations_

The religion of the little tradition is not only a negotiated, localized, domesticated, and subordinate variant of the great tradition. A close inspection of any folk culture is likely to uncover elements in the religious life of subordinate classes which are profanations of the dominant spiritual and temporal order. This radical strain of little tradition religion may take the form of rituals of reversal in which, for a time, the poor become aristocrats; the prevailing hierarchy of power and piety are openly mocked; and deference is suspended. Popular sacrilege is at the core of these “moments of madness.”

Insofar as such profanations are rigidly defined, contained, and even sanctioned by dominant elites, it may be claimed that they are epiphenomena designed to drain off the tensions which any political or moral order engenders. By ritualizing protest, they may reinforce the symbolic hold of the dominant order.[^88] The institution of the royal buffoon may fit this interpretation nicely. On the other hand, profanations are an indication that the symbolic hegemony of ruling groups is not complete. They represent an alternative moral universe, a latent normative subculture which, under some conditions, threatens to shatter its ritualized straitjacket. Time and time again we find that themes of religious profanation serve as the moral basis of mobilization for peasant religious dissidence, whether quietistic or violent.

Rituals of profanation among the European peasantry during the Middle Ages may be seen strikingly in the plays, dancing, and general Dionysian character of Carnival.[^89] The origin of these festivities owed as much to indigenous fertility rites as it did to the Roman Saturnalis, in which social and moral restraints fell away and slaves were on an equal footing with their masters. Carnival was, and is, notable for its social and religious sacrilege. The demonic clown, encouraging obscenity and lasciviousness, dominated events, which assumed the proportions of a collective black mass. Many of the carnival plays included wild burlesques of the Christian service and vivid portrayals of the sexual and material appetites of the priesthood.

It goes without saying that Carnival was most popular among the lower classes. The official church was dead set against the tone of the village plays (_ludi_), not to mention the dancing, and encouraged Christian morality plays in direct competition. Just as the Roman “Senate had proscribed the dionysian cult of intoxication,” so the church recognized that ecstatic cults, particularly those of pagan origin, were a potential threat to its ecclesiastical authority.[^90] Thus it was not simply the ridicule to which the church was exposed that determined its opposition but rather the status of Carnival as an alternative religious experience.

To my knowledge, no systematic study of profanation in peasant religion has ever been undertaken. Such a study would teach us a great deal about the pattern of normative dissent from reigning religious ideas. As Hilton emphasizes in the European context:

the vital problem of the social consciousness of the peasants is inevitably bound with our understanding of popular religion, the relations of the people with the official ecclesiastical hierarchy, and with the heretical sects which become so important from the twelfth century onwards. Many of the thoughts and feelings of the peasants must have derived from pre-christian or nonchristian sources.[^91]

The theme of an equalitarian state of nature without shame, hierarchy, law, or exploitation is prominent in many of these ritual reversals which derive as much from the “Golden Age” or “reign of Saturn” in Greek and Roman myth as from Christian sources. The antinomian and anarchist tone of many religious rebels who denounced the official church, its doctrine of sin, and even the sacrament of marriage directly reflected the spirit of profanation.[^92]

The doctrines of the Seekers and Ranters, elaborated in the midst of the English Civil War, are a striking example of the incipient pattern of heresy in folk religion.[^93] Meeting in taverns, the Ranters sang blasphemous songs, swore as a matter of principle, and ridiculed communion. They abandoned the normal churchly doctrine of sin and morality and celebrated the pleasures of the flesh as God-given joys. For them, God was to be found more in the uninhibited drinking and sexual hedonism of the poor than in the temperance of the pious rich. Nothing could have been more of an affront to the Puritan doctrine of the religious victors who legislated against blasphemy and ruthlessly suppressed both movements.

Elsewhere, the association of a dominant religion with an oppressive social order has frequently given rise to heresy and profanation among subordinate classes. In Rwanda, for example, the cult of Ryangombe among the Hutu serfs of the dominant Tutsi pastoral people was a nearly total symbolic rejection of the values and myths that supported an exploitive tribal feudalism.[^94] Where the Tutsi proclaimed the sacredness of herding, the central figure in the Hutu myth was a destroyer of cattle who ritually bathed his hands in the blood of cows. Where the Tutsi religion proclaimed the justice of caste and feudal subordination, the Hutu cult rejected all hierarchy and its hero declared, “I walk behind no sovereign and no vassal follows me.”[^95] Long before Hutu uprisings, the moral structure of revolt was firmly in place:

Historically foreign to Tutsi culture, the cult of Ryangombe in its typical Rwandan form is the product of a popular, multi-faceted alienation. Ryangombe offers to the ensemble of castes a mystic evasion…a kingdom without hierarchy where the father and son, closely allied, affirm an equal sovereignty, a kingdom without castes or cows, without links of maternal lineages nor alliance.[^96]

But it is not simply as a “mystic evasion” that the cult must be understood. It provided a critique of the existing order and an alternative symbolic universe which was so potentially explosive that its practice was forbidden by the Tutsi elite. While the cult may have consoled in the present, it was also the cradle of social links and moral dissent among the oppressed which lay in wait for the future.

The pattern of religious profanation may be largely determined by the dominant religion, inasmuch as it is often its mirror image. A clear example is the cult of Krishna and its festival, _holi_, in village India. To the extent that one can speak of any order in a celebration marked by wild revelry, it is an order “precisely inverse to the social and ritual principles of routine life.”[^97] During _holi_ the prerogatives of age, wealth, caste, sex, and power evaporate; Brahmin men are chased and beaten by low-caste women and burlesque dirges are sung at the door of notorious moneylenders. Judging from the enthusiasm with which they participate, _holi_ seems especially popular among the lower castes, who have the most to gain from a reversal of roles.

Profanation is very much a part of folk religion in Burma, despite the fact that local monks are quite tolerant of heterodoxy. To some degree, such profanation may arise from a natural ambivalence which laymen feel toward the monkhood and its implicit claim to status in the hierarchy of grace. It is common, for example, to hear criticisms of monks for having violated their oaths as well as claims by laymen to an equal or greater piety than those who wear the robe.[^98] A number of folk sayings, such as the following riddle, also reflect the undercurrent of hostility: “One always gives to the other, but the other squanders what is given and still asks for more. Who can it be? [Answer] the layman and the monk.”[^99] This latent hostility has, on at least one occasion, taken the manifest form of a sect which, in the nineteenth century, repudiated laymen’s obligations to the _sangha_ in the belief that nirvana could be attained without the assistance of a clergy. The sect “spread like wildfire” and was subsequently proscribed by the Burmese government.[^100]

Quite apart from a certain ambivalence toward the _sangha_ itself, there are elements in Burmese folk religion that have a pronounced anti-Buddhist tone. Thus the Water Festival is marked by transvestism, disrespect for authority, and sexual license, as well as insults to government officials and politicians[^101]—which give it something of the tone of the Indian _holi_ or Catholic Carnival. While _Thingyan_ may have acquired an official Buddhist charter, its tone is somewhat of a profanation of Buddhist norms.

The most profound and thoroughgoing profanation of Buddhism, however, is to be found in the cult of nat worship and, in particular, in the famous cult of the Taungbyon (nat) brothers, celebrated annually near Mandalay. The mythical lives of the Taungbyon nats themselves may be seen as a symbolic confrontation with Buddhism. Both were Muslims, not Buddhists, during their earthly lives and were put to a grisly death by the famous Buddhist king Anawrahta for having chosen to play marbles rather than contribute to the construction of a pagoda. Their father and uncle had earlier disobeyed the injunction of a Buddhist monk by eating the corpse of a magician whose powers they thereby acquired. Beyond this disobedience to the will of Buddha, the lives of these and other nats who are honored at the festival are virtually a mirror image of Buddhist values. They are known, and celebrated, for their drinking, gambling, womanizing, and general debauchery. “Thus, for example, the song of the elder Taungbyon brother, Shwepyingyi, ends with ‘and the pretty maidens have missed us from that day’.”[^102] In short, it is as if the Taungbyon brothers had taken vows to lead a life which reversed the moral code of the monkhood.[^103] The inherent affront to Buddhism in the myth of the Taungbyon brothers makes it reasonable to assume, as Brown did, that they are worshiped precisely because they defied a Buddhist king whose proselytizing was resented by much of the population.[^104]

If the myth of the Taungbyon brothers has an anti-Buddhist tone, the tone of the festival itself resembles a black mass of official Buddhist values. Like the nats whose cult is honored, the celebrants drink, gamble, swear, and take advantage of the atmosphere of open sexuality. The dancing in this bacchanalian setting is “wild and abandoned,” frequently leading to trance-states. Police and military uniforms are very much in evidence at the eight-day festival since the carousing often threatens to get out of hand. A decree by King Thibaw commanding local officials to maintain order lest the “crimes” which marked the festival during King Mindon’s reign be repeated[^105] suggests that the problem is not new and that something more than mere disorderly conduct may have been involved.[^106]

Thus the festival of Taungbyon contravenes almost every Buddhist value. It occurs in the middle of Buddhist Lent, a time of meditation and abstinence. It is marked by the sacrifice of a hare which violates the Buddhist law against taking life. It is concluded by the collective destruction of a tree which may represent the sacred _bo_ tree under which Buddha sat. Above all, of course, it is the hedonistic abandon of the festival which runs _totally_ counter to the Buddhist ideal of the suppression of earthly desires. As Spiro concludes, “the most famous of nat festivals, honors two nats who personify almost every evil which Buddhism abhors.”[^107] “In celebrating this festival, it is as if the Burmese are deliberately flouting most of the values of Buddhism.”[^108]

Reducing Buddhism and nat worship to two ideal types, Spiro emphasizes the stark contrasts. Where Buddhism is moral, ascetic, rational, serene, and other worldly, the nat cultus is amoral, libertarian, non-rational, turbulent, and worldly.[^109] It is no surprise in this context that two of the three victims of nat possession observed by Spiro shouted, while in trance, “There is no Buddha.”[^110]

The object of this discussion of religious profanation has been to show that any moral order is bound to engender its own antithesis, at least ritually, within folk culture. To say that all Burmans are Buddhists, while true as far as it goes, is to ignore the fact that their religious life contains elements of belief and practice which are symbolically hostile to Buddhism. Much the same may be said of the secular order, where the existing distribution of status, wealth, and power meets its symbolic antithesis within folk culture. When the dominant religious order and the dominant secular order are mutually reinforcing, as they often are, religious and secular profanation may represent one and the same phenomenon.[^111] In any case, it is clear that, at the level of belief and practice, opposition to the dominant religion does not await the arrival of “outside agitators”; it is already symbolically in place.3

**THEMES OF PEASANT POLITICS: LOCALISM, SYNCRETISM, PROFANATION—AGRARIAN REVOLT AND THE LITTLE TRADITION**

The political dimension

Aspects of local vernacular traditions that represent the symbolic rejection or reversal of the central beliefs and values of elite culture may provide a cultural basis for movements of political dissent. Such subversion or profanation of literate, cosmopolitan, urban traditions, it must be emphasized, applies to radical as well as conservative great traditions. Where the dominant religious order and the dominant secular order coincide or are mutually reinforcing, religious profanation may be the same as secular profanation. Thus the little tradition religion may serve as a “cradle” of social links and moral dissent among the oppressed. This brings us to the more directly political import of the little tradition. I begin with an example from recent European history.

We are likely to see the communist movement in the twentieth century to be, both in its doctrine and ideology as well as in its Leninist practice, supremely _secular_. And yet, on a little reflection, it seems fairly obvious that, for millions of its adherents, it took the form of a quasi-religious faith. Here, I do not simply mean that it inspired a fervor and devotion that we typically associate with religious sects, though that too is undeniably the case. What I mean is that for the Christian European working class it was metaphorically read as a fulfillment of the salvation on earth associated with the Apocalypse and the Day of Judgment prophesied in Revelation and the Book of Daniel. A reading of the _Communist Manifesto_ side by side with the Gospels reveals a structural parallelism that is impossible to ignore. The Gospels foretell a time of the rule of surpassing sin and evil followed by a Second Coming of Christ and avenging angels who destroy the wicked and save the righteous. A paradise of harmony and virtue is established that marks the end of history. The teleology of the _Manifesto_ follows a similar script. The increasing exploitation of capitalism eliminates all but a property-less proletariat whose claims for justice and subsistence are arrayed against a small, oppressing class of owners of the means of production. An apocalyptic clash takes place in which the working class (guided by the virtuous vanguard party!) defeats the capitalists and their state apparatus, after which a communist paradise is established that marks the end of history. It is hard to imagine that the European working class was insensible to the way in which communist teleology mapped so closely onto the Christian narrative of collective redemption and transcendence. Much of the appeal of “folk” communism depended, I believe, on it being a re-working of an eschatology with which the working class was thoroughly familiar.

Any major political movement that faces determined opposition from powerful elites and the state is unlikely to endure unless many of its members believe firmly that the zeitgeist is headed their way: that the future is on their side. This faith is what allows them to persist through setback after setback, defeat after defeat, in the confidence that they will one day prevail. The combination of the class-based wish for a socialist state and a millennarian narrative, whose religious roots underwrote their faith, was vital in sustaining them through decades and decades of defeat. That faith, of course, largely evaporated throughout the world after the collapse of the Soviet bloc in 1989.

**Themes of little tradition politics**

Just as the peasant community has historically been religiously defined by its own guardian deities and ritual life, so has it been politically defined by its own structure of power and customary law. The strength and distinctiveness of this political tradition will vary considerably with the ecological, social, economic, and historical character of the community itself. As in the religious sphere, however, we are likely to find a dualistic political culture: a negotiated version of what we might call great tradition politics and a more radical set of values which cannot be reconciled with dominant political conceptions.

The radical strain within the little tradition is particularly important for one basic reason: the demands of political elites on the peasantry tend to be more concrete and unavoidable than the claims of religious elites, except perhaps in the case of compulsory tithes. Questions of rent, taxes, conscription, and tribute often pit the peasantry against ruling elites in what amounts to a zero-sum game. Much of what constitutes the political little tradition implies a limitation or, more radically, a repudiation of the elite’s claim to a “fund of rent” which characterizes all peasant societies.[^1]

**_Localism_**

Historically within Southeast Asia there has been an enormous variation in the strength of local sentiment—all the way from the closed corporate communities of Java and North Vietnam to the open frontier settlements of the Mekong Delta and Lower Burma. In almost every case, however, the village has constituted something more than merely a physical aggregation of households. Ritually, it has been set apart by local guardian spirits and religious shrines; economically, it has represented the unit of labor exchange; socially, it has formed the unit of status, of reciprocity, and of social insurance; politically, it has generally been a unit of dispute settlement as well as of administration and taxation. Until the massive economic changes of the late colonial period which undermined much of the economic basis of village autonomy, Kartodirdjo’s description of Javanese localism would have been applicable to most of the region:

Though by no means isolated from the larger society, local peasant communities stubbornly retained their own identity which was bound up with attachment to the soil and to age old village cults…moreover…the central village values of cooperation and reciprocal help were prized because they allowed the village community to function as a more or less self-contained unit and were thus without outside referent.[^2]

Indicative of the moral integration of the village was the fact that thefts, when they occurred, were committed across, not within, village boundaries.[^3]

Localism manifests itself in essentially three forms. First, the village is a local system of action—of status, influence, and authority—which is to some degree isolated from the outside.[^4] Second, it thereby constitutes a distinct sphere of perception and information—of political meaning—that is also set apart from the wider society. Finally, it is a unit of moral obligation (i.e., intense social sanctions) which tends to exclude outsiders. Localism in these senses differentiates the village not only from the world of external elites above it but also, to some extent, from other villages, each of which is a distinctive social sphere.

Few of the village studies of Southeast Asia have failed to remark the high value accorded to the political autonomy of the village. There is typically a strong preference for settling disputes informally and avoiding litigation which would bring the intervention of outsiders. District officials when they come to the village are entertained, and possibly bribed, with a view to minimizing the damage that might be done.[^5] The same ethos is apparent even in the relatively open northern Thai village. The headman is expected to, and does, fail to report a whole series of activities for which licenses would be required, such as lumbering, butchering, distilling, and gambling. He under-reports landholding to reduce taxes and “boasts about incorrect reports that help the village.”[^6] In northeast Thailand the very word for politics means “things in or about the city” and the assumption is that in all important matters of concern to villagers the “government has no right to involve itself unless requested by citizens.”[^7] No doubt this attitude is the legacy of a long and rich historical experience which has found its way into folk sayings and which suggests that government is to be feared and avoided. Particular headmen may, of course, find it in their interest to violate local opinion, but it is clear that they do so at the expense of their local reputation. While villagers must live in a wider polity which makes claims on their resources and intrudes into their lives, they “look upon their own officials primarily as buffers between themselves and the frightening heights of higher government bureaucracy.”[^8] Their stance might be described as one of moderate autonomy, in part negotiated, in part maintained by dissimulation.

Nowhere is the social reality of the village more evident than in the moral distinctions between insiders and outsiders. Within the community there is a pattern of finely grained mutual reciprocities which govern social relations and which are enforced by the sanctions of local approval or censure. Outsiders, though they must be treated circumspectly if they are powerful, are beyond this moral circle and are dealt with cautiously and according to criteria of self-interest. Charity, for example, is an intra-village affair. Better-off villagers are under some pressure to help out their indigent neighbors and kinsmen and to contribute to local religious functions, both of which enhance their prestige, but no one would dream of bestowing charity on a stranger from another village. The value of local charity is obvious from Gourou’s account of a village in North Vietnam in which only the even distribution of hunger during a famine prevented anyone from dying.[^9] Hunger was not, however, spread evenly across villages.

Inasmuch as the crucial problem of peasant economics is that of subsistence or food supply, one would expect that localism would concern itself above all with subsistence rights. The moral economy of localism, in this sense, appears to take two forms.[^10] First, within the village it is generally assumed that, when the resources of villagers allow, every family ought to be provided a subsistence niche in the local economy. This is by no means a radically egalitarian notion; it does not assert that all should be equal but rather that all should be provided for. The second form of local subsistence rights deals with the community’s relationship with the outside world. In this sphere, the assumption is that the village has a right to the resources (e.g., land, forests, pasture) which it has traditionally used and that claims on local resources are only admissible after the usual subsistence needs of the village have been met. Just as great tradition religion encounters local religious traditions, so do the state and outside economic forces confront local imperatives with which they may clash. The first principle may be seen at work in the social sanctions which militate against the selling or renting of land to outsiders. Gourou reports that Tonkinese villagers “bent every effort to prevent a stranger from buying a piece of land; this tendency still exists and, in most cases, a person exposes himself to cruel disappointment if he buys land in a commune in which he was not born. The villagers band together to prevent the dispossession of one of their fellow villagers.”[^11]

On Java it is reported that a landowner who rented his land to town merchants who, in turn, brought in outside laborers was deeply resented by villagers.[^12] Even where land was more abundant, as in Lower Burma, landlords who imported tenants from a distance were in fear of physical retaliation.[^13] The principle of according priority to local needs was, of course, increasingly violated as the colonial state and capitalist economic relations penetrated the countryside. The important point for our purpose, however, is that there existed a normative order within the village which resisted these incursions.

Many of these same economic “rights” were strongly in evidence in pre-capitalist Europe as well. English villages, for example, actually had ordinances forbidding strangers to come and glean on local land and, in the early nineteenth century, we find folk songs which vilify landowners who hire harvest labor from afar.[^14] In much the same spirit, local custom in some areas of France banned the replacement of the sickle with the scythe in harvesting for fear it would reduce the work available for villagers.[^15]

The basis of the local village economy in Southeast Asia and elsewhere was not only its cultivated lands but also the local subsistence resources to which it traditionally laid claim. Depending on the local economy, these resources might include pasture, woodland, and fishing areas. Rights to these resources were considered to be collective village rights, although it was often the poor of the community who had the greatest stake in maintaining them. From the perspective of local custom, such rights taken together defined prerogatives that could not legitimately be breached by the state or by private landowners. The reaction of the peasantry to impending encroachment suggests how vital they were for subsistence.

The Saminist movement on Java in the early twentieth century is one of the many Southeast Asian examples of the defense of local subsistence rights. Peasants in the Rembang area had taken wood and charcoal from nearby forests for generations. When forest officers of the colonial regime acted to bar them from cutting wood to conserve the watershed, they reacted by declaring that “land, water, and wood are the property of all” and insisted “on what they took to be their prescriptive rights.”[^16] There followed a one-sided confrontation between little tradition prerogatives and colonial law in which the Saminist villagers attempted in vain to defend their access to the forest.

The political creed of the Saminists may perhaps be best understood as a form of _little tradition nationalism_ which rejected all outside interference in the affairs of the village. Thus, Saminists repudiated the Islamic solemnization of marriages and funerals and the fees associated with it. They refused to pay the new colonial taxes imposed upon them, although they might make voluntary “gifts.” They resisted new schools and school fees as well as the _prijaji_ bureaucrats who administered them. As far as possible, they attempted to remain outside the cash economy with all its attendant perils. Against an intrusive colonial state, the Saminists championed a form of folk anarchism which accepted the primacy of local custom and the closed economy.

Elsewhere in Southeast Asia, the defense of local economic rights also played a prominent role in peasant movements. The loss or leasing of village common land to outsiders in North and Central Vietnam and in East and Central Java was a constant source of peasant protest through much of the colonial era. Forest access, after head taxes, constituted a major issue behind the famous Saya San Rebellion which broke out in Burma in 1930. A document seized in connection with the revolt declared that “although the twelve kinds of timber together with precious minerals came into existence for the use of Burmans, they are prohibited from picking up the smallest splinter, even the size of a toothpick or earstud.”[^17] The second stated purpose of the secret societies formed by Saya San and his confederates was, accordingly, “to offer civil resistance against oppressive forest laws which deprived villagers of the free use of bamboo and timber for domestic purposes.”[^18] In an equally bloody uprising in Central Vietnam at about the same time, new forest regulations were cited as a major irritant. “If they [peasants] accept the tax for state forests, they do not understand the intervention of the state _in village forests_.”[^19]

Resistance to taxes, which was the major cause of most peasant rebellions in colonial Southeast Asia, implied a similar assertion of local economic rights. To follow the progress of colonial administration is to record the imposition of a host of new revenue measures—taxes on heads, on land, on marketing, on salt, on alcohol, on timber. Many of these taxes were without precedent and inspired a certain hysteria that all customary economic activities might be taxed.[^20] After a good crop, such new obligations might be silently borne, but when villagers were hard-pressed they were unwilling to grant the legitimacy of outside claims to their subsistence resources by acquiescing peacefully. Their defiance of these claims is evident both in the coercion often needed to collect them and in tax protests. Not only did the new tax regime and forest regulations violate customary village rights, but they also violated the little tradition principle that local subsistence needs take precedence over any external claim.

The pattern of conflict described here bears a marked resemblance to the historical conflict between the local economy of the peasantry and the incursions of the state and the money economy in Europe, and well it might, since the process of commercialization and the creation of the nation-state have been the assailants of the little tradition everywhere. Bloch, for example, writes movingly of the ferocity with which the French peasantry defended its traditional right to glean and to graze animals on the post-harvest stubble against the attacks of landlords and the state in the eighteenth century.[^21] Such traditional rights extended as well to the question of renewal of tenure when landlords sought to replace local tenants with outsiders or to alter substantially the terms of rental. “Both landlord and [outside] tenant were likely to pay dearly for their infringement of what the peasant community regarded as their rights; whether it was boycott, theft, murder, ‘fire and sword,’ no punishment was considered too great.”[^22] Restrictions on hunting, fishing, and the gathering of forest products—especially important in times of dearth—were similarly resisted for “the feeling that wild places and water, untouched by human hand, could not be lawfully appropriated by an individual was deep-rooted in man’s primitive social conscience.”[^23] “The result was a considerable crop of offenses against the forest laws, not to mention breaches of the laws relating to fishing and hunting.”[^24] Wherever the little tradition of customary subsistence rights clashed with the desire of the state or with the imperatives of the market, one could find a popular tradition of “lawlessness” or, better stated, a vigorous defense of unwritten local law.

The defense of established economic prerogatives is a constant in English agrarian history until at least the mid-nineteenth century as well. During the English Civil War, the Levellers and their more radical off-shoot the Diggers saw themselves as the upholders of the customary right to a living from the commons against the assaults of enclosure.[^25] Rights to wood and game were also important to the rural poor as late as 1850, when one could no longer call the landless labor force of rural England a peasantry. The principal source of conflict between landlords and tenants centered in the game laws, and poaching was a popular crime which amounted to the assertion of a natural right.[^26]

In one form or another, this struggle has been fought out in thousands of villages throughout the Third World in the twentieth century, with the peasantry generally losing. It is a constant source of tension between the hill peoples of Southeast Asia and their lowland rulers. In Mexico, the right to communal land was the _casus belli_ between the peasants of Morelos under Zapata and the sugar barons. No one has captured the moral tone of the conflict better than Oscar Lewis’ informant Pedro Martinez, a one-time soldier with the Zapatista forces:

At first I was an ordinary _thacololero_, planting corn on the communal hillside, but then the Forestry Department began to interfere and wouldn’t let us work. They said the forest land was a national park and we couldn’t make clearings just anywhere. _Now we had to have a permit to do what our ancestors did!_[^27]

In this particular instance, although the village was ready to fight to defend its own law, the forest officer was successfully bribed and allowed the planting to continue.

This brings us to one final point about the politics of peasant localism. The rights of the little tradition are almost invariably _local_ and they are defended as often against other villages as against the state or landlords. The very particularism of the little tradition has two important implications. First, it means that, by itself, the village lacks the institutional means for a direct confrontation with a vastly more powerful great tradition. The peasantry constitutes a local society or, at best, a county society, while elites are linked together at the provincial and national level. While confrontations may nevertheless occur, the historic strength of the little tradition has resided in dissimulation, foot-dragging, and passive non-compliance. One might even call this kind of Brechtian tenacity the normal pattern of class struggle for the peasantry.[^28] Second, it means that the peasantry is, by itself, illequipped, in terms of both knowledge and interest, to sustain a national struggle for broad goals. Thus, most peasant movements or armies are coalitions of local groups which, like Zapata’s forces, operate locally, champion local issues, and are relatively indifferent to national issues except as they affect the fortunes of the local struggle. The rural anarchist collectives in Spain during the Civil War illustrate much the same spirit. As impressive as their local performance was, it was enormously difficult to persuade them to help other villages, let alone be generous with food and money for the men at the front.[^29] While the moral boundaries of the little tradition are what give it its local staying-power, it is strategically no match for the great tradition.

**_Syncretism_**

Just as the forms of great tradition religion are more easily absorbed into the little tradition than the meanings attached to them by doctrine, so are the forms of elite politics more readily absorbed than their formal meanings. At the village level these meanings are transformed into a syncretic whole that reflects local history, custom, and social structure. Whether we look at rituals such as elections, at radical or conservative social ideologies, at party labels, or even at revolution, we are normally unable to infer local meaning and experience without an appreciation of the particular small societies into which such forms are incorporated. Thus, depending on the local context the Communist Party of Indonesia might appear in varying local guises. In one village it might represent the desire of plantation workers for higher wages, in another it might express a cultural opposition to Islam, in another it might take the form of an antagonism between peasants and the bureaucracy, and in still another it might simply represent one pole of a struggle between family factions.

Something of this process of transformation may be seen in what happens to abstractions such as “class” within the village setting. To be sure, class distinctions are frequently recognized and important means of ordering local experience. But they are likely to be so strongly suffused by a variety of other ways of experiencing social reality that they offer an indifferent guide to the phenomenology of the little tradition. Unlike urbanites who may know only the class affiliation of someone they meet, the villager lives in a world of diffuse whole-person relationships; he knows the biography, family, and peculiarities of everyone within the community. The very proximity of the face-to-face society virtually defies stereotyping.[^30] As Berger and Luckmann point out, class tends to disappear at the local level where people are perceived richly and where classness does not begin to exhaust an individual’s persona as it might with a stranger.[^31] There is typically a large gap between the concreteness of the local social milieu and the stereotyped others beyond the horizon of direct experience. The gap is so marked that Strickon has persuasively argued that members of a folk society may employ two models of stratification depending on the content of action: one for the local arena and the other for the wider society.[^32]

Any political idea or artifact transferred from the great tradition to the little tradition is also likely to undergo a metamorphosis in meaning and usage not unlike what has happened to the saints, communion, and the rosary in folk Catholicism. Consider, for example, the arrival of a candidate for election together with his entourage in a village. Such an event has often been experienced by villagers not so much as an opportunity to assess the candidate and his program but rather as an occasion for entertainment—an unscheduled local festival—at which the candidate provides the entertainment and foots the bill.[^33] The objects associated with an electoral campaign may likewise take on heterodox meanings in the little tradition. Thus the amulets and handkerchiefs distributed by the party of Field Marshal Pibun in the 1957 Thai elections were deemed to have magic powers and were highly prized by villagers all out of proportion to their intrinsic worth.[^34] A similar phenomenon was noted with respect to the red membership cards given to Sarekat Islam adherents prior to the 1926–27 uprisings in West Java. The cards were immediately accorded a magical significance; they exempted one from the poll tax and became a token of membership in a cult with mysterious powers. Without stretching matters much, it would appear that ideology itself may often be experienced by peasants, and not only peasants, as a kind of magic charm, an esoteric religious knowledge that is capable, by itself, of transforming the world.[^35]

The political party itself arrives in the village not as an abstract institution, but in the form of very concrete individuals embedded in the local social structure. For this reason it takes on a local meaning in line with its place in that structure. Thus, in the same Thai elections discussed above, a vote for the ruling party was, among other things, a vote for a community leader who, it happened, was a distant cousin of the bodyguard of the Minister of Culture.[^36] In Burma, the national “Clean” and “Stable” factions of the AFPEL Party were, at the village level, represented by local branches which more or less followed the fault lines of village factional histories. There was typically no way of inferring the sociology of local support from the programs of the national faction. If a local notable urged a vote for the “Stable” AFPEL, his kinsmen, friends, and retainers would follow his lead, while another notable, together with his entourage, would vote for the “Clean” AFPEL. If the village was not split, it might back a single party favored by an influential man.[^37] In any event, it was the local social structure which was decisive, not the national parties and what they stood for. This tendency toward what we might call political syncretism was of course abetted by the parties themselves, which needed votes. Local campaigning was often reduced to a race between various party brokers to line up the support of whatever local influentials they could, trusting that their clientele would be brought along more or less automatically.[^38] Thus, within the village party labels were appropriated to serve ends that often had only local significance—a significance having little or nothing to do with the parties as national institutions.[^39]

The process of parochialization we have been describing often applies with equal force to radical parties which, at least nominally, embrace a program of revolutionary change. The history of the PKI (Communist Party of Indonesia) from roughly 1951 to 1965 is illustrative. Party “access to the peasantry seems to have been predominantly via channels of patronage, kinship, and traditional deference.”[^40] Leaders of the party recognized this problem and regularly denounced the deviations of paternalism or _bapakism_. As one observer noted:

This selection of the well-to-do, the respectable, and the traditionally oriented _abangan_ as left-wing political leaders in a rural village was not unique to Tamansari. I found it to be a consistent pattern in the left-wing dominated villages that were a part of the traditional rural society, the exceptions occurring in villages of ex-plantation workers.[^41]

By 1955, when peasants became a majority of PKI membership, party leaders were actually complaining that local wealthy elements were obstructing party decisions.[^42] The local structure of the PKI—its village meaning—had thus created formidable obstacles to class militancy.

The discontinuity between little tradition parochialism and national politics implies that issues which may occupy the energies of national or provincial figures may either evaporate altogether or be much disfigured at the village level. Writing of villagers in Burma, Nash declares bluntly that “the national issues are not relevant for them.”[^43] More commonly perhaps, issues are simply transformed and syncretized as we move from the center to the periphery in the fashion Bailey has described for India:

there is no homogeneity at all levels; the issues which are at stake in state politics have to be translated into something else at the constituency level and have to be translated yet again at the village level. For example, the Ganatantra–Congress conflict at the state level appears in the guise of rural policies…in the constituencies of K. District it appeared as a dynastic dispute; in Bisipara [village] it was translated into caste conflict.[^44]

It is this discontinuity which helps explain why, for example, nationalism, in its narrow construction as the transfer of power, has historically had a very limited appeal in village Southeast Asia.[^45] Where nationalism did sink deep rural roots, as in Vietnam, either it was linked to issues of surpassing local importance such as land distribution or taxes or else it took on a millennarian tone in accord with elements of folk religion quite at variance with what the nationalist intelligentsia had in mind.

The shift in meaning from the great to the little tradition is often as marked in rebellion and revolution as it is in “normal” electoral politics. Thus a revolutionary intelligentsia hoping to establish a socialist state may discover that its local supporters have different goals in mind, for example the assassination of a hated official, the recovery of land for private tilling, the pursuit of factional advantage, or even the destruction of the state itself and the establishment of a religious utopia. At times local goals may be in accord with elite visions; at other times, the goals may be unrelated or actually opposed. As Kartodirdjo noted in the case of Sarekat Islam: “As the organization developed mass roots, it was sometimes used by the peasantry, as in the Tjimareme affair, for purposes of their own, in some respects quite remote from those of its top leaders.”[^46]

**_Revolution in the revolution_**

In fact there is good reason to believe that within every great tradition rebellion with mass support there is also a little tradition revolt that threatens to usurp that rebellion for its parochial ends. This “revolution in the revolution” is typically denounced by radical elites as adventurism, deviation, or anarchy. Just as often, of course, it is the radical elite which attempts to usurp a rebellion begun by peasants and to put it to ends which its supporters do not recognize and, indeed, might disavow. One may even detect an additive, temporal dimension to these “layers” of rebellion akin to syncretism in religion. That is, the goals of purely little tradition rebellions have something of an ahistorical, permanent quality to them, like animism. When self-consciously revolutionary elites emerge to link up with these older patterns, they tend to add a new dimension to the revolt but not to eliminate the parochial forms in the process.

The Hukbalahap rebellion in the Philippines provides a nearly classical example of this tension. While the Huk leadership wanted to establish a socialist state and break the American hold over the Philippine economy, the peasantry, it appears, was pursuing other goals closer to home. Even on the land issue, formulated with peasant interests in mind, there was a gap, as party official Jesus Lava explained: “They [peasants] only wanted to increase their shares and improve the tenancy system. It was the Party that propagandized the slogan ‘Land for the Landless!’, it did not come from the peasants.”[^47] When it came to nationalist economic issues, the Huks and the Communist Party were less successful in getting out the vote against a neo-colonial trade agreement with the United States than they were in organizing over the issues of tenancy or police repression.[^48] This is not to say that the Central Luzon peasantry was less “radical” than the Communists. On the contrary, the peasantry, in self-defense, began the rebellion more or less spontaneously, with the Communist Party dragging its feet until it had no choice but to endorse the insurrection. The evidence indicates only that there were two revolutions going on simultaneously and that they were never completely integrated.

The parallel between religious and political syncretism seems striking in this context. Just as Burmese villagers may employ great tradition Buddhism to serve here-and-now animist purposes, so do villagers take advantage of elite politics for parochial ends. In the Thai election mentioned above, the ringing majority that villagers accorded the ruling party was hardly an endorsement of its policies or, to the extent it had one, its ideology:

They [peasants] dealt with the occasion very much in bread-and-butter terms, viewing it as a device for getting something immediate and concrete out of the government…For these villagers the election was primarily an opportune occasion to get a new ritual hall for their temple.[^49]

The exploitation was, to be sure, mutual, for elites were counting on the vague promise of a new ritual hall to swing the vote in Bang Suaj their way. Much of the literature on electoral politics in Southeast Asia fits the same pattern of machine politics in which the cement of the electoral coalition is provided by short-term material benefits.[^50] Where the social links between the great and little traditions are tenuous, where there is no stable basis of mutuality, and where each represents a different universe of meaning and values, it is perhaps to be expected that concrete material exchanges should represent the basis of a limited collaboration.[^51] As Bailey observes for India:

These [electoral] ties are instrumental; they are used by the villagers to gain their ends in the village and by the elite to gain its ends in the elite arena…the elite arena and the village arena are, for their respective protagonists, ways of life; the constituency is merely an instrument for the preservation of those ways of life.[^52]

One writer has taken this parochial opportunism as the basis of a theory of peasant political participation, claiming that, initially at least, peasants “respond to the immediate material trade-offs they can garner in exchange for their organizational membership.”[^53] While this is not the whole story, it is certainly an important truth—one recognized by conservative and radical elites alike. As the head of the PKI, D. N. Aidit, advised: “The first step to be taken in our work among the peasants is to assist them in the struggle for their everyday needs, for the achievement of their partial demands.”[^54]

**_Profanations_**

The popular religion and culture of peasants in a complex society are not only a syncretized, domesticated, and localized variant of larger systems of thought and doctrine. They contain almost inevitably the seeds of an alternative symbolic universe—a universe which in turn makes the social world in which peasants actually live less than completely inevitable. Much of this radical symbolism can only be explained as a cultural reaction to the situation of the peasantry _as a class_. In fact, this symbolic opposition represents the closest thing to class consciousness in pre-industrial agrarian societies. It is as if those who find themselves at the bottom of the social heap develop cultural forms which promise them the dignity, respect, and economic comfort which they lack in the world as it is. A real pattern of exploitation dialectically produces its own symbolic mirror image within folk culture.

Much of this symbolic opposition is not socially organized but finds a fragmented expression in the folk songs, proverbs, humor, popular theater, and folktales of peasant culture. In Vietnam, as Chesneaux has pointed out: “To every classical sentence one easily finds a retort in the folk proverbs and sayings. The popular theatre, chéo, was essentially satirical, always casting the mandarin and the notable in a bad light.”[^55] Nor is it just a question of symbolic resistance and satire. There is often an imagined future (generally linked to a mythical or real past), as in this _dünca_ lyric also from Vietnam:

Would that no one were hungry

Would that joy was in the hearts of all…

Would that no more unjust taxes were paid

Would that ancient customs were restored.[^56]

On occasion, in Vietnam and elsewhere, this latent possibility within the folk tradition might find overt expression in millennarian religious activity of either a quietistic or violent form. The prophets of such sects, together with their peasant following, generally aspired to a new secular order which was revolutionary in its implications. Religion and politics were joined in a utopian vision. The most striking feature of such sects was that, unlike Buddhism, Islam, or Christianity which focus doctrinally on a reward in the next life, they entertained quite worldly ambitions for salvation on this earth. Just as Buddhism is often put to mundane, animist uses within the little tradition, so is the salvation message of great tradition religion often transformed into a message of secular liberation here-and-now by its folk adherents.

This is not to say that such radical religious visions are the motivating force of all or even most peasant movements. On the contrary, many peasant struggles for lower rents, fewer taxes, and local autonomy may be seen as fairly straightforward attempts to defend or establish rights within the context of an accepted social order and hierarchy—as a variety of peasant “trade-union consciousness,” if you will. What I am asserting, however, is that there is frequently a religious charter or basis for more far-reaching, revolutionary goals which may, under certain circumstances, form the ideational foundation for peasant movements.

The radical vision to which I refer is strikingly uniform despite the enormous variations in peasant cultures and the different great traditions of which they partake. Fundamentally, it invokes a religious profanation of the existing secular order—a reversal of things as they are. In this respect, the radical vision is reflexive; its point of departure is the pattern of exploitation as it is experienced. One might even be able, working backwards, to deduce the actual structure of social relations in society from the utopian vision created to serve as its mirror image.

At the risk of overgeneralizing, it is possible to describe some common features of this reflexive symbolism. It nearly always implies a society of brotherhood in which there will be no rich and no poor, in which no distinctions of rank and status (save perhaps those between believers and non-believers) will exist. Where religious institutions are experienced as justifying inequities, the abolition of rank and status may well include the elimination of religious hierarchy in favor of communities of equal believers. Property is typically, though not always, to be held in common and shared. All unjust claims to taxes, rents, and tribute are to be nullified. The envisioned utopia may also include a self-yielding and abundant nature as well as a radically transformed human nature in which greed, envy, and hatred will disappear. While the earthly utopia is thus an anticipation of the future, it often harks back to a mythic Eden from which mankind has fallen away.

The reflexive nature of such folk utopias is apparent from the fact that they, above all, represent a world in which “the last shall be first.” The following Vietnamese folk song captures the central idea:

The son of the king becomes king.

The son of the pagoda caretaker knows only

how to sweep with the leaves of the banyan tree

When the people rise up,

the son of the king, defeated, will go

sweep the pagoda.[^57]

That this vision is not simply a solace in this life—a symbolic escape—is indicated by the fact that it has provided the normative structure for countless peasant rebellions. On the lips of Pedro Martinez, Oscar Lewis’ peasant informant, it is a symbolic preparation for necessary revolutionary violence:

I believe that all the revolutions that we see on this earth come to us already destined from up above. The _next revolution_ is already written…Since Zapata, many have tried but nothing happens. Everything is crushed because God has not given the word yet. Then suddenly we’ll see the revolution of the poor against the rich in Mexico. Not now, I don’t think, but it will come. I can’t say who will be the leader, but it must be someone.[^58]

What we see here is the appropriation of religious symbolism in the service of class interests. It is virtually impossible not to read into the popular heresies and millennarian expectations of the peasantry a pattern of class aspirations and desires which constitute a revolutionary message. Little tradition syncretism, in this context, represents a reworking, a selective appropriation, of those elements of a religious doctrine that answer the needs of a subordinate class. To be sure, the themes of patience, humility, and salvation in the next life are also a part of the little tradition and, at times, they may predominate. But at other times, the teachings of compliance seem to evaporate and give way to the themes of liberation and revolution. The reason why such themes of liberation bear a remarkable resemblance to one another across cultural and religious traditions can only be explained by the similarities in circumstances which peasants face as a class, as an occupational group, and as a social status. Thus many of the features that one might employ in a description or definition of the peasantry—social subordination, taxes and land rents, a precarious subsistence—all reappear, negated or inverted, in its millennarian beliefs. Similarly, the major transformations which have done violence to peasant life—the imposition of law over custom, the incursions of the market and agrarian capitalism—also reappear as part of the definition of the present evil in millennarian thought.

_Europe_

The appropriation of symbols by a class can be seen in the classic, almost diagnostic, case of the myth of the “Tsar-Deliverer” among the Russian peasantry.[^59] In its various forms, the myth declares that the “true-Tsar” is wandering or in hiding after having been spirited away as an infant and that he will one day return to save the peasants and set things aright. This true-Tsar became virtually a symbolic projection of the desires and needs of the peasantry for land, for relief from taxes and from oppressive overlords. When the actual Tsar was perceived as evil, he was typically declared a “false-Tsar”—a usurper who would be replaced by the Tsar-Deliverer. Any successful rebel acting in the interests of the peasantry might then be proclaimed the true-Tsar by the peasantry. While the symbol of the Tsar might at other times be used to appeal to paternalism and hierarchy, the myth of the Tsar-Deliverer was full of revolutionary content.[^60] The symbolic meaning of the true-Tsar was nothing more and nothing less than the peasant vision of justice—a vision that might shift from region to region and over time as the situation of the peasantry itself shifted. The myth of the Tsar was anything but a belief imposed by elites and the church in the service of social order; it was rather the cultural property of the peasantry as a class.

The belief in a just, avenging king who will right wrongs is, of course, not confined to Russia, or even to Europe. In the famous Wat Tyler uprising of 1381 in England, peasants held a vision of a social order in which all the intermediate social ranks between peasants and the king would be eliminated. Their slogan was: “with King Richard and the commons.”[^61] Nearly five centuries later, participants in the Captain Swing Rebellion which touched many of the same counties believed the king was on their side inasmuch as they were acting to restore traditional justice.[^62]We shall see how comparable beliefs permeate folk religion in Southeast Asia. It is worth noting, however, that rebels who may begin with other purposes in mind may find themselves taken for “the just king” by peasants with their own millennarian vision of justice. Prince Dipa Nagara, a leader in the Java War of 1825–30, was assimilated into Javan prophesy and myth in just this fashion. Sensitive to the fact that he had been transformed and deified by his following, he elected to honor the role into which he had been cast, declaring: “I can’t act differently, the masses at large have taken possession of me.”[^63]

In the West, the belief in the return of the just king was firmly linked to the Judeo-Christian apocalyptic tradition.[^64] This tradition has a basis, of course, in the scriptures, particularly the Book of Daniel and the Book of Revelation, although it drew heavily on Hellenistic Judaism (the Sibylline books) as well. Despite its many variants, the apocalyptic tradition foresaw a time of surpassing evil dominated by the archenemy of God (the Antichrist) who would be defeated in the last days by the hosts of Christ, who, in turn, would establish a millennium of perfect happiness and justice. Once the church had become, in the fourth century, the official church of the Empire, the apocalyptic tradition was declared “a superstitious aberration” by the Council of Ephesus. “Nevertheless…even though official doctrine no longer had any place for it, it persisted in the obscure underworld of popular religion.”[^65]

The political danger which the chiliastic myth represented for kings, princes, and archbishops was self-evident. “Above all any ruler who could be regarded as a tyrant was apt to take on the features of Antichrist”[^66] and arouse expectations of the Second Coming. _If theology could be used to validate the secular order, popular religion, in the guise of millennarian expectations, could be used to delegitimize that order_. Particular kings (usually deceased) were appropriated, on the pattern of the Tsar-Deliverer, into this eschatology as just rulers who would usher in the millennium, thus providing a normative basis for rebellion.[^67]

The class elements of the millennarian tradition are perfectly evident from the nature of the utopia which peasants, artisans, and a portion of the lower clergy entertained. First, the hosts of the Antichrist were to be destroyed. For the Taborites of the fifteenth century these included “all lords, nobles, and knights,” who would be “cut down and exterminated in the forests like outlaws,”[^68] as well as town-dwellers, merchants, and absentee landlords. At other times and places they might include tax collectors, higher clergy, and moneylenders. On the ashes of the old order would arise a religious kingdom without taxes, rents, or feudal dues and, above all, without private property. The Taborites anticipated “the return of a lost anarcho-communist order” without rank: “we shall live together as brothers, none shall be subject to another.” A prototypical labor theory of value and the redistribution of income were often a part of this symbolic world: “Princes, ecclesiastical and secular alike, and counts and knights should only possess as much as common folk, then everyone would have enough. The time will have to come when princes and lords will work for their daily bread.”[^69]

Elsewhere the millennium might promise the free use of pasture and woodland. The image of the millennium was, in short, as varied as the needs and aspirations of the peasantry and lower classes required, but it always bore a direct symbolic relationship to the circumstances of their exploitation as a class.

Virtually without exception it was the poor who formed the chosen agents of the Elect. The import of this symbolism was not lost on the official church which, under Pope John XXII (1323), went so far as to declare that the mere assertion of Christ’s poverty was, in itself, a heresy.[^70]

A pattern of radical symbolic dissent from the secular, and often religious, hierarchy of property, rank, and grace is thus at the very core of apocalyptic religion. It is worth emphasizing, however, the ways in which such millennarian themes have explicitly repudiated liberal property regimes and national law (vs local land-tenure and customary law)—forces which have historically undermined the economic and social basis of the little community. The themes we find in the European context reappear in the Southeast Asian millennarian vision.

Community of property is perhaps the major economic theme in the millennarian tradition. It has roots in Christian utopian thinking, as Bloch has observed: “The forms rebellion took (and they were always the same) were also traditional: mystical fantasies; a powerful preoccupation with the primitive egalitarianism of the Gospels, which took hold of humble minds well before the Reformation.”[^71] The notion of common property was not only a part of religious tradition; it was also embedded in the practices of the agrarian poor. In contemporary Spain, for example, the village poor still consider it within their rights to pilfer the property of the rich, reasoning that the surplus of some is unjustifiable in the presence of the want of others.[^72]

During the English Civil War, most of the popular agrarian movements subscribed to one form or another of communalism. Had they succeeded in overwhelming the better organized and more conservative forces of Puritanism, Hill argues, they “might have established communal property.”[^73] The question of property was “the chief issue in the minds of the poorer classes,” who were enthusiastic supporters of calls for “equality in goods and lands” and for a redivision of property at least once a year with this end in mind.[^74] In England and elsewhere such beliefs owed as much to popular history as to popular religion. Winstanley, the popular Digger leader, thus saw communal property both as a restoration “of the pure law or righteousness before the Fall” and as a return to the equality which had prevailed before the Norman Conquest when each family had what it needed for its own subsistence. Such radical egalitarian ideas about property stretch back in English history until at least the fourteenth century.[^75] One might say they constitute a constant, if latent, part of the cultural woodwork of rural England. Their power to mobilize the lower classes, however, was likely to be confined to those historical moments when new economic changes (e.g., the enclosures, famine, market fluctuations) appeared to threaten local subsistence routines.

The theme of common property is indissolubly linked in the little tradition to the question of local custom versus law. A whole host of threatening changes ranging from new taxes, the growth of landed estates, forest restrictions, and debt have come to the peasantry in the guise of new laws and their agents, asserting the claims of the written statute against traditional practice. Law, as it impinges on peasant life, has almost always been the tool of a privileged, literate few which has operated to strip the non-literate majority of its lands, its goods, and its customary rights. Historically, the efforts of centralizing kings to establish a uniform administration and the later creation of the legal framework of the liberal state have provided the context for a utopian vision that repudiates such legal codes as the thinly veiled tyranny of powerful outsiders. Much of the class struggle of the European peasantry has thus historically taken the form of an assertion of customary local law. There is a rich tradition of local support for popular crimes such as poaching, smuggling, pilfering, and even banditry when such crimes were seen as the exercise of a popular right outlawed by statute. To cooperate with the state when such cooperation violates local custom is to betray the community.[^76]

It is little wonder that in this context the millennarian tradition of the peasantry has looked to a social order in which formal law would disappear. In the English Peasant Revolt of 1381, lawyers along with tax collectors were the particular target of peasants desiring to abolish the legal system itself.[^77] A popular ballad from the reign of James II conjures up a society with

No law nor lawyers fees

For everyone does what he please

without judge or jury.[^78]

The Diggers, in common with other radical sects, saw the law as an instrument of oppression: “The law is the fox, poor men are the geese: he pulls off their feathers and feeds upon them.”[^79] In the utopia which Winstanley elaborated, the death penalty would be retained for those “following the trade of lawyer or parson.”[^80] The hatred of written law is also poignantly evident in the frequency with which peasant rebels have destroyed tax rolls and lists of manorial dues in an effort to erase the formal badge of their oppression. Inasmuch as peasants felt that law had substituted the rule of the privileged for the freely consented rule of custom, a new society would have no need for such mystification or tyranny.

As the growth of commerce and markets brought new insecurities and broke the hold of local custom, the utopian vision of the peasantry increasingly anticipated a society in which, as in earlier times, “buying and selling” would disappear. “Buying and selling” were of course associated with all the classical effects of an expanding market economy: the growth of disparities in wealth, concentration of landownership, moneylending, wage labor, and the elimination of customary economic rights. Many of these changes were seen to emanate from the city, the site of markets, speculators, lawyers, and absentee landlords.

The elimination of this threatening, expanded market economy forms an integral part of the radical utopias which appealed to the English peasantry in the seventeenth century. Winstanley’s communist commonwealth would abolish the “buying and selling of land as a condition of human dignity and the practice itself was to be put on a par with murder and rape as requiring capital punishment.”[^81] The market, along with property itself, was seen as part of the Fall which made exploitation possible. Given the fact that the maintenance of established rights to land, labor, and subsistence was the central goal of a great many peasant movements in early modern Europe, it is hardly surprising that the more restricted pre-capitalist economy should constitute an attractive utopian goal.[^82]

It is, in fact, this backward-looking mentality of peasants and artisans which, for Marxists, forms their decisive ideological handicap. As Lukács states it: “Their [the petty bourgeoisie and peasants’] aim, therefore, is not to advance capitalism or to transcend it, but to reverse its action…Their class interest concentrates on symptoms of development and not on development itself.”[^83] This view, however, seems particularly short-sighted. For it is precisely the fact that peasants and artisans have one foot in the pre-capitalist economy that explains why they have provided the mass impetus for so many “forward looking” movements. Their opposition to capitalism, based as it is on a utopian image of an earlier age, is as tenacious, if not more so, as the opposition of a proletariat which has both feet in the new society.

The radical symbolic themes I have described are a consistent part of the cultural equipment of the peasantry and other subaltern classes. Their content and emphases shift to reflect the changing material and social conditions of the peasantry. Thus in one epoch the millennium may mean, above all, the elimination of lords and masters and, in another, the abolition of buying and selling.

For the most part such themes are but an undercurrent, a potential, which lies beneath the surface of a prevailing, if grudging, accommodation with the existing secular and religious order. At times, however, this latent radical vision may become a powerful social myth for which thousands of peasants may be willing to risk everything. The events that seem to trigger this passage from quiescence to arousal are varied, but most involve large-scale crises which, actually or apparently, endanger both the material and cultural well-being of the peasantry. In the apocalyptic Christian tradition of Europe, for example, the millennium was to be preceded by a time of troubles. Famines, the black plague, and other natural disasters served frequently as the backdrop for millennarian expectations. New economic forces and their attendant social disasters might also provide the stimulus. Cohn contends that the geography of millennarian excitement coincides with those regions in which, owing to population growth and economic change, “traditional social bonds were being weakened or shattered and the gap between rich and poor was becoming a chasm.”[^84] Wars, revolutions, invasions, or even crushing new taxes might also provide the catalyst. The civil war in England, Hill reminds us, was a period in which “it would be difficult to exaggerate the strength of millennarian expectations among ordinary people.”[^85] The much-researched millennarian movements of the Pacific islands were in large part a response to the arrival of powerful Europeans with their strange habits and machines, an event which shook the symbolic world of these isolated people to its very foundations. Even elections, among people unfamiliar with them, appear capable of triggering millennarian fantasies.[^86]

Thus, the situations in which millennarian themes are likely to become mobilizing social myths involve not only material distress but also a loss of everyday social meaning as well. Wars, plagues, revolutions, earthquakes, and even elections may appear to destroy the normal categories in which reality is apprehended and organized and thereby provide the social soil for latent millennarian beliefs to become manifest. At such times the prophets and champions of popular themes of religious liberation are apt to attract an enthusiastic following. That these prophets have touched on themes which have a cultural life of their own is suggested by the fact that the movements they initiate so often take on more radical dimensions that escape their control. Luther, Cromwell, Wat Tyler, and dozens of other historical figures have found themselves at the head of movements that resonated more with age-old millennarian hopes than with the instructions of their nominal prophets. Lucien Febvre has brilliantly captured this paradox:

Even during the time when Luther was at his most venturesome…even he failed to satisfy the frantic desire for freedom that animated men of his country and age, and this fact tells us a lot about the mentality of those generations. And just as Luther had his Carlstadt, his Munzer, and his Anabaptists, Calvin at a later date had his Caroli, his spiritual “libertins,” and Nicodemites, for the shake-up that occurred in people’s minds as a result of the great religious crisis of 1520 did not come to a halt in a day or in a year. Even when…the free outpourings of the prophets [were reduced]…to a narrow credo to be learned by heart, how many people went on secretly nourishing the dreams which they were unable to forsake?[^87]

_Southeast Asia_

A popular millennarian tradition is as much a part of the peasant worldview in Southeast Asia as it has been historically in Europe. Despite the variety of religious great traditions—Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity—one uncovers a more radical strain of popular religion that is in stark symbolic opposition to the secular order and promises liberation here-and-now. In a largely Christian country such as the Philippines, millennarian themes bear a family resemblance to Western Christian eschatology, although they may be traced to pre-Christian sources as well. In a Buddhist country such as Burma, a belief in the return of a just king (_setkya min_) who will set things right exists side-by-side with a belief in a Buddha-Deliverer (_Buddha Yaza_) who will usher in the Buddhist millennium. In an Islamic context such as Indonesia, one finds a nearly parallel structure of radical religious beliefs: the older idea of a returning savior-monarch (_Ratu Adil_) and that of an Islamic conqueror (_Mahdi_) who will sweep away the heathen and restore justice. In each case, millennarian beliefs are not merely a reinterpretation of great tradition prophesy but also a symbolic complex rooted in earlier religious traditions which have persisted. The fact that one should uncover such a strikingly similar structure of popular beliefs in cultural and religious contexts so markedly different lends some substance to the claim that millennarian religion is always to be found among the lower classes of a complex agrarian society.

Southeast Asia is at least as rich in millennarian movements as Europe.[^88] The precipitating factors are much the same as in Europe, inasmuch as the Southeast Asian peasantry has experienced many of the same traumatic events stemming from the creation of an intrusive state and the development of a commercialized agrarian economy. Southeast Asian colonial history may be seen, in this context, as a provincial variant of world economic history, although the social dislocation was the more traumatic for being compressed into a shorter span and presided over, until recently, by foreigners. Millennarian themes were most salient in precisely those countries most directly ruled and penetrated by market forces—Burma, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Vietnam. They are least in evidence in areas where the social and economic transformations were slower and less thorough-going—Thailand and, until recently, Laos and Cambodia. In the brief account of millennarian outbreaks given below, the parallels with the European experience will become apparent.

The colonization and Christianization of the Philippines have conspired to produce a history of millennarian sectarianism that is almost without parallel in the Third World. Thanks to the pioneering research of David Sturtevant and Reynaldo Iteto, on which much of the following discussion is based, many of the little tradition movements there have been rescued from the near oblivion of the colonial archives. As early as 1622 in Bohol province, Spanish colonial authorities were faced with religious rebellions of traditional shamans (_babaylones_) and mediums (_catalonans_) who promised a return to a “secure and abundant” life for those who repudiated Catholicism and the Spaniards.[^89] Small-scale apocalyptic movements continued to disturb the colony from time to time throughout the eighteenth and early nineteenth century. All were contained or suppressed with relative ease but, as Sturtevant notes, they “established the broad boundaries of barrio opposition to the Great Tradition.”[^90]

The first large-scale uprising came in 1841 and, like so many subsequent movements with millennarian overtones, it began with the formation of a Catholic lay organization.[^91] Its leader, Apolinario de la Cruz, who had been denied a clerical career by restrictive church policies, founded the Confradia de San Jose which drew many recruits from the southern Luzon provinces of Tabayas, Batangas, and Laguna. When church authorities, fearing its potential for religious and political heresy, stepped in to abolish the organization, the confraternity took on a more threatening demeanor. Assembling 4,000 armed followers, Apolinario and his deputy, who assumed the new name “Purgatorio,” established a local theocracy. Rumors circulated that Apolinario had declared himself “King of the Tagalogs” and “Supreme Pontiff”; he promised believers that the earth would open and swallow enemies of the new creed. After a victorious skirmish, his followers were finally crushed in a bloodbath which took 1,000 lives. Survivors fled to nearby mountains to establish village “Holy-Lands” that became the goal of annual pilgr_resources/books//Decoding Subaltern Politics_ Ideology, Dis - James C. Scott by thousands of lowlanders. Renaming themselves “Colorums” (from _seculorum_), the survivors helped spread folk cults throughout Luzon which were to be implicated in many subsequent rebellions.

Millennarian turmoil was not confined to the Tagalog population. One of the most important uprisings, that of the Guardia de Honor, began in the Ilocano region of northwest Luzon in the late nineteenth century and eventually spread to Central Luzon. As with millennarian movements in general, this uprising took place in the context of political and economic convulsions: the war for independence and landgrabbing and commercialization in the Ilocos region. Begun under clerical auspices to promote the worship of the Virgin Mary in 1872, the Guardia de Honor rapidly took on a life of its own among the peasantry. Pre-Christian rites were added and Julian Baltasar, “a powerful anitero (animist) and an accomplished faith-healer,” became its charismatic leader together with his blind wife. He was called “Apo Laqui” (figuratively, “Male-God”) and his wife “Goddess.” Baltasar announced, in 1886, the coming Judgment Day on which the corrupt would drown and the virtuous would be spared. The appointed day came and went without the promised flood and, a few years later, in 1897, Baltasar and his wife died. The movement, however, did not die; it was revived by Baltasar’s deputy, Antonio Valdes, who christened his sect army _los agraviados_ (the oppressed).

Under Valdes, the Guardia de Honor became the self-appointed defender of the church _against_ the gentry-led Philippine revolutionaries, the Katipuneros. Its activities, however, reflected the class basis of its members’ grievances. Sect armies swept through towns in Tarlac, Pampanga, Pangasinan, and Nueva Ecija, sacking government buildings, burning all records and, above all, attacking the homes of the landowning gentry. The class import of this revolution is captured in this telegram from the elite of Tarlac to Katipunero leader Aguinaldo: “Many rich people here urgently ask the creation of a…body of volunteers…formed of trustworthy and prominent persons…for the pursuit of robbers…We have the money and only need rifles.”[^92] General Otis of the American Expeditionary Force was especially struck by the religious fervor sweeping Luzon and reported that “self-declared prophets were proclaiming new creeds…quite markedly variable in origin and nature.”[^93]

By 1900, roughly 10,000 followers were encamped at a remote village in Pangasinan which was dubbed Cabarvan (“Renewal”). Described as an assemblage of fanatics and robbers, the town became an armed theocracy with thousands of pilgrims arriving with their worldly goods. Followers were fed from communal granaries and lists of sinners, especially the landowning gentry, were compiled. On the appointed day the lands of the corrupt would be divided equally among true believers. This millennarian anticipation and attacks on neighboring haciendas were encouraged by Valdes and two aides who were collectively worshipped as the “Trinity,” while the now dead Baltasar was referred to as “God Almighty.” The rebellion was, as one might expect, unceremoniously crushed by American troops and its leaders executed, although the Guardia’s religious heritage remained alive in local heterodox sects to spark later uprisings.

In the turmoil generated by the war of independence, which claimed as many as 200,000 lives, millennarian sects flourished. Between 1902 and 1906 the Constabulary faced a host of militant cults variously named _Pulajanes_ and _Colorados_ (Reds), _Cazadores_ (Hunters), _Babailanes_ (Priests), _Santos Ninos_ (Holy Children), _Hermanos del Tercero Orden_ (Brothers of the Third Order), _Soldados Militantes de la Iglesia_ (Militant Soldiers of the Church), _Dios-Dios, Cruz-Cruz_, and _Anting-Anting_. An American observer noted in his journal that: “It seems impossible for these people not to be drawn by misguided leaders into a sort of religious frenzy.”[^94] The utopia which these sects sought was defined above all in reflexive terms: “there would be no more labor, no taxes, no jails, no constabulary.”[^95] Members of the Santa Iglesia sect in Central Luzon predicted a rain of fire to be followed by a utopia and, in anticipation, confiscated wealth from landowners for distribution to needy peasants.

After the colonial regime became firmly entrenched, the level of millennarian activity subsided but did not disappear. By the mid-1920s, however, agrarian conditions once again provided fertile soil for utopian sects. On Negros and Panay in the late 1920s a millennarian cult led by Florencio Entrencherado proclaimed a coming day of judgment “when the poor will be ordered to kill the rich,” and organized the poor into cooperative work battalions suggestive of a rural Owenism.[^96] The new state which would follow the holocaust would reduce taxes by 90 percent and provide free legal, educational, and medical services. In the midst of the depression, a mass-based reformist movement in southern Luzon, the Sakdals, veered in a millennarian direction as its peasant followers infused it with their own worldview. Local Sakdalistas assumed the new order would mean common ownership of land and an end to taxes. As Sturtevant sees it, “village zealots, in fact, were well on their way to transforming a bourgeois challenge to the Nationalista oligarchy into rampant patriotism of a millennarian variety.”[^97] The mass movement, much to the dismay of many of its _illustrado_ leaders, became something of a “revolution in the revolution” and ended in a tragic bloodbath on May 2, 1935.

Throughout the early twentieth century there were many peasant sects which endorsed a more quietistic form of millennarianism. The Rizalista cults, named after the great nationalist hero Jose Rizal, were a striking example of such religious themes of liberation.[^98] Rizal, much like the Tsar among the Russian peasantry, was appropriated by poor Filipinos as a savior upon whom they might project their aspirations. The belief of each cult varied, for it was no unified movement, but there were some striking parallels throughout the archipelago. First, there was an implicit rejection of Catholicism. Rizal was believed to have been appointed the national savior by Bathala (the Malay god worshipped by the pre-conquest Tagologs). He became, in effect, the Tagolog Christ who would come again to redeem his people. Centers of cult worship, as in other indigenous religions of Southeast Asia, were often located in forests near sacred mountains and hills. The beliefs of the scattered sectarians recapitulated the classic themes of liberation and symbolic reversal. Sect leaders preached “the equality of everyone” and proclaimed that “men shall be free from oppression and slavery.”[^99] While awaiting the return of Rizal, local believers founded new communities in which they attempted to put their doctrine of sharing and communal ownership into practice. Inspired by the conviction that when Rizal came “there would be a time when rich and poor would be alike,” the sect passed, by turns, from quietism into rebellion.[^100] Local sects varied along classic little tradition lines; beliefs and ritual diverged from place to place and over time in accordance with local genius and the situation of their peasant members. What they all shared, however, was a repudiation of the official church and an aspiration for an eventual reversal of an oppressive secular order.

In Burma, one finds a dissident millennarian tradition that bears a marked family resemblance to its counterpart in the Philippines. This parallelism is instructive for it suggests that the nature of the dominant religion, in this case Theravada Buddhism, is less crucial for predicting the character of religious dissent than the socioeconomic situation in which the peasantry finds itself.

The idiom, to be sure, is different. Burmese millennarian beliefs center around the _Buddha Mettaya_ or _Buddha Yaza_ who will return when injustice and irreligion prevail to vanquish the forces of evil and usher in an ideal Buddhist society. This tradition is joined to a specifically Burmese myth of the _Setkya Min_, a just king (often a real historical figure, perhaps a nat) who will liberate his people. Despite the culturally and religiously distinctive idiom, however, the language of liberation was, as we shall see, recognizably the same.

It is almost certain that the millennarian tradition in Burma extends far back into pre-colonial history. Most of the evidence we have, however, dates from the colonial period when, owing to the massive economic changes in the agrarian sector, millennarian proclivities reached new heights. Sarkisyanz, for example, records at least eight major movements between 1839 and 1926, the last of which brought together 20,000 followers of a hermit monk claiming to be the _Setkya Min_.[^101] Countless smaller sects which posed less of a threat to public order undoubtedly escaped official notice.

By far the largest and most investigated millennarian movement in modern Burmese history, however, was the Saya San Rebellion of 1930, named after its leader.[^102] The movement began in Lower Burma where a frontier-capitalist, agrarian economy had run its full course and where many indebted Burmese tenants and smallholders had been ruined by the world economic crisis. Its nominal leader, Saya San, was a prominent Buddhist monk, widely known throughout the countryside for his traditional medical skills and his alchemy. The grid of extra-local coordination for the revolt was provided by many local monks who accepted Saya San as the _Setkya Min_ and the new utopia which he proclaimed. As in other such movements, the utopia in question was largely a negation of the oppressions under which the Burmese peasantry labored. Private property was to be abolished; tenants would once again have free access to the land; there would be no taxes or debts to pay; forests would be open to the villagers; there would be no need to sell rice.[^103] this end, Saya San’s followers, believing themselves invulnerable, burned tax rolls and attacked loyalist headmen, forest officials, Indian landowners, moneylenders, and laborers. The rebellion was ultimately crushed with a loss of well over 3,000 lives.

Saya San did not create the role of _Setkya Min_ but rather filled a role that was embedded in the age-old religious eschatology of the Burmese peasantry. When he built a replica of the Mandalay palace for his coronation, when he announced that he was the king of the old prophecies, when he dispensed protective amulets to his men, when he invoked the nats on his behalf, he was enacting a scenario which had been culturally prepared within popular religion and made appealing by the plight of the rural population. And to judge from more recent research, millennarian symbolism is far from dormant in contemporary Burma. Spiro reports that “many (but not all) Burmese peasants firmly believed in the coming of a future king” while, among monks, the notion was more often dismissed as a “bazaar rumor.”[^104] In Mandalay in early 1960, Mendelson described an established, messianic Buddhist association with 5,000 members, mostly peasants and artisans, who were ritually preparing for the appearance of a Buddhist king who would establish the new society. All of this suggests that colonial historians who tended to see Saya San as a charlatan who duped the peasantry were tackling the problem from the wrong angle. They might more profitably have begun by understanding that substratum of more or less permanent millennarian beliefs which, in times of crisis, might attach itself to almost any figure who promised deliverance from oppression according to the old formulas.

In Indonesia, the symbolism of earthly salvation has taken various forms in keeping with the cultural and religious diversity of its population. We have seen how the Samin movement, which strictly speaking was not millennarian, elaborated a set of beliefs at the turn of the century that were at sharp symbolic odds with the secular order in which they lived. Saminists repudiated the status distinctions of their time by using only “low” Javanese and dropping honorifics. They repudiated the state as well by refusing to pay taxes and by invading restricted forests. They appeared to be self-conscious about the little tradition aspects of their religion, calling it _agama tani_ (peasant religion). While Samin himself denied pretensions to being a _Ratu Adil_, or just king, his followers seemed to take him for one.[^105] The ritual of the Saminists was explicitly anti-Islamic and reflected the _abangan_ symbolism of “traditional Javanese fertility cults.”[^106]

A study of more than a century of rural protest on Java[^107] has highlighted how sects or millennarian movements have reiterated those same themes. They always looked to a world without taxes, without disparities in wealth, without hunger. Nearly always they rejected Islam, although this rejection might take the form either of a competing puritanism or of a contrasting permissiveness and licentiousness. The supernatural agents of salvation might be a famous Javanese king or the mythical heroes of pre-Islamic Java, Semar and Tagog.

The leaders of such movements were frequently the specialists of pre-Islamic religion, the _dukuns_ (shamans and mediums). After independence, _dukuns_, and often _dalangs_ (puppeteers), were again associated with political dissidence as many of them were connected with the local Communist Party and with the affiliated peasant leagues. Following the massacres of the mid-1960s and the suppression of the Communist Party, _dukuns_ continued to flourish:

_Dukuns_ and other “magicians,” having a large and often militant following at their disposal, usually developed “theories” or _alirans_ on the coming of a “savior,” “a just ruler” or Ratu Adil. Some of these _dukuns_ claimed to be the Ratu Adil or a reincarnation of some mystical ruler, like King Jayabaya, who in the past established a “just society.” In 1966–67 all over the Javanese countryside more than 300 mystical _alirans_ with millennarian elements sprang up like mushrooms in the rainy season. In their teachings, the _dukuns_ usually advocated the elimination of their adversaries—replacement of village leaders, hostile village “saints,” district officers, local military commanders, and other “enemies” of the peasantry.[^108]

For the more self-consciously Islamic sector of the Indonesian population millennarian movements have taken a somewhat different form, drawing upon the Muslim belief in a Mahdi (an avenging Islamic conqueror) as well as the Ratu Adil tradition. The themes of taxes, autonomy, land, and food, however, remained remarkably constant. For the Islamic rebels of Banten in 1888, the millennium meant the return of a just sultan, a state with no taxes, and the elimination of hated officials.[^109] The problems confronting the peasantry had not changed dramatically when, in 1926, the Sarekat Islam launched a rebellion in much the same area which promised freedom from taxes, the restoration of a just sultanate, and airborne assistance from Kemal Ataturk and/or the Russians. As in many such rebellions, whether Islamic or _abangan_, the leaders were hard-pressed to control a movement with such deep roots in popular mythology.

Dissident sects, in Indonesia and elsewhere in Southeast Asia, have always posed a potential threat to the established secular order—a threat which reigning elites have been quick to recognize. As Kartodirdjo notes, governments—whether traditional, colonial, or independent—understand that such movements are “capable of aggregating and channeling peasant loyalties along new and unofficial [and we might add ‘revolutionary’] lines… Moreover, their partly spontaneous and wholly unbureaucratized nature makes them enigmatic and difficult to control on a routinized basis.”[^110]

**Conclusion**

Perhaps one reason why political scientists and historians generally overlook the moral and political ideas of vernacular agrarian society is that both, unlike anthropologists, tend to concentrate on the written record—the product, _par excellence_, of the great tradition. The little tradition achieves historical visibility only at those moments when it becomes mobilized into dissident movements which pose a direct threat to ruling elites. It is for this reason that I have had to rely so heavily on evidence from millennarian revolts in constructing my argument. Yet it seems to me that there is a “shadow history” which remains to be written for almost every mass movement in the Third World.

Consider, for example, the case of nationalism. There is evidence that the meaning of independence at the base of many nationalistic movements diverged markedly from its meaning to the intelligentsia who nominally led them. David Marr concludes that in Vietnam “salvation from the foreigner was taken by the peasantry to include _salvation_ from hunger, tenancy, and taxes” (emphasis added).[^111] For the Filipino peasantry, Sturtevant claims that “independence took on miraculous connotations.” “Some barrio dwellers began to look forward to the anticipated condition as a panacea for everything from hook worms to _hacenderos_.”[^112] It is only when the nationalist legions elude the control of their erstwhile leaders that this shadow history and its participants move into the spotlight. Much the same may be said about communist and socialist movements which are apt to look radically different from the village than from the national headquarters.[^113]

If it is worth writing religious history and sociology with the beliefs and values of its mass adherents in mind, then it is worth writing the history and sociology of political movements in the same spirit. The enterprise is important not only because it uncovers the experienced history (what French historians would call _mentalité populaire_) of most actors but also because it is likely to reveal the whole substratum of ideas and values which represent a human potential that is only rarely tapped.

In this analysis of the little tradition and popular religion in Europe and Southeast Asia, my point has been to demonstrate that, among the peasantry in most complex agrarian societies, one can find a pattern of profanations—symbolic reversals of the existing social order. The idiom in which they are expressed is, almost universally, religious. Much as the official religious doctrine is selected, reworked, and profaned in little tradition cults, so is the existing political order symbolically negated in popular millennarian traditions. For the most part, as we have stressed, these symbolic reversals are an undertone, a counterpoint, to dominant religious and political ideas. When outside forces or natural disasters appear to overwhelm the peasantry and play havoc with the normal categories of experience, however, this alternative world may chart a new course of action and open up new possibilities. This alternative symbolic world is constructed, we must not forget, largely in reaction to what might be described as the historic process of modernization—the creation of a bureaucratic state, the penetration of a market economy, the replacement of custom by law—a process experienced by much of the world’s peasantry. It is out of the turmoil and pain of this transformation that the need for a redemptive community grows. How else are we to comprehend a religious symbolism of liberation that displays so many similarities across time, space, culture, and religion?

If this examination of peasant religion and politics has revealed anything, it is surely that there is no such thing as a perfect ideological hegemony which socializes subordinate classes to accept either their fate or the values which ordain that fate. In fact, it would appear that the growth of oppression dialectically produces its own negation in the symbolic and religious life of the oppressed. At the very least this negation generates a new resistance to socialization and moral instruction from above. At most, it represents the normative basis for rebellion and revolution.[^114] As Lucien Goldmann has pointed out, “human action…can no longer be defined by its actual reality without reference to the potential reality which it seeks to bring into being.”[^115] We can do no better in closing than to quote Marx on religion, including a passage that is, alas, usually taken out of context:

_Religious_ distress is at the same time the _expression_ of real distress and the _protest_ against real distress. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, the spirit of a spiritless situation. It is the _opium_ of the people.[^116]

If the production of values is a political weapon in the class struggle, then the religious profanations of popular religion are no less a weapon than the doctrines of the high church.

**MODES OF DISSIMULATION**

**The infra-politics of subaltern groups**

If the interests, values, and notions of class entertained by urban elites are a poor guide to those of the peasantry, it is also true that the political action of urban elites is a woefully poor guide to that of poor farmers in the global south. Peasant rebellions, let alone peasant “revolutions,” are few and far between. The circumstances that favor them are rare and those revolts that do develop are nearly always crushed unceremoniously. In fact, overt public political action is the exception rather than the rule in subaltern politics. Throughout most of the global south, rights of public assembly, open marches, peaceful public protest, boycotts, and overt movements of political opposition are dangerous and frequently lethal. Outside the global south, the civil laws that guarantee the rights of opposition movements are a recent and fragile achievement. We look therefore in vain for the great bulk of rural political activity if we focus our attention on public movements, manifestos, and formal organizations with officeholders, banners, constitutions, and programs, demonstrations and pitched battles. This is not where the action is.

The job of peasants is, one might say, to stay out of the archives. By extension this implies staying out of the newspapers and below the radar of the authorities. What is true historically for peasants has been the case as well for most subordinate groups historically. One might say that, in a larger sense, the historiography of class struggle has been systematically distorted in a state-centric direction. The events that have claimed attention in most histories are those to which the state and ruling classes accord most attention. Thus, for example, a small and futile rebellion claims an attention all out of proportion to its impact on class relations, while unheralded acts of flight, poaching, sabotage, and theft which may have far greater impact are rarely noticed. A history of subaltern politics that focused only on uprisings would be much like a history of factory workers devoted entirely to major strikes and riots and ignoring the durable day-to-day struggle on the factory floor over the pace of work, leisure, autonomy, privileges, and respect. Vital territory is being won and lost here too.

What I have called “everyday forms of resistance” makes no headlines. It capitalizes on the ordinary resources of relatively powerless groups: foot-dragging, dissimulation, false-compliance, pilfering, poaching, desertion, arson, sabotage, feigned ignorance, slander. These Brechtian forms of class struggle have certain features in common. They require little in the way of planning and coordination; they often represent a form of individual self-help; and they typically avoid any _direct_ confrontation with authority or with elite norms. When such acts are widespread and systematic, when they work to thwart acts of appropriation by a superior class, and when they are often reinforced by a venerable popular culture of resistance that condones or celebrates them (e.g., Robin Hood, Jesse James and the banks and railroads), then we can be fairly certain that we are in the presence of a special form of class conflict.

Such techniques are especially well-adapted to the particular characteristics of subordinate agrarian classes. Being a diverse class of “low classness,” geographically dispersed across the countryside, often lacking discipline and leadership that would encourage opposition of a more organized sort, the peasantry is best suited, in its politics as well as in its warfare, to extended guerilla-style campaigns of attrition requiring little formal organization. And yet such forms of resistance can have, in the aggregate and over time, massive effects. The desertion (not mutiny) of Confederate troops in the US Civil War, especially by non-slave holding conscripts from the hills, was instrumental in weakening the Confederacy. The desertion and foot-dragging (not rebellion) of slaves further amplified the South’s weaknesses. Poaching was the most popular (frequent and quietly celebrated) crime in England from about 1650 to 1850. It was the main venue of the struggle over rights to the commons when legal redress was no longer an option. Squatting, both urban and rural, has probably, as a matter of de facto control over property, “won” more land than land invasions. Finally, the indifferent labor of millions of factory workers in the Soviet bloc over several decades (“We pretend to work and they pretend to pay us!”) surely played a decisive role in the long-run un-competitiveness of the Eastern European economies before 1989.

In the course of my fieldwork in a Malay village I was able to trace many kinds of resistance of this sort. One example, which did not make it into the book _Weapons of the Weak: Everyday Forms of Peasant Resistance_, was widespread resistance to the newly state-appropriated Islamic tax, the _zakat_. It so happens that the _zakat_ is essentially the same as the Catholic tithe (or _dîme_, for “tenth”) as they are both derived from an older Judaic religious tax. This made possible the comparison between six centuries of French historical data on resistance to the tithe and contemporary Malay resistance to the _zakat_ in “Dissimulation in practice: resistance to the tithe in France and Malaysia; below the radar”.

It has always been my view that anthropology and history are natural partners. When they can be usefully combined, they complement one another powerfully. Anthropology adds the phenomenology of lived experience by explaining how people understand and describe why they do what they do. No social science worthy of the name can do without a robust encounter between the explanations of an outside observer and those of the people whose behavior is being illuminated. To do otherwise is to commit social science behind the backs of actors. On the other hand, anthropology often lacks historical depth. Such depth helps us understand how a certain set of circumstances came into being, how contingent it was at the time, and, therefore, the conditions under which it might disappear. It is in this sense that history is an ultimately subversive discipline.

My quarrel with rational-choice theory in this respect is its thinness. For readers interested in the bare bones of my critique of rational choice theory as it applies to the subject of resistance examined below, in note 73 of Chapter 5 I sketch out a case that could be greatly elaborated.5

**DISSIMULATION IN PRACTICE**

**Resistance to the tithe in France and Malaysia; below the radar**

It is clear that no Herostratus among them has dared to go into the remote countryside to study the permanent conspiracy of those whom we still call “the weak” against those who believe themselves “strong”—of the Peasantry against the rich…You shall see this tireless sapper, this nibbler…Out of the reach of the law by virtue of his insignificance, this Robespierre, with a single head and twenty million hands, works ceaselessly, crouching in every commune.

_—Honoré de Balzac, letter to P. S. B. Gavault, introducing Les Paysans_

That is why the history of the tithe in the region of Lyon takes this form: the peasants endeavor to nibble away at this burden little by little, demonstrating a great ingenuity and less great obstinacy.

_—Marie-Therese Lorcin_

I don’t register my land for the _zakat_. Why should I? It just goes to make the palace even larger. The raja doesn’t need it.

_—Malay peasant_

**Introduction**

This chapter presents an analysis of contemporary Malay peasant resistance to the Islamic _zakat_ (hereinafter written zakat) and of French peasant resistance earlier to the Christian tithe, but it is offered with a larger argument in mind. Its purpose is to show that a vast range of what counts—or should count—as peasant resistance involves no overt protest and requires little or no organization.

A demonstration along these lines serves, I believe, to restore a more defensible balance to our understanding of what may broadly be called popular movements. Much of the modem scholarship on such movements has been at great pains to transcend an interpretive tradition that saw popular movements either as the more or less unmediated expression of mass rage and anger or—less libidinous but no less mechanical—as a reaction to quantifiable standards of material oppression and exploitation. These theories of popular movements, appropriately termed volcanic by one writer, have been superseded by far more sophisticated views emphasizing social action, cultural history, intentional behavior, group formation, and various patterns of organization.[^1]

Revisionist work in this spirit by historians and sociologists is surely a vast improvement over the earlier tradition. Above all, it transforms lower-class actors into social and deliberating beings; they are no longer merely ciphers for incoming food and outgoing rents and taxes and/or emotional tripwires oscillating wildly between abject passivity and blind rage. The result of this laudable refusal to portray peasants and other popular actors as, in effect, stomachs wired to nerve endings has been to highlight organization and conscious intention. Thus Rod Aya claims:

This again points up the organizational link between grievances and the capability to act on them. Individuals are not magically mobilized for action, no matter how aggrieved, hostile, or angry they feel…The point, in any event, is that there must be some kind of organization on hand to orchestrate discontent and convert it into collective action. Otherwise the unhappy merely brood passively on the sidelines.[^2]

To what extent must this organization, broadly construed, embody collective identity and broad political goals to qualify as a social movement? Charles Tilly, following a brief account of a late seventeenth-century episode in which the women of Narbonne stoned the collectors of a reimposed grain toll, makes clear his own criteria for a social movement:

Somehow a social movement should be more durable than a fleeting encounter … it should pursue broader aims than the blocking of a particular toll. If, on the other hand, we were convinced that the little affair of 1682 was only one incident in a long series, that the women of Narbonne were _aware of their common interests and distinct identity, that they were self-consciously seeking a set of changes considerably larger_ than the suspension of one tax or another, then we might comfortably begin to think in terms of a social movement. (emphasis added)[^3]

I have no quarrel with the application of these criteria, at the level of definition, to distinguish various forms of protest and collective action. Distinctions of this kind are surely necessary and, in any event, definitions are justified by their power to illuminate relations and uncover causes that would otherwise remain obscured. In the able hands of Aya and Tilly, they perform their tasks admirably.

My quarrel is rather that attention to organization, collective identity, and broad purposes may cause us to overlook much in the way of peasant—and not just peasant—resistance. If we imagine a continuum of _resistance_ ranging all the way from petty individual acts focused on the here-and-now to highly organized, durable movements of broad ideological purpose, I argue that Aya’s and Tilly’s definitions would confine our observations to a very small, if vital, sector of that continuum. To put it another way, their perspective directs our attention away from what I take to be the core of peasant politics—of peasant resistance. Much, if not most, of the prosaic but constant struggle of the peasantry to thwart those who seek to extract labor, grain, taxes, rents, and interest from them takes forms which do not and, I shall argue, _cannot_ satisfy such a restrictive definition of a social movement. Such forms, taken together, might be called everyday forms of peasant resistance.

What happens if we apply a wide-angle lens to the phenomenon of peasant resistance and then seek to situate the place of social movements within this enlarged field of vision? With this goal in mind, let me propose an initial working definition of peasant resistance:

Peasant resistance is any act by a peasant (or peasants) that is intended either to mitigate or deny claims (e.g., rents, taxes, corvée, deference) made on that class by superordinate classes (e.g., landlords, the state, moneylenders) or to advance peasant claims (e.g., to land, work, charity, respect) vis-à-vis these superordinate classes.[^4]

Three features of this working definition merit brief comment. First, there is no requirement that resistance take the form of collective action—let alone overt protest. Second, and this is a nettlesome issue, intent is built into the definition. We will return to this problem but, for the moment, the formulation allows for the fact that many intended acts of resistance may backfire—as may protest or rebellion—and produce consequences that are entirely unanticipated. Finally, the definition allows for what we might call symbolic or ideological resistance.

Viewing matters from this angle, I believe it can be shown that the greatest part of peasant resistance occurs well outside any standard definition of social movements. Here I have in mind the ordinary weapons of relatively powerless groups: foot-dragging, dissimulation, false compliance, pilfering, feigned ignorance, slander, arson, sabotage, and so forth. These Brechtian—or Schweikian—forms of class struggle have certain elements in common. They require little or no planning, they often represent forms of individual self-help, and they typically avoid any _direct_ symbolic confrontation with authority or with elite norms. Their execution depends on little more than a bit of room to maneuver, a healthy self-interest, and a favorable climate of opinion among one’s neighbors. Marc Bloch has insistently drawn our attention away from the noisier events of agrarian history to this more clandestine, undeclared war beneath the surface.

Almost invariably doomed to defeat and eventual massacre, the great insurrections were altogether too disorganized to achieve any lasting result. The patient, silent struggles stubbornly carried on by rural communities over the years would accomplish more than these flashes in the pan.[^5]

Following Bloch, if _quiet_ struggle to mitigate appropriation represents the core of popular dissent in much of agrarian history, then our models and typologies of social conflict should perhaps reflect that fact. It is certainly true that recent social history has been far more attentive to forms of struggle that fall well short of riot and rebellion.[^6] Implicitly, however, we have tended to make do with a fairly small number of principles according to which continua of social protest might be generated. The degree of violence, the scope of the goals sought, and the sheer size and durability of the activity are typically invoked, singly or in combination, to develop typologies of protest or resistance. The degree of violence helps us distinguish between, say, peaceful petitioning on the one hand and riots or guerilla movements on the other. The scope of the goals sought helps us distinguish between reformist intentions, however violently pursued, and more ambitious political ends such as those of millennarian sects or revolutionary movements.[^7] Finally, the size and durability of the activity serve to distinguish more epiphenomenal events, such as a spontaneous local riot over food prices, from an organized mass movement that represents, in Tilly’s terms, an “organized, sustained, self-conscious challenge to existing authorities.”[^8] Combining all three criteria, we have at one extreme a revolutionary movement that is likely to be violent, to have far-reaching political goals, and to be large and durable. At the other extreme are the multitude of rather passive, reformist, episodic, and small-scale actions that fill the pages of local and provincial histories.

Viewed in terms of these criteria or in terms of social movements as defined earlier, it is clear that the protracted peasant struggles Bloch describes, the long history of poaching in England, and the resistance to the tithe we shall detail below would scarcely merit much attention. By other standards, however, such struggles belong at the center of our attention. Considered as forms of resistance to appropriation, they command attention by their sheer empirical weight; each of these struggles is plausibly one of the central means by which each of the agrarian populations in question has historically defended its interests. By the standards of efficacy they also command attention. As Bloch notes, such techniques of resistance were likely to “accomplish more” in the way of defeating claims on peasant property and income than overt forms of protest or social movements.

On a broad reading of some of the criteria that Tilly applies to social movements per se, it is also arguable that everyday forms of resistance are impressive. The duration—the persistence over decades and centuries—of poaching as a de facto assertion of property rights, or of tithe resistance as a defiance of taxes, certainly compares favorably to more short-lived social movements. The number of people involved over time in such resistance may also frequently dwarf the number drawn to a particular social movement. Even by the criterion of organization, everyday forms of resistance are not so deficient as is often assumed. As I shall argue below, the conjunction of a folk culture that encourages some forms of resistance, a set of habits and practices that are part of the practical heritage of the peasantry, and a shared material interest in thwarting appropriation can produce a form of tacit coordination that mimics or substitutes for formal organization.

If certain forms of everyday resistance are effective, widespread, durable, and highly coordinated, they are, on the other hand, neither formally organized, nor do they seek, “self-consciously,” broad policy goals. Peasant resistance, before the late nineteenth century at the earliest, is unlikely to satisfy either of these criteria unless it is linked to other classes (for example, artisans, dissident elites, urban or rural middle classes). Thus, almost by definition, peasant involvement in a social movement occurs only through the mediation of non-peasant allies. By itself, the peasantry’s most common and durable weapon is an everyday resistance that stops short of the more dangerous forms of overt protest and confrontation. By itself, the peasantry has been less concerned with formal, legal changes in the arrangements governing, say, property and taxation than with attempts to defeat, block, escape, and mitigate the most harmful effects of those arrangements.[^9] Typically lacking the institutional access necessary to influence legislation and administrative regulation, the peasantry defends its interests at the enforcement stage. If social movements, in the strict sense, are rarely found among peasants, this is in large part the result of a prudent, calculated, and historically tested choice favoring other strategies more attuned to the particular social structure, strengths, and defensive capacities of this class.

It is not my purpose to argue for a change in the definition of a “social movement” that will enable everyday forms of peasant resistance to fall within its boundaries. My purpose is rather to claim that the standard of Tilly and Aya excludes, by definition, the central forms of peasant politics. Further, I hope to demonstrate that the generalized, persistent practice of everyday forms of resistance underwritten by a subculture of complicity can achieve many, if not all, of the results aimed at by social movements.

The historiography of class struggle, one might add, has been systematically distorted in a state-centered direction. Everyday resistance does not throw up the manifestos, demonstrations, or pitched battles that normally compel attention. It makes no headlines. But just as millions of anthozoan polyps create, willy-nilly, a coral reef, so do thousands of individual acts of insubordination and evasion create a political and economic barrier reef of their own. There is rarely any dramatic confrontation, any movement that is particularly newsworthy. And whenever, to pursue the metaphor, the ship of state runs aground on such a reef, attention is typically directed to the shipwreck (for example, a fiscal crisis) itself and not to the vast aggregation of petty acts that brought it about. It is seldom that the perpetrators seek to call attention to themselves. Their safety lies in anonymity. It is also extremely rare that officials of the state wish to publicize the insubordination. To do so would be openly to confess that their policy is unpopular and, above all, to expose the tenuousness of their authority in the countryside. Thus, the nature of the acts themselves and the self-interested muteness of the antagonists conspire to create a complicitous silence that is reflected in the historical record. In this context, the events that claim most attention are typically those to which the state and ruling classes accord most space in their archives. Thus, for example, a small and futile rebellion claims an attention that is often all out of proportion to its impact on class relations, while unheralded acts of flight, sabotage, and theft that may be of greater long-run significance are rarely noticed.

The matter of taxes is a case in point. It is by now an historical commonplace that, along with food prices and conscription, the most frequent proximate cause of riot and revolt in early modern Europe was the imposition of taxes that threatened subsistence and/or violated customary practices. Thus we have a vast and increasingly sophisticated mass of studies on the etiology of anti-tax movements. And yet it could be argued that the main—the generic—form of tax resistance in early modern Europe and elsewhere has taken the form of flight, evasion, misreporting, false declarations, and so on. We will perhaps never know for certain whether such patterns of resistance were more effective means of avoiding tax claims than the more dramatic measures. What is reasonably clear, however, is that they were safer and more prudent than overt defiance and that they were generally better suited to a peasantry scattered across the countryside and facing imposing obstacles to organized collective action. One might, in fact, plausibly claim that tax revolts are an indication that the more durable and judicious forms of struggle have failed, leaving no alternative.

In the interest of clarity let us contrast paired forms of resistance, both directed toward much the same goal. The first of each pair is everyday resistance in our meaning of the term, and the second is the more open, direct confrontation that typically dominates the study of social conflict. In one sphere lies the quiet piecemeal process by which peasant squatters have often encroached on plantation and state forest lands and, in the other, a public invasion of land that openly challenges property relations. In one sphere lies a process of gradual military desertion, in the other an open mutiny aimed at eliminating or replacing officers. In one sphere lies the pilfering of public or private grain stores, in the other an open attack on markets or granaries with intent to redistribute the food supply.

Here it is worth emphasizing why direct challenges to elite prerogatives are likely to encounter stiffer resistance than quiet stratagems. Overt challenges to, say, taxes and property rights—except perhaps by deferential petition—are likely to threaten the sovereign privileges of the state or of a class of overlords. They represent, once conceded, important formal precedents that validate, after the fact, a symbolic abridgement of elite claims. It is one thing for a tenant to be permanently in arrears in his rent; it is another for him to claim the de facto lower rent as a formal privilege. The former is an informal concession that can often, when the opportunity arises, be reclaimed. The latter is likely to be territory lost for good. In this context, we may appreciate why the peasantry might avoid open protest so long as other alternatives are available.

The resistance of the peasantry is thus, paradoxically, often most effective when it follows the path of least resistance. If by persistent evasion and nibbling the peasants can reliably reduce a formal tax claim on their harvest, say, by 50 percent, this result serves them about as well as the more dangerous course of pressing for an equivalent formal change in the tax. If by successfully squatting and poaching they can acquire de facto property rights, the result serves them about as well as a public right to the land and its products. The goal, after all, of the great bulk of peasant resistance is not to overthrow or transform a system of domination but rather to survive—today, this week, this season—within it. As Eric Hobsbawm aptly puts it, the non-utopian aim of peasants is “working the system to their minimum disadvantage.”[^10]

Much of what we term everyday forms of resistance can be understood as class struggle over custom and usage. Rights in law to taxes, rents, and property that are consistently violated in practice become customary or traditional violations that acquire a kind of authority of their own. In French law, as we shall see, litigation brought by tithe payers against tithe owners often hinged on the payer’s ability to demonstrate that the custom for at least twenty years had been to collect less than was formally due. Custom, therefore, was a key element in making the case for subsequent legal adjustments. As a practical matter, a tradition of successful tax evasion or of poaching also took on the force of a popular right which, once entrenched, was that much harder to revoke. One must see this struggle over custom as a long-drawn-out campaign very much dependent, at any one moment, on relationships of force—the power of the state, the effectiveness of enforcement, the pressures on peasant subsistence, the revenue needs of the state and landowners, and so forth.[^11] The peasantry was likely to sail as close to the wind as possible, pressing home its advantage whenever circumstances permitted and tactically retreating when they did not. The resources they brought to this struggle were their numbers, their wits, and the costs in coercion and enforcement that would have been necessary to bring them into line.

**The case of the Malaysian zakat**

Peasant resistance to the Islamic tithe—the zakat—in Kedah, Malaysia, provides us with a diagnostic case of everyday resistance involving no protest or organization as commonly understood. The zakat collected by the officials of the Religious Affairs Office of the state of Kedah is widely resisted and very unpopular. This last fact made it possible to gather quite detailed information about actual patterns of evasion. What follows is both a quantitative and a qualitative account of resistance to taxation. I will briefly describe the zakat and the local context within which resistance takes place, the extent and techniques of resistance, the moral reasons for evasion, and finally the relationship between the zakat and voluntary religious contributions.

The village (which I shall describe under the pseudonym Sedaka), of seventy-four households from which the details of resistance are drawn, is located near the southern extremity of the Muda Plain in northwestern Malaysia. Rice monoculture prevails, and the area has long been the major supplier of marketed rice within the country. Its importance in paddy production has grown appreciably since 1971, when the Muda Irrigation Scheme first permitted double cropping and higher yields. Given the federal structure of Malaysia, which reserves issues of Malay custom and Islamic governance to the several states, the regulation of the zakat is a state matter. In the course of nearly two years of fieldwork in Sedaka from 1978 until 1980, I had ample opportunity to observe both the collection of the zakat and local opinion on the issue.[^12]

The payment of the zakat (and the fitrah) is at the very center of the Islamic faith. Along with the confession of faith, obligatory prayers, fasting during Ramadan, and the pilgrimage to Mecca for those who can afford the trip, it is one of the five pillars of Islam that virtually define one’s status as a Muslim. Like the Christian tithe which it closely resembles, it represents an elaboration of the older Hebrew scriptures which also provided for a religious grain tax. The cultivator in each case is expected to hand over a tenth of his gross harvest for the support of his religion. The religious function of the zakat for those who give it is, in part, to sanctify them and their claims to the remainder of the harvest. As the Koran asserts, “take alms of their substance, that thou mayst cleanse and purify them thereby” (Surah 9:104). This theme, very much a part of folk beliefs as well, is related to social harmony in a pamphlet explaining the zakat, distributed by the State Religious Council of Kedah. After noting that Islam does not discourage the faithful from becoming rich, it claims that the zakat prevents stinginess (_sifat-sifat bakhil_) and serves: “To cleanse those who receive zakat of jealousy and hatred toward the owners of property [_tuan-tuan harta_]. To harmonize [_merapatkan_] the social relation between the haves [_golongan berada_] and the have-nots.”[^13]

Prior to 1955 the zakat was a purely local and largely voluntary affair; cultivators gave paddy as they saw fit to Islamic teachers, to the imam (mosque official, prayer leader), to maintain the mosque or prayer house (_surau_), to the poor, to relatives, and to those who had helped harvest their crops. Although non-payment was, in principle, punishable through the religious (_sariah_) courts, prosecution was extremely rare. Not until 1955, with the passage of the Zakat Enactment—amended in 1962 and 1963—was the zakat centralized. Collections were to be made exclusively by an appointed official—the _amil_—and forwarded to the Zakat Office in the state capital, Alor Setar, which would make all disbursements. Rubber and coconut harvests were made officially exempt and, later, the law specified that, in the case of double cropping, the full zakat of one tenth was due on each crop. As provided in the Koran, cultivators whose harvest fell below a certain minimum (_nisab_) were exempt. For Kedah, the _nisab_ was set at 480 _gantang_, or the average harvest from roughly three quarters of an acre.[^14]

The actual collection of what villagers now call the “strong zakat” has a bureaucratic patina to it whose recognition is essential to an understanding of the techniques of resistance. Prior to each harvest, the _amil_, a local resident, conducts a census of cultivators to ascertain their names, identity card numbers, the cadastral codes of the lots they farm, and the acreage being cultivated that season. At harvest time or just afterward, cultivators either deliver the zakat or ask the _amil_ to come fetch the paddy (in sacks) from the field or from the house. Unlike the case of the Christian tithe of eighteenth-century France or England, the collector does not go to the fields to inspect the harvest and gather every tenth sheaf. Nor is the zakat ever commuted into a fixed cash payment as it often was in Europe. The _amil_, upon receiving the threshed grain, weighs it, records the total declared harvest of the cultivator, and then issues an official receipt. Zakat paddy is then taken for sale to private or state paddy millers, and the net proceeds (minus transportation costs) are remitted to the Zakat Office in Alor Setar. A 20 percent commission is paid to the _amil_ for his services.[^15]

**_Statistics of resistance_**

Despite the widespread unpopularity of the strong zakat since 1962, there has never been a single public protest against its imposition. Indeed, why protest when the zakat can be defied, evaded, and largely undone by a host of petty stratagems? If Sedaka is any indication, the zakat has been resisted to the point where its actual burden as a tax has been whittled down to easily manageable proportions. Rather than addressing themselves to the abolition or reform of the new zakat system, the peasantry of Sedaka has worked quietly but massively at the enforcement stage to accomplish the same end.

Resistance has taken essentially four forms. Some farmers simply refuse to register their cultivated acreage with the _amil_. Others register but understate both the extent of their paddy fields and the size of their harvests. Those who underreport acreages or crops often take the further step of delivering an amount of zakat grain well below what even their false declarations would require. Finally, the grain handed over is frequently spoiled or adulterated—for example, paddy that is soaked or has sprouted, or that contains straw, mud, and stones—so that the recoverable grain is far less than its nominal weight indicates. A few statistics will convey the scope of this unannounced achievement (see Table 5.1). Figures are drawn from actual zakat collections for the (pre-irrigation) single crop of 1968, for the main-season crop of 1977–78, and for the irrigated crop of 1979; and from the actual cultivator yields for each of these crop seasons.[^16] Comparisons over time and between categories of villagers offer some insight into trends and strategies.

The overall impact of resistance to the zakat is a relatively simple matter to calculate. The Table 5.1 data are based on the known cultivated paddy acreage and yields for all cultivators whose harvest exceeded the _nisab_ exemption level,[^17] and on a full compliance figure resulting from delivery of one tenth of the total taxable harvest.

**TABLE 5.1** Overall zakat compliance in Sedaka, 1968, 1977–78, 1979

![[00002.jpeg]]

We see that the villagers of Sedaka fall considerably short of being model taxpayers. In practice the zakat is a mere shadow of its official reality and is becoming more so. The reason for the marked increase in evasion between 1968 and 1978 is no mystery. With the beginning of double cropping in Sedaka in 1972, the zakat authorities in Alor Setar could legally expect to collect the tax twice a year, thereby doubling their receipts. The cultivators, who, as demonstrated below, thought the existing zakat already unjust, simply compensated by paying less than half of what they paid earlier on a single crop. Their success has been such that they now deliver less grain than in 1968.[^18]

Aggregate resistance may be broken down into several different stratagems. The two most common stratagems of evasion, shown in Table 5.2, were failure to report cultivated acreage at all and payment of less than would be required on the basis of actual acreage and yield. Of those households that paid anything at all in 1977–78, only three paid a zakat that was more than half of what the law specified. And in 1979, not a single household paid even half of what was due.

Those cultivators who actually declare cultivated acreage to the _amil_ generally declare considerably less acreage than they actually farm—in 1968, for example, they declared only 59 percent of their total acreage. In 1977–78, they declared only 69 percent of the land they had cropped. Lest these figures convey the impression that underdeclaring was less common in 1977–78 than in 1968, we must remember that in 1977–78 thirty farmers liable to the zakat refused to declare at all. Combining non-declarations with underdeclarations in 1977–78, the farmers of Sedaka managed surreptitiously to remove a total of 129 acres (or 59 percent of the total taxable acreage) from the zakat rolls.

Resistance does not end there. It is mildly surprising that those who understate their farm size take the bolder step of paying less than their fraudulent declarations would require. Not one of the twenty-seven cultivators who misreported their acreage in 1977–78 paid the full zakat on their understated plots, and four paid nothing at all.[^19] We are dealing here with open fraud or defiance. This form of resistance has grown appreciably between 1968, when farmers paid 74 percent of the zakat formally required by their declarations, and 1977–78, when they paid only 40 percent. The failure to prosecute default of this kind suggests political constraints, which will be examined later.

**TABLE 5.2** Forms of noncompliance by household, Sedaka, 1977–79

![[00003.jpeg]]

The technique and extent of evasion are not entirely uniform within Sedaka. Distinguishing between various categories of villagers can tell us a good deal more about the structure of resistance. Table 5.3 summarizes the most significant findings in this respect. For simplicity of presentation the two zakat collections of 1977–78 and 1979 are combined, inasmuch as there were only minor differences in the findings for each season.

Class differences within Sedaka have a significant bearing on the structure of resistance. Small farmers, who generally live closer to the subsistence level, might be expected to resent the flat 10 percent zakat tax more than those with greater acreage, and the figures reflect this supposition, for small farmers are far less likely to pay the zakat at all. In 1979, for example, only two of eighteen such farmers paid any zakat. And when they did pay, they also contributed a smaller proportion of what was due than their neighbors with greater acreage. Class differences are also significant when we consider household income rather than farm size. Poorer villagers (that is, those of the poor who are at least above the minimal _nisab_) more often default altogether and pay less of what the law requires than the richer half of Sedaka’s farmers.

**TABLE 5.3** Default and underpayment by various categories of villagers, combined 1977–78 and 1979 seasons (in percentages)

![[00004.jpeg]]

The observation that resistance to the zakat is most marked among the poorer peasantry must, however, not obscure the fact that, from the perspective of the state, their resistance is less significant than that of the larger, more prosperous farmers. Because large farmers account for so much more of the total yield, their evasion is far more telling fiscally. The _amil_ in 1979 received only 70 _pikul_ (1 _pikul_ equals 133.3 pounds) of paddy zakat from all villagers. If the rich had paid all the zakat legally due from them, the _amil_ would have received an additional 269 _pikul_; if the poor had paid up fully, they would have delivered only 114 more.

One might expect that tenants would be more inclined to resist the zakat than owner-operators. They, after all, pay a seasonal rent to the landlord over and above normal operating expenses, and their profits per unit of land are correspondingly smaller than owner-operators.[^20] Tenants are, in fact, significantly less likely to pay any zakat at all than owner-operators, although the proportion of the zakat they thereby evade is not much more than for owners.[^21]

The most striking statistical fact about resistance to the zakat, however, is not so much the differences between categories of villagers as the high overall rate of evasion in every category. Not one of the eight distinct groups we have examined pays more than one fifth of the zakat it owes by law. Amid such generalized resistance, small statistical differences are lost.

**_Phenomenology of resistance_**

The vast majority of Sedaka’s villagers would like to abolish the centralized zakat system and return to the voluntary local pattern of religious charity they remember and prefer. Their wishes were not consulted when the system was changed, nor are they likely to be in the foreseeable future. The importance to the ruling party of fostering a centralized Islamic bureaucracy amenable to its influence precludes any initiative against the new zakat system.[^22]

What the peasantry of Sedaka, and of Kedah as a whole, has brought about is a virtual dismantling of the zakat system in fact, but not in name. Instead of paying 10 percent of their harvests, they have by steady stubborn resistance reduced the tax to a mere 1.5 percent. The struggle has been a silent one. And yet there exists a palpable climate of opinion, a shared knowledge of the techniques of evasion, a steady pressure to extend the limits of resistance, and a quiet complicity among the resisters. Although this activity cannot be deemed a form of collective action or a social movement, its result is comparable and it has the added advantage of denying the state an easily discernible target. There is no organization to be banned, no conspiratorial leaders to round up or buy off, no protesters to haul before the courts—only the general non-compliance of thousands of peasants who, without much fuss, are tearing down the edifice of the official zakat brick by brick. By turning to the values and experience of Sedaka’s villagers, we can learn more about how such achievements are possible.

Villagers have their own name for the new zakat system. They call it the _zakat raja_, a term never used in official documents. It might be translated “the ruler’s zakat,” but since the word for government is _kerajaan_ (a term denoting the condition of being ruled over by a raja), it might just as easily be translated as “the government’s zakat.” The term is pejorative and is contrasted with _zakat peribadi_, or “personal zakat,” which is the zakat that is given willingly to individuals as an act of private religious charity. _Zakat raja_ is known to be in such disrepute among paddy growers that most politicians and officials touring the countryside avoid even mentioning it. A prominent agricultural official, speaking off-the-cuff to members of the local farmers’ association in 1979, trespassed in this respect by wondering aloud whether the past few years of insufficient rainfall were perhaps related to the small-ness of the zakat collections. He quickly retreated, saying, “I know you don’t like to hear about this matter, so I won’t raise it.”[^23]

Apart from the understandable desire of most cultivators to keep as much of their harvest as they can, the dislike of the _zakat raja_ derives from what peasants see as the inequities in its provisions, the unsuitability of its beneficiaries, its disregard of local needs, and the assumed corruption in its collection. The farmers of Sedaka not only resist the zakat; they also have, collectively, a rather elaborate argument to justify their resistance. They have no more trouble explaining to themselves how, as good Muslims, they can in good conscience resist the _zakat raja_ than did Christian peasants in reconciling their religion with resistance to the tithe.

The zakat shares with the Christian tithe both a common origin and common inequities. It is, like the tithe, a fixed-rate tax on gross yield rather than on profits. Depending on a farmer’s rents, production costs, and yields, the zakat can represent a far higher percentage of his net income. In a poor year, the zakat as formally assessed might mean the difference between a modest profit and a serious loss. Above all, the _zakat raja_ is collected almost exclusively from paddy growers, a group with a high incidence of poverty, and not from shopkeepers, businessmen, officials, or the growers of other crops such as rubber, oil palms, or coconuts.[^24] There are provisions for a _zakat raja_ on property (_zakat harta-benda_), but they are largely ignored in practice. Villagers rarely fail to note this injustice in their defense. They accuse the government of overlooking the rich and collecting from the poor. Invoking a popular proverb, they claim: “The germ on the other side of the sea is noticed; the elephant directly ahead is overlooked.”

Like the tithe, the zakat is collected from the cultivator whether or not he or she owns the land. Non-cultivating landlords therefore escape the zakat altogether. Since many such landlords are rich, the fact that they are not assessed is seen as another inequity and as a persuasive reason for evasion. As Che Nor, a modestly well-off tenant cultivating nearly eight acres, puts it, “I don’t give. Why should I, when a landlord who rents out fourteen acres doesn’t have to pay?” The principle implicit here and in the earlier complaints is that the _zakat raja_ should be collected in a way that reflects the ability to pay.

Discontent with the _zakat raja_ is not confined to the way it is formally assessed. It is resented at least as much for the inequities of its destination as for those of its collection. Villagers make ample use of the _raja_ in _zakat raja_. Thus, “The raja is rich, he doesn’t need my padi.” Or, “The zakat goes to the big men in Alor Setar; why does the government take it from us?” Such comments often compare the _zakat raja_ with the _zakat peribadi_ given to the local poor. Che Nor says, “I don’t much like giving to the _amil_, who gives to the _raja_; I want to give zakat to people here in the village.” Haji Kadir, the wealthiest villager, who farms nearly fifteen acres of paddy land, is more explicit: “We should give to people who are really bad-off, like Hamzah [a local wage laborer] and not to big men like the iman [head of the nearby mosque].”[^25] The _zakat raja_ is illegitimate because it is compulsory and goes—the villagers presume—to officialdom far away.[^26] The _zakat peribadi_ is legitimate because it is a voluntary gift and goes to the recognizable poor of the village.

The _amil_ and the Zakat Office in Alor Setar are, from the peasants’ perspective, something of a Bermuda Triangle into which their contributions disappear, never to be seen again. It is not that the proceeds of the _zakat raja_ are not used for worthy purposes. According to the 1970 official report of the Zakat Office at least, 15 percent of the total proceeds of M$1,120,800 went to the poor, 53 percent for “commendable measures”—often aid to religious schools—6 percent for assistance to travelers making the pilgrimage, 2 percent to converts, and 22 percent for commissions to the _amil_ and central administration.[^27] For the villagers of Sedaka, however, only one fact is worth noting: No needy villager has ever been assisted by the centralized zakat. Whatever zakat they pay “disappears” (_hilang_). As one villager asserts, “the government has never sent back a single gunny sack of paddy to Sedaka.” Unlike the _zakat peribadi_, whose results are visible and immediate, the _zakat raja_ is essentially just another tax.

The nearly unanimous belief that the _zakat raja_, quite apart from its formal inequities, is venally administered further justifies a climate of resistance. Villagers assume that, as the zakat receipts pass through many hands on the way to Alor Setar and back again on the way to beneficiaries, a great deal of the money vanishes into the pockets of officials and their relatives (_adekberadek depa_). The presumption must be understood as a reflection of the general attitude toward officials in the state capital: that they are high-living and self-serving. Widely publicized trials of two high zakat officials for misappropriation of funds in 1971 only served to confirm peasant suspicions. A recent commotion over the conduct of the _amil_ in the adjacent village of Sungai Tongkang offers evidence even closer at hand. There, a new _amil_ was appointed for a two-year term in 1977. But by the end of the first year, the Mosque Administrative Committee had received so many complaints from villagers about irregularities and the lack of receipts and records that the incumbent was summarily dismissed. Today, the residents of Sungai Tongkang are said to defy the _zakat raja_ in far greater numbers than in Sedaka.

Sedaka’s own _amil_, Basir, has nothing of the infamous reputation of Sungai Tongkang’s former _amil_, but neither is he above suspicion. Nearly all villagers assume that there are irregularities in collection that benefit him personally. As one poor laborer notes, “you can’t expect the zakat of the _amil_ to be correct.” He goes on to list the many ways in which the collections can be manipulated. Thus, when the _amil_ sells the rice to a dealer for cash, the laborer imagines that if the real value is M$32, the _amil_ will have the buyer give him a receipt for M$30 and will pocket the difference or share it with the buyer. A smallholder explains that he contributed 2 _naleh_ (32 imperial gallons) of paddy as _zakat raja_ after the 1978–79 main season, but Basir gave him a receipt for only 1 _naleh_, 8 _gantang_ (24 imperial gallons). He assumes that Basir kept the difference. Nor are the villagers above drawing attention to the fact that the previous _amil_, Basir’s father, made not one but two pilgr_resources/books//Decoding Subaltern Politics_ Ideology, Dis - James C. Scott to Mecca, implying that the cost of the trips was defrayed by misappropriations. For them, the _zakat raja_ has a long and checkered history. And adding insult to injury, the only local beneficiary of the zakat in memory was Basir’s son, who, while attending university, was granted M$100 by the Kedah Zakat Office. Basir’s family, one of the wealthiest dozen families in Sedaka, is viewed as a scarcely fitting object of charity.

Sedaka’s peasantry not only resists the _zakat raja_ but has a rather elaborate critique of the tax—as a law and as a practice—that socially justifies that resistance. This critique can undoubtedly be heard throughout much of rural Malaysia, judging from the available evidence.[^28] Though the critique is shared generally by the peasantry, though it produces a tacit coordination of resistance, and though it is well known to the _amil_ and to state officials, it is not a public argument in the usual sense. The critique, like the resistance it inspires, is offstage.

Implicitly, peasant criticism of _zakat raja_ is also embodied in the continuation of the older tradition of private Islamic charity (_zakat peribadi_) within the village. Each season, villagers voluntarily donate as much paddy to religious teachers, friends, neighbors, relatives, and harvest workers as they grudgingly give to the state-appointed _amil_. They regard these gifts as legitimate acts of religious piety—as the authentic zakat enjoined by the Koran. By comparison to the _zakat raja_, such private charity is freely given; it is a face-to-face gift to personally known beneficiaries, and it serves to create or reinforce social bonds between classes in the village. That this earlier practice, lacking formal sanctions to enforce it, should survive at all implies that it serves the important social and religious functions in the community that, in stark contrast, the official zakat fails to serve.[^29]

**_A finely tuned resistance_**

What are the limits of resistance to the zakat? In addressing this question we must above all realize that the limits are fluid and subject to constant testing and pressure. If those who now pay nothing remain unscathed, others will undoubtedly copy their example, while a burst of prosecution and enforcement could possibly increase the level of grudging compliance. We can, however, say something about the current balance of forces and how it is locally understood.

The existing folk wisdom on the subject, one that speaks for virtually all those with farm sizes at or above the average of 3.3 acres, can be captured in a single phrase: “Give a little bit, and they won’t bother you” (_Bagi sedikit, tak kachau_). Thus, Haji Kadir, Sedaka’s biggest landowner, whom I quote here, gave the _amil_ only 4 _pikul_ of paddy from a total harvest of roughly 225 _pikul_, or less than 2 percent of his crop. He resents paying anything at all but is well aware of the possible consequences of total defiance. Roughly a decade ago he was prosecuted and fined for having failed to pay any _zakat raja_ for three successive seasons. Now he walks a fine line, giving as little as he dares but enough to avoid another prosecution. Ten other large farmers with more than 5.6 acres (8 _relong_), who would each owe at least 11.2 _pikul_ by law, actually contribute an average of 3.2 _pikul_. Only one defies the zakat by paying nothing. Cultivators of mid-sized farms who would owe on average 8.5 _pikul_ actually deliver an average of less than 1.5 _pikul_.[^30] This category apparently feels itself more secure from official scrutiny, for five of the twenty-one farmers in the group pay nothing whatever. For small farmers cultivating fewer than three acres of paddy land, the folk wisdom—and the practice—is: “They don’t need our paddy so we don’t pay.” Knowing from experience that they are evidently immune from prosecution, roughly nine out of ten such cultivators ignore the tax altogether. Taken collectively, these patterns represent the achievements of peasant resistance and the existing _modus vivendi_.

The limits of resistance are not static. Moves by either state or peasantry elicit counter-moves. The extension of the _zakat raja_ to double cropping was, as we have seen, soon met by a reduction in local receipts that more than offset the double tax claim. The state has also recently responded to the common practice of paying the zakat with paddy that is spoiled, wet (increasing its weight), and dirty, as well as the stuffing of zakat paddy sacks with stones and straw. This problem is hardly new, to judge from the official zakat regulations, which make a point of insisting that the paddy delivered be “good” (_elok_).[^31] According to Basir, Sedaka’s _amil_, villagers used to give fine clean grain, but the tendency has been growing to set aside the worst paddy for the _zakat raja_. Responding to this ploy, the Zakat Office has now directed the _amil_ to sell the grain to a miller and then credit each contributor with the value of the recovered polished rice rather than with the estimated value of the paddy by weight as before. By all accounts this has not materially improved the quality of the paddy supplied.

The peasantry of Sedaka is ever alert to moves that might jeopardize the effectiveness of their resistance. When a fertilizer subsidy was announced in 1978, a good many villagers were suspicious. To apply for the free fertilizer, farmers were required to state the acreage they farmed. If they gave a true or inflated figure to get the fertilizer, what would prevent the state from comparing that figure with their underdeclarations of acreage for the _zakat raja_ and then taking them to court for underpayment? Many thought the fertilizer subsidy was simply a ruse to flush out those who were avoiding the zakat. When no prosecutions were forthcoming, the villagers breathed a sigh of relief. They could apparently have it both ways, exaggerating farm size when applying for loans and fertilizer and minimizing it when registering with the _amil_.

Why does the _amil_ overlook this pattern of massive _zakat raja_ evasion? His commission is, after all, contingent on how much he collects and, being a village resident himself, he knows exactly how much land each household cultivates and how good their harvest has been. The same question applies to the Zakat Office in Alor Setar and to state officials generally. They are certainly well aware of the extent of evasion; it is a simple matter for them to compare the statistics on each harvest published by the Muda Agricultural Development Authority with the paltry gleanings of the _zakat raja_.

Much of the answer lies in the delicate position of the _amil_ in Sedaka. Basir is not only the _amil_; he is also owner of a small provisions shop in the village, a leading member of both the Farmers’ Association and the Village Development Committee, and, more important, the local strongman of the ruling party. “A shopkeeper,” as he puts it, “has to be on good terms with everyone. They can buy their things in another store.” Given the fact that there is also political competition in the village (38 percent of the villagers belong to the opposition Malay party), one might say the same about party affiliation. Were Basir zealously to pursue collection of the _zakat raja_, he would certainly jeopardize his own position of leadership and perhaps even that of his party as well. Such cross-pressures constrain Basir to turn a blind eye to all but the most blatant defiance of the zakat. Thus when a villager whom Basir knows to be cultivating five acres registers only two acres, he simply takes the underdeclaration at face value. I asked once naively why he was so tolerant, and he chose to answer in terms that emphasized his respect for local opinion: “Every day I see their faces; I live here and they live here.” He also implies by this that he is more dependent on the good will and patronage of the local community than on maximizing his income from the _zakat raja_.[^32]

Political accommodation of the resistance to the _zakat raja_ also operates at the provincial and national levels. The continued political hegemony of the ruling party, the United Malay Nationalist Organization (UMNO), depends vitally on the support it receives from the Malay population of the country, whose interests it claims to represent. That claim is potentially threatened by the considerable following which its Malay opposition, Partai Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS), still enjoys. Compared to this key matter of controlling the state of Kedah, the value of the zakat revenue is negligible.[^33] Most of the larger farmers who make up the backbone of UMNO in the countryside are themselves at the same time successfully resisting the zakat laws. A crackdown on zakat evasion would threaten the networks of patronage that are the social basis of the party. The ruling party and the religious officials associated with it thus face two obstacles. The first is largely administrative. A tax like the _zakat raja_, which affects nearly every paddy farmer, is costly to collect and comparatively easy to evade. Strict enforcement where evasion is so general would require literally thousands of court cases for rather meager results. Politically, the effects might well be devastating, and the religious officials of the Zakat Office itself can hardly savor the prospect of undermining their own standing by compelling compliance with the least popular aspect of official Islam in the nation. The peasants not only know this and act accordingly, but they may fairly be said to have helped to create this dilemma by their persistent resistance.

**The case of the French tithe**

The resistance of the French peasantry to the Catholic tithe, until its abolition shortly after the Revolution, bears a striking family resemblance to Malay evasion of the _zakat raja_. In broad terms, the tithe and the zakat are of course comparable taxes because of their common historical and scriptural origin. I focus on France for two reasons. First, the tithe was a major bone of contention between peasants and church authorities for at least four centuries.[^34] Its importance, furthermore, is amply reflected in the rich and sophisticated historical studies published over the past three decades. I happily acknowledge being in this respect the beneficiary of a tradition of scholarship pioneered by Marc Bloch and Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie that has placed such issues as the tithe in a far larger historical context. The Malaysian case, by contrast, has all the advantages and disadvantages of being contemporary. While it is possible to speak to the principals involved and collect statistics with a particular goal in mind, the case of Sedaka covers little over a decade. In the case of France, however, although we may lose much of the detail and phenomenology, we gain the unique capacity to see the struggle over the tithe as it was waged by generations of contestants and to evaluate its ebb and flow as well as the results. Guided by the richness of the sources, we emphasize particularly the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, with only occasional reference to earlier periods.

_La dîme_ (“the tenth”) _ecclésiastique_, as it was known, was formally established by the Capitulaire of 801, made into a divine right and hence obligatory by the Lateran Council in the fourteenth century, and reconfirmed under Charles IX in 1571. In principle, as with the zakat, it was a charge on the gross harvest of the cultivator before deduction of any rents or other expenses. The tithes that will concern us were the major tithes (_grosses dîmes_) levied on the main food grains (wheat, rye, and oats) and on wine.[^35] Proceeds from the tithe collection were—according to the 1571 document—to be divided into three (presumably equal) parts: one part was for the maintenance of the local clergy to ensure that the major sacraments were available; a second part was for poor relief; and a third part was for the upkeep of the church itself.

Although similar in concept to the zakat, the tithe evolved along quite different lines. Reflecting its origin, the tithe was feudal property that the owner could sell, mortgage, or lease, although ultimate ownership generally remained in clerical hands. Exemptions could also be granted. As with other feudal dues, there was a tendency, especially strong in the eighteenth century, to commute the tax to a fixed annual cash payment in lieu of collections in kind. The general practice, however, was for the clergy to lease, by auction, the right to tithe collection to private speculators (tithe “farmers”) who, in turn, guaranteed the tithe owners a fixed income for the term of the lease and assumed the costs of collection. The tithe farmer’s profit then depended on his costs, grain prices, and, most important, on how much he could squeeze from the cultivators. Unlike the _zakat raja_, for which the farmer declares his own yield and hands over what he deems suitable, the tithe collector came to the field at harvest time and took every tenth sheaf of grain. Generally speaking, the tithe was both more decentralized _and_ more ferociously collected than the zakat. The multiplicity of tithe owners might mean that a given community or cultivator could be paying tithes on different fields or crops to several collectors. At the same time, the compulsory tithe was far more important to clerical incomes in France than is the compulsory zakat to Islamic officials and teachers in Malaysia.[^36] This reason alone helps to explain why efforts to enforce the tithe were more rigorous.

**_Reasons for resistance_**

Language and religion aside, the standard criticisms of the French tithe in the eighteenth century could be spoken in Sedaka today with scarcely a jarring note. The tithe, like the zakat, was regarded as simply another tax on the harvest—one that was collected inequitably and disappeared leaving hardly a trace. Judging from what evidence we have, most of which comes from the _cahiers de doléances_ assembled from rural France shortly before the Revolution, the peasantry agreed with the verdict of the physiocrat François Quesnay: The _dîme_ was “onerous, unjust, and disastrous.”[^37]

The tithe was inequitable as between cultivators. Those with poor land and/or high production costs found themselves paying a third or even half of their net return to the tithe collector.[^38] We must recall in this context that, compared to his contemporary Malay counterpart, the French peasant had far more variable harvests and a much higher seed/harvest ratio (it might be as high as 1:4 or 1:5). In a bad year the tithe might well jeopardize household subsistence. Although the physiocrats emphasized that the tithe was a barrier to agricultural investment and the clearing of new fields, the peasantry was clearly more concerned with its threat to household income. The tithe was also inequitable as between cultivators and non-cultivators. Non-farming landlords paid nothing. Although the tithe was, in principle, obligatory for all, it was not in fact collected from artisans, shopkeepers, traders, officials, or the wealthy bourgeoisie.

Even more galling perhaps, and again familiar to Sedaka ears, was the final destination of the tithe. The bulk of the proceeds—five sixths by one count—went to the clerical hierarchy composed of bishops, archbishops, abbeys, monasteries, and seminaries.[^39] The local curé or vicar got no more, and sometimes less, than one sixth. The failure of the _dîme_ to defray expenses of the local clergy or to maintain rural churches meant that parishioners were subject to onerous additional charges (for example, the _prémices_) and to high fees (the _casuel_) for baptisms, marriages, and funerals. The price list was quite detailed—so much for cushions, so much for candles and chairs, so much for saying the bans, so much for nuptials. Despite their payment of the tithe some parishes had no priest in residence. Thus a parish in the Lyon region refused to pay on the grounds that Mass was said only every other week by a non-resident priest who was never available for last rites.[^40]

If the lower clergy were relatively short-changed by the tithe, the needs of the local poor were often ignored completely. Jean Rives, summarizing the evidence from the archbishopric of Auch in the eighteenth century, claims that “such unanimity [in sources] confirms that the maintenance of the clergy is, in general, well enough assured by the tithe, but in contrast the portion devoted to the maintenance of the churches and the organization of charity remains very small.”[^41] The common complaint was that abbeys and monasteries with enormous tithe receipts had either ceased their charitable activities altogether or distributed only paltry rations or amounts of cash even in times of great dearth.[^42]

The idea that unifies a great many of these complaints, as well as those appearing in the _cahiers de doléances_, is simply the insistence on local reciprocity. What tithe payers expected, at a minimum, is that there be some plausible relationship between whatever was taken from them and the local religious services and charity the local poor might receive in return. It is the same principle that underlies objections to the zakat, and the appeals in each case hark back to a presumed earlier time when religious dues were both local and voluntary. The zakat payers in Sedaka would recognize the tone of the _cahiers_ references to the tithe, which rarely call for abolition but instead emphasize equity in collection and local distribution. In the former category are demands for a uniform (and lower) tithe rate, the deduction of seed costs prior to assessment, and the elimination of minor tithes and multiple collectors. In the latter category are demands that tithe receipts be devoted in equal parts to local charity, the local church, and the local clergy, but not to the rich religious orders, which, in fact, monopolized much of it.[^43]

**_Mode of resistance_**

The French peasantry did not shrink from open, violent resistance to the tithe. My reading of the evidence from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries suggests, however, that everyday forms of resistance prevailed, with open defiance erupting when political conditions permitted or when subsistence was threatened. There is thus no shortage of tithe riots, tithe strikes, tithe revolts, and, especially, tithe litigation to whet the appetite of the historian of protest. But even on this public terrain small skirmishes were the rule.[^44] The more perilous forms of open resistance seem to have occurred in periods of crop failure, when new tithes were introduced on land and crops formerly exempt, when the state was particularly weak, and, finally, when some religious heresy (for example, the Huguenots) had taken hold. Such events were, we may venture, given pride of place in the archives in large part because they represented a palpable threat to clerical authority and public order. They are, of course, absent from the Malaysian record and not only because of the vastly longer sweep of history and weaker state in the French case: The tithe was a far heavier burden on far more variable peasant incomes than the zakat has ever been.[^45]

The essential and continual struggle over the tithe, however, was a conflict that rarely erupted into violence. Instead, it was a long-drawn-out, silent, and undeclared war of evasion, fraud, concealment, dissimulation, non-compliance, and quiet defiance answered by counter-measures, threats, and prosecutions. The historians who have most closely examined the tithe view it as a campaign of attrition. Le Roy Ladurie makes it clear that the archives are misleading in this respect:

The world of the peasant was for the most part beyond the pale of the written word, and his strikes, except for a few notable episodes, have left almost no traces in the archives—more especially since they were usually a question of insidious forms of sabotage, of intermittent resistance, and prosaic actions overlooked by history but nonetheless extremely pernicious for clerical finances.[^46]

Three other assessments from the regions of Toulouse, Savoie, and Lyon, respectively, will suffice to convey the general accord.

Frauds, disputes over the [tithe] rates, the switching of crops, the mixture of titheable and nontitheable crops [on the same field] were among the thousand and one means which, in normal times, the tithe payers used to reduce the levy.[^47]

Most often the refusal [to pay the tithe] took the secret form of maneuvers of obstruction, of cabals [to rig the auctioning of collection rights], and of struggles conducted on the terrain of legal proceedings.[^48]

The tithe agents struggled with difficulty against communities of peasants who, with a tacit accord, applied all of the same techniques mentioned. In a wearying war, they let abuses transform themselves into customary usages and the tithe owners, who despite being powerful lords, could no longer eliminate them.[^49]

The popular movement of resistance to the tithe in France thus took a form that differs in detail but not in substance from Malay peasant resistance to the zakat. There is one important exception to this observation, and it concerns the relation of custom to litigation. The legal system in France at the time accorded custom priority over canon law; if a community could prove in the courts that it had customarily not paid the tithe on certain crops or that the customary tithe was lower than the official rate, it had a sporting chance of winning its case. Peasants who managed to evade or underpay a tithe for as long as two decades could thus transform a practice of resistance into a recognized right in law—a possibility not open to their Malay counterparts. All the more reason, as Lorcin notes, for the French peasants to persist quietly.

The tithe payers have no interest in alerting the tithe-collector, since their goal is to introduce new practices in the local custom by imperceptible degrees so that they can later claim that, “it was always this way.” Thus it is by litigation which finally erupts that one recognizes the opposition of tithe-payers.[^50]

How successful was this resistance? Lacking the kind of data we have for Sedaka, it is impossible to know for certain. And in any case the answer would vary over time as well as by region and community. Fluctuations in collection were closely related to fluctuations in the balance of power between payers and collectors, with the peasantry likely to exploit fully any weakness in enforcement. Resistance to the tithe would reach epidemic proportions in the region of Toulouse, for example, whenever social tensions or exterior danger persuaded the intendant that it was unwise to apply coercive measures. For this reason, tithe collections were negligible at the end of the seventeenth century and again in the decade before the Revolution.[^51]

There is scattered evidence suggesting that the terrain favored the rural guerillas over the long haul. Even the shift in the official tithe rates points toward this conclusion. Lorcin’s remarkable chart of tithe rates in the Lyon region from 1200 to 1800 shows a decline from the earlier standard of one tenth to a norm of one twelfth. For the years after 1600 she records only a single instance of the full tenth.[^52] We are perhaps observing here the gradual transmutation of resistance into custom and thence into law. As far as clandestine resistance is concerned, Paul Viard’s standard work on the tithe concludes that the difficulties of monitoring the crops and the spiriting away of part of the harvest in the sixteenth century would have denied tithe collectors fully half of what they were entitled to by law.[^53] Finally, we have the occasional complaints by tithe owners themselves. A _mémoire_ left by the apparently hard-pressed _curés_ of Hautes Bornes (Haute Savoie) in 1766 asserts that a bewildering variety of petty stratagems (for example, undeclared land, sowing of non-tithable crops, and the concealing of crops) have reduced their collections by more than one third over the previous century.[^54] If the French resistance to the tithe did not succeed quite so brilliantly as Malay resistance to the zakat, the difference perhaps lies in the crucial importance of the tithe to clerical incomes and hence its more determined enforcement. The achievement of the vast popular movement—whether we accept Viard’s verdict of one half or generalize the one third cited for Haute Savoie—is nevertheless impressive, and it appears that time was on the side of the resisters.

It is also quite clear that throughout our period, roughly from the 14th to the 18th century, the collectors steadily lost out. In many areas of France the tithe level fell and the re-imposition of liability in certain cases which had been exempt and the introduction of a higher level of tithe…by no means succeeded in slowing down the erosion of income.[^55]

The outcome was almost entirely the result of a bewildering array of petty stratagems that were far safer and, over time, more effective than open confrontations—ample reason, then, to follow the advice of Le Roy Ladurie and Joseph Gay to “study the ingenuity of peasants faced with disaster, and explain why for centuries the tithe remained at a level which was just tolerable.”[^56]

**_Techniques of resistance_**

The techniques employed by the French to evade all or part of the tithe were far more elaborate and varied than those of their Malay counterparts. The central reason for the relative simplicity and directness of zakat evasion is the political environment that has allowed the Malay peasantry to gain the partial complicity of the collection agent, the _amil_. Although French rural communities tried, and occasionally succeeded in, “fixing” the tithe auction, they more often faced a tithe agent who was a stranger with no incentive to look the other way. They also faced a tithe agent who had to recover his “sunk costs” (that is, his contract with the tithe owners) before any profit was possible and who came directly to the field at harvest time to make his collection. This, of course, is the point of tax farming, in which the state passes the risk of collection costs on to the tithe agent while assuring itself a guaranteed return. Having failed to “capture” the tithe agent, the peasants’ only alternative was to convince him, by dogged resistance, that attempts to ensure full payment would prove to be a losing proposition.

One of the major techniques of resistance involved use of cropping patterns designed largely to evade the tithe. Whenever possible, peasants switched from the major tithe crops to crops that were either exempt or taxable at a lower rate. Strictly speaking, of course, this was not illegal, but the struggle over the tithe status of new and/or minor crops was a constant refrain. As a crop that had previously been ignored grew in importance, tithe owners attempted to tax it and cultivators resisted paying. Here again, resistance and custom had legal import: Because a forty-year record of collection of an exceptional (_insolite_) tithe had been sufficient evidence in litigation to raise its status to that of a regular tithe, the peasantry of Hautes Bornes contended that broadbeans, buckwheat, and peas were not tithable and refused to pay anything lest the tax become customary.[^57] Another standard ruse was to interplant tithable and non-tithable crops in the same field and then claim that the entire field was exempt from tax since the volume of the non-tithable crop exceeded that of the tithable crop. Evasions of this kind apparently became so widespread in the Toulouse region that tithe owners decreed that changes in cropping practices could on no account reduce the liability of the tithe payer by more than one third of the previous collection.[^58] Multiple cropping patterns with varying harvests, even if all had been tithable, presented almost insurmountable obstacles to tithe collectors, who had only so many carts, so many assistants, and so much time. Finally, it was common in many areas for peasants to open new plots (_bleds noirs_) in secret and not declare them to the collectors at all.[^59]

With a little imagination, the categories defining the tithe could be stretched almost beyond recognition. Ordinarily, orchards, meadows, woodlots, game, fish, and kitchen gardens were not subject to the tithe on the principle that they were minor, subsistence activities. The possibilities for evading the tithe by manipulating these definitions is perhaps best illustrated by the ingeniously elastic term _garden_.[^60] Peasants took to expanding the size of their gardens, opening “new” gardens, and sowing tithable grains in their large, tax-exempt “gardens.” Where enforcement was temporarily lax, whole communities of farmers would threaten to transform themselves into gardeners. Alarmed tithe owners responded by issuing regulations specifying a maximum size for gardens and restricting what was grown in them to “soup vegetables.” The moves and counter-moves over gardening are something of a metaphor for the tithe struggle itself: Loopholes are discovered and exploited, efforts are made to stem the loss of revenue, new evasions are devised, and so on—a cat-and-mouse game in which, most observers agree, the mouse generally outwitted the cat.

Once the tithe collector actually arrived at the field during harvest, another phase of the campaign began—or, more accurately, the campaign had begun the day or night before when portions of the crop had been surreptitiously cut, perhaps threshed, and safely hidden. The tithe collector was by law to be informed of the impending harvest at least twenty-four hours in advance so that he could arrive in good time to verify the crop as it was gathered. Of all the tithe regulations this was the most uniformly violated. Peasants typically claimed that the threat of bad weather had impelled them to begin the harvest early. The collector frequently arrived to find all or part of the crop already in the barn and a negligible tithe left in sheaves in the field. When inclement weather was not handy as a pretext, cultivators might excuse themselves by citing the danger posed by thieves or marauding animals to crops left lying in the open. In the Toulouse region there were dozens of prosecutions each year for harvesting without informing the tithe agent, and between 1524 and 1752 the Parliament of Toulouse passed no less than nine separate _arrêts_ forbidding the practice.[^61] The repetitiousness of the decrees suggests how unsuccessful they were in eliminating the practice.

One can detect in this and other forms of resistance not merely a desire to reduce the tithe but also an attempt to unilaterally _enact_ a more equitable tax. From the cultivators’ point of view, neither the seed grain reserved for the next season nor the payments in kind to harvest laborers should have been subject to the tithe; they were not profits but costs. An unannounced harvest allowed the peasantry to escape the provisions of canon law and, in effect, deduct these costs (normally about 30 percent of the gross harvest and far more in a bad season) before the tithe agent arrived on the scene. Little by little, peasant insistence on this issue might find its way into customary law.[^62]

Even the apparently straightforward matter of collecting one tenth or one twelfth of the sheaves or stacks, assuming they were in the field, was another source of unremitting struggle. It was, for example, customary to exempt the few sheaves which formed the base of the stacks in the field. As one might by now imagine, the tax-exempt base of the stacks grew by leaps and bounds, and the tithe owners responded by decreeing that only five of one hundred base sheaves could be used for this purpose. The legislation was of limited value inasmuch as it was impossible to count the sheaves at the base without disassembling it.[^63]

A final bone of contention was known as the _rompu_.[^64] If we imagine, for example, a wheat tithe of one twelfth and a harvest consisting of thirty sheaves, the six sheaves over twenty-four—a multiple of twelve—were considered the _rompu_, and were not tithable. This custom is itself almost certainly a result of resistance to paying the tithe on fractional amounts above a simple multiple of the standard rate. By manipulating the size of sheaves or stacks it was possible for the peasantry to maximize the _rompu_. Thus a collector taking one twelfth would typically find the grain in twenty-three sheaves, so that nearly half the harvest (eleven sheaves) would be exempt. And, if the _rompu_ sheaves were larger than the rest, one might escape the tithe on more than half the harvest.

Each of these petty stratagems, considered alone, might save the peasant only a small amount of grain. But when all the various techniques of evasion are aggregated and pursued relentlessly decade after decade, their impact is appreciable. A complaint by clergy in the Lyon region in 1769 makes its own calculation of the losses. It notes that many peasants gather their crops without telling the collector or allowing him on their fields and that they deduct one tenth for harvest costs, one twelfth for transportation, and then refuse to pay the _rompu_—”so that of thirty stacks, it is plausible that they pay only one.” The conclusion of the complaint makes it clear that the pattern of evasion borders on insolence.

The inhabitants of Thézé are so convinced of the injustice of their own acts that they remove from the collectors the knowledge and proof; they often carry off their harvest at night and leave in the field only that which they want to give as tithe.[^65]

**Safety in numbers, safety in nibbling**

A complete and systematic comparison between Malay resistance to the zakat and French resistance to the tithe is ruled out by the sources at our disposal. In the French case, we lack much of the phenomenology of resistance, its variation by class and tenure status, and detailed statistics. We know very little, for example, about the local class basis of resistance to the tithe, beyond vague suggestions that the poorer cultivators were most likely to default.[^66] What role, if any, did venality in collection play in the opposition to the tithe? What effect did the tithe have on the pattern of private charity within the community? How did factional conflict influence the structure of tithe resistance? In the Malaysian case, we lack the historical depth (Sedaka was first settled only a century ago) or geographical breadth that might permit broader conclusions.

Despite both the lacunae in our knowledge and the many differences in historical context there are nevertheless remarkable similarities in the patterns of resistance, two of which merit brief comment.

Both forms of resistance are, in a narrow definition of politics, largely outside the political arena. There is little attempt to reform or abrogate the legal order being resisted. Ordinarily lacking the means to make law, the resisters must content themselves with undoing its application in practice. They pursue this course less by violence, riot, and open defiance than by “a patient labor of nibbling”[^67] that accomplishes much the same result while minimizing the ever-present possibility of massive retaliation. The resisters may, and often do, have principled objections to the claims on their harvests, but these objections find public voice only under exceptional circumstances. They seek less to destroy the tax barrier they confront than to find, like water, a hundred ways around it, through it, and under it while leaving it standing.

At one level such resistance is individual and self-interested. At another level it is a unique species of collective action. None of this resistance could hope to achieve its purposes except through a generalized, often unspoken complicity. One or a few resisters would be easy for the authorities to pick off and make an example of. There is safety in numbers. Thus the French sources frequently refer to “tacit consent,” “unanimity,” the refusal to give testimony, and conspiracies of silence. It is clear as well in the Malaysian case that all the cultivators in Sedaka know just how far they can press their luck and that their evasion is finely tuned to that of their neighbors. Peasants have no more need for formal organization to achieve this tacit coordination of behavior than they do to exchange harvest labor or to arrange a small feast.

**Conclusion**

The everyday forms of peasant resistance we have examined merit, at the very least, far greater attention than they have received in the analysis both of peasant–state relations and of rural class relations. More boldly, there is a case to be made that resistance of this kind belongs at the center of any historical assessment of peasant politics. What follows here is a brief sketch of the case for the importance and centrality of such humble forms of resistance.

Considering only the zakat and the tithe, that case could assuredly be made in terms of results. In both settings, the peasantry has confronted a tax that it judges inequitable and has largely succeeded in either reducing it to manageable proportions or virtually nullifying it. The consequences for household income, on the one hand, and clerical revenues, on the other, have been appreciable. Since these results have been attained with little in the way of protest or organization, there may be good conceptual reasons for excluding these everyday forms of resistance from the privileged realm of “social” or “popular” movements. Be that as it may, let us recognize at least that in terms of durability, persistence, tactical wisdom, and flexibility, as well as results, such activity may well eclipse the achievements of what normally are considered social movements. In the French case, after all, we are dealing with at least four centuries of unremitting resistance by millions of peasants informed by a definite, if seldom openly articulated, view of justice.

Acts which, taken individually, may be trivial need not have trivial consequences when taken cumulatively. Many of the major events of history were precipitated when the cumulative impact of these forms of resistance reached critical thresholds rarely intended by their petty perpetrators. We may see this perhaps most strikingly in the case of desertion from armies. As a case in point, Armstead Robinson has demonstrated the key role of everyday resistance in the collapse of the Confederacy during the American Civil War.[^68] Incensed by laws that exempted many sons of plantation owners from conscription, impelled to save their families from the subsistence crisis of 1862, and in any case having little stake in defending slavery, the poor, hill-country white yeomanry deserted the Confederate Army in great numbers. Robinson estimates that as many as 250,000 deserted or avoided conscription altogether. Their refusal to participate in what they termed “a rich man’s war and a poor man’s fight” was decisive in Lee’s defeat at Antietam and in eastern Tennessee. As a southern clergyman noted, “our army has melted like a snow wreath, and chiefly by desertion.”[^69] Defections from the ranks were compounded by massive shirking, insubordination, and flight among the slave population, which deprived the Confederacy of the food supplies and revenues it needed to prosecute the war successfully. These mutinous activities were not part of a rebellion; they were not organized or coordinated by anyone—and yet their aggregate impact was as deadly, if not more so, than any large open movement of sedition might have been. Comparable cases abound.[^70]

Quite apart from military desertion, the social historian could profitably examine the role of petty tax resistance in producing, over time, the fiscal crisis of the state that frequently presages radical political change. Here, too, without intending it, the small self-serving acts of thousands of petty producers may deprive a regime of the wherewithal to maintain its ruling coalition and prevail against its enemies. Short of revolution, there is little doubt that massive peasant non-compliance has been the force primarily responsible for major shifts in agrarian policy in even the socialist nations of the third world.[^71] A skeptic might well grant the case made thus far and nevertheless insist on distinguishing _principled_ (self-conscious?), _organized, political_ activity from the sorts of resistance analyzed here, which might be termed _opportunistic, unorganized_, and _pre-political_. It is certainly true that everyday forms of resistance all involve immediate self-interested behavior. The English poacher of the eighteenth century may have been resisting the gentry’s claim to property in game, but he was also interested in rabbit stew. The French and Malay peasants who conceal or misreport their harvests may be protesting the tithe and the zakat, but they are also interested in feeding their families until the next harvest. The peasant conscript who deserts may be a war resister, but he is just as surely interested in saving his skin. Compared to protest or to rebellion, everyday resistance aims at an immediate and personal gain in a fashion that minimizes the risks of open confrontation. Distinctions among forms of resistance, between social movements and pre-political activities, are no doubt necessary in explaining how various kinds of resistance are related to one another and to the system of domination in which they occur. My quarrel is not with the distinctions themselves but rather with the tendency to assign greater historical priority and weight to the organized and political than to everyday resistance, a position that, in my view, fundamentally misconstrues the very basis of economic and political struggle conducted daily by subordinate classes—not just the peasantry—in repressive settings.

Let us first address the issue of immediate self-interest versus principled action. To ignore—or to relegate to some lower realm—the self-interested element in peasant resistance is to ignore the determinate context of peasant politics. It is precisely the fusion of short-run self-interest and resistance that provides the motive force of peasant movements. Thus it is no coincidence that cries of “bread,” “land,” and “no taxes,” which often form the core of peasant rebellions, are each joined to the basic material survival needs of the peasant household. We need assume no more than an understandable desire on the part of the peasant household to persist—to ensure its physical safety, its food supply, its necessary cash income—to identify the source of its resistance to the claims of press gangs, tax collectors, and landlords.[^72] The intrinsic nature and, in a sense, the beauty of much peasant resistance lie in its capacity to confer immediate and concrete material advantages while at the same time denying resources to the appropriating classes _and_ in its requirement of little or no manifest organization. Class conflict is, first and foremost, a struggle over the appropriation of work, production, property, and taxes. The stubbornness of resistance owes its force to shared material interests.[^73]

To assign organized political action a priority over everyday forms of resistance is myopic for several reasons. The first and most obvious is that the sphere of organized political activity is preeminently the preserve of elites, the intelligentsia, and the middle classes, who enjoy something of a monopoly of institutional skills and access. It would be naive to expect peasant political activity to take the same form.

Nor should we forget that the forms of peasant political action are not simply a product of the social ecology of the peasantry. The parameters of resistance are also set, in large part, by the institutions of repression. To the degree that they do their work effectively, these institutions may all but preclude any form of politics other than the individual, the informal, the clandestine.[^74] It may still be important to distinguish between forms of resistance: formal—informal, individual—collective, public–anonymous, and those with revolutionary claims versus those seeking marginal gains. But it should be made crystal clear that what we may actually be measuring with these distinctions is the anticipated level of repression that structures the available options. More than one peasantry has been brutally reduced from open, radical political activity at one moment to stubborn and sporadic acts of petty resistance at the next. We may still wish to call only the former “popular movements,” but in doing so we simply permit the structure of domination to define for us what is a popular movement and what is not a popular movement.

Finally, everyday resistance may be an aggregate of individual actions, but this is not to say that they are uncoordinated. Here again, a concept of coordination or organization derived from formal, institutionalized settings is of little use in understanding action in small communities with dense informal networks and historically deep subcultures of resistance to outside claims.[^75] It is no exaggeration to say that much of the folk culture of the peasant “little tradition” amounts to a legitimation—even a celebration—of the evasive and dissimulating forms of resistance examined here.[^76] In this and other ways the subculture of the peasantry helps to create a “climate of opinion” that often underwrites tax evasion, poaching, theft, avoidance of conscription, and so forth. No formal organization is created because none is required; and yet a form of coordination is achieved which alerts us that what is happening is not merely individual action.

Let us return briefly to the question of intention. For many forms of peasant resistance, we have every reason to expect that the actors will remain mute about their intentions. Their safety may depend on silence and anonymity; the kind of resistance may depend for its effectiveness on the appearance of conformity. Their intentions may be so embedded in the peasant subculture and in the routine, taken-for-granted struggle for subsistence as to remain inarticulate. The fish do not talk about the water.

When it comes to those social settings where the vital material interests of the appropriating classes are directly in conflict with those of the peasantry (for example, rents, wages, employment, taxes, conscription), we can, I think, infer something of intention from the actions themselves. This is especially the case when the actions—as in the case of the zakat or the tithe—constitute a systematic pattern of behavior that mitigates or denies a claim on the surplus of subordinate classes. Direct evidence about intention is, of course, always welcome. Malay peasants make it abundantly clear that they pay only as much of the zakat as they must, and that, given the opportunity, they would defy the _zakat raja_ altogether. By the same token, they make no revolutionary claims. This is hardly surprising since even the rank-and-file proletariat in manifestly revolutionary situations of the twentieth century have not held revolutionary sentiments.[^77] Here we return again to Hobsbawm’s observation that the goal of the peasantry is typically to “work the system to their minimum disadvantage.” The pursuit of this end, depending on the circumstances, may entail the petty resistance we have seen or more dramatic actions of self-defense. It may backfire, it may marginally alleviate exploitation, it may force a renegotiation of class relations, and it may, more rarely, help bring the system down. These, however, are possible consequences. The intention, by contrast, is nearly always survival and persistence.6

**THE STATE’S GRIP ON THE VERNACULAR WORLD**

The foundation of power for all early states depended essentially on grain and manpower. The state was defended by men and they had to be fed; the artisans, priests, masons, potters, and aristocrats around the court center depended on a reliable supply of foodstuffs from beyond the city walls. Much of early statecraft involved counting. The bulk of the cuneiform tablets from the Tigris and Euphrates valley civilizations are tallies: so many bushels of millet, so many ewes, so many cubits of lumber, so many conscripts or laborers—tracking commercial contracts, corvée labor, and, above all, the collection of taxes.

And yet the societies from which these states extracted resources were largely _illegible_ to officials. How were the agents of the state to begin measuring and codifying the population, the arable land, the livestock, the wealth, the harvests year by year, the volume of commerce of each region of an entire kingdom? It was, of course, in the interest of the kingdom’s population to resist being “assessed” and when assessed to misrepresent its condition to minimize the crown’s exactions. Thus, much wealth was hidden, newly opened land was not declared to the tax man, village and district populations were minimized in local reports to lessen head taxes and conscription quotas. The state faced everyday forms of resistance, and sometimes violence, when it attempted to assess and tax its fiscal base.

Assuming that the state could overcome this resistance, it still faced formidable obstacles because of the vernacular practices of local societies. Let’s say the state wished to conduct that classical exercise in tax-craft, the cadastral survey. What unit of land measurement should it use? In much of the world, land is not measured by surface area but by productivity. The Irish speak of a “farm of two cows”; in poor areas that would mean a larger area than in richer lands. Telling an Irishman that this is a twenty hectare farm is like telling a scholar that he has been given twenty kilos of books! The _mu_, a traditional unit of land measurement in China, was, on the same principle, smaller where the land was rich and larger where it was poor. In eighteenth century Germany and France a unit of farmland was often measured by how long it took to plow (longer in stony steep soil) or how much seed it required to plant (less in richer soil). The bushel in ancien régime France varied greatly from region to region. Even in the same place, for example, landlords might use a smaller bushel in giving out grain loans and a larger bushel for repayment. The practice of measurement was thoroughly infused with both vernacular interests and with power relations.

Statecraft proved difficult in these conditions of vernacular measures and vernacular resistance to assessment. As a colleague of mine once put it, such states were all thumbs and no fingers. That is, they could make only clumsy gross interventions to grab conscripts and extract grain; they lacked the sort of precise knowledge that would have allowed them to calibrate their exactions to the varying capacity of the underlying population to deliver. As a result they might, at times of dynastic weakness, tax the population very lightly and, at times of dynastic strength or in time of war, press the population beyond its endurance. Tax rebellions, perhaps the most common form of unrest in pre-modern states, were the major consequence of the state’s blindness to the actual economic and demographic conditions of its people.

It is no exaggeration to claim that the conquest of illegibility is the most momentous achievement of the modern state. This required the standardization of weights and measures against determined local resistance. It required elaborate censuses and population rolls, cadastral surveys of landed property, and, not least, the institution of individual freehold property adapted to cadastral science. The project of legibility allowed the state to “see” the human activity of interest to it through the simplified approximation of documents, lists, and statistics: tax proceeds, lists of taxpayers, names, addresses, land records, average incomes, unemployment numbers, mortality rates, trade and productivity figures, disease rates, etc., etc.

An illegible society is a hindrance to any effective intervention by the state, whether that intervention is plunder or public welfare. As long as the state’s interest was largely confined to grabbing a few tons of grain and rounding up a few conscripts, its relative ignorance of the underlying society need not be fatal. When, however, the state’s objective requires changing the daily habits (say, with respect to hygiene or health practices) and work performance (say, quality labor or machine maintenance) of its citizens, or arresting dissidents, such ignorance can be disabling. A thoroughly legible society (never fully achieved) eliminates local monopolies of information and creates a kind of national transparency through the uniformity of codes, identities, statistics, regulations, and measures. At the same time, it is likely to create new positional advantages for those at the apex who have the knowledge and access to decipher the new state-created format.

How was the state to identify and locate a particular subject? Here, the obstacle was vernacular naming practices that were the personal counterpart of vernacular measurements. Every culture had its own unique naming practices: names might be changed at various life stages; most names did not indicate lines of descent except for the father; many names did not signal gender; and many people had multiple names, each specific to a particular audience or situation. Until quite recently (with the striking exception of Qin China) permanent patronyms (permanent surnames) were absent. The invention of the permanent patronym was, I argue, a state invention, an early form of official identity necessary for police work, tax rolls, cadastral surveys, conscription, and legally enforced contracts. They were, like the standardization of weights and measures, an essential state technology for making the population individually legible. There are many countries where permanent patronyms have not yet prevailed (e.g., Malaysia, Burma, Indonesia, part of the Middle East), countries where they are very recent (e.g., Turkey, Indonesia, Iran), and at least one country where they are, for folkloric reasons, expressly prohibited (Iceland). In the essay “The Production of Legal Identities Proper to States: The Case of the Permanent Family Surname” I aim to show how the technology of permanent patronyms was crucial to making citizens and subjects legible to the state and represented a lineal ancestor of the modern photo identity card and its more discerning progeny: fingerprints, iris scans, and DNA typing.7

**THE PRODUCTION OF LEGAL IDENTITIES PROPER TO STATES**

The case of the permanent family surname

We name a thing and—bang!—it leaps into existence. Each name a perfect equation with its roots. A perfect congruence with its reality. (Yolland and Owen)

But remember that words are signals, counters. They are not immortal. And it can happen—to use an image you’ll understand—it can happen that a civilisation can be imprisoned in a linguistic contour which no longer matches the landscape of…fact. (Hugh)

I’ll decode you yet. (Yolland)[^1]

**Introduction**

State naming practices and local, customary naming practices are strikingly different. Each set of practices is designed to make the human and physical landscape _legible_, by sharply identifying a unique individual, a household, or a singular geographic feature. Yet they are each devised by very distinct agents for whom the purposes of identification are radically different. Purely local, customary practices, as we shall see, achieve a level of precision and clarity—often with impressive economy—perfectly suited to the needs of knowledgeable locals. State naming practices are, by contrast, constructed to guide an official “stranger” in identifying unambiguously persons and places not just in a single locality, but in many localities, using standardized administrative techniques.

**_There is no state-making without state-naming_**

To follow the progress of state-making is, among other things, to trace the elaboration and application of novel systems which name and classify places, roads, people, and, above all, property. These state projects of legibility overlay, and often supersede, local practices. Where local practices persist, they are typically relevant to a narrower and narrower range of interaction within the confines of a face-to-face community.

A contrast between local names for roads and state names for roads will help illustrate the two variants of legibility. There is, for example, a small road joining the towns of Durham and Guilford in the state of Connecticut (USA). Those who live in Durham call this road (among themselves) the “Guilford Road,” presumably because it informs the inhabitants of Durham exactly where they’ll get to if they travel it. The same road, at its Guilford terminus, is called the “Durham Road” because it tells the inhabitants of Guilford where the road will lead them. One imagines that at some liminal midpoint the road hovers between these two identities. Such names work perfectly well; they each encode valuable local knowledge, i.e., perhaps the most important fact one might want to know about a road. That the same road has two names, depending on one’s location, demonstrates the situational, contingent nature of local naming practices. Informal, “folk” naming practices not only produce the anomaly of a road with two or more names; they also produce many different roads with the same name. Thus, the nearby towns of Killingworth, Haddam, Madison, and Meriden each have roads leading to Durham which the inhabitants locally call the “Durham Road.”

Now imagine the insuperable problems that this locally effective folk system would pose to an outsider requiring unambiguous identifications for each road. A state road repair crew, sent to fix potholes on the “Durham Road,” would have to ask, “Which Durham Road?” Thus it is no surprise that the road between Durham and Guilford is reincarnated on all state maps and designations as “Route 77.” Each micro-segment of that route, moreover, is identified by means of telephone pole serial numbers, milestones, and township boundaries. The naming practices of the state require a synoptic view, a standardized scheme of identification generating mutually exclusive and exhaustive designations.[^2] And, this system can work to the benefit of state residents: if you have to be rescued on Route 77 by a state-dispatched ambulance team, you will be reassured to know that there is no ambiguity about which road it is that you are bleeding on.

All place names, personal names, and names of roads or rivers encode important knowledge. Some of that knowledge is a thumbnail history: e.g., Maiden Lane (the lane where five spinster sisters once lived), Cider Hill Road (the road up the hill where the Cider Mill and orchard once stood), Cream Pot Road (once the site of a dairy where neighbors went to buy milk, cream, and butter). At one time, when the name became fixed, it was probably the most relevant and useful name for local inhabitants. Other names refer to geographical features: Mica Ridge Road, Bare Rock Road, Ball Brook Road. The sum of roads and place names in a small place, in fact, amounts to something of a local geography and history if one knows the stories, features, episodes, and family enterprises encoded within them.[^3]

For officials who require a radically different form of order, such local knowledge, however quaint, is illegible. It privileges local knowledge over synoptic, standardized knowledge. In the case of colonial rule, when the conquerors speak an entirely different language, the unintelligibility of the vernacular landscape is a nearly insurmountable obstacle to effective rule. Renaming much of the landscape therefore is an essential step of imperial rule. This explains why the British Ordnance Survey of Ireland in the 1830s recorded and rendered many local Gaelic place names (e.g., Bun na hAbhann, Gaelic for “mouth of the river”) in a form (Burnfoot) more easily understood by the rulers.

The conflict between vernacular, local meaning in place names and a higherorder grid of synoptic legibility is, however, rather generic. It is heightened by cultural difference, but it rests ultimately on the divergent purposes for which a semantic order is created. In western Washington state, for example, county officials in the 1970s changed old street and road names (e.g., French Creek Grange Road, Rainwater Road, Picnic Road, Potato Road) to new names based on the comprehensive logic of serial numbers and compass directions (19th Avenue Northwest, 167th Avenue Southeast). The result was a standardized grid on which each house could be located with Cartesian simplicity.[^4] As the newspaper headline “Towns in Washington Bringing back the Poetry in Street Names” indicates, a small popular revolt had succeeded in recuperating the old street names to the consternation of planning officials whose geometry had enabled ambulances or firefighters to be dispatched with greater speed and reliability. For a planner, a transportation manager, a tax collector, or a police officer, the convenience of such a grid over vernacular practices is obvious. “With all these strange names, for an engineer like me, I go, ‘Aw, this is awful.’ With Killarney Place or Baloney Whatever, cul de sacs [_sic_] and circular streets, finding our way around is really difficult.”[^5]

**State-naming as state-making: the case of individual naming practices**

Like place names, permanent surnames help to chart the human topography of any region. Names play a vital role in determining identities, cultural affiliations, and histories; they can help fracture or unify groups of people. They represent an integral part of knowledge-power systems. Here we study surnames as a social construct—a system of knowledge spun in the webs of power. Although most Westerners take their existence for granted, fixed, hereditary surnames are modern inventions. Through a comparative analysis, we will argue that the use of inherited familial surnames represents a relatively recent phenomenon intricately linked to growing state control over individuals and the development of modern legal systems and property regimes. In particular, the creation and diffusion of inheritable surnames represented a critical tool in the power struggle between local and outside authorities in the development of the modern nation-state, the emergence of ethno-nationalist identities, and the imposition of credible private property systems.

**_The problem of confusion_**

It is both striking and important to recognize how relatively little the pre-modern state actually knew about the society over which it presided. State officials had only the most tenuous idea of the population under their jurisdiction, its movements, its real property, wealth, crop yields, etc. Their degree of ignorance was directly proportional to the fragmentation of their sources of information. Local currencies and local measures of capacity (e.g., the bushel) and length (the ell, the rod, the toise) were likely to vary from place to place and with the nature of the transacting parties.[^6] The opacity of local society was, of course, actively maintained by local elites as one effective means of resistance to intrusions from above.

Having little synoptic, aggregate intelligence about the manpower and resources available to it, officials were apt either to overreach in their exactions, touching off flight or revolt, or to fail to mobilize the resources that were, in fact, available. To follow the process of state-making, then, is to follow _the conquest of illegibility_. The account of this conquest—an achievement won against stiff resistance—could take many forms, for example: the creation of the cadastral survey and uniform property registers, the invention and imposition of the meter, national censuses and currencies, and the development of uniform legal codes.

Here we examine what we take to be one crucial and diagnostic victory in this campaign for legibility: the creation of fixed, legal patronyms. If vernacular landscape-naming practices are opaque and illegible to outside officials, vernacular personal naming practices are even more so. The fixing of personal names, and, in particular, permanent patronyms, as legal identities seems, everywhere, to have been, broadly speaking, a state project. As an early and imperfect legal identification, the permanent patronym was linked to such vital administrative functions as tithe and tax collection, property registers, conscription lists, and census rolls. To understand why fixed, legal patronyms represent such a quantum leap in the legibility of a population to state officials, it is first necessary to understand the utter fluidity of vernacular naming practices untouched by state routines.

Vernacular naming practices throughout much of the world are enormously rich and varied.[^7] In many cultures, an individual’s name will change from context to context and, within the same context, over time. It is not uncommon for a newborn to have had one or more name changes _in utero_ in the event the mother’s labor seemed to be going badly. Names often vary at each stage of life (infancy, childhood, adulthood, parenthood, old age) and, in some cases, after death. Added to these may be names used for joking, rituals, mourning, nicknames, school names, secret names, names for age-mates or same-sex friends, and names for in-laws. Each name is specific to a phase of life, a social setting, or a particular interlocutor. To the question “What is your name?” the reply in such cases can only be: “It depends.”

In the small vernacular community, of course, this cornucopia of names occasions no confusion whatsoever. Local residents know the names they need to know, the codes appropriate to their use, the room for maneuver within these codes, and the ways in which these codes might be transgressed. They are rarely in doubt about who is who.

How is local confusion avoided in the absence of permanent patronyms? Let us take the simplest case where there are a small number of fixed, given names (often called “first” or “Christian” names in Western Europe). It is claimed, for example, that around the year 1700 in England a mere eight given names accounted for nearly 90 percent of the total male population (John, Edward, William, Henry, Charles, James, Richard, Robert). Without permanent patronyms, local people had innumerable ways of unambiguously identifying any individual. A by-name, second-name, or (sur)name (not to be confused with a permanent patronym) was usually sufficient to make the defining distinction. One “John,” for example, might be distinguished from another by specifying his father’s name (“William’s John” or “John-William’s-son”/Williamson)[^8]—by linking him to an occupation (“John-the-miller,” “John-the-shepherd”)—by locating him in the landscape (“John-on-the-hill,” “John-by-the-brook”)—or by noting a personal characteristic (John-do-little). The written records of the manor or the parish might actually bear notations of such by-names for the sake of clarity.

Local practice in a contemporary Malay-Muslim village, where there are no permanent patronyms and where the number of given names is similarly limited, follows much the same pattern. Kasim who owns a small store is distinguished from four other Kasims in the village by being called “Kasim-kedai” (“store” Kasim); Ahmad who can read the Koran is called “Lebai-[Ah]mat” (“teacher” Ahmad); Mansor who was once tripped up when his sarong fell down while chasing children is called, only behind his back of course, “Mansur-terlondeh” (Mansor of the accidentally falling sarong), and Zakariah who has a harelip is called, also behind his back, “[Zakar]iah-rabit” (“Torn” Zakariah). In this Malay-Muslim village, each of these names is locally, but _only_ locally, definitive; only a relative insider is likely to know who has the village reputation for laziness, who can recite the Koran, who tripped on his sarong, or which John is William’s son. The vernacular system is perfectly discriminating for those with the requisite local knowledge to understand each reference. Without a “local-tracker” to fill in the missing information for identification, the outsider is at a loss.

The vernacular communities of the past, in part because of their autonomous naming practices, were quasi-opaque to state officials. Access to individuals was typically achieved indirectly through intermediaries: the local nobleman, the village headman, the imam or the parish priest, the tavern keeper, the notary. Such intermediaries, naturally, had their own individual and corporate interests. They might profit handsomely from their gate-keeping role. In any case, their interests were never perfectly coincident with those of state officials and frequently at cross-purposes. It is for such reasons that locally kept census rolls have often under-reported the population (to evade taxes, corvée labor, or conscription) and understated both arable land acreage and crop yields. Wilfred Thesiger, in his classic account of the Marsh Arabs in southern Iraq, provides an instructive example of how official ignorance of local identities might be deployed for local purposes. The provincial police, acting as conscription officers, come to a marsh village with a list of thirty-two presumably eligible young men, two of whom they plan to take with them as recruits. Unable to identify anyone properly, the officials are told that the boys they seek are all either too young, have moved away, or have died. Instead they are given two young men whom village leaders had, all along, selected for them.[^9]

**_Remedies to illegibility: the taming of chance_**

The problem of naming and identification can be expressed generally. Let us imagine a police official (it could be a tax collector or a conscription officer) who is trying to locate a specific, unique individual. Assume further that he is faced with a situation not unlike that of a small English village in 1700, but with _no_ surnames, let alone fixed, patronymic surnames. Take a comparatively simple case of a village with, say, 1000 males each bearing only one of eight names which we shall assume are, for the sake of this initial case, perfectly evenly distributed across the (male) population. How likely, in this case, is our police official to collar the man he is after? If he knows he is looking for a “Henry,” there will be 125 “Henrys” in this village and 124 of them will be the wrong “Henry.” Without local assistance and under the assumption, for the sake of argument, that he actually knows the “true” given names of all villagers, he will almost surely fail. What if we imagine that all males in this village have _two names_, which vary independently? In this case, the chances that the police official will grab the wrong “Henry” are much reduced, but still substantial, as there will be about 15 “Henry Thomass,” 15 “William Jamess,” etc. Once we move to _three names_ (also varying independently), it is likely that the police official will get his man half the time on average. The opacity of the villagers to outside identification is reduced radically by the use of each additional identifying name.

Our hypothetical example is, in effect, a _best_ case scenario with only eight given names. Assume, for a moment, that the names are not evenly distributed; assume that the name, say, “William” is so popular that half the men in the village bear it, and the other seven names are evenly distributed among the remainder. In that case, the police agent, looking for a particular William, will face 285 aliases if the villagers have only a single name, 81 aliases in a village with two names, and 39 aliases in a village with three names.[^10] The point is that anything other than an even distribution of names appreciably raises the odds that the “suspect” with a more common name will elude identification.

If we impose, arbitrarily, on such a village a _permanent_ legal patronym such that Thomas son of William is registered as Thomas Williamson and his son as, say, Henry Williamson, and his son as, say, Edward Williamson, and so on, we do not improve the odds for the police who want to identify an individual in his generation but we _do_ vastly improve the odds of identifying his parents, grandparents, sons and daughters who must necessarily bear the same permanent patronym. Questions of inheritance, paternity, and household affiliation become far more transparent, but never entirely so.

Before the advent of internal passports, photographs, and social security numbers, personal names were the form of identification most germane to police work. The use of personal names to locate a person depended, of course, on the compliance of the individual and the community in revealing true names. Where the community was hostile and the individual evasive, state officials were stymied. Hence the official predilection for internal passports that must be carried at all times under penalty of fines, or, better yet, for fingerprints which are unique and hard to efface, or, still better, for DNA profiles, a unique marker present in any sample of tissue.

Let us assume, for the moment, both a high level of compliance and a world in which the personal name is the key “identifier.” The police—here used as a convenient shorthand for any authorities wanting to locate a specific individual—may have their task complicated in either of two ways. The smaller the number of names in use within a population, the more difficult becomes the process of identification. We might think of this as the “needle” part of the “looking for a needle in a haystack” problem. How many needles look just like the particular needle we are looking for? The size of the haystack—a problem of scale—is also crucial. Once police work becomes a matter of finding a unique individual in a large town, a province, let alone a nation, the confusion of identical names becomes an administrative nightmare. The nightmare is further compounded by geographical mobility, as we shall see. If people are moving with any frequency, it becomes well-nigh impossible to know in which of many haystacks to search them out.

The modern state—by which we mean a state whose ideology encompasses large-scale plans for the improvement of the population’s welfare—requires at least two forms of legibility to be able to achieve its mission. First, it requires the capacity to locate citizens uniquely and unambiguously. Second, it needs _standardized_ information that will allow it to create _aggregate_ statistics about property, income, health, demography, productivity, etc. Although much of the synoptic, aggregate information that officials of the modern state require is collected initially from individuals, it must be collected in a form that makes it amenable to an overall statistical profile—a shorthand map of some social or economic condition relevant for state purposes.

Officials of the modern state—and of large organizations generally—are, of necessity, at least one step removed from the society they are charged with governing. They “see” the human activity of interest to them largely through the simplified approximations of documents and statistics: tax proceeds, lists of tax-payers, land records, average income, income distributions, mortality rates and tables, price and productivity figures. Once in place the tools of legibility and synoptic vision are readily deployed as the basis for gauging the progress of an “improving” state.[^11] Thus do trends in statistics on accidents, fertility, mortality, employment, literacy levels, and consumer-durable ownership serve as indices of the success of state policy. Programs of improvement, even more than mere identification, require a discriminating set of techniques to locate individuals and classify them according to the relevant criteria. The more intrusive and discriminating the level of intervention contemplated, the sharper the tools of legibility required. The demographic knowledge resources necessary, for example, to conduct a vaccination campaign during an epidemic or to identify and locate all residents of a city who have engineering degrees or who have children with speech defects are cases in point.

The importance of statistics and measurement to legibility alerts us to the fact that permanent patronyms are, as we have emphasized, only one of a larger series of state practices collectively designed to take a relatively illegible world of vernacular meaning and recast it in terms that are synoptically visible. The case of uniform, standardized measures and the cadastral survey might as readily illustrate how the legibility of names nests, logically, with other state-making initiatives.

**_Permanent patronyms and the state: origins_**

Before the fourteenth century, if we confine our attention to Europe, permanent patronyms were very much the exception.[^12] Surnames designating, say, an occupation or some personal characteristic were widespread, but they did not survive the bearer. The rise of the permanent patronym is inextricably associated with those aspects of state-making in which it was desirable to be able to distinguish individual (male) subjects: tax collection (including tithes), conscription, land revenue, court judgments, witness records, and police work.[^13]

All of these activities require more or less elaborate lists. So it is hardly surprising that it is through such documents that the effort to render the population and its genealogy legible is best traced. The census (or _catasto_) of the Florentine state in 1427 was an audacious (and failed) attempt to rationalize the administration of revenue and manpower resources by recording the names, wealth, residences, landholdings, and ages of the city-state’s inhabitants. At the time, virtually the only Tuscan family names were those of a handful of great families (e.g., Strozzi) whose kin, including affines, adopted the name as a way of claiming the backing of a powerful corporate group. The vast majority were identified reasonably unambiguously by the registrars, but _not_ by personal patronyms. They might list their father and grandfather in the biblical fashion (e.g., Luigi, son of Paulo, son of Giovanni)[^14] or they might add a nickname, a profession, or a personal characteristic. It is reasonably clear that what we are witnessing, in the _catasto_ exercise, are the first stages of an administrative crystallization of personal surnames. And the geography of this crystallization traced, almost perfectly, the administrative presence of the Florentine state. While one-third of the households in the city declared a second name, the proportion dropped to one-fifth in secondary towns, and then to a low of one-tenth in the countryside. The small, tightly knit vernacular world had no need for a “proper name”: such names were, for all practical purposes, official names confined to administrative life. Many of the inhabitants of the poorest and most remote areas of Tuscany—those with the least contact with officialdom—only acquired family names in the seventeenth century. Nor were fifteenth-century Tuscans in much doubt about the purpose of the exercise; its failure was largely due to their foot-dragging and resistance. As the case of Florence illustrates, the naming project, like the standardization of measurements and cadastral surveys, was very much a purposeful state mission.

**_England, Scotland, and Wales: private property, primogeniture, and law enforcement_**

Even in England and Scotland, where patronyms took several centuries to develop, there was a method to the madness. If patronyms emerged solely for local, individual recognition purposes, then a system of non-hereditary secondary appellations would have sufficed. However, the surname system that emerged involved the use of hereditary and fixed last names. This fact is crucial to understanding the importance of patronyms with respect to the state. Indeed, the development of patronyms helped enforce private property rights, advance primogeniture regimes, and secure the ability of the state to make its subjects legible to its gaze.

The use of last names did not become common until well after the Norman Conquest. Social norms developed by the twelfth century dictated that it was a disgrace for a proper gentleman not to have a last name.[^15] The use of patronyms then spread, albeit unevenly, with the implementation of the poll tax under Richard II[^16] and the legal requirement of baptismal registration by Henry VIII.

A closer analysis of the process of surname diffusion also reveals the link between the English naming system and the securing of private property rights. In a bargain that replicates itself in many other nations, the aristocracy gained security for their property rights by adopting heritable patronyms. Their new legal identity was a political resource in their claim to property in land and office. By the middle of the thirteenth century, a large proportion of large and medium landowners in England possessed hereditary last names. An examination of Exchequer and Chancery records listing feudal landholders reveals that most of these patronyms were derived from the lands possessed by their bearers.[^17]

It is significant to note that, in the century or two following the reign of William the Conqueror, there was a great deal of uncertainty regarding the status of large land grants made by the king. As Richard McKinley notes:

How far his grants were grants of property in fee and inheritance was perhaps not clear. In these circumstances, anything which helped to stress the hereditary character of tenure was likely to be viewed with favour by landowners, and the acquisition of a hereditary patronym especially one derived from a landed family’s estates, would obviously have this effect…[Thus, the adoption of patronyms was] part of a general trend from them to the consolidation of their position as hereditary property owners.[^18]

The link between land and last names is further emphasized by the types of names introduced by the Normans when they invaded Britain: they were almost all territorial in derivation. Indeed,

[t]he followers of William the Conqueror were a pretty mixed lot, and while some of them brought the names of their castles and villages in Normandy with them, many were adventurers of different nationalities attracted to William’s standard by the hope of plunder, and possessing no family or territorial names of their own. Those of them who acquired lands in England were called after their manors, while others took the name of the offices they held or the military titles given to them, and sometimes a younger son of a Norman landowner on receiving a grant of land in his new home dropped his paternal name and adopted that of his newly acquired land.[^19]

Patterns of surname adoption also reveal a close link between primogeniture and naming practices. For example, during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries it was not uncommon that a senior branch of a family would continue to use the hereditary surname while the junior branches would adopt new patronyms, since they no longer had any property right in the main family estate.[^20] Furthermore, the reorganization of the system of land ownership, the establishment of a formal system of primogeniture, and the development of inherited copy-hold tenure for manorial land under the reign of Edward I helped to accelerate the use of last names. The last name became, in this context, another way of displaying paternity and, hence, inheritance rights. More generally, the adoption of permanent patronyms retraced, geographically, the growing presence of the Crown and its agents. It occurred “sooner among the upper classes than the lower, and sooner in the south than the north,”[^21] sooner in the large towns than in the countryside. The greater the contact with the Crown-crafted world of documents, rolls, taxes, conscription, wills, and deeds, the greater the need for unambiguous designations.

On rare occasions, one gets a glimpse, like a fly caught in amber, of the state-based process of crystallization. A Welshman who appeared before an English judge in the early sixteenth century, during the reign of Henry VIII, was asked his name. He replied, in the Welsh fashion, “Thomas Ap [son of] William, Ap Thomas, Ap Richard, Ap Hoel, Ap Evan Vaughan.” He was reprimanded by the judge to “leave the old manner…whereupon he after called himself Moston, according to the name of his principal house, and left that name to his posteritie.”[^22] One imagines, however, that this newly minted administrative last name remained all but unknown to Thomas’s neighbors.

This small episode from Wales alerts us to the fact that local, vernacular appellations persist and co-exist, often for long periods, alongside official naming practices. Each name is appropriate to a particular sphere of social relations, certain encounters, and situations. Local naming practices rarely if ever disappear completely; instead, they remain relevant to a diminishing social sphere. The slippage between official naming and vernacular practice is apparent in the institution of the telephone book in countries where permanent patronyms are recent creations.[^23] As encounters grow with the extra-local world, the world of official documents and lists (e.g., tax receipts, military eligibility lists, school documents, property deeds and inventories, birth, marriage and death certificates, internal passports, court decisions, legal contracts), so also does the social circumference of official patro-nyms. Large segments of social life that might previously have been successfully navigated without documents, and according to customary practice, are now impossible without the paper trail, stamps, signatures, and forms on which the authorities insist. The state creates irresistible incentives for calling oneself after its fashion.

**_Citizenship, identity, and state administration_**

The logic and geography of the adoption of surnames and, later, permanent patro-nyms in France were little different than in England or Florence. In medieval Languedoc, for example, only a few names (Guillaume, Bernard, Raimond, Pierre, Pons) might designate three quarters of the male population. Nobles increasingly adopted surnames (not yet a _nom de famille_) to distinguish the eldest, inheriting son. In this fashion, the use of surnames and, later, stable _noms de famille_ proliferated, first among the nobility, in the large towns, and among the propertied. The professional agent of this transformation was the _notaire_ who functioned as the local record-keeper and for whom precision of identity was essential.[^24] The fifteenth century case of Marin Guerre, made famous in film, is precisely about the great difficulty of establishing identities, especially among mobile populations. When, much later, birth certificates became more common, it was forbidden for a subject to change his or her name without permission from the Crown.

More broadly, the link between state-making and state-naming is so strong that one might, in fact, use the synoptic legibility of permanent, registered patronyms as a reliable proxy for the degree of state presence. Here a long-run, time-elapse record would show the fissures and breakpoints of state saturation. That record would show, for Britain, that projects of legibility tended to stumble in the hills, where they encountered ecologies and populations that were distinct culturally and linguistically. The hills were, as Braudel has emphasized, bastions of relatively autonomous local societies.

For there man can live out of reach of the pressures and tyrannies of civilization, its social and political order, its monetary economy. Here there was no landed nobility with…powerful roots…There was no tight urban network, so no administration, no towns in the proper sense of the word, and no gendarmes we might add…The hills were the refuge of liberty, democracy, and peasant republics.[^25]

Inaccessibility, demographic dispersal, poverty, and active resistance meant that permanent patronyms (not to mention standardized place names) came late to the hills of Wales and Scotland. The higher the hills, the further from lowland centers of administration, the later their arrival. At the risk of overgeneralization, it might be said that the more precocious the state-making, the earlier the appearance of permanent patronyms.[^26] Thus they appear comparatively early in Italy, France, and England and later in Sweden, Germany, Norway, and Turkey. In many colonized countries, it occurred even later; in some cases it has hardly begun.[^27] _Within_ each political context, it is reasonably clear that the permanent patronym radiates out from the administrative center at a tempo that is conditioned by “stateness”: first in the capital, first at the top of the status ladder, first in modern institutions (e.g., schools) and last in marginal areas (mountains, swamps), among the lower classes, among the marginalized and stigmatized.

Once deeds, wills and testaments, property transfers, and certain contracts are subject to state validation, there are powerful incentives for becoming a legible subject. And yet, at the same time, the classic fear of the state as taxer and conscriptor continued to provide much of the population with good reasons for remaining illegible. As late as 1753, the British Parliament defeated a census bill over fears of more taxation and, five years later, a bill for the “mandatory registration of births, marriages, and deaths.” Contrast this effective resistance in England with the Crown’s colonial policy in Ireland nearly a century earlier when William Petty conducted a comprehensive survey of land, buildings, people, and cattle in order to facilitate seizure and control. Where autocracy or conquest permit state officials to pursue projects of legibility, unhampered by consultation, they are likely to proliferate earlier and more extensively, though they may provoke resistance and rebellion.

War, because of the exceptional demands it makes on the mobilization of resources, is the great handmaiden of all forms of legibility, including permanent patronyms. Mobilization for war, as Charles Tilly demonstrates, impelled the early modern state to abandon indirect, tributary rule through powerful, and often recalcitrant, intermediaries and, instead, directly seize the military resources it needed.[^28] What the state requires, of course, is far more than just conscripts (who are, hopefully, unambiguously identified). Fielding a 60,000-man army in the late seventeenth century would have required, for its men and its 40,000 horses, nearly a million pounds of food a day: a quartermaster’s nightmare. The task demanded impressive feats of organization and expenditure. The mere grain needed to keep this army in the field, let alone armed and clothed, cost the equivalent of the wages of 90,000 ordinary laborers. This last requirement meant taxation nets of finer and finer mesh to enumerate real property, wealth, commercial exchange, and above all the individuals who would bear the responsibility for paying and fighting.

**_Modern citizenship and statecraft: the uneasy bargain_**

If state-making for the purposes of taxation, police control, and war were the great incentives to projects of legibility in ancient regimes everywhere, the rise of democratic citizenship and modernist social engineering required entirely new forms of legibility. The reach of the modern state, together with its ambitions to social reform, gave rise to state lenses with far greater resolving power than any premodern regime.

The great emancipatory step of the French Revolution’s Declaration of Human Rights created a new subject/citizen. Whereas, before, even the most intrusive absolutist regimes were obliged to work through social intermediaries—clergy, nobles, and wealthy burgers—the revolutionary regime sought a direct, unmediated relationship to the citizen. This new citizen was an abstract, unmarked individual who was the bearer of equal rights before the law. Universal citizenship implied in turn that a citizen be uniquely and reliably distinguishable _as an individual_ and not as a member of a community, manor, guild, or parish. Universal rights signified in turn universal duties vis-à-vis the state—duties which included direct, universal conscription and taxation.

This extension of citizenship, coupled with legibility, was part and parcel of the internationalization of the French Revolution carried by the forces of Napoleon. Prussia’s law, passed in 1812, encouraged the adoption of patronyms by all members of the Jewish faith. Ostensibly in the progressive spirit of the Enlightenment, the Jewish population would receive citizenship in exchange. The connection between universal citizenship and the taking of a name proper to a legal state identity is nowhere clearer than for the Jews in Central Europe. Despite the widespread use of fixed and hereditary patronyms in Europe by the nineteenth century, one key group lacked last names—the Ashkenazim. The nomadic, Yiddish-speaking Jewish population of Central and northern Europe, the Ashkenazim, had managed to retain their ancient patronymic system since the biblical era. However, during the nineteenth century, Austria, France, Prussia, Bavaria, and Russia all imposed modern surname systems on their Jewish populations. The motives for such policies varied, but generally focused on the adoption of a registered legal patronym as a condition of citizenship and emancipation. The new surname system enabled governments more easily to levy and collect taxes, regulate businesses, conscript for military service, and control movements,[^29] in return for which the Jewish population would receive full citizenship for its cooperation. Drawing on Prussian councilor-of-war Christian Wilhelm von Dohm’s memorandum “On the Civic Betterment of the Jews” from 1781, several plans were advanced to establish economic and legal equality for the Jewish population. Although these plans differed in a variety of ways, they all agreed on one point: “no proposed law fail[ed] to declare an official choice of name to be obligatory”[^30] for citizenship rights. Indeed, the eventual edict that passed gave the Jewish population citizenship in Prussia but only if they bore firmly fixed patronyms.

Soon after 1812, more insidious motives came to light. As Dietz Bering points out, “immediately after the Jews had chosen fixed surnames, attempts were made to secure via the names the dwindling recognizability of the Jews as Jews.”[^31] The liberality of the 1812 edict gave way to a new law passed on 22 December 1833 which required all Jews to adopt a surname, not just those who sought naturalization. Furthermore, the government took steps to assure that previously adopted last names by the Jewish population were in line with newly adopted ones. Government appointed committees forced the Jewish population to accept patronyms that the government chose for them, such as Himmelblau, Rubenstein, Bernstein, Hirsch, and Loew. Furthermore, numerous ministerial reports in the 1830s and 1840s demanded the enactment of a penal clause to prevent members of the Jewish faith from altering their last names. By 1845, laws were passed to render the Jewish patronym in Prussia a closed list. Jewish last names took upon an immutable quality. It was not long before “the Jews, for whom in 1812 the gates of the legal ghetto had been opened only half-heartedly and not even completely, were to be imprisoned again in another ghetto: one of names.”[^32]

By 1867, all loopholes were closed. A Royal Cabinet order signed on 12 July 1867 gave district presidents the right to confirm or deny any patronym changes that resulted from members of the Jewish faith converting to Christianity. The order made it increasingly difficult to alter a surname through religious conversion. Thus, the democratizing revolutions of 1848 and other reforms played a role both in emancipating and in controlling the population that had previously been illegible. The Prussian state wanted permanent patronyms not only to identify unique citizens, but also to code for religious background. When Germany implemented the Final Solution, the closed list of Jewish patronyms made the task of genocide terrifyingly simple.

By the mid-nineteenth century the idea of universal manhood suffrage was joined, in the West, with a high-modernist ideology requiring entirely novel levels of intervention in society. Once the improvement of society itself (its health, skills, well-being, intelligence, safety, community life, housing, morals, etc.) became an important state project, a wholly new level of legibility was required. It is one thing to round up a handful of recruits and seize part of the wheat harvest; it is quite another to vaccinate, block-by-block, the poorer quarters of a teeming city, to send disability checks to those (and only those) with a specific handicap, or to create an epidemiological database to identify rare diseases. High modernist intrusions typically require fine-grained, discriminating, unambiguous forms of identification. The preferences of administrators, left to their own devices, are nearly always _serial numbers_ of one kind or another: an infinite, discriminating, continuous series, simple to apply and designed for maximum synoptic legibility.

**_Two colonial cases_**

What happens when a modernizing state with large ambitions encounters a society that is administratively opaque? The starkest version of this encounter is met in colonial situations where an authoritarian, mobilizing state faces a society at once resistant and uncharted. Here, confronting a population with few, if any, formal rights to representation, state officials are free to invent schemes of naming that suit their ends, though implementing them successfully is another matter altogether.

We examine two such colonial cases, separated from one another by roughly a half century: the creation of permanent patronyms for Native Americans in the United States around the turn of the twentieth century and the attempt by the Canadian government to craft legible identities for the Inuit population in the 1950s. Each scheme, seemingly simple in conception, became in practice a baroque tangle of contradiction and confusion. The schemes were, of course, intended to create unambiguous (male) personal identities _legible to officials_. The immediate purposes animating each naming exercise varied: the Bureau of Indian Affairs was hoping to create and stabilize a new, private property regime and, not incidentally, seize more land from the reservations; the Canadian officials hoped to intervene more discriminatingly to promote their vision of welfare, health, and development. What the exercises share, however, is an overarching cultural project: to fashion and normalize a standard patriarchal family-system deemed suitable to their vision of citizenship, property rights, and civilized, moral conduct.

**_The renaming of Native Americans_**

The story of conquest, particularly in European settler colonies where the conquerors held overwhelming power, could be written as a vast project of renaming the natural world. Presto! Native names for flora, fauna, insects, mountains, valleys, birds were effaced and replaced by the nouns and taxonomies of the conquerors. This process, too, is a project of legibility, a transfer of knowledge in which the mystifying (to Europeans) hieroglyphics of native naming practices were replaced by imported practices transparent to Europeans and, now, mystifying to the conquered. Comprehensive re-labeling is a precondition for the transfer of power, management, and control.[^33]

Nowhere is this hegemonic project more apparent than in the effort to rename the individual “native subjects” of this colonial enterprise in a fashion that would allow the colonizers to identify each (male!) unambiguously as a legal person. To grasp the importance and scope of this undertaking, its function in promoting legibility, and its role as a civilizational discourse, it is helpful to appreciate just how illegible Native American naming practices were to Europeans.

_Illegibility_

Officials encountered, among “Indians,” what they considered a radical instability and plurality of names. As in many small stateless societies, a person would have several names dependent on the situation of address (e.g., among age-mates, between generations, among close kin) and these names would often change over time. A child who ran screaming into the teepee on seeing a bear might be called “Runs-from-the-Bear.” Later on, if she rides a horse from which others have been thrown, she might be called “Rides-the-Horse.” A hunter who was called “Five Bears” may be called “Six Bears” when he has killed another.[^34] Researchers tracing surname adoption among the Weagamow Ojibwa noted the plurality of names, in this case partly due to contact with Europeans. The same individual was variously known as Freed Smith, Banani, Nizopitawigizik, and Fredrick Sagachekipoo.[^35]

The plurality of names, as the previous example illustrates, was not simply a consequence of indigenous naming practices; it was substantially increased by overlapping jurisdictions and by problems of transliteration. An individual might have one or another of his names recorded by several authorities: a trading post clerk, a missionary, a tribal scribe, or a military or civilian administrator. Each name might be different and, if the people in question were migratory, the places of registration would vary. Imagine trying to pin down the identity of persons who have five or six names and who are constantly on the move![36](part0012.html#ch7en36-36) Here, of course, it is important to recall that the recording of names was either an attempt at translation into English (e.g., Six Bears) or a stab at transliteration for which there were no fixed rules. The results, in both cases, were names that bore an indifferent relationship to the indigenous appellation they purported to transcribe.[^37] In the case of translation, even an accurate one, the name became nothing more than a nonsense syllable for non-English speaking Indians. In the case of transliteration, the problems were compounded by large phonological differences between English and native tongues. Thus, in the case of the Severn Ojibwa, such differences produced exotic local renderings of English given names: e.g., Flora = Pinona; Hector = Ehkitah; Telma = Temina; Isabel = Saben; Amos = Thomas; Louise = Anoys.[^38] In the case of direct transliteration of the indigenous names of different persons, as among the Crow at the Devil’s Lake Agency in North Dakota, one imagines that the recorded names were only one of many possible phonetic renderings: “Eyaupahamini,” “Iyayahamani,” “Ecanajinka,” “Wiyakimaza,” “Wakauhotanina,” “Wasineasuwmani,” “Tiowaste.” Had there been standard rules for transliteration and had the recorders of names followed these rules rigorously, the results would have still been mystifying and unpronounceable to white officials.

There were two further problems from the point of view of government agents. First, even translated names that could be understood came in an incompatible format. Take, for example, the names “Barkley-on-the-other-side,” “Alice shoots-as-she-goes,” “Irvie comes out of fog” (Montana, Crow). The given name is clear, perhaps, but what should be taken as the surname: the whole phrase, the last word…?

Secondly, and more seriously, the indigenous naming system only rarely gave any indication of sex or family relationship. Among the Southern Cheyenne, the following “family names” were recorded:

The letter recording these names notes that they do not indicate the sex of the children; in fact, what the writer means is that, if sex is indicated, it is not a code that he understands. Even when translation into English names prevailed among the Cheyenne, they very rarely indicated roles in a nuclear family so prized by officials. Thus, “Crow Neck,” his “wife” “Walking Road,” their sons “Clarence Crow Neck,” “Rested Wolf,” and “Hunting Over.” On the Arapaho roll: “Bear Lariat,” his “wife” “Mouse,” sons “Sitting Man” and “Charles Lariat,” and daughter “Singing Above.” As we shall see, such illegible naming practices were unsuited to the twin normative legal requirements of civilized life: property ownership and marriage by law.

**_Property: the Dawes Act_**

The experience of Native Americans in the United States also suggests an intimate link among the consolidation of the modern nation-state, ethnic assimilation, the development of a private property regime, and the imposition of a European-style surname system. In their study of the Native Americans of the Oklahoma, Dakota, and Wyoming Territories, Daniel Littlefield and Lonnie Underhill examine the nature of this link in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.[^39] Prior to 1887, Native American tribes had held land in common. However, with the passage of the General Allotment Act of 1887, the United States government required Native Americans to receive individual title to land. Though represented as a proassimilation policy that would give Native Americans the ability to pursue the American Dream,[^40] the imposition of a private property regime actually condemned Native Americans caught in the reservation system to generations of poverty.[^41]

Just as significantly, the new regime also represented a major attack on the power of tribal authorities.[^42] Property rights accompanied the right to national citizenship, making the Native Americans subject to the law of the United States and not the laws of their tribe. Furthermore, with the elimination of common property rights, the tribal governments lost a major source of their power. The intermediary of the tribe was removed, allowing the United States government to directly control individual Native Americans.

So long as the administrative regime governing Native Americans resembled indirect rule—so long as the aims of white officials were containment and military security—their seemingly promiscuous and illegible naming practices were inconvenient, but not fatal. Officials worked through their own Indian employees and a handful of chiefs. They were dependent on “native-trackers” for detailed information or for locating a particular individual.

All of this changed with the Dawes Act of 1887, which authorized the President to allot 160 acres to each family head (presumptively a male) on a reservation. The title to the land would be held in trust for twenty-five years (apparently to prevent victimization of the new landowners by speculators) after which it would revert to the allottee and _his_ heirs. The goal, aside from seizing more tribal land for white settlers,[^43] was the cultural assimilation of Native Americans. “(A)fter receiving his allotment, which signified his severance from the tribe and its communal ways, he would become subject to the laws of the state or territory in which he resided.”[^44] In this sense, the Dawes Act was “a mighty pulverizing engine for the breaking up of the tribal mass.”[^45]

Now that many Native Americans would become property-owning citizens, no longer exclusively under tribal jurisdiction, but citizens with rights and obligations under the laws of the larger society, their illegibility as (male!) individuals was no longer acceptable. Native American naming practices were suitable for a common-property regime with a loose family structure and nomadic ways. They were not suitable for a newly created, sedentary, property-owning, tax-paying, citizen yeomanry. As legal persons, Native Americans now needed a legal identity proper to the state.

The immediate impetus behind a standardization of Indian names was the institution of private property in land. Allotments meant deeds, titles, cadastral surveys, and inheritance, and these, in turn, required an unambiguous legal identity—preferably one that reflected close kinship ties (i.e., the “normative” nuclear family). Reformers, who believed allotments were the route to a necessary and beneficial assimilation, were intent on avoiding the confusion and litigation that customary naming practices might encourage. They set about standardizing names to make sure that land was registered under an unambiguous identity: names with permanent patronyms that would reduce the legal confusion about exactly who a deceased landowner’s heirs were.

What is noteworthy here is the unavoidable, not to say coercive, logic joining standardized legal identities on the one hand and property ownership on the other. As one official wrote, the American system of naming was

a good system, for it fixes the name of each individual after an unvarying fashion, and establishes the same practically beyond alteration…We cannot see how it could be otherwise than it is. Furthermore, and what makes it so important, it is practically the only system known to American law, and it is impossible not to see that in all things, prominent among which is the transfer of property or the bequeathing of the same to heirs, trouble must come to those who disregard this system.[^46]

Once the allotments were decided on, a whole set of gears were inexorably set into motion. The process is a classic example of practical, systemic hegemony; after all, property deeds, land records, and property taxes require synoptic, standardized forms of identification.

The enormous diversity of Native American naming practices, varying degrees of contact and assimilation, and the huge variety of administrative arrangements under which they were governed created nearly insurmountable problems of illegibility. The “Poet of the Prairie,” Hamlin Garland, made “the naming of the Red Men as they became citizens” a personal mission, seeking the confidence of President Theodore Roosevelt in carrying it out successfully. Stressing the legal necessity of a legible surname system for private property purposes and promoting the assimilation of Native Americans into Anglo-American society, Garland brought the renaming project to the President’s attention on 1 April 1902.[^47] In a letter urging Roosevelt to place George Bird Grinnell (a naturalist and ethnographer of the Cheyenne) in charge of a committee to rename all Native Americans, he made his goals clear: he wanted to establish a secure legal identity for all Indians.

It is imperative that family names should be reasonable and according to some system. The whole list is an inextricable tangle…They must be named according to their family relation in order to prevent endless legal complication…The work should be done by a central committee and not by the various clerks of the agencies.[^48]

With Roosevelt’s blessing, Garland cooperated with various members of the executive branch to execute a thorough renaming project among the Native Americans residing in the Territories. The overriding concern with establishing a systematic, centralized formula for renaming was echoed by Commissioner of Indian Affairs Thomas J. Morgan in 1890. Although “the command to give names to the Indians and to establish the same as far as possible by continuous use had been part of the Rules and Regulations for years past,” it had not been widely applied or generalized.[^49] Morgan proposed general guidelines for the renaming exercise. A further regulation deplored the lackadaisical efforts to systematize and enforce the new names, which left in their wake a host of confusing, unpronounceable, and insulting patronyms. He further scolded both his subordinates and his Native American charges:

Such Indian agents and superintendents of Indian schools have not sought to impress the Indian people with the importance of having their names fashioned after the whites, consequently they have had in this direction the opposition instead of the cooperation of the Indians. In this thing, as in nearly all others, the Indians do not know what is best for them. They can’t see that our system has any advantages over their own, and they have fought stubbornly against the innovation.[^50]

Morgan, Grinnell, and Garland tried, by the standards of the time, to be as accommodating as they could to indigenous naming practices, _so long_ as they conformed to minimal standards of legibility. Morgan and Grinnell were not opposed to retaining Indian names providing that they were not “too difficult to pronounce.” The rub, of course, was that “difficult to pronounce” referred to the difficulty experienced by native English speakers. Otherwise English names and translations were to be substituted whenever the original name was long and/or difficult. Garland agreed. Easily spoken names such as “To-re-ach” or “Chonoh” might be retained, while others would require translation and, frequently, shortening as well. “Black Bull” might be shortened to “Blackbill” or “Blackbell”; “Standing Bull” to “Stanbull”; “Albert Spotted-Horse” to “Albert Spotted”; “Black Owl” to “Blackall”; “Brave Bear” to “Bravber.” A Christian “given name” was normally appended as a first name: e.g., “Charles Stanbull.” The Garland proposal aimed to make all names “decent and reasonable,” to show a legal connection to the family. Brevity, ease of pronunciation to whites, and “pleasantness” were emphasized values, all favoring legibility. Existing names would be adopted if they met this criterion. If not, family names might be abbreviated or even altered and spelling would be made uniform.[^51] As Garland noted, the point was that “_our_ Indians should be entirely renamed according to some general system, retaining the Indians’ own name whenever possible, shortening or modifying it so that it can be spoken by the Red Man’s neighbor, so that it name(s) all children after their father or a name chosen by their mother.” In short, he desired “a system which will show family relations, which will meet the wishes of the red people and be comprehensible to the white people.”[^52] The aim, Garland wrote, was to start each allottee with a decent and reasonable name—names that, when translated, seemed demeaning (e.g., “Ghost-Faced Woman,” “Drunkard,” “Let Them Have Enough,” “Nancy Kills a Hundred,” “Rotten Pumpkin”) were to be avoided.[^53]

**_The civilizational project_**

The renaming of Native Americans was a “civilizing project” in at least two respects. The first is most obvious. The “Red Man” was being inducted, through the Dawes Act, into a radically new life that would eventually lead, it was hoped, to complete assimilation. Just as the precondition of the emancipation and full citizenship of the Jews in Central Europe was the legal adoption of permanent patronyms along Christian lines, so was a fixed legal patronym a condition of post-reservation life. The creation of such a legal identity was the necessary “universal gear” which would then engage the other gears of the official machinery of the modern state.

In 1819, Congress had established a “Civilization Fund” to introduce the Indian to “the habits and arts of civilization.” In general, the fund’s goal was to transform what were seen (often mistakenly) as exclusively “hunting-and-gathering” cultures dependent on nomadism and communal ownership of land into a sedentary, agrarian (and artisan) society based on private property. The former condition, requiring bravery, shrewdness, and honor, was associated with savagery, whereas a settled life with cultivated property was seen as the handmaiden of civilization:

you may look forward to the period when the savage shall be converted to the citizen, when the hunter shall be transformed into the mechanic, when the farm, the workshop, the school-house, and the church shall adorn every Indian village; when the fruits of industry, good order, and sound morals shall bless every Indian dwelling.[^54]

As the Director of the Bureau of Ethnology John Wesley Powell reasoned, accomplishing this work required new names which “tend strongly toward the breaking up of the Indian tribal system, which is perpetuated and ever kept in mind by the Indian’s own system of names.”[^55] As a structure of physical confinement and surveillance, the reservation system was itself not conceived as a project of cultural autonomy but as a prelude to transformation. “Restricting the tribes to a limited and permanent area was a prerequisite to successfully civilizing them.”[^56]

The second civilizing project—one embedded in the formula for renaming the Indians—was the restructuring of the “family” to bring it into line with the normative patriarchy of their white Christian neighbors. Family and kinship practices varied widely among Native Americans, but it is safe to say that they rarely resembled the codified religious and legal forms of the dominant society.[^57] Plural and serial unions, child-rearing by the extended family, and changes in the composition of bands over time were common and only served to confirm the need for “civilizing” efforts.

The illegibility of Native American kinship nomenclature was frequently taken by the “would-be civilizers” as a direct indication of confusion and disorder among the Indians themselves about kinship relations, _not_ as a sign of a different kinship _order_. Just as the Spanish Governor General of the Philippines in 1847 imposed permanent patronyms on the premise that they would help Filipinos figure out who their cousins were (and avoid marrying them), so did the namers of the “Red Men” imagine that they were helping their charges sort out the primeval mess of their savage ways. Hamlin Garland, for example, supposed that the mere absence of a common patronym joining siblings was evidence “that each child stands alone in the world.”[^58] Writing of the Southern Cheyenne tribal roll, he declared: “The whole list is an inextricable tangle. For example, practically only one man can straighten out the family ramifications among the Southern Cheyenne.”[^59] It is not entirely clear whether Garland imagined that the Cheyenne themselves were in doubt about their relationship to one another; but it is clear that he believed that they, as well as the white man, would be thankful for a kinship terminology that clarified matters. Reading the correspondence and official circulars of the time makes it appear that the reformers believed that _if_ they just got the kinship terminology right, the actual practices of Native Americans would soon fall in line with white, “civilized” norms.[^60]

_Boarding schools_

Nowhere was the civilizational project more evident than in the boarding schools set up for Native American school children. The logic behind the boarding school was precisely the logic of the “total institution.” One might flail away at effecting small changes among masses of Native Americans on the reservation or, alternatively, concentrate on removing a smaller number of children of an impressionable age from the contaminating influence of the tribe and placing them in highly controlled, disciplinary surroundings. By a reduction in scale, one achieved a commensurate increase in micro-control of the environment. Here the new elites could be shaped from the ground up, Pygmalion-fashion.[^61] The results were also more legible: so many graduated, so many literate in English, so many taught certain crafts and mechanical skills, etc.

Like the military model they mimicked, school techniques were meant to be a shocking and comprehensive baptism. The clothes they arrived in were discarded and a “military kit” was issued in its place; their diet was changed to a Western one; their hair (often an important cultural badge) was forcibly cut; facial paint was forbidden; time discipline was imposed; conversation in native languages was severely punished; and, of course, new names were mandated. A Sioux memoir of naming in the boarding school captures the atmosphere:

The new recruit’s acquisition of a uniform was followed by the acquisition of a new name. Most often this occurred on the first day of instruction. In the case of Luther Standing Bear, he remembers that one day there were a lot of strange marks on the blackboard, which an interpreter explained were white-men’s names. One by one the students were asked to approach the blackboard with a pointer and were instructed to choose a name. When a name was selected, the teacher wrote it on a piece of white tape, which was then sewn on the back of the boy’s shirt. When Standing Bear’s turn came, he took the pointer and acted as if he were about to touch an enemy. By the end of the class, all the students had the name of a white man sewn on their backs. In the case of Luther Standing Bear, he needed only to choose a first name and was able to keep part of his Indian name in English translation. Not all the boarding school students had this luxury.[^62]

As in many utopian schemes of standardization, the project of renaming Native Americans was a messy affair. It was common for one authority to codify names without noting, in each case, the results of earlier naming exercises. Efforts to create new names in the boarding schools to indicate paternity were seldom coordinated with renaming on the reservation where the students’ fathers lived, thus leading to nearly hopeless confusion. Two brothers named in separate exercises might not be given the same last name. But, as in the case of the Philippines, over several decades, the frequency of contact with officialdom ensured that most Native Americans had legal names that conformed to the Anglo-American normative patriarchal order. Practice, of course, was something else again.

**_Serial numbers and synoptic order: the case of the Inuit_**

Roughly half a century after the Dawes Act, Canadian authorities set about identifying their most nomadic and illegible population: the Inuit. Thanks to the existence of one closely observed study,[^63] some comparisons with surname creation among Native Americans in the United States are possible. The similarities are more striking than the differences, which arise, it would seem, from Canada’s more developed and centralized federal administration.

The Inuit, like many Native American groups, had naming practices that, while perfectly adequate for Inuit purposes, baffled the officials in charge of ruling them. Most Inuit had a single name, one that might, furthermore, change more than once in the course of a lifetime. In common with many other peoples, the Inuit believed in appeasing the restless ghosts of the deceased and, to this end, they strove to ensure that a dead person’s name was given to a newly born infant as soon as possible. Gender-specific names arose only under colonial rule and it was quite common to have a daughter given the name of an admired and recently deceased male, whether or not he was a close relative.

Inuit names sounded odd and unpronounceable to European ears (e.g., Itukusuk or Kilabuk) and, as in the United States, even when European and biblical names were adopted, phonological differences made transliteration a tenuous art. As early as 1935, well before a comprehensive renaming was proposed, the difficulties had been noted. One official charged with following migrating individuals from one part of northern Canada to another complained to the Department of the Interior:

There are five divisions to the settlement and I think that if I left it to get the names from the natives, each has a different spelling for each name…It does not seem to ease our troubles any that [the Inuit] have in recent years taken their names from the Bible. A good example of this is the common name “Ruth.” The native cannot get his sounding mechanism around the letter “R” at the first of a word. As a result, different persons would write down the following when the native gave the child’s name, “Vrootee,” “Olootie,” “Alootah,” and other alterations along the same line. _To one who does not know them personally, this makes it rather difficult when it comes to putting them in alphabetical order_.[^64]

To the problem of variant transliterations must be added that of multiple jurisdictions. Names might be exotically and differently crafted by the Nursing Station personnel, the Royal Mounted Police, and the school administration.

Like Native American personal and place names, Inuit names offered a condensed reference-shelf of narratives which, taken in the aggregate and expanded on, amounted to local histories. Such names marked the landscape and its inhabitants and created a local habitat rich in order and meaning, but largely inaccessible to outsiders. Projects to re-label places and people in standardizing ways carry at least three implications: they facilitate identification and control by extra-local authorities; they help nest the locality in a larger pattern of regional and national meanings; and, finally, they overlay and often efface local systems of orientation. As systematic re-mapping ventures, they re-orient some actors, typically powerful state agents, and dis-orient others. The transfer of knowledge via synoptic legibility is, at the same time, always a cultural project of internal colonialism. Thus, the “tidying up” of Inuit nomenclature went hand-in-hand with the creation of boarding schools, the ban on Inuit drum dancing, and, in the case of the Coppermine Inuit, a prohibition of lip ornaments—actions all intended to make the Inuit into _national_ subjects and citizens.

Unlike the United States government, which, in the 1890s, was preoccupied with confinement, sedentarization, and legal order, the Canadian state, after the Second World War, was animated as much by the delivery of services as by the creation of legal persons. The Canadian welfare state, though in its infancy, was committed to providing social security, pensions, family allowances, vocational schooling, and medical services for everyone, including the nomadic, illegible Inuit. Such discriminating intervention required an equally discriminating system capable of pinpointing each individual.

Bureaucratically speaking, the simplest system of identification is the serial number. Anything else is second best. Given half a chance, administrators are drawn to the arithmetic beauty of a potentially endless series of consecutive numbers. It eliminates, at a stroke, all the ambiguity and discretion which plague any system of last names, for example how to transliterate names not previously written or what part of a name to consider as a patronym (e.g., “de la Fontaine, Oscar” or “Fontaine, Oscar de la”; “McArthur” or “MacArthur”). Inspired by the experience of military “dog tags,” the Ministry of the Interior at first devised for the illegible Inuit a disk system. Each small fiber disk had, printed in relief, a crown, the words “Eskimo Identification-Canada,” and then a letter and a number: e.g., “E-6-2155.” The “E-6” would stand for “East Zone, District 6,” indicating the administrative zone of the North where this particular Inuit had been sighted, registered, and tagged! The succeeding number, “2155,” was a personal identification reference (as a social security number might be in the United States) which directed an official to the appropriate dossier containing all the information of interest to the state (name, aliases, birth date, civil status, vaccinations, criminal record, pension and welfare records, etc.).

The intention of the administrators was that each Inuit would wear his or her disk on a necklace; in fact, they were manufactured with a hole stamped in them for this purpose. Analogies with the military “dog tag” system were not implicit but quite conscious. The 1935 proposal noted that:

My humble suggestion would be that, at each registration, the child be given an identity disk along the same lines as the army identity disk and the same insistence that it be on at all times. The novelty of it would appeal to the natives.[^65]

Nor is the analogy superficial. The military “dog tag,” like the hospital identification bracelet, is worn on the body precisely to identify someone who cannot, or will not, identify himself. It identified the dead or unconscious soldier, or the one whose remains are otherwise unidentifiable. The Inuit disk, like the military dog tags, was invented as a device for outsiders to keep track—in the face of muteness, death, or willful resistance—of the people or objects so ordered. Not expected to speak for themselves, the fugitive hunting and trapping Inuit were to be branded like migratory birds so as to track their movements. Had the technology of the age permitted, there is little doubt that officials would have preferred small electronic transmitters and global positioning systems to monitor all movement by satellite.

Imposition of the disk system was seen as the key to all development and welfare among the Inuit.[^66] The disk numbers, distributed exclusively to the Inuit following the 1935 census, were the template for assembling all vital statistics about health, education, income, crime, and population. In order to make it stick, officials insisted that the disk number be used in all official correspondence and on all birth, marriage, and death certificates. Evidence that the Inuit did not like the disk system[^67] and suggestions for alternatives were rebuffed by its supporters, who urged stricter enforcement:

In my opinion there is no necessity whatsoever to replace the present identification disk with a medal or token of any kind. As I have been pointing out for twenty years, once the Eskimo realizes that the white man wants him to memorize an identification number and use it in all trading and other transactions, the Eskimo will fall into line.[^68]

It was a very rare Inuit indeed who wore the disk around his or her neck.[^69] Many Canadian agencies did not insist on the use of disk numbers in their dealings with Inuit, and the utopian single identifying number fell gradually into disuse. The Inuit complained that their children at school were asked to call out their disk number rather than a name and that they occasionally got mail addressed to their disk number alone.

Finally, in 1969, the disk system was formally abandoned, and a three-member board was created to take charge of establishing family names and their consistent spelling. Thus was born “Project Surname,” a crash program to create and/or register proper patronyms for all Inuit before the Centennial. Those officials for whom unambiguous identification was paramount argued for retaining the disk scheme—“the alternative would be an unacceptable level of confusion.”[^70] “What about variable spellings of the same name?” they asked. “What about people using the same name?” (One official pointed out that in Pongnirtung there were three women named Annia Kilabuk.) “How will we keep track of people who move around?” “How do we know we are paying the right person?”[^71]

Unlike disk numbers, patronyms did not lend themselves to a smooth, unambiguous series. A brochure explained why European-style names were preferable: Inuit names were too hard to pronounce, too long, and too similar.[^72] As with most crash programs, implementation was chaotic and coercion fairly high. One official told the startled Inuit that everyone had to have a last name by the time he left the settlement the same afternoon: “I was in Baker Lake…There were 800 people. It was just like a sausage factory…‘Do you have a surname? What’s your father’s name? OK. You’re [new name]’…Project Surname ended up by creating a situation which is just horrendous.”[^73]

Serial numbers and permanent patronyms are each civilizational projects. But while the doling out of serial numbers bore an air of lofty abstraction, the choosing of surnames involved, as elsewhere, an implicitly cultural project. One primary reason why Inuit names did not reflect sex and paternity was because the Inuit simply did not live in standard normative European-style families. (Nor, of course, did many Canadians of European ancestry!) The scolding tone of the administrative summary of Project Surname admitted as much. It complained of

a total lack of understanding among the Eskimo people about the legal, social, and moral aspects of names…family- or sur-name, under which all members of a family are identified, is unknown. Legal usage, ownership of property under a family name is impossible…Marriage customs have never developed in the sense of the “Western civilized ethic,” as a family unit has no common name tying it together. Adoption of children has presented extreme difficulty.[^74]

Adoption among relatives was very common and many Inuit children were named to reflect their adoptive parents rather than their birth parents. Nor was the concept “head of family,” even as a formal status, particularly germane in the Inuit context. The desire of officials to create a viable system of identification and get welfare checks to the right person (and avoid fraud) was germane enough; but the desire to create a modern Canadian identity for the Inuit and muster them, at least on paper, into a standard, normative family was at the very core of Project Surname’s logic.

This exercise did not, of course, eliminate Inuit naming practices. What it did produce was rampant name pluralism. Many, perhaps most, Inuit had an administrative name that followed European usage but also one or more local Inuit names, not recorded in any document, by which he or she was known locally. Thus, most Inuit moved back and forth between a local identity with its own codes and an administrative identity with its own code. As the mother of a newborn son explained:

It [a child’s Inuit name] won’t go on any record at all. But he _will_ be known as another name…It’s still followed today. Like right now my own baby is named by three different names, which aren’t going to be on his birth certificate.[^75]

These two spheres of naming can coexist for long periods. Unlike the Inuit “register” of names, however, the Canadian register of names is underwritten by a state, an army, the police, and the law. The greater the necessity and frequency of the Canadian code in Inuit lives, the greater the practical, daily hegemony of European-style surnames.

**Names and the practical hegemony of the state**

Just as industrialized nations are extending long-standing projects of legibility to the far reaches of their periphery, new states, with modernizing agendas, have been inventing permanent patronyms for the first time. Other techniques of identification, as we shall see, are now available. Most of them are more discriminating, legible, and efficient than the proper name. Nevertheless, to follow the progress of legal naming throughout the world is to follow, simultaneously, the rise of regimes which have plans for the mobilization and/or improvement of their population.

_Modernization projects_

The modern Turkish republic of Kemal Ataturk decreed universal, legal patronyms in the context of one of the most comprehensive projects of modernization and Westernization the world has seen. Having “reformed” the clock and the calendar, adopted the metric system, abolished feudal tithes, created a national system of citizenship, and rewritten the legal code to bypass the _shari’a_, Ataturk ordered the adoption of permanent legal family names in 1934.[^76] The creation of a powerful modern state required a system of meticulous taxation and conscription that improved on the techniques of the Ottomans. This objective, in turn, required legible, personal identities. As we have seen in other instances, however, the mandating of last names was part and parcel of a vast cultural project designed to transform Turkey into a modern European nation. To this end, Arabic script was replaced with Roman, words with Ural-Altaic roots were emphasized, the wearing of the fez and the veil was banned; Islam and, with it, the Islamic tithe (zakat) were disestablished. The adoption of distinctively Turkic names, as opposed to Islamic and, especially, Arabic names, was encouraged.[^77]

The brusque legal change was easier to bring about than the revolutionizing of naming habits. Turks (not to mention the many national minorities) had many different names, some of which might change in the course of a lifetime. Locally, this posed no confusion as local residents knew the names of their neighbors and could, if necessary, add qualifying nicknames to clear up any possible misunderstanding. The new names co-existed with older naming practices for a long time, especially where contact with the state was episodic. Even at the center, the adoption of novel patronyms threatened, if rigorously and suddenly imposed, to provoke commercial and administrative chaos. Very few citizens actually knew the new patronyms of their acquaintances[^78] and, mercifully, the Istanbul telephone book listed subscribers alphabetically by _first_ name until 1950, fourteen years after the patronym decree. Nor was Turkey unique in this regard. Authorities in Thailand, where permanent last names were instituted in the 1950s, also have a healthy respect for the importance of practical knowledge. Names in the Bangkok phone directory are still listed and alphabetized by first name.

**_Fixing names, fixing identities_**

So far we have examined the creation of names as official legal identities only in the context of Western-style naming practices. It should be perfectly clear, however, that the legibility of names as legal identities is intrinsic to _any_ project of governance requiring discriminating intervention in local affairs. Thus, the conflict between parochial and outside authority and the legibility questions prevalent in the naming process are not merely vestiges of our past. Witness, for example, the legal and policy issues surrounding the creation of fixed identities in the relatively anonymous world of the Internet. The development of Internet “cookies” to better track cyber-identities, the quest for a consistent domain-name registration system, and judicial reforms aimed at awarding jurisdictional authority over the Internet to the courts of modern nation-states all represent early efforts to make cyberspace legible.

Meanwhile, the older process of state-making through naming continues, often with non-Western wrinkles. In China, for example, the contemporary regime confronts a host of nationalities (fifty-six by official codification). Some have no tradition of permanent patronyms at all, some have many names and surnames, and still others have family names that do not conform to Han-Chinese usage. The standardized Chinese administrative system is no more able to accommodate exotic minority names than was the Bureau of Indian Affairs able to absorb—even after translation—the Crow name “Irvie comes-out-of-fog.” Confronted with Kachin minority naming practices at the southwest frontier in Yuna’an Province, Chinese authorities do what Hamlin Garland did. They shoehorn Kachin practices into the nearest available standard Chinese equivalent. An ethnographer from Taiwan, studying the Kachin, described how they were fitted into the grid.

Names in official records have to be able to be written in Chinese characters; hence family names that are mono-syllables are changed into Chinese (usually single character) surnames. Among the Zaiwa [sub-division of the Kachin] “Muiho” is a common and important surname whose standard matching surname in Chinese is “he” [Wade-Giles system “Ho”], my own surname.[^79]

For many of the isolated Kachin who have thus been conjured by a Han administrator into “He(s)” or “Ho(s),” the Chinese record-keeping is of little moment. Their Han administrative identity is invoked only on those infrequent occasions when they have official business (e.g., taxation, contracts, conscription, inheritance of property) with the state. For the rest, for daily transactions, local naming practices are perfectly satisfactory.

Initially, then, state schemes of naming may hardly touch the citizens whose identities they aim to fix. “Name pluralism” may persist for centuries, with state-devised identities being invoked for some purposes and local vernacular identities for others. But we must not imagine that official and vernacular names are on an equal footing. Official names have, in the final analysis, the weight of the nationstate and its associated institutions arranged behind them. Here the concept of “traffic patterns” as applied by Benedict Anderson to state-sponsored identities is instructive. “Traffic patterns” are what make imaginary administrative identities into the solid realities of social life. Thus the Dutch colonizers in Indonesia “identified certain residents as Chinese [Chinezen] although they were part of a huge diaspora that did not think of themselves as Chinese,” and nor were they so thought of. Nevertheless, the Dutch government, working on their “ethnoscape,” proceeded to organize

the new educational, juridical, public-health, police and immigration bureaucracies it was building on the principle of ethnic-racial hierarchies. The flow of subject populations through the mesh of differential schools, courts, clinics, police-stations, and immigration offices created “traffic-habits” which, in time, gave real social life to the state’s earlier fantasies.[^80]

Vernacular names, like vernacular identities, do not typically disappear; but state naming systems typically become hegemonic for several reasons, all having to do with the institution of the modern nation-state. The state can insist that one use one’s legal name in all official acts: e.g., certification of birth, marriage, and death, inheritance, legal contracts, last wills and testaments, taxes, written communications to officials. Correspondingly, the greater the frequency of interaction with the state and state-like institutions, as we have seen, the greater the sphere of public life in which the official name is the only appropriate identity.

Take, for example, the birth certificate. Along with the death certificate, it is a remarkable and very recent innovation; even in the West, people managed, until quite recently, to be born and die without official notice! The birth certificate is the first official recording of a proper, [paper] legal identity and it is governed by many regulations. Care is taken to devise a proper surname when the normal parental agreement is lacking:

In cases where the mother and father have joint custody of the child and disagree on the selection of a surname, the surname selected by the father and surname selected by the mother shall both be entered on the certificate, separated by a hyphen, with the selected names entered in alphabetic order.[^81]

Notice, also, that the normal, modern, institutional setting for birth, and hence for the birth certificate forms, is the maternity ward of a hospital, where state-like bureaucratic routines for the collection of vital statistics prevail. When, by contrast, most children are born at home, with or without professional care, the official registration of births is that much more complex. Modern, formal institutions are handmaidens to the creation and hegemony of official patronyms. The hegemony of state-structured institutions such as schools, social security, military service, tax-paying, property registration and transfer provides the “traffic patterns” that ensure the dominance of state-identification practices. It is in most citizens’ interest to be duly recorded whenever state institutions have the power to provide a benefit or to diminish or cancel a penalty. Official identities, then, constitute an iron cage enclosing a great deal of social life in the contemporary modern state.

**Vernacular optics, state optics**

Central to the institutional hegemony of the nation-state has been the project of synoptic legibility. Its hard-won achievement against dogged resistance, an achievement requiring massive institutional investments in creating records and the personnel to manage them, represents the armature of state knowledge. Without this synoptic grasp, without the field of vision it affords officials, most of the activities of the modern state, from vaccinating schoolchildren to arresting criminals (or political opponents), would be inconceivable.

The early modern state faced a population whose land tenure practices, identity, production, wealth, and health were largely opaque. An exotic tangle of local measurement practices, nicknames, customary rights, and forms of local exchange thwarted any monarch’s scheme to mobilize resources for war or for public works. At the very least, officials at the center were hostage to the cooperation of local authorities for what intelligence they chose to offer. We have examined the creation of the permanent patronym as an essential, though rudimentary, element in this project of synoptic legibility. In a larger study, the permanent patronym would take its place beside a host of other state “optical technologies”: the standardization of weights and measures, the centralization of the legal code, the creation of uniform cadastral maps and property registers, a uniform tax code, a common currency, and the promotion of a standard dialect.[^82]

Each of these projects represents a transfer of power and a corresponding switch in codes. The transfer of power, in terms of state capacity, is obvious, as is the fact that it is achieved against opposition. As socio-linguists are fond of saying, “the difference between a dialect and a national language is that a national language is a dialect with an army.” Nation-states, even revolutionary ones, could not simply decree projects of synoptic legibility; they had to be enforced. In 1791, the Revolutionary State in France required all prefectures to furnish the “name, age, birthplace, residence, profession, and other means of subsistence of all citizens living in its territory.”[^83] Only _three_ of 36,000 communes replied! While the Napoleonic State a decade later did achieve better results, it required heroic efforts against substantial odds.

The switch in codes is vital. Both vernacular systems and state systems of, say, naming and measurement are codes. The question is who holds the key to the code, who can break it. In the case of vernacular naming, as with the Inuit or Native Americans in the United States, the keys to the code are held locally—and often, but not always, fairly democratically—while the code remains an opaque hieroglyph to outsiders. In the most synoptic forms of identification—for example the serial number—the keys to the code are held by specialists (clerks, lawyers, statisticians) while the code typically remains a hieroglyph to local, non-officials. Such specialists might be termed “trackers,” but they track synoptic forms of knowledge that are proper to the modern state. Access to these trackers ordinarily depends on political influence, financial resources, or both.

The “bird’s-eye view” achieved by official projects of legibility is best seen as a neutral instrument of state capacilty. Synoptic views are by no means neutral in how they privilege and empower state officials over local citizens and subjects. But they are utterly neutral with respect to the purposes for which they are used. They are, as we shall see, the basis for beneficial interventions that save lives and promote human welfare, without which contemporary life is scarcely imaginable. On the other hand, they enhance the capacity of the state to carry out the most fine-tuned and gruesome projects of surveillance and repression. In between these extremes lie the vast majority of uses: uses with both beneficial and troubling consequences.

Let us take the unambiguous identification of individuals through systematic, standardized birth records. This capacity, along with hospital records of birth defects, has existed for some time in Norway and has allowed epidemiologists to learn rather precisely how likely it is that a mother with a birth defect herself will give birth to a child with a defect.[^84] Having a complete record of nearly half-a-million births from 1967 to 1982 (8,192 of which involved birth defects), researchers were able to establish that while women with birth defects were more likely than women without to bear children with birth defects, the _added_ risk was quite small (1.4 percent), and that the small risk applied only to the passing on of their own birth defect. The findings have obvious implications for more informed genetic counseling and social policy, not to mention women’s decisions about child bearing. None of these statistical facts is even imaginable without the personal legibility—two generations long—that makes possible this correlation between the birth defects of mothers and their children.

The way in which massive projects of legibility are often driven by a laudable concern for public welfare is manifest in the debate in the United States about a “health identification number.” Originally seen as a means to ensure that employees could retain medical insurance if they changed employers, the proponents of “portability” suggested an electronic code for _all_ patients.[^85] In the words of the Chairman of the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics, this code would be “a way to identify people uniquely.”[^86] Existing procedures, they reasoned, were inadequate. Names were not unique; they changed and were subject to various spellings; drivers’ license numbers were not universal nor unique except within a single state; the social security number, though unique, was not universal. Furthermore, the existing system of medical record keeping had all the charm and confusion of vernacular naming practices. The varying modes of identification and software programs of different health-management organizations, hospitals, clinics, and employers ensured a mutually unintelligible dialogue of the deaf.

Reaching for a utopian solution, planners suggested a comprehensive and unique number for each patient, consisting of date of birth, latitude and longitude of hometown, and additional digits unique to the individual. Others suggested bio-medical markers such as thumbprints, electronic scans of the retina, or DNA profiles. The advantages of this vast administrative simplification are obvious: all patient records will be tracked as patients change doctors or addresses (or names!), billing would be streamlined, patients could get their records expeditiously, and last, but not least, the system would create the kind of national database of which epidemiologists have long dreamed. For the Center for Disease Control, it promised comprehensive information on illnesses (as opposed to the Center for Disease Control’s system of reporting hospitals), and, for the individual practitioner, it promised the possibility of matching a comparatively rare individual case with others like it nationwide and learning which treatments worked best.

The opposition to a unique and comprehensive health identification number came from those who were in no doubt about its efficacy as a project of legibility. It was, in their view, all too legible, especially for those who wanted to put it to other uses. Sensitive health information could be conveyed to employers (e.g., HIV status); it could be linked to financial data and used for blackmail; it might be used by the police to track down suspects or witnesses (thus driving them away from medical care). Patients, thinking that a medical history of depression, abortion, or sexually transmitted disease might end up in a database available to their employers or creditors, would be reluctant to confide in their doctors in the first place.[^87] Once a comprehensive project of legibility is in place, it represents a vastly expanded capacity for discriminating intervention by _whoever_ commands and surveys the synoptic heights.

**Conclusion: the modernization of identification**

The accurate identification of individuals, let alone actually locating their whereabouts, is, historically speaking, a very recent phenomenon. Lacking a comprehensive and standardized population registry, the best that most early modern European states could hope for was a tolerably accurate census and cadastral survey to guide levies of grain, draft animals, and soldiers. The specification of individual identities was typically confined to the local level, where the state was hostage to the collaborators it could find. Even where permanent patronyms were already established, the vagaries of their recording, standardization, duplications, variant spellings, not to mention population movement, made accurate extra-local identification of a resident a tenuous affair.

One can sketch, roughly, something of a continuum of identification practices, ranged according to how legible, exhaustive, and unambiguous they were. At one end would be, say, the Inuit before the disks and before “Project Surname”: a population totally legible to local insiders and almost totally illegible, synoptically, to outsiders. The introduction of permanent patronyms, even with all the liabilities we have noted, is a substantial step forward. Standardization of record keeping across jurisdictions and of spellings, as well as declining duplication of names, have made the name increasingly discriminating. The name remains, in most cases, the first element in most systems of identification (e.g., “name, rank, and serial number” in army parlance).

The next step is the unique identification number, of which the social security number is the classic American example. Where it covers every citizen and is coordinated with other data (e.g., address, father’s name, mother’s maiden name, date of birth), it can be quite discriminating. Its major drawback is that officials are stymied when a citizen refuses or is unable to give his or her name and “serial number.” Many nations have attempted to remedy this defect in legibility by imposing substantial penalties on citizens who fail to deliver their internal passport or piece of identification to an authority. It is for this reason that the first thing a gendarme says to someone he has accosted is, “_Vos papiers, Monsieur_.” One of the most notorious cases of requiring all subjects to carry an identity card was the “pass system” of South Africa under apartheid. Here the pass was used to authorize and control movement between the cities and white areas on the one hand and the “native locations” on the other. Elsewhere, as in nineteenth-century France, the pass system was sometimes combined with a record of employment (including the notation of employers) as in the _livret de famille_.

The development of photography in the mid-nineteenth century made possible photo-identification and, with it, the police “mug shot.”[^88] The photograph aids formidably in the progressive elimination of possible misidentifications afforded by several forms of identification—a name, a social security number, and a signature. Here one thinks of the “Wanted Posters” made famous by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in US Post Offices, with a photo (front view, side views), name, aliases, height and weight, fingerprints, and the location last seen. For most civilian purposes, however, name, photo-ID, social security number, and signature are sufficiently definitive.

The next step, of course, and one devised long before the advent of the modern state, is the indelible marking of the body. This practice too amounts to a document of identity: an identity mark one has no choice but to bear corporeally. Tattooing was, for example, used in pre-colonial Siam on commoners in much the same fashion as a cattle-brand—to indicate to whom the commoner was enserfed. Like the mutilations used elsewhere to identify criminals, runaway slaves, or serfs—such as notching or severing the ear or distinctive scarring—they identified less the individual than a class of people, almost always in a stigmatizing way. More permanent than dress, such marks nevertheless served, like sumptuary laws, to make status legible to any observer. In principle, permanent marks, such as tattoos, could be made the basis for unambiguous personal identification. One need only imagine that Canadian authorities had thought of tattooing the disk number on each Inuit for handy reference.

One decisive advantage of an indelible identification marked on the body is that it does not require the cooperation of the subject. When physically present, he reveals his identity whether he wishes to or not. The most modern forms of identification—and therefore those most favored by administrators—are virtually definitive for personal identity as in the case of bio-medical markers—e.g., the fingerprint,[^89] the iris scan, and the DNA profile. In the case of the DNA profile, it is definitive long after death; a bit of tissue from a 2,000 year-old corpse exhumed from the permafrost yields the same absolutely distinctive DNA signature, giving a new twist to the term “cold case.”

The disadvantage of _all_ these technologies is that they require the physical presence of the body to be identified. But, the trick to much police work is, of course, successfully locating a suspect or witness whose identity is already known. It is not a radical step from fingerprints and DNA profiles to imagine electronic bracelets transmitting distinctive signals to a global-positioning satellite, allowing the police to know, at any time, the precise location of every person of interest—just as naturalists and wildlife ecologists now track the movements of a particular individual of a migratory species. Such totalizing possibilities are close to being realized for certain felons on probation or on work release under the United States judicial system.

The capacity that a society made perfectly legible by meticulous policies of identification affords state officials is far beyond what the early modern state could achieve—though not beyond what its ministers could imagine. In fact, a chief distinction between the early modern state and the modern state is precisely the hard-won terrain of synoptic administrative legibility—of geography, people, property, goods, commerce, health, skills—that makes large projects of mobilization and transformation conceivable.[^90] Nowhere is this more apparent than in modernist projects of extermination. The efficient deportation of most of the Jews (some 65,000) of Amsterdam to their deaths during the Nazi occupation would have been unthinkable in the early nineteenth century. The roundup was made possible by a meticulous and comprehensive population and business registry—names, addresses, ethnicity/religion—and cartographic exactitude. A map produced by the city’s Office of Statistics in May 1941 is entitled “The Distribution of Jews in the Municipality.” Each black dot represents ten Jews, making it clear which blocks, when surrounded, would yield most of the Jewish population.[^91]

Under more controlled conditions—i.e., the concentration camps—schemes of synoptic legibility could be pursued ruthlessly. The very term “concentration camp” is, of course, a shorthand reference to the involuntary confinement and regimentation of prisoners in a miniaturized setting, allowing close surveillance and near perfect legibility. In Auschwitz, serial numbers were tattooed on the left arm of all Jews and gypsies, in the order in which they had arrived: the handful of long-term survivors became known as “old numbers” (i.e., low numbers).[^92] An elaborate “sumptuary” color code to mark the sub-sets of prisoners was introduced. In addition to the well-known Jewish star of David, sewn on the left breast and the right trouser leg, there were a series of triangles (apex down) affixed to clothing to make the taxonomy of prisoners legible at a glance: brown for gypsies, green for “criminals,” red for “politicals,” pink for homosexuals, mauve for Jehovah’s Witnesses, blue for émigrés, and black for “asocial” elements. Prisoners were identified at roll call by number, not by name.

Many of the same technologies of concentration, identification, and control are also the basis for what we could consider humanitarian interventions. The operational procedures of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) are a striking illustration of how a comparable state-like capacity to generate legible social landscapes can also be deployed to provide a safe haven for victims of terror and/or feed famished civilians. A “Practical Guide for Field Staff” entitled “Registration” distills the experience of refugee administration over the past fifty years.[^93] “Fixing the Population,” a key term in the manual, refers to enumerating, concentrating, and identifying the people “of concern” to the UNHCR. It requires, though without the barbed wire and electrified fences, a secure perimeter with a single, easily controlled entrance and exit. As refugees arrive, they are given “fixing tokens” and then, if the situation permits, wristbands and temporary identification cards, all of which are serially numbered to facilitate a rough census. Both the wristbands and the temporary identification cards have numbers from one to twenty-four or thirty, each of which can be punched like a railway ticket to indicate the receipt of certain supplies and rations, depending on the code established. One purpose of the wristbands and identity cards is to prevent double registration and fraud; another is to identify particularly vulnerable groups (e.g., women nursing infants, aged and infirm) for special attention. Together with orderly, barracks-style, shelter construction, enumerated also by “section/block/individual shelter,” the identity cards permit a more-or-less complete census of individuals by location in the camp. This too facilitates locating a particular individual who, say, needs special medicine or rations, has received a letter, or who has special skills of value to the camp’s operation.

Recent technological advances, however, have made camp organization easier and more efficient. Computer-generated bar codes on the wristbands and identity cards, read by laser guns, allow camp officials to monitor the refugees and the distribution of rations more efficiently.[^94] In mid-1999, volunteers from Microsoft Corporation were being deployed to the refugee camps bordering Kosovo to establish a standardized, digitized, photo-ID to be issued to all refugees. The aim was to produce a single, instantly accessible, database, which, among other things, would allow individuals to locate relatives and friends lost in the scramble to leave.

Despite the radically different purposes of concentration camps and refugee camps, despite the fact that the former routinely employs violence to achieve its ends, the discriminating administration of large numbers of strangers requires practices of legibility that bear a family resemblance to one another. Thus, unless one wishes to make an ethical-philosophical case that no state ought to have such panoptic powers—and hereby commit oneself to forgoing both its advantages (e.g., the Center for Disease Control) and its menace (like fine-combed ethnic cleansing)—one is reduced to feeding Leviathan and hoping, perhaps through democratic institutions, to tame it.**NOTES**

|[^2]|The following two essays were written two years after _The Moral Economy of the Peasant_ and after the publication of Samuel Popkin’s volume _The Rational Peasant_ criticizing it. I believed Popkin had, in order to create a straw man, purposely misconstrued my argument to imply that I thought peasants were dewy-eyed altruists. Nothing could be further from the truth. I described rational behavior in situations where a peasant would, owing to the danger of a subsistence crisis, behave in such a way as to minimize the maximum loss. My argument was, in fact, entirely in keeping with what a rational choice analyst would expect, given the existential situation of the peasant. Some commentators described it later as a rational choice argument _avant la lettre_. In any event the two books were frequently taught together as a debate because they appeared to take the same data and interpret it through different analytical lenses.<br><br>What I did argue was that the social arrangements designed to prevent the worst outcomes acquired, over time, a normative value such that they were defended as moral claims. The evidence for this is, I believe, overwhelming.<br><br>Though tempted to respond to Popkin’s book with an elaborate critique of rational choice theory in general—a job since accomplished many times over—I instead believed that where my argument in _The Moral Economy_ was deficient or at least incomplete was in its inattention to the religious and ideational aspects of peasant movements. It represented the peasantry, if anything, as too cool and bloodless and overlooked the religious values embedded in folk culture. It is, after all, not until after the French Revolution in the West that the idea of revolution begins to detach itself, and then only tenuously, from religious thought. For much of the global south, it seemed to me that the revolt and folk religion were inseparable. Thus, rather than respond to Popkin’s critique of my book, I decided instead to pursue what I thought were the shortcomings of the book. These two essays were, then, my small form of intellectual penance for the criticism that I thought my book deserved but did not receive!|

|[^10]|The explanation for these characteristics of working-class political beliefs is a critical issue that is hotly debated. Converse attributes the fragmentary character of non-elite beliefs to a lack of education and a relative weakness of cognitive skills. One might simply say that non-elites place a lower value on consistency. A more radical and, I believe, more satisfactory interpretation of the same data rests on the concept of “hegemony” as developed by Gramsci. Here it is assumed that dominant control over the symbolic and intellectual means of production by the ruling classes causes the fragmentation of beliefs and frequent “misidentification” of interests among subordinate classes. The fact that the French and Italian working classes are more ideological and class conscious, as these terms are normally understood, and have also created a subculture of newspapers, clubs, and union activities which diminish the symbolic hegemony of ruling elites appears to lend some support to the hegemonic view. Cf. David Sallach, “Class Domination and Ideological Hegemony,” _The Sociological Quarterly_ 15 (Winter, 1974), pp. 38–50.|

|[^15]|The disparity in belief systems may, paradoxically, be inversely related to the level of actual conflict within a society. The intervening variables here are the degree of contact between the groups involved and the extent to which one group attempts to impose itself. So long as there is little contact and no struggle for hegemony, social peace may be compatible with large differences in values. Labor relations in the Third World provide a homely example of this paradox. Peasants who occasionally take up factory labor are uncommitted to factory work as a way of life and, when they are dissatisfied or have earned what they need, they leave. Labor turnover is huge but overt conflict is low. As a permanent labor force evolves, however—a labor force for which working conditions and earnings constitute a major issue—the level of conflict may escalate. A commitment to the factory system and a tacit agreement to bargain within its constraints may produce far more social conflict. All of this is, of course, very much in keeping with Simmelian sociology.|

Some of the analogous communities in Meso-america suggest a similar explanation.|

The sabia’s activities are condemned by the Church: the _curandero_ turns into a quack beside the wonders of modern medical science. Where the values of authority reign, the bandit is a criminal traitor.” (p. 201).|

|[^106]|Throughout the festival, the Taungbyon brothers are treated as kings: a replica of the royal court is constructed for them; slaves and ministers are appointed, as are chief queens. “For the seven days of the festival it is as if the entire royal court, except the king, were transferred to Taungbyon … For in this court the Taungbyon nats are kings.” (ibid., p. 136). Inasmuch as the regalia and palace of a king are a source of power in their own right, pretenders in Burma classically began by building a replica of the palace. Thus the court at Taungbyon may have had implications for political rebellion.|

|[^30]|It is true, however, that the forces of commercialization and the elaboration of an administrative bureaucracy exert strong pressures toward a certain homogenization of experience.

|[^14]|However, when the sum of two harvests under double cropping was above the _nisab_, the zakat was to be collected.|
|[^15]|Even by an entirely official accounting, the collection costs of the zakat as a proportion of total proceeds are quite high. In 1970, for example, the Zakat Office reported a figure for payments to _amil_ and the central office administration that was equivalent to 22 percent. Otto Charles Doehring III, “Malaysian Rice Policy and the Muda River Irrigation Project” (PhD diss., Cornell University, 1973), 302–306. The _unofficial_ costs of collection—the rice and cash that disappear along the way—are also an issue, to be discussed later.|
|[^16]|The 1968 data come from a study of the same village by a Japanese scholar, reported in Kenzo Horii, “The Land Tenure System of Malay Padi Farmers,” _Journal of Developing Economies_, 10:1 (March 1972), 45–73.|
|[^17]|The zakat, like the tithe, is assessed against the cultivator of the land, not the owner. Thus the households not liable to the zakat in Sedaka fall into one of three categories: (1) landlords who do not cultivate, almost all of whom are retired farmers, (2) landless laborers, or (3) those cultivating one _relong_ (0.71 acres) or less, who thereby fall below the _nisab_. There were fifteen such households in 1977–78 and twelve in 1979.|
|[^18]|Three additional factors may be at work here. Since 1976, input costs had increased markedly while the price for paddy was stagnant, squeezing profits. In addition, the beginning of combine harvesting in 1976 had cut into wage earnings of smallholders, reducing their income further. Finally, the irrigated season of 1978 was cancelled because of a water shortage, and farmers were therefore more reluctant in 1979 to surrender much of their harvest to the _amil_.|
|[^19]|The _amil’s_ census of declared acreage is not available for 1979, but given the aggregate figures it is unlikely that the situation differed materially from the 1977–78 season in this respect.|
|[^20]|This burden is not mitigated by the property tax paid by the owner-operator, which in Malaysia is negligible.|
|[^21]|There are also good prima facie reasons to consider the role of partisan politics in resistance to the zakat. The _amil_ is, in fact, the local strongman of the ruling Malay party (the United Malay Nationalist Organization), and the state government of Kedah, including the Zakat Office, is dominated by the same party. Members of the opposition party (Partai Islam Se-Malaysia) might well resent handing over the zakat to their factional enemies. A slight difference in compliance does in fact exist, but it is not of any significant magnitude. The difference would have been, in all likelihood, larger except for one capital fact. Villagers allied with the opposition are more fearful that they may be prosecuted for their failure to pay, while the political allies of the _amil_ enjoy virtual immunity. Only two villagers have been charged with non-payment before the sariah courts in the past two decades; both were members of the opposition.|
|[^22]|The opposition party, Partai Islam Se-Malaysia, aspires to take over the state religious bureaucracy and the Zakat Office, not to decentralize or abolish it.|

|[^24]|The zakat, like the tithe, is applied almost entirely to the major food grains and livestock, and not to inedible cash crops. Both levies reflect their origin in the paramount concern with food supply and its distribution, the basis of public order in traditional society.|
|[^25]|The imam happens also to be a stalwart of the ruling party, while Haji Kadir is with the opposition. He chooses, however, to make his case on grounds that virtually all villagers would accept.|
|[^26]|The very notion of alms or charity is bound up with the concept of a discretionary gift. Once it is collected by law, it loses its status as charity in the normal sense and becomes a tax—even if it is used for charitable purposes.|

|[^29]|A good share of this _zakat peribadi_ was, in the past, provided to harvest laborers. It was treated by the larger farmers as a discretionary religious gift that, not incidentally, helped guarantee a reliable labor force during the peak labor demand at harvest time. For the beneficiaries, it came to be regarded as a customary right. After 1976, when combine harvesters became available in place of hand labor, these gifts to harvest workers declined steadily. This loss of income by the poor has been accompanied, ironically, by a comparable growth in thefts of paddy from the larger farmers. Poor villagers humorously call these thefts “private zakat that one takes for oneself.” Here again, it appears, we have an example of successful resistance. In this instance, however, it is class-based resistance within the village rather than resistance to state taxation. The form is nevertheless structurally similar. There is no open protest, no public outcry, but rather the quiet appropriation by the bolder of the poor of the _zakat peribadi_ that they feel is legitimately due them.|
|[^30]|Mid-sized farmers are here defined as those cultivating between 2.8 acres (4 _relong_) and 5.6 acres (8 _relong_).|

|[^32]|If the suspicions of many villagers are correct and Basir does actually manage to skim off something for himself beyond his commission, then another possibility emerges. A tacit accord may perhaps be discerned in which Basir’s small manipulations are not denounced by villagers so long as he, in turn, permits them to practice their usual evasions.|
|[^33]|Government revenues in Malaysia are largely drawn from export and import taxes, corporate income taxes, and various excise levies. Unlike the case in the classic agrarian kingdoms of Asia, extraction from the food-producing sector has never been very significant.|
|[^34]|The Reformation in northern Europe and England, for example, marked a sharp break in the tithe struggle. In England, at least one third of all tithes had been distributed to laymen by 1600, and many more were abolished by substituting land grants in the process of enclosure. See Eric J. Evans, _The Contentious Tithe: The Tithe Problem and English Agriculture, 1750–1850_ (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1976), ch. 1; and Henry Lansdell, _The Sacred Tenth or Studies in Tithe-Giving, Ancient and Modern_ (London: Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, 1906), 283–289.|

|[^70]|How is it possible, for example, to explain the collapse of the Czarist army and the subsequent victory of the Bolsheviks without giving due weight to the massive desertions from the front in the summer of 1917 and the accompanying—unorganized—land seizures in the countryside? Few if any rank-and-file participants intended a revolution, but that is precisely what they precipitated. R. C. Cobb’s account of draft resistance and desertion both in post-revolutionary France and under the early empire is, in the same vein, compelling evidence for the role of everyday resistance in bringing down regimes.

|[^72]|This does not mean that everything a peasant household might do to survive counts as resistance. When survival comes at the expense of members of the same class, appropriation by superordinate classes is aided, not resisted.|
|[^73]|One might, in principle, elaborate an account of the tax resistance described here entirely in terms of what is known as rational-choice theory. Such an account would begin with the desire of peasants to maximize their after-tax income and would then examine the information and coercion costs required of the state or religious authorities to ensure compliance. The pattern of evasion would then be seen to be a tacitly negotiated outcome of a struggle between opposed rational actors, each maximizing its gains and minimizing its costs. The problem with such a gloss on the tax evasion we have examined is not so much that it is mistaken per se; it is rather that, by its radically simple (simple-minded?) model of human behavior, it misses most of the social facts that would interest anyone but a game theorist. Its implicit assumption that the cause of an action is nothing more than the results it brings about abandons the effort to uncover any more complex reasons why this particular tax is resisted. It is clear, for example, that both Malaysian and French peasants could and did give rather elaborate reasons for their dislike of the tithe. These reasons amount to a collective vision of what would have been a fair, equitable, and tolerable tithe system. By, in effect, treating notions of justice as post facto rationales beneath its consideration, rational-choice theory denies such visions any role in constituting the behavior. For any view of human action in which the stated intentions and values of the actors themselves are deemed relevant for adequate interpretation, this will not do. We may note here that the Malay peasants, at least, do in fact voluntarily give up a portion of their income, which they distribute as a private tithe within the village. They would hardly do so if they were the mere income maximizers posited by rational-choice theory. Resistance to the official zakat or the Catholic tithe is not simply a matter of narrow self-interest; it is also a matter of popular views of custom, justice, and religious duty.<br><br>In its interpretation of the options facing tithe collectors, rational-choice theory must begin with the costs of enforcement. Here again it posits what an historian would want to have explained. The costs of enforcement are above all an artifact of the level and techniques of resistance devised by local communities and arising out of their normative solidarity in opposition to the tithe. How that resistance originates, and how it is maintained, are the social facts that determine the very parameters within which the tithe collectors may “rationally” act.|

Reddy argues that it was precisely the lack of organization in crowd behavior that was enabling, and that the crowd came to value and use spontaneity in the knowledge that it was the most effective and least costly means of protest. The cultural understandings were so well developed that any just grievance could, he writes, bring together a crowd without any planning or organization, let alone formal leadership.|
|[^75]|And not just the peasantry. In his interpretation of nineteenth-century working-class history in England, Francis Hearn finds, in just such _informal_ structures of ritual and community, the heart and soul of direct action by the working class.

|[^2]|Strictly speaking, governmental road designation systems vary by level of jurisdiction. Thus one has, moving step-wise from local to supra-local, town roads, county roads, state roads, and national roads. At this last level the Interstate system, built with military needs in mind, is logically calibrated with east—west highways designated by “tens” (Interstate Routes 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90) growing larger as one moves north, and north—south highways designated also by tens (Interstate Routes 45, 55, 65, 75, 85, 95) growing as one moves east. The older and smaller the jurisdiction, the greater the likelihood that its road and street system will have “folk” characteristics that will be difficult for a stranger to fathom.|

|[^12]|China, by contrast, had a centralized surname scheme as early as the Qin dynasty (fourth century BCE), which tried to register the entire population of the kingdom, but it is not clear how universally it was applied. This initiative may well have been the origin of the term “laobaixing” meaning, literally, the “old one hundred surnames,” and which, in modern China, has come to mean “the common people.” Before this time, the fabled Chinese patrilineage was absent among commoners.|
|[^13]|The role of surnames as an official state function is also revealed in female naming practices. This is especially the case when one examines the tradition of married women taking their husband’s last name. Strangely enough, “no hunting, gathering, or fishing society, no society with nuclear family organization; and only one society without patrilocal residence requires [women to change their names at marriage]”: R. Alford, _Naming and Identity_, op. cit., p. 88. Indeed, the only sociocultural variable that correlates with female name changes at marriage is the technological complexity of a society. In the Anglo-American tradition, women typically took the last names of their husbands; “as women did not pursue an occupation outside the home and inheritance typically passed through sons or other male heirs, women took upon marriage their husband’s surname as their own. It was the name that _best described and identified women to local officials_.” See Ralph Slovenko, “Overview: Names and the Law,” _Names_, 32, 2 (June 1984): 107–113, 109 (emphasis added).|

As Helen Lynd writes: “The wood in _Through the Looking Glass_ where no creature bears a name is a place of terror” (quoted in Harold R.

Moreover, as Isaacs points out: “The sanction of namelessness imposed on bastardy in our culture is one of the most fearful that a group can impose. Namelessness of any kind, indeed, is almost beyond bearing; ‘nameless fear’ is worse than any other kind of fear. Names, like social norms, provide a certain minimum security, bearings that every individual must feel around him or else be lost” (ibid.).|

|[^49]|Morgan was in favor of retaining Indian names and transliterating them into English script where they were reasonably short and pronounceable (to whites). The practice of renaming had, of course, begun with those Native Americans who were employed by reservation authorities, because they figured first on payrolls and ration lists. Naming, as we have seen earlier, spread as a function of the intensiveness of contact with officials. (Frank Terry, op. cit.)|

You needed something logical. You had to have an order. There weren’t any names.’ I replied that there were names and they were not the same. He insisted that Inuit were ‘impossible to identify’.”|

|[^73]|V. Alia, _Names, Numbers and Northern Policy_, op. cit., p. 69. Elsewhere in the circumpolar region, the Yuit of Siberia had single names like Canadian Inuit but were given last names in the 1930s, under Stalin. In the 1960s, the polar Inuit were given last names by the Danes—first by the Ministry of Ecclesiastical Affairs. There were mixed names (e.g., the hunter “Itukusuk Kristiansen”). “People got surnames for administrative convenience.” V. Alia, _Names, Numbers and Northern Policy_, op. cit., p. 75.|

|[^76]|The process was not, however, completed until 1936. The late Ottoman Empire itself had moved, during the period known as the “Tanzimat,” toward codification, systematization, and more fine-tuned administrative control.

|[^87]|The social security system is now linked to many records, and practical access to credit histories, medical records, wages, and employment records is within the grasp of most talented computer hackers. In addition there are a great number of counterfeit cards. Opponents of the health identification number fear that the same abuses and unauthorized access to confidential information will quickly overtake a health identification number. For the United States, it is the closest thing to a national identification number (137 million numbers issued since 1936).|
|[^88]|And, later, a series of techniques by which witnesses could attempt to build a likeness from various elements of a face with the help of trained specialists.|
|[^89]|The fingerprint as a form of identification was developed around 1880 and first applied in Bengal to combat pension fraud. Like so many other advances in police work, it was tried first in the colonies and then transplanted back to Britain. Most of the uses of fingerprints involve trying to match the fingerprints of a suspect in custody with fingerprints collected at the crime scene. The fingerprint was never universal (though attempts were made in the 1920s in the United States to make it universal), and, despite the patina of pure science about it, it requires specialists with long experience to match fingerprints definitively.

Each camp designated prisoners by number but it appears that only at Auschwitz was the number tattooed on the skin of gypsies and Jews. The designation “Z” (for “Zigeuner”) appeared before the number in the case of gypsies. Some thought was given to branding prisoners’ names on their forehead.|
