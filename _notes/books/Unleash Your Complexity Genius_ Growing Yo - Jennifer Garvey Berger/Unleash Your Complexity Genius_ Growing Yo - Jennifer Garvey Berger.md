**INTRODUCTION**

You know those days: you have planned your schedule precariously, one thing hanging off of the next, like a child’s balancing game. Then something unexpected happens—you get a call from school that your daughter is sick, you get a ping from a colleague that a major customer is about to make an announcement, your boss walks in with a troubled look on her face. And you think: I simply cannot handle one more thing that is changing or uncertain or difficult on this day—or this week or this month.

And yet the world keeps throwing these things at us. Whether we think we can handle them or not, they come, and they come.

We’re here to help. We can’t do much to shape what the world throws at you, but one of the things we’ve learned in our twenty-five years of helping leaders manage difficult situations is that we can do very much to shape how we respond to what the world throws at us. In this book, we’re going to let you in on a secret: you have a genius for handling complexity.

You might feel like maybe we’re talking to someone else. You have a frustration with complexity and not a genius for it. But trust us on this one—all the research we’ve done and the thousands of leaders we’ve worked with assure us that this is in you too. The word “genius” originally described a spirit or ability that was in us from the day we are born. Our complexity genius is our birthright: the natural ease and delight with which we handle our complex, confusing, and uncertain lives.

We know this is something that humans have excelled at for as long as we have been on this planet—we know how to play and invent and learn our way into new possibilities. If we weren’t able to flourish in complexity, we wouldn’t have been able to do all the wonderful things humans have done—building thriving societies, writing novels, making vaccines for COVID-19. And this isn’t just a modern or just a COVID-era capability. There are complex adaptive ideas woven through our most ancient texts. Humans have been accessing their complexity genius for millennia (which shows that these are both ancient ideas and not as automatic as we might wish).

We understand that it doesn’t always feel like you have a complexity genius. That’s because alongside your genius for handling complexity, you—like the rest of us—have a rather unsettling human quirk. It turns out that when we need to handle complexity the most, we often are least able to. Here’s why. Complexity tends to trigger us, to make us anxious or afraid or overwhelmed. When this happens, our nervous system creates a whole series of shifts in our body that lead to reactivity and oversimplification. So we have a funny paradox woven right into our humanity: when we are calm, we are able to handle complexity better with play and collaboration and co-creation. But complexity kills the calm, making us _less_ able to handle these things.

We two have been puzzling about this conundrum in one way or another for the last twenty years or so. We first met as partners in a small consulting firm, both with little children of our own. Our lives were complex and overwhelming, and we were struggling to stay on top of things. We studied and taught and used the complexity and adult development ideas that had brought us together, and we learned. Over the years, Jennifer has gotten more and more into the world of outer complexity: _What is it about the way complex systems work that is so counterintuitive for us?_ Over the years, Carolyn has gotten more and more into the world of the body: _What is it about how we manage our own bodily reactions that makes us more fit to handle the complex world?_ The ideas and practices that come together in this book have transformed our lives and have transformed the lives of the thousands of leaders with whom we and our colleagues have worked. And now we’re hoping they’ll help you too.

Here’s what we’ll explore together: What is already inside us that makes us well adapted to handling complexity, and how can we dial that up when we need it the most? Or, to put it another way: What is our complexity genius and how do we best make use of it for ourselves and others?

So come along with us. We’ll look inside ourselves and understand a little about our biology to make sense of the way our bodies automatically handle complexity. We’ll look outside ourselves at some of the most important complexity principles, and we’ll figure out what the complex world is demanding of us. And we’ll look for the particular moves we can make to switch our natural inclinations away from our unhelpful autopilot and back into our helpful genius.

The best news of all is that the practices that bring out our complexity genius are delightful. They are some of the great joys of being human: noticing, breathing, moving, sleeping, experimenting, laughing, wondering, and loving. We’ll see how these are perfectly aligned with what the world needs from us. And we’ll offer you some practices—Genius Engagement Moves (GEMs)—that help us amplify the genius that is our birthright. Those GEMs build on each other as the book progresses, so the ones toward the end use all that we’ve learned—like an exercise circuit for our bodies to become more fit to handle complexity with more ease and grace than you might have imagined possible.

Along the way, you’ll have the company of a few companions you’ll recognize from _Unlocking Leadership Mindtraps_[^1] if you’ve read that (no worries if you haven’t—you’ll probably recognize them from your own lives anyway). Their lives have changed enormously since that book was published, and they’re just trying to keep up as well.[^2]

The notions in this book are not shiny new ideas that emerge from the latest research and send us in utterly novel directions. These ideas have been woven into human societies for tens of thousands of years. Want to be more creative, more connected? Dance, feel into wonder, come to stillness with your breath. Love one another well. We offer them not because they’re new but because we often lose them in the tumult of our current lives. When the fog of complexity is so thick that we lose our way, when we lose even our own best versions of ourselves, these ideas are a lifeline to bring us back to our natural giftedness, back to the fullness of our ability to thrive in this world. Pour a cup of tea, settle into a comfy chair, and let’s begin.

**IT’S NOT JUST OUT THERE, IT’S IN HERE**

_Your Nervous System Meets Complexity_

“Mark, you’re on mute,” Pete told him for the tenth time in as many minutes.[^1]

“Argh sorry—it’s just so loud here that I’m trying to spare you the virtual saxophone lessons Naomi is taking.” Mark paused for a moment, examining his ceiling. “And now I’ve forgotten what I was saying. It was pure genius though.”

“It’s always genius with you!” Pete smiled at his friend on the screen. “I miss hanging with you, you know?”

Mark’s video sputtered for a moment with his mouth opened and his eyes raised in a most surprising and unattractive way, and Pete heard, “—about you—damn thing’s frozen—didn’t think through all the pieces.”

“I’m sorry, what?”

Mark’s video feed became clear again. “When we moved to Edenville, I didn’t think through all the various parts of what it would be like. I had _resources/books//Unleash Your Complexity Genius_ Growing Yo - Jennifer Garvey Berger of a different life—the kids having rooms of their own and lots of space to run, no more traffic hassles, and zero commute. I didn’t think about the Zoom saxophone and Alison working at all hours and having endless thirty-minute catch-ups with my team. I’m worn out in ways I never even imagined.”

“Sounds like things are tougher there than you expected them be,” Pete sympathized. “Man is that true for me too! When I showed up to take care of the business after Dad died, I was thinking about free babysitting from Mom and maybe finding love on the East Coast. But this new world is an utterly different challenge—running a small business, managing the people, dealing with the unexpected waves of grief that still hit me about Dad. And it’s all been too overwhelming to make friends out here. Sometimes the isolation of it is mind-numbing.”

Mark, as typical, was still lost in his own story. “I worry I’m just not cut out for this,” Mark said. “Maybe no one is. Maybe this whole massive experiment in hybrid work is hopeless. Maybe we should just pack up and go back to the office. With the promotion and the move here, I am floundering—and you’re not even around to help me.” His video froze again, but Pete could hear his voice become a little husky. “I’m not sure I’ve ever been so tired. And so lost. I’m sleeping more than ever, and yet some days I’m so exhausted I can hardly pull my body up the flight of stairs to this attic office. And don’t get me started on the tension between Alison and me—”

Pete startled and his video dropped out. “Oh sorry” he interrupted, “I have to go—yelling and dog barking insanely downstairs. I’ll ping you later.”

SO WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL ABOUT COMPLEXITY, ANYWAY?

We’re going to be thinking a lot together about complexity and what we can do to lead ourselves and others in an increasingly complex world. So let’s start with a definition we have found invaluable in our lives: the difference between what’s complicated and what’s complex.

Complexity theorist Dave Snowden tells us that some of the tricky things we deal with—challenges, problems, processes—are “complicated.”[^2] Complicated problems or issues aren’t obvious at all—they have too many moving parts, too much background knowledge required. Your taxes are complicated. Your car is complicated. The yearly budgeting process is complicated. Probably lots of things about your life are complicated—and to handle them, you either have to become an expert or to hire experts to help you. Expertise and experience are your friends here, because you need to know what you’re doing in order to accomplish your goal. When a problem is a complicated one, the goal tends to be pretty clear: balance the budget, remove the tumor, create the fastest, cheapest, most reliable route to get your partner and your four best friends to your holiday destination. Complicated problems are difficult, but they’re solvable. Better still, as you solve one category of them, you get faster and more efficient at solving more and more problems in that category. You can feel like such a hero as you master the complicated!

Complex challenges, on the other hand, are tricky for a different set of reasons. It’s not just that there are moving parts and background knowledge, it’s that there are so many moving and interacting pieces that they are impossible to predict, and they are not within any one’s ability to control. The lines of causality are blurred, and even as you look back on things, you can’t always tell which move led to which outcome. Did your team do so well because you were an extraordinary leader? Or do you lead so well because you have an extraordinary team? You can’t tell which things are the _cause_ and which things are the _effect_.

Even if you get really, really good at dealing with complex challenges, you’ll still be surprised, and you’ll still be wrong sometimes, maybe even often. There’s no certainty here because, by definition, complex spaces are uncertain and unpredictable. You can’t ever perfect your approach because the conditions change and then your approach has to change too. In fact—and here’s perhaps the most important part—if you get lulled into believing that you can use your experience and your expertise to predict and control complex things, you’re likely in trouble. Your expertise and experience, which were your friends when things were complicated, can become your enemy when things are complex. You need all the creativity, agility, pattern-recognition, experimentation, and learning you can muster when you’re dealing with complexity.

We’ve set up our organizations, our schools—often even our families—to create predictable spaces where we mostly believe we know what’s going to happen next. We have created systems and structures that allow us to handle difficult situations with what looks like a kind of predictable ease. We understand how to create clean drinking water and thus how to prevent plagues and illnesses that could kill millions. We understand how to build houses that will stand up to the unpredictability of a gale or an earthquake. We understand how to keep good records of what money comes in and what goes out and protect ourselves from financial ruin. We have worked hard as “progress” marched on to slowly move some of the complexities of life into the complicated realm.

But of course, we begin to believe too much that we can control the universe. These systems and structures—particularly in our organizations—trick us into believing that there is much more about the world that is complicated and much less about the world that is complex. We humans enjoy the feeling of being in control and of knowing what happens next, so we act as though that’s possible—even when it isn’t.

This is not a new trend. Things were complex and uncertain in 2009 and in 2019.[^3] People were tired and overwhelmed at work and at home. And then 2020 hit, and everything notched up in difficulty and complexity. The lines between work and home blurred as so many of us sheltered in our homes, and our offices shrunk into small boxes on a screen. The inequalities that were woven through the system became more visible, and the jobs of those who were less privileged either disappeared overnight or became unexpectedly dangerous as healthcare workers, supermarket staff, and bus drivers were exposed to the threat of a deadly virus at work each day. Add social unrest, economic confusion, and the inability of individuals to control the forces of their own lives—where they traveled or shopped or saw their families and friends. It was a time when the regular patterns of our lives began to fragment and shift, and the simple stories we had been telling ourselves about the level of control and predictability in our lives simply vanished.

In the time since, we have discovered that we can no longer believe that the pattern of life will unfold in one fairly predictable way. Hybrid work is unraveling organizational cultures and familiar ways of working. And now we know better than ever that unexpected weather systems, virus variants, social disruption—any of these can upend our experience of our lives at any moment. That was always true, but now we have lived some of the truth of it, and it has changed us.

All of this uncertainty wreaks havoc on our systems—financial systems, political systems, social systems. But the first stressed system that leaders must deal with is their own nervous system. We cannot handle the complexity outside us unless we are able to notice—and ultimately change—what complexity does inside us.

COMPLEXITY AND THE BODY: WE ARE FIT FOR COMPLEXITY UNTIL IT GETS REALLY COMPLEX

You see, humans—like most animals—evolved to face times of threat and times of safety. To handle that difference, our bodies evolved with two different phases for our nervous system: the sympathetic and the parasympathetic.

![[22_1.png]]

The sympathetic is often talked about as the fight or flight nervous system. It’s the one that’s always ready for action. It is perfect for short bursts of physical challenge or threat as we prepare to move our bodies to save our lives. Adrenaline kicks in for energy and focus. Our breath gets shallow, pumping oxygen quickly into our largest muscles so that we can run. We get hyperfocused, with our peripheral vision actually disappearing. And we get incredibly sensitive to danger, ready to lash out at—or run from—anything that might be threatening us. Even when the threat isn’t physical, the reaction is physical. Think back to the last scary movie you watched. This is the sympathetic nervous system at work: your heart beating faster, your stomach churning, your palms sweating, and your muscles tight.

Sometimes what we get with the sympathetic nervous system is the sweet spot of all of the good things that come from stress—which we might think about as thrill or high-intensity flow. When we feel at the top of our game as we step out in front of a crowd to make a speech, or are about to leap off the bungee platform over a deep river gorge, or watch the roulette wheel turn after we have put all of our chips on 14, we have this delicious—and addictive—sense of excitement. This is what the sympathetic nervous system was made to do! We are hooked!

If the perceived threat continues, though, our body finds things somewhat less thrilling. Our nervous system releases the hormone cortisol which shifts basically every system in our body toward saving our life. And remember, this is an ancient threat we’re moving away from, so our body readies itself for running and fighting. Who needs the immune system, the reproductive system, the digestive system to be working if your life is under threat? Cortisol takes command of the entire bodily system as a kind of emergency military leader. If we’re not attentive, we won’t even notice it, but there is an internal coup afoot.

Over time, this coup—like most coups—gets to an unsavory place. The long-term effects of too much cortisol can literally kill us. For a whole variety of reasons, cortisol becomes corrosive in basically every human system. Robert Sapolsky, the brilliant primatologist, writes, “The human species, despite its talent for solving problems, has managed over the millennia to turn one of its most basic survival mechanisms—the stress response—against itself.”[^4] When people suggest that stress is hurting our health, what they tend to mean is that cortisol is building up and overwhelming our system, doing what it was never meant to do—becoming our destroyer rather than our savior.

What’s missing in that picture is the other part of our nervous system, the parasympathetic nervous system, which people sometimes call the “connect and restore” nervous system. When our parasympathetic system is in charge, our heart rate becomes slower and oddly more irregular which keeps it healthy and agile. Our breath deepens and slows. Our life-giving systems—our digestive systems, endocrine systems, reproductive systems—just go ahead and do their thing, digesting, crafting the perfect blend of hormones, and, you know, reproducing. Instead of adrenaline and cortisol, the body releases a different cocktail of dopamine, human growth hormone, and, at night, melatonin. Our immune system pumps up, our peripheral vision expands, and the conditions are created for neurogenesis, the creation of new connections in our brain. Now we are wired for play, connection, and creativity with a wide focus and the more complex view that is required for humor and for innovation.

The parasympathetic system has its own shadow side, though. If we’ve been stressed out of our minds or under increasing threat, the parasympathetic takes over again—but not in that connecting and creative way. You’ll recognize this from Mark’s ideas above that he’s exhausted and sleeping more than ever but not getting less tired (and you might have had that experience yourself). This is when we find ourselves stuck in the part of the nervous system that is meant to basically make us freeze: to conserve our energy, disconnect, and prevent what might be life-threatening movement. Ultimately, this stressed parasympathetic nervous system is a shut-down switch and leaves us feeling hopeless or lost in the face of the profound uncertainty around us.[^5]

Instead of this emergency shutdown switch that toggles us between the overactivation of the sympathetic and the overwhelmed circuit breaker of the parasympathetic, in normal times, our bodies are supposed to find their way to a dance between the everyday versions of the sympathetic and the parasympathetic. The sunshine of the parasympathetic nervous system (and the way we’ll talk about it from here forward) is supposed to take over when we are free from danger and we can not only rest but also restore, connect, and create.

Here’s why this matters as we’re dealing with complexity. It turns out you want that restorative parasympathetic nervous system switched on when you are facing a complex situation where it’s not movement and thrill but creativity and connection that will meet the challenge. Unfortunately, though, one of the biggest stressors in our lives is that brew of ambiguity, complexity, and uncertainty that the modern world serves up at every meal. The sense that you don’t know what’s going to happen next is itself experienced as a threat by your body. Neuroscientist Lisa Feldman Barrett has found that “uncertainty is more unpleasant and arousing than assured harm, because if the future is a mystery, you can’t prepare for it.” She goes on to write, “When people are seriously ill but have an excellent chance of recovery, they are less satisfied with life than people who know their disease is permanent.”[^6]

Take that in for a minute. If you’re _sure_ that something is going to end badly—this is it for you—it is less troubling than thinking that something _might_ end badly. We humans tend to really, really hate uncertainty.

The uncertainties and complexities of the modern world are the equivalent of your heart racing as you watch the hero go down the basement stairs after all the lights have gone out unexpectedly. What these last couple of years have shown us is that we are all always going down into the basement in the dark. The world has become a set of stairs leading into an uncertain future, and we have to find a different way to deal with the anxiety that automatically arises in us. We have to figure out how to avoid activating the shadowy sides of our nervous system and activate intentional parasympathetic goodness.

AUTOMATIC MESSAGE SYSTEM: I’M OUT OF CONTROL TODAY SO I’LL BE MOVING TO SAFETY

Of course, we don’t think much about our nervous system at work. We experience it as a set of thoughts or emotions that set us off to _do_ something. This makes sense. We have evolved to stay one step ahead of the dangers of our outside world—literally. There is more and more evidence that many of our internal systems are, in fact, attempting to predict our way into making the appropriate physical movement to escape trouble. Barrett tells us, “Prediction is such a fundamental activity of the human brain that some scientists consider it the brain’s primary mode of operation.”[^7] Neuroscientist John Coates takes it one step farther when he writes that evolutionary science suggests “the brain is fundamentally very practical, that its main role is not to engage in pure thought but to plan and execute physical movement. What is the point…of our sensations, our memories, our cognitive abilities, if these do not lead at some point to action?”[^8] Our emotions, our thoughts, our impulses all arise from this body whose primary job is removing us from danger so as to keep us alive.

Our nervous system doesn’t know whether it’s our lives or our identities that are threatened, though. Whether we are dealing with the essential question of a threatening noise downstairs or the existential question of whether this terrible feedback means we should just quit our jobs and join the circus, our nervous system understands these different types of threat the same way and wants to act—to move—to make the threat go away. This means that often our impulse when we’re feeling triggered by our anxiety is do something—grab the wheel, answer the question, come to a conclusion. Or we numb out—have a beer, check our Instagram, binge watch the latest Netflix series.

Leaders discover this impulse in themselves when they see a problem: a missed launch date, falling quarter three numbers, two teams that seem to be blaming each other more than working together—and they want to get in there and take action. We can hardly count the number of times we have heard leaders say something like, “I know this might look like micromanagement, but really it’s necessary given the circumstances.” And maybe those leaders are right. But what they might not notice is that this “action urge”[^9] is their nervous system telling them that they are at risk and they need to move. The logic about why we should move is generally a back-filled rationalization—we are justifying the action urge that stress delivers to us rather than rationally deciding to take action. In most cases these days, the risk is to our reputation, our bonus, our need for harmony rather than our lives, but it’s all the same to the nervous system.

GO SLOW TO GO FAST

One of the core paradoxes of complex systems is that a lot of effort can have no impact and a tiny bit of effort can have a lot of impact. And of course, in complex systems the bummer is that you can’t know which is which until afterward. But this means that continuing to act at speed can be counterproductive for a couple of different reasons.

First of all, it can take a while for a new pattern to emerge in complexity, and you can’t always tell whether what you’re seeing is a new pattern or a momentary aberration. This means that rushing in too fast to make a change can be a total waste of effort or worse. You probably recognize this in your own history. You know, like when you come home from holiday to a full in-box, and you notice as you slog through the piles of emails awaiting you that many of your challenges resolved themselves without your doing anything. After these moments we tend to breathe a sigh of relief—to have acted right away would probably have made everything worse. But we forget this.

The second reason is that it can take a while to see what is emerging. This is the classic delay in the system, like a shower tap in an old London flat. You turn both taps on equally, expecting warm water, and you get freezing water. So you turn the cold down and the hot up—still freezing. So you turn the cold off and the hot on full and suddenly the water heats up to scalding. So you turn the hot down and the cold up—still scalding. You get the point.

This also happens in organizations, of course, or anywhere there are “taps” with delays. You find your team is frustratingly slow with delivering projects because they are trying to get them perfect before they send them out, so you push them to send work in progress and to move faster and not count on perfection. Still, it seems slow to you, so you institute more changes that are designed to move work through faster. But this changes hardly anything. Then you try another initiative and then suddenly there is a flood of very fast, very mediocre work, and you have to begin to scramble to increase your quality again.

The third reason that going slow can help you go fast is an unexpected quirk of human systems: just putting your attention on something—without doing anything—can change what happens. You’ve seen this one too. You get feedback that you’ve been interrupting others in meetings, and you set out to prove that it’s wrong. As you watch yourself, you notice that you don’t interrupt at all! And then your feedback-giver comes back to congratulate you on your changed behavior when you hadn’t intended to change anything. This also happens at scale, when we begin to notice something collectively. Drawing attention to the idea that people have been a little profligate with their use of office supplies can have an effect on how people use office supplies (although, like so many complex systemic effects, you can’t know whether people will begin to use fewer supplies—because they’re being mindful about it—or more supplies—because they’re being passive aggressive about it).

So while action is useful in complexity, not all actions are useful. And the kind of reflexive action that is created by our sympathetic nervous system is rarely useful. We need to slow down to learn as well as speed up to fix. We know that our bodies will pull us to motion. But to truly learn enough to change our perspective and then change the system, we need to resist that action urge.

For example, an executive team was on the eleventh item in a packed agenda when Khalil, the chief operations officer, voiced his frustration that a decision had been taken by a colleague’s team that had led to extra work for one of the operations teams. After some discussion about why this was so annoying and what was to blame, Khalil’s colleagues began to offer ideas about how to keep this from happening again. Perhaps whenever a team made a decision that had some impact on operations, Khalil’s team should be notified. Another colleague offered the idea that there were some meetings where operations were often discussed, and perhaps Khalil should have a member of his operations team attend those meetings. Yet another possibility was that the executive team could circulate a weekly email questionnaire about any operations-related decisions, and someone from Khalil’s team could compile them and bring them to his attention. As they were debating these choices, one of the team members turned to Khalil. “Were you wanting us to fix this or were you just letting us know that sometimes your job is annoying?”

Khalil laughed. “I think it was the second!” The team members looked around, a little taken aback. “So we don’t need to make any changes?” someone asked.

“Nah, this kind of thing is just going to happen in a company as big as ours,” Khalil told them. “And now that I’ve heard what it could take to prevent it from happening again, I’m guessing that each of these solutions would actually cause more work and an even bigger problem in the end.” The group laughed.

“It sucks that this whole thing happened to you, Khalil. Sounds like your job can be really annoying!” one of them said, practicing her best listening without fixing. Khalil and the rest of the team laughed, and they moved on to the next topic in their agenda.

Noticing that they were simply acting because they were driven by their action urge saved the team from some significant—and probably wasteful—changes.[^10]

After she dropped the kids at school and unclipped the puppy from her leash, Alison paused to consider her racing heart. Only forty-five minutes before the Town Hall, Alison was still in her sweats, hadn’t read through her notes this morning, and hadn’t even glanced at her email. She could see that Mark had left his running clothes and shoes in a heap next to the door, and she felt that quick hot surge of anger that seemed always right under the surface these days. She noticed that she wanted to do basically everything at once: get dressed, make coffee, clean the mess, answer emails, and check the engagement scores which were supposed to come in this morning. Sometimes the overwhelm of choosing where to start made her mostly just want to go back to bed.

It was a radical idea to close all of their offices during the pandemic and take a bet on the idea of working from anywhere, and the jury was still out about whether it was a good idea. True, AN&M had been able to expand its global footprint quickly, and their costs had plummeted as they stopped paying for the fancy offices and all that those offices required. But those savings came with big costs. The connections between people, the goodwill they shared—all of it seemed to have disintegrated as they let go of the buildings where they used to work. The coworking spaces which they were funding all over the world just seemed to emphasize the thousands of islands that had once felt like one big land mass.

Alison, as a tech-geek turned CEO, had thought she wouldn’t miss the office so much, but once it was gone for good, she discovered that she had gotten a huge amount of her energy from thinking together, from checking in with people as they grabbed a piece of fruit from the shared fridge, from the reflected joy when someone landed a cool new client. She hadn’t noticed earlier, but it seemed to be that she got both information and some sense of connection and calm from those casual conversations while waiting for the tea to brew. Alison’s desk in her basement office seemed to be a world away from the others and balanced precariously on the edge of her capabilities.

Her phone rang and pulled her out of her thoughts. She checked the screen: Henry, her Chief Operating Officer. “Alison, I’ve just gotten the latest engagement scores, and they are dismal. We’re going to have to announce some new culture initiative at the Town Hall today or we’re going to start hemorrhaging people.” His voice was clipped and tense. Of course, Henry’s voice was often like that these days.

“Henry, we knew these scores were coming,” Alison said, heading to her office to open the email with the data. “We have been talking about what we want to do with them, and we’re not ready yet to make a move. We need to pause and make sense of them first.” She stopped with her hand on the door, noticing that she was telling him to pause while actually walking to do something.

“There’s no time for pausing!” Henry said, impatiently. “You said yourself that we knew these terrible scores were coming. I’ve had two teams coming up with solutions for the past three weeks. We’re ready to simply pick one and announce it.”

“I hear how much you want to spring into action, Henry,” Alison said, forcing herself to stay still in her kitchen. “I totally feel that too! I want to fix this instantly—yesterday would be too late. But I think right now is the very worst time to decide what’s next. Let’s get through the Town Hall this morning and then regroup. With a little bit more distance, we’ll be able to see more clearly.” As the phone clicked off, Alison stared out into the leafy backyard she was mostly too busy to visit. This job had never been easy, but these days it seemed mostly impossible. Either she was going to have to find a new way forward or find a new job. She was just not cut out for this.

INTENTIONAL EVOLUTION: FIND YOUR COMPLEXITY GENIUS AND AMPLIFY IT

So far what we’ve been talking about is the system that evolution has created for us. We get it automatically, just for being born: hundreds of thousands of years of experimentation into how we protect ourselves and keep ourselves alive long enough to reproduce and raise our young. This is what evolution offers to all living things on the planet.

But evolution has also given humans an unusual extra genius, one that might be our birthright alone: a relationship to our own minds and bodies that grows and changes over time. This relationship creates a developmental path—a small evolutionary impulse in each of us. And unlike the evolving nervous system, which might take hundreds or thousands of years to catch up with the demands of our current lives, this evolutionary impulse of our minds unfolds anew in each human lifetime.[^11] All of us have the capacity for our own intentional evolution.

This means that over time we can shape what our nervous system offers. When we are very young, there is no separation from the signals our nervous system sends us and the actions that we take. When we are frightened, we wail. When we want to touch the shiny sharp object, our hands dart out. Growing up is in part a journey of learning to recognize and manage our impulses.

But even once we are able to resist bursting into tears when we stub our toe or refrain from hitting someone who has taken something we wanted, there is another set of difficulties for us to cope with as the modern world continuously levels up the challenge of life. Now we need to deal with our sense of threat when we experience the emotional pain of not being invited to drinks after work, or the sense of loss when we don’t get into the university of our choice, or when the wrong candidate wins. We have to deal with our _needing_ to have the latest camera on our phone, _needing_ to have a promotion to feel whole and good about ourselves. And for each of these pains and these needs, no matter how far away they might be from literal life and death issues, our nervous system is still experiencing threat and longing, still mobilizing to relieve the discomfort of desire or try to save our lives.

Our current age requires the brilliance of our nervous system, slowly evolved over generations, to work together with what we call our “complexity genius.” Our complexity genius is our ability to see and respond to our nervous system and make intentional choices. This is a capacity that can evolve quickly, even over the course of reading this book. Instead of mindlessly heeding the impulses that happen so fast we hardly notice them, we can intentionally amplify our complexity genius to create spaces that bring out the best our nervous system can offer to us.

We know how to do so many things to shape our external environments—we look at a dozen apartments before making the choice of which one is best, we DIY our kitchen to make it more useful and appealing, we rearrange our office to help us get more work done. But too often we don’t try to shape our _internal_ environments. Too often the cycling of our nervous system just happens to us, driven by those conditions outside us and those unconscious conditions inside us. From here on, look out for the Genius Engagement Moves (GEMs) to let you not only find what’s going on in your nervous system but begin to make intentional shifts. Use these GEMs to amplify your own complexity genius.

GEM: RECOGNIZE THE ACTION URGE

The first genius practice is to find and notice what your action urge feels like. For Jennifer, it sometimes feels like a sense of unease, the strong notion that something is wrong and needs fixing. Sometimes it looks like searching for the best answer or even (as much as it pains her to admit it) the best fake question that is an answer all dressed up to look like a question. But more often, her action urge looks like, well, action. Jennifer finds that her hands move toward her phone at the same time a question is forming that might require a Google search. She hits “reply” to an email that annoys her before even understanding why she’s so annoyed. If she is not aware, she sends the email before even noticing the action urge. This looks frighteningly like sleepwalking through her life, reacting out of impulse, and not intention. It was useful to have our impulses rule us when we were sprinting from danger; it is less useful to fire off a text message when you feel dangerously misunderstood. These two forms of threat are different and require wholly different actions.

Carolyn’s action urge turns up a little differently. Carolyn was working with her coach Doug Silsbee (who later became a close friend and collaborator) who noticed that she had a strong tendency to ask, “Why is this happening?” or “Why do I do that?” Doug helped Carolyn to see that her habit of asking these “why” questions, while comfortingly familiar, was energy-sapping and tended to dig her deeper into the hole of her frustration. It turned out to be more rumination and self-blame than genuine curiosity. Her “why” questions were about finding the root cause so that she could follow her own action urge.

With some practice, Carolyn could (occasionally at first) interrupt that habit and instead notice the inner, embodied experience that was happening at the same time. It was a physical discomfort that she began to notice—the discomfort of being out of control, of not knowing the answer. Over time, Carolyn found that she could instead make a small shift in her body—like breathing more deeply or shifting her attention to her feet—to amplify a sense of calm and stability instead of spinning around questions with no helpful answers. She could use what was going on inside her to eventually expand her options for what to do outside her.

One of the most important ways to unleash your complexity genius is to notice this action urge and pause, stay with the discomfort you might feel, and then make a choice about whether to act or not.

So you try it. Over the course of the next hour or so, pay attention to your own action urge. Notice when you find yourself needing to comfort, correct, compel, or convince. Notice when you are feeling an almost physical urge to interrupt, to override, to divert. Notice when you are asking why me, why this, why now? At first our action urge might only be visible to us after we have taken an action, but eventually, with practice, you’ll notice the action urge before it leads you to make a move.

Spotting our action urge is just the first of many GEMs that will help us shift our nervous system to be more fit for this complex world of ours. The next step is starting with what’s going on for you right now.

**START WITH THE PRESENT**

_The Genius of Noticing_

Pete didn’t know where to put his hands. When he put them in his pocket, he felt like a kid slouching around. But when they just dangled by his side, he felt the itch to grab Supriya’s hand. And that idea was crazy—this was a first date, and she wasn’t giving off any of those signals that might be encouraging. In fact, in her mask he couldn’t read her at all.

“Do you think?” she finished.

Pete felt his face move into a nervous half-smile. Without a mask sometimes he felt more exposed, more vulnerable. “I’m really sorry, Supriya,” he said. “Usually I’m a good listener, but today I am really not onto it. Can you say that again?”

Supriya stopped walking and turned to face him. “I’m nervous too,” she said, her eyes crinkling into a smile above her mask. “Plus I have the sniffles so I feel like I need to wear this thing to protect other people from whatever I might have. To make up for my discomfort, I’ve been asking a ton of questions—I guess that’s an occupational habit for a psychologist. Let’s just take a minute to feel our feet on this ground and see if we can arrive here together with a couple of breaths. Is that weird?”

Pete looked beyond her at the pond in the distance. He noticed his own breath now, shallow and puffing from walking up the hill—and from being on a first date in the first place. And as he tuned in, he could feel the chatter in his mind get a little quieter. “Thanks,” he said. “Now can you just repeat what you were saying?”

“I was just noticing that you and I had such totally different growing up experiences—you as one of the only Black kids in your suburban high school and me as one of a million Indian immigrants in mine, but that has led us both back to live with our parents in Jamaica Plain. It seems to just highlight how totally uncertain life is and also how strange it is that different paths lead to exactly the same place.”

“Yeah, it’s wild, isn’t it, the way life is just what we make of an almost random series of chances?” Pete’s mind was totally present now. “Dad used to tease me about giving up my fancy West Coast job and memorizing hardware lines, but neither of us really imagined I’d ever actually do that. I think he secretly wished I would, but he never ever pressured me about it. And it took Dad dying in the first COVID wave for me to do what he had always wanted. I feel bad in basically every way about that.”

“That sounds so hard, Pete,” Supryia said, her voice tinged with sadness. “Funny how easy it is to ignore an unspoken wish.” There was a break in the trees, and Supriya stopped walking to look out at the view. “Pete, you’ve had such an enormous amount of loss—how are you coping with it all?”

Pete realized they were standing with their shoulders touching now as they gazed down at the water. His mind raced into the future: Would he try to kiss her at the end of the date? Would he see her again? And then he pulled himself back to the present. “I think every day is different. There are times when I can really handle all of the difficulties, and times when they seem to swamp me. There are some days when the new life is exciting and full of possibilities, and I relish the time with my mom and the growing of the kids. And there are days when I am so stressed and overwhelmed that my life seems absolutely impossible, and I get mired in something like hopelessness. And I’m not even sure I understand why it moves around so much. Sometimes I feel like I’m just not cut out for all this change.”

Supriya started walking again as she answered. “I’ve been finding that the world is knocking me around a lot more than it used to, even without all the losses you’ve suffered,” she admitted. “Some days it’s a struggle to just pull on a decent blouse and see one client after the next on the screen. But I’ve also found resources—in me and in my clients, in all of us I guess—that are more extraordinary than I would have known before. Resources that are more exciting than I remember in my psychology classes.”

“Man, I’d love to have a pocket full of those!” Pete said, wistfully.

“The good news,” Supriya said, her eyes crinkling into a smile again, “is your pockets are full of them already.”

COMPLEXITY: THE FUTURE EMERGES FROM WHAT’S HAPPENING NOW

One of our favorite ideas from complexity is to remember that the seeds for the future exist right now. Whatever the conditions are right now, that’s what you’ve got as ingredients to make the future.

OK, OK, this doesn’t seem revolutionary. You get that you can only make a sandwich with whatever happens to be in the kitchen. No matter how much you crave sun-dried tomatoes and goat cheese on a baguette, if all you have is peanut butter and jelly and stale white bread, that’s what’s for lunch.

But we mistake this all the time by looking at our goals for the future as if they have little to do with what happens now. We watch the organizations we work with as they set new goals: for more diversity, for more innovation, for more psychological safety. Each of these feels like an item people can order from the Organizational Development Corner Shop. But there are no shops like that. Instead, people have to look inside the cupboards of the present to figure out what kind of future they might be able to create from the ingredients they already have.

The outcomes you’re getting today are the result of the way the context is working right now. In complexity lingo, we say these outcomes are the “emergent properties” of the system. What that means is that all the various pieces are interacting together, and something comes out of that. You can’t _make_ an emergent property exist. The system does that for you. And it’s doing it for you now—whatever is being produced is the outcome that the context is creating. If you rush ahead to think about how you want your context to look next, you’ll miss all the clues to what is making it this way now.

For example, if your present organization is filled with the sort of competition that undercuts teamwork, it’s not enough to just try to offer workshops on being more collaborative. You have to look at what is conspiring to create the conditions of that undercutting competition right now—the ways you reward folks, talk about success, punish poor performance. Importantly, you’re not searching to find the root cause of the issue, because this is a fool’s errand; there are no root causes in complex situations. If you search for a root cause, you’ll have to either search forever or else settle on something that looks like a root cause while distracting you from seven or seventy other things that could also look like root causes. The reason we look at this present moment is to understand as well as we can that the interactions of these elements as they exist today are the ingredients available to change tomorrow. Right now those ingredients are interacting to create competition that undercuts teamwork. To change the future, you have to first really, really understand the present.

THE GENIUS OF NOTICING

Even if you are getting convinced by this idea that we need to understand the present in order to act in our uncertain and complex world, you might wonder why we think that “noticing” is itself a complexity genius. You noticed a whole variety of things in the last hour—perhaps that the milk was souring in the fridge, that you double booked yourself for two meetings at the same time on Tuesday, and that once again your daughter left her wet towel on the bathroom floor. Hardly feels like a genius—it just contributes to your frustration and disorientation!

So we’ll be more specific. The genius of noticing is when you do it intentionally. The fact that we can call our attention from one thing that grabs it to another thing that might be better for our lives—this is genius. And indeed, the act of calling upon our noticing to work for us is helpful inside and out. (You’ve been practicing this already as you’ve noticed your action urge.)

Inside us, the act of noticing changes our state, beginning to awaken that complexity-friendly nervous system. Remember that when our sympathetic nervous system is in charge, our attention narrows, and we lose the peripheral vision to notice anything other than that which is creating the challenge and threat. As meditation teachers have been saying for centuries, our capacity to direct our attention is a core piece of handling all that the world throws at us. Too often we are bossed around by the shiny (or stinky) things that happen to catch our eye. Calling our attention back to us means that we can make choices about our reactions.

Like Lin. Only three months into her new job as a communications manager, Lin could feel her anxiety rise as she clicked on the link for the meeting with her direct reports. She had thought this was her dream job, but it was turning out to be something of a nightmare. The team was mistrustful of her and of one another, and she seemed to be surrounded by people who were incompetent. Worse, every move she made to make it better just seemed to be making it worse. In this meeting she was finally going to let her team know that she would need to see their rough drafts forty-eight hours before the deadline so that she would have time to edit them herself. It was exhausting, but at least it meant she wouldn’t be embarrassed by the mistakes in work that was allegedly finished.

She was the first to arrive to the meeting. She blinked at her own image on the screen, and then she remembered what she was working on as a leader: simply noticing what was going on for her. She took a few deep breaths and allowed her eyes to close for a minute as she took a rare moment to check in with herself.

And then, as she opened her eyes, she tapped into the genius of noticing. She noticed that she tended to come to meetings with a full agenda and to talk a lot more than she listened. She noticed that she didn’t know her team members particularly well, and they didn’t know her. And she noticed that she didn’t give much feedback one-on-one because it made her so uncomfortable, which was maybe making it hard for her team to learn the things she so desperately wanted to teach them.

Suddenly, Lin could see that she was spending a lot of her time spinning, and that it was maybe the spinning that was causing some of the problems rather than (just) the problems causing the spinning. Her frustration crumbled away for just a moment, and the light that came through the cracks was the sunshine of curiosity. Noticing had shifted Lin’s internal state.

Outside us, too, the act of noticing shifts what’s possible. When we are focused on a goal or a task, we stop being able to see the full field in front of us. This is great when that field doesn’t matter because things are so predictable that you know every player and every move. This is not so great when the complexity of the world means that we need to pay attention to what might be brewing unexpectedly. Here, in the complex world outside you, you need to be able to actively move your attention from the tasks that narrow our focus to the whole. You need your noticing genius.

Even though we’ve been teaching about this idea for years, we make this mistake all the time, too. Take our work at Cultivating Leadership, the firm we founded with our friends Keith Johnston and Jim Wicks more than a decade ago. For years—literally for years—we on the leadership team would talk about our desire to diversify the members of our organization. We would congratulate ourselves about our gender mix (which always hovered near the fifty-fifty mark), and we would angst about the racial composition of our collective. And we would recommit to growing our diversity.

Even though we knew this rule of complexity—that the future emerges from what’s happening now—we kept staring into our future goals without noticing well enough the patterns of the present.

And then we caught ourselves doing this. We slowed down and noticed. We looked at the patterns of now and wondered how it was new colleagues came to join us. And we discovered—not so surprisingly, but ultimately transformationally—that new colleagues came from our own watering holes, the places where we hung out. We realized that it made sense for a leadership firm founded by two men and two women to stay gender balanced. And that a leadership firm founded by four white people would probably, without thoughtful effort, stay pretty white.

To make the change we desperately wanted to make, we had to shift the way we saw who we were and what we wanted to become. We had to pay attention to how things were happening right now. We had to tap into the genius of noticing.

GEM: SCAN YOUR INNER WORLD

Let’s start inside. How often have you been moving from meeting to meeting and then, when you slowed down for a moment, noticed that in addition to being out of sorts, you also have a headache? It takes noticing to even begin to disrupt the stories you have about what’s wrong (that is, if you even noticed you had a particular story in the first place) and wonder: Was it the nonstop meetings that caused the headache? The headache that caused the out-of-sorts? The out-of-sorts anxiety that led you to schedule three more meetings? Inside us and outside us, our complex world means there probably isn’t one unidirectional, root cause.

So notice. First, check in with your body. How are you sitting or standing right now? What shape do you have? What parts of your body feel more or less relaxed?

Second, check in with your breath. Where is your breath and what is it doing? Is it high in your chest, shallow, quick? You can see what moves when you breathe—your neck and shoulders (high, shallow breath) or your diaphragm and stomach (lower, deeper breath). You don’t need to change this. Just notice.

Then turn to your thoughts. If your thoughts were a weather system and you were the meteorologist of your thought weather, what would you describe? Blue sky with gentle cloud-thoughts drifting by? Thick pea-soup thought fog? A swirling tornado of whirling thoughts?

Finally, check in with your emotions. The more specific and nuanced we can be about noticing what’s going on for us, the less likely we’re going to be swept away by emotions. Just naming them gives us some distance to see them. And our emotions don’t generally come one by one, but in a whole bubbling stew. Engaging our noticing genius is about separating out the various ingredients of that emotional stew, and the more specific we can be about naming those ingredients, the more genius we have access to.

Now that you have unleashed the genius of noticing what’s going on inside you, you can begin to think about where you are right now.

GEM: PRACTICE ARRIVING

Conscious arrival has always been foundational to important rituals, but it has become almost lost in today’s rush from virtual call to virtual call. This is a shame because we have seen the practice of arriving intentionally transform not only the nervous system of the leader herself, but also the nervous systems of everyone around. In this time of racing from place to place, it can take quite some time to show up—with your full attention—in the place where you are. In complexity, your attention is one of your most essential tools.

So gather your attention and use it. Give yourself another thirty seconds at the start of whatever you’re doing to land where your meeting is, even if it’s a virtual space. Put down whatever was happening in the moments before this meeting and whatever is going to happen next. Notice where you are in your physical space, and take a moment to ready that space for this particular meeting (with a cup of coffee or a clearing of the desk or an opening of the right folders on your computer). Remind yourself of the purpose of this gathering of people at this time. Specifically. Not what the meeting is called: “This is the Monday business meeting of my team,” but the reason for calling the meeting: “The purpose of this meeting is for us to be able to know enough about what’s going on for one another that we can be all working together even if we don’t see each other again for days.” And then, as a final step, think about how you want to show up in this meeting. What’s needed from you: To be more decisive? More open? To listen better? To be clearer? Just jot it down wherever you take notes as a reminder.

There. Engaging our noticing genius also means creating the conditions inside you to actually become present where you are. Now you’ve arrived. You’ve called the best version of yourself forward. That was sixty seconds well spent. Now you’re ready to look outside.

GEM: INTENTIONALLY NOTICE PATTERNS AROUND YOU

Obviously, it’s not enough to scan what’s inside you—what’s outside matters too! But the genius here is to use your open and curious state to scan for patterns that you might otherwise be blind to.

The first step, of course, is to begin with now. Ask yourself: What do you know to be true about this situation? Get yourself a list of facts and beliefs about what’s going on here and see if you can be wide and broad with this list. Keep asking yourself, “What else is true here?” until you run out of ideas.

You might feel trapped in your current job, for example, and know that there’s basically nothing you can do about it. Asking what is true right now rather than what you wish were true gets you a list like:

It’s really hard to find a new job in my field;

I have student loans to pay off;

If my boss would just cut me a break, this job wouldn’t be so bad;

The expectations of this current project are simply impossible to meet;

If I had gotten that promotion, I would be so much happier.

Keep at it. At first the ideas will be the ones that usually swirl around, but as you keep pushing forward with the same question, you get into new territory.

Then look at that list. See if you can put aside those issues that are about predicting the future or rehashing the past (or both, like that assumption about being happier with the promotion). Now you’re left with what’s really going on right now.

The third step is asking: What would I have to believe for this truth to change? You might want to see how many different ways you could change your belief for that idea to change. Take, for example, the first belief: “It’s really hard to find a new job in my field.”

I would have to believe that while the field is crowded, my experience in this job would help me stand apart;

Or, I would have to believe that perhaps I’ve been thinking about “my field” too narrowly, and there are other possibilities;

Or, I would have to believe that the number of positions is actually growing rather than shrinking.

And so on. Engaging our noticing genius means letting go of what we wish or fear were true and turning to what is true right now. It means pushing ourselves past the obvious things that arise at first and into new and potentially more fruitful territory. And it means remembering that our beliefs construct what we notice which constructs what we believe. So noticing on purpose and questioning those beliefs is pure genius.

Beginning with what is happening now—in our bodies and in our homes and in our organizations—allows us to see patterns that shape our lives. Of course, we care about where we are going, but if we do not notice where we are beginning, the pathway is impossible to find. Action matters—we’ll talk more about that as we go along. But action in the absence of noticing the present is often just wasted effort. If we are not noticing ourselves and our surroundings in this moment, we can’t make changes that shift us to a better tomorrow. But now that we’ve noticed, we can start to shift. First let’s start close to home: shifting you.

**ADJUST YOURSELF FIRST**

_The Genius of Breathing, Moving, and Sleeping_

Mark tried again to settle into the desk chair. A few years ago, he’d thought of his office as one of the most comfortable and familiar places in his world. He’d spent way too many hours there, and the piles of dirty cups and takeout containers had been clear evidence. Not to mention the silly supplies that had been piling up—the noisemaking horns from a celebration of a new launch a few years ago and the feather boas from a rather loud office cabaret night.

But this postpandemic office had none of that. Now he signed out whatever space was available. No pictures, no stacks of paper, and certainly no feather boas: this room was tidy to the point of sterility. He would feel more at home in a run-down diner he’d never been to before! And worse, in this sterile space he’d have to have a series of conversations of the most fundamentally unpleasant variety—the ones about not having a job anymore.

This hybrid work thing had seemed like such a good idea—the ultimate in having your cake and eating it too. He could live in the almost absurdly charming Edenville with all the sweetness and ease of small-town life and come down to the office every month or so to catch up and have the in-person meetings he clearly needed so much. But the intensity of the coordination (who is going to be in the office and when) plus the added load of the ambiguity about what things were better done in the office versus online was exhausting. And now, with this second round of job cuts, he was feeling like the only thing that happened in the office these days was misery.

His phone rang. Alison. He stared blankly at the screen, trying to decide what it might mean. It was a video call, so she must be in a good mood—she mostly went to audio calls if she was upset. But it was here in the middle of the day, so it wasn’t one of the kids calling to show him something from school. And things were pretty tense between them these days, so maybe he would call her back later. Besides, she was the one telling him to focus and breathe more, to be present with where he was instead of on his phone all the time. He clicked “decline” as the door opened.

Simon walked in and sat down heavily in one of the office chairs. His face had a high flush, and he was a little out of breath.

“Sorry I was late. I swear the traffic around here has never been worse. I thought for a while I wouldn’t make it at all, but then an accident must have been cleared or whatever and so the road opened up. Anyway, here I am! And I know you’ve called people in today, and there is a lot of word on the street that this is not a good sign. So I’m here but I’m nervous, and I’m hoping you’re about to tell me about a promotion or something and not about bad news again. I’m just not sure I could handle bad news.” He looked away, fidgeting uncomfortably in his seat.

Mark opened his mouth to comfort Simon, to reassure him and tell him all was going to be OK. He noticed that his mouth was already forming the words, “It’s all OK,” as he wanted so desperately to help Simon feel more comfortable. But he was trying to stay present and just notice that he wanted to fix things without actually fixing them.

“Yeah. It’s a crazy time right now,” Mark said, focusing for a minute on his breath. “I can imagine you’d be anxious about why I called you in for this meeting. Let’s just focus on what’s going on now and we can talk it through together.”

START WITH YOU: YOU HAVE TO SHIFT THE INSIDE BEFORE YOU CAN SHIFT THE OUTSIDE

We think we see the world clearly. But it turns out, it’s not as if you can see the world as it is. There are so many things happening all the time that to see it all would be crippling, if it were even possible. So we filter out most of the world, and then try to make sense of what we’ve filtered. Philosophers began to write thousands of years ago about what psychologists and neuroscientists have proven since: we _construct_ our version of the world by seeing it. Life happens to us, and our nervous system responds and shapes what we see. That response shapes what we do, which shapes the way life is happening, which shapes what we see, which shapes the way the nervous system responds. And so on.

For example, both Carolyn and Jennifer spent time wishing for a baby before we had our children. In those days of waiting and hoping, it seemed to both of us (before we ever met and while living in different cities) that nearly every person in the street was either pregnant or pushing a stroller. Was this true? Were there really mini baby booms around the years we wanted kids? No. But the internal state of our longing changed the external things we noticed. This contributed to our misery about not yet having children which maybe slowed down our ability to get pregnant in the first place. What we saw shaped how we felt, which shaped what we saw next.

And, like most humans, because we hadn’t noticed the ways we were nudging or shaping events, we had the experience that these events were totally outside our control. And it’s true that in a complex situation, we cannot directly control what’s happening the way we can in a complicated one. Too often, the frustration that comes with what feels like powerlessness makes us try harder and harder to predict and control (that pesky action urge again)—to come up with a better system, to buckle down and prevent the mistakes of last time, to get our people to run the analysis one more time to be sure we’ve got it right.

Perhaps we are so devoted to making things feel tractable even when they aren’t because we feel so out of control and hopeless when we realize that we cannot command the future. Hopelessness is one of the most draining and disabling of all of our emotions. Maybe most of us would rather pour a lot of energy into even useless activity if it keeps us from being hopeless. But there is a better way.

THE GENIUS OF BREATHING

The single most powerful communication channel we have for our nervous systems is our breath. It is not only the way we can find out which nervous system is running us, it’s also the way to switch gears.

Jennifer had been learning about the power of breath for a few months when she became the guinea pig for a demonstration in a workshop more than a decade ago. The teacher was a physician who was talking about resilience, and he asked Jennifer to come to the front of the room where he clipped a monitor to her finger and projected her vital signs on the screen behind her. He asked her a variety of questions that she could tell were designed to stress her out: Could she name five important things that she wasn’t giving enough attention to? Were there some conversations she needed to have that she was putting off? She could feel her heart starting to race and her hands starting to sweat. There were so many important things she was neglecting, and one conversation in particular she was dreading. But she was practicing noticing and then breathing intentionally. She felt her breath high in her chest and, as she had been practicing, imagined a gentle force pushing it lower and slower. She focused fully on that for a moment as the teacher continued to ask questions.

As she breathed, she could hear a gentle murmur arise in the group. “What’s happening?” someone asked.

“I’m not sure,” the teacher answered. “We were seeing a stress response, and now we seem to be not seeing one. This doesn’t usually happen. Jennifer, what’s going on for you?”

“I’m breathing!” she answered, and the class laughed. They thought she was cracking a joke, telling them nothing. Breathing, the most constant, ordinary thing in the world, was not an explanation for something that didn’t usually happen.

But it turns out it _is_ an explanation, and the outcome of it can be seen plainly, whether it’s projected on a screen at the front of the room or felt inside your body. If we are going to deal well with the massive rise in complexity in our lives, our breath is both our most important teacher and our most important student. Probably more than any other complexity approach, the breath is the most constant, most important, and most immediate communication mechanism we have with our entire nervous system, which, as we are learning, is also our complexity management system.

The genius of your breath—like the other geniuses—is that it is both an automatic and an intentional process in your body. There aren’t many of our vital life processes like that. Heart beating? You can’t directly control that. Kidneys working to filter the nutrients from the waste? You can’t directly control that. Immune system working? You can’t directly control that. But your breath happens automatically all the time _and_ you can also directly control it. That is genius!

It’s also always with us. Some of the other practices in this book can be tricky if you’re in your quarterly sales review or strapped into the middle seat on an airplane. But your breath is always right there, and you can always learn from it and use it to teach your body things.

The breath is the literal switch from the sympathetic to the parasympathetic nervous system. Breathe in—you’ve just activated the sympathetic nervous system for that moment. Breathe out—there, that’s the parasympathetic working for an instant. Our breath is the key move in the dance of our two nervous systems.

But we do more than just breathe in and out—we breathe in fairly patterned ways, and those patterns can teach us what’s going on. We started with just _noticing_ the breath in the last chapter. But we can do more than just notice. First, we can _learn_ from it: a pattern of shallow breath is an indicator that perhaps our sympathetic nervous system is activated—more inhale than exhale. You know that feeling, right, like you’re almost holding your breath? Like it’s not quite safe to let it all out? In fact, right now you can turn on your sympathetic nervous system by making your breath shallow and quick: a few panting breaths and your heart rate will rise, and your body will begin to release adrenaline. As you do that, you might notice your emotions shift, and you start to get a little anxious or excited. (And if you keep going, you might hyperventilate, which can make you feel a little panicked, so you can stop breathing shallowly and quickly now.)

Shifting the pattern of our breath is also a prime gateway to the parasympathetic nervous system. Just as you were able to cue the sympathetic nervous system, you can intentionally use your breath to cue the parasympathetic. There are a few moves that send the loudest signals and we’ll practice them below. Each of these elements tells your nervous system that you’re safe and well, and you don’t have to run from anything.

We know this isn't the first time you have heard that you should manage your breath before you picked up this book. Breathwork has been a part of people’s practices all over the world for millennia. We are just offering one more reason to pay attention to this ancient idea. If you want to manage complexity, you need to be managing your breath. Perhaps even more importantly, if you have others around you that you lead when you are feeling stressed out—whether you’re their boss or their parent—you need to shift your nervous system before you can help them lead theirs. So, for complexity’s sake, lean into the genius of breathing.

_GEM: Choose Your Breath_

We’re offering three different breath practices, and you can see which one works for you. Or try them all out at different times. The important thing is to remember that this is your switch into a complexity-friendly way for your body to engage with the world.

_Deep breath_. Here the focus is on moving the breath from the chest to the diaphragm. Notice your breath and see if you can move it deeper and deeper into the bottom of your lungs. It can help to put one hand on your chest and one on your stomach to see whether you can lower the breath from your chest into your stomach. We find that imagining a force pushing it down toward our stomachs is a help. As our diaphragms move rhythmically with the breath, they signal to the parasympathetic nervous system that all is well.

_Slower exhale_. Remember, the exhale is the parasympathetic system at work—so let’s use that to signal good things to our nervous systems. Make sure your exhale is longer and slower than your inhale to remind your body that you’re not in danger. Counting is useful here. Try an inhale to the count of six and an exhale to the count of eight. Repeat this for five breaths to give your parasympathetic nervous system a chance to kick in.

_Box breath_. This practice is useful when your mind is swirling, because the practice of it requires attention. Breathe in for a count of six, hold your breath for a count of six, breathe out for a count of six, hold the breath out for a count of six. As you’ve been holding your breath, the carbon dioxide has been gently increasing in your blood, which (in small doses) enhances the signal to the parasympathetic. Every piece of the breathing rhythm now has your attention and your intention. Your sympathetic nervous system will feel that intention and quiet. Engaging your breathing genius means creating the conditions for you and those around you to meet the complexity of the world with a settled, creative nervous system.

Mark opened his eyes as his alarm rang. He had been lying awake for the last little while in the half space between waking and sleeping that he was trying to think of as restorative instead of seeing it as a waste of his time. All those years of pushing his body to wake earlier and earlier had felt more productive, but he was noticing the cost. It still felt a little silly, but he had been doing some intentional deep breathing as he waited for the alarm and let his mind wander over the coming difficulties of the day.

The conversation with Simon the day before had rocked him. It was clearly true that Simon had not been performing as well as he needed to be. He was often late, and his projects simply didn’t sparkle as they once had. But it was also true that if he didn’t need to cut his budget to the bone, he would never be getting rid of Simon. As they talked while walking the day before, Simon told Mark that he and his husband were splitting, that they were arguing about custody of the baby they had adopted the year before, and that he was looking for a new place to live. He explained how much he loved this job, and he needed something with the flexibility of this role to be the dad he wanted to be. But it wasn’t just pity that was giving Mark second thoughts. Simon was incredibly smart as well as being the social heart of the team. If Simon went, Mark wasn’t totally sure that others who really were high performers would stay. He knew that there were recruiters constantly circling his best people.

Mark had left the conversation feeling exhausted and overwhelmed. He felt that way now, even as he was trying to lie quietly in bed. His mind took off, and the to-do list started to dance before him. He needed to reschedule some of his meetings for this morning to next week. He needed to figure out what to do about the budget, which wasn’t getting any easier. And, of course, he needed to make some kind of decision about Simon, whom he had failed to fire yesterday.

But before he did any of that, he could feel that his desire to fix and force and move was simply overwhelming his capacity do anything well. In order to soothe it, he pulled on his running clothes and headed for the door. Nothing cleared his mind as well as a good sweat. Even though it felt like he didn’t have time to move, he knew that he didn’t have any time not to either.

LEADERSHIP IN MOTION

Up until now, we’ve been trying to convince you that noticing and breathing are a kind of doing. But now we’re going to do something else with that action urge. Remember, leading in complexity requires leading your own nervous system and the nervous systems of others. So let’s tend to that action urge in the way it was meant to be tended to: by moving your body. Leaders and teams that thrive in complexity are able to use their entire leadership presence—from the top of their heads to the bottom of their feet—in order to lead well. That sometimes means moving everything!

THE GENIUS OF MOVING

We said this in chapter 1]]: one of the most interesting findings that we see across all different kinds of research is the basic news that our bodies are made to move. We know that doesn’t seem shocking at first glance—you moved just a few minutes ago to open up this book or to make a cup of coffee or to find a more comfortable position. But most of the people we work with spend most of their time not moving. The march of progress means we have outsourced our marching. For many of you reading this, movement has become somewhat optional. Our food comes to the grocery store or to our front door. Our work comes to our computers. Our cars, trains, airplanes bring us long distances with basically no physical effort. And so on. Evolution prepared us to move, and our modern world tells us to just sit down and think about things. It’s hard to come up with a leadership “move” made by a modern leader that requires moving more than just the mouth (or the hands, if the leader is feeling particularly expressive). Leaders are supposed to make decisions and offer directives and enlist the hearts and minds of all those around them using only a tiny portion of their bodily resources, and mostly standing—or sitting—still.

But for our bodies over evolutionary time, safety has been found in motion. The sympathetic nervous system kept us alive through movement to escape danger. And now it’s killing us because instead of sprinting off that built-up cortisol, we sit in traffic or at our computers and feel stressed out of our minds. Cortisol builds up and begins to shut down our most important health systems and corrode our arteries. So oddly, we were once creatures who had to move to save our lives from deadly things _outside_ us, and now we are creatures who have to move to save our lives from deadly things _inside_ us.

The other reason we need to move (do you need another reason beyond saving your life?) is because we still experience the desire to move, but in our stationary world the subtle craving for motion shows up as an action urge to make or fix or do. And while acting is a great thing (we’re going to talk about experimenting in the next chapter), the reflexive action of a stressed nervous system is basically never as creative or connected or experimental as a complex situation requires. Our modern world has shifted our body’s desire to move from danger into our mind’s desire to take charge. So if we don’t move our bodies, we will move into controlling or certainty or agreement or some other thing that makes our sympathetic nervous system feel safe. Which is, unfortunately, almost always the wrong thing to do when we are faced with complexity.[^1]

So what do we do about this? We cannot assert this enough: we need to move. When we are tired or stressed or too busy to have any time for anything, we need to move. We need to move each day.

Your gentle authors are not aligned in our particular love of movement. Carolyn would exercise each day no matter what was going on in her life. She would rather sweat than eat cake (seriously!). Jennifer, on the other hand, would rather weed the garden than exercise (although it must be noted that weeding is a generally underrated, delightful activity). So Jennifer has needed quite a significant argument to believe in the power of motion. And, wow, the data are just stunning.[^2]

There has never been any medication that has been shown to be as effective as motion for fighting off nearly everything that plagues us: heart disease, stroke, cancer, high blood pressure. And also depression, dementia, anxiety. Researchers aren’t even sure why the benefits of motion are so great, but some theorize it’s that pesky nervous system again. Ironically, we haven’t evolved to love exercise because as we evolved, exercise was simply necessary to staying alive. Now, though, our habits take us away from running and toward ruminating.

This means that when you are faced with a complex challenge, your reflex is probably to think it through. You might stay late at your desk, pushing around ideas or post-its, or sending email after email. You might think, “If I just could just find one more piece of data, read one more book, this solution would spring into clearer relief.” But the thing is, you’re not using the gifts of your body and brain well when you choose to buckle down and work through lunch. It’s like when your computer gets stuck and you just keep hitting keys, getting more and more frustrated with each keystroke. Often the thing to do is simply reboot. Movement is our rebooting switch.

Even in between one motion and the next, our body is shaping the way our nervous system responds. Gently rest a pencil in your teeth and you might find yourself feeling happier. It’s not the absurdity of the look that amuses you (or not _only_ that), it’s that your lips just moved into a smile which tells your body that you’re happy so your nervous system releases dopamine. Check your shoulders right now. If they’re tight or hovering high at your ears, they are telling your nervous system there’s something unsafe around you, and your body will activate the sympathetic nervous system to prepare for the threat. If you release them down your back, you’ll be signaling to the parasympathetic nervous system that it’s all good and there are no wolves or tigers in the vicinity.

This is because the complex adaptive system of our body means causality goes both ways. Remember that while we humans crave the causality that says X caused Y, in complex systems X and Y tend to somehow cause each other. That’s true for our bodies as well. We smile when we are happy, and we are happy when we smile. We lift and tense our shoulders when we are stressed, and we become stressed when we lift and tense our shoulders. Understanding this two-way street means we can walk it more gracefully.

_GEM: Choose Your Shape_

First, of course, the practice is to notice. How are you shaped right now? Curled up in a small ball? Stretched out like you own the place? Harvard professor Amy Cuddy found in her research that the shape you took not only changed the way people thought about you (when you take up more space physically, you seem more impressive), but it also changed the way your own hormones seemed to think about you (when you make yourself smaller, you release more cortisol, and when you make yourself bigger, you release more testosterone). Many other studies find the same thing: the way your body is shaped changes the way the world looks and feels.[^3]

So think about whether your shape says what you want it to say—to you and to the world. Notice if you’re wanting to be more flexible about the decisions your team is making in this meeting, but your muscles are tight. See if you can relax your muscles or change your position to stretch in new ways. Notice if you want people to take you more seriously but you’ve curled your body to make yourself as small as possible. Or if you’re trying to interrupt less in a meeting, notice if your legs and arms are all sprawled out, taking up more than your fair share of room. Change your body to try a different shape, and see how that changes what arises inside and outside you.

_GEM: Get Moving_

Then there are the genius practices of movement. These don’t need to take much time at all, but you should try them all. We are not offering you training suggestions to be a marathon runner. We are not even suggesting you do this to get into good shape. We are saying that a leadership skill that has long been ignored is using everything at your disposal to lead well. Not just your mind or your relational skills or your EQ. Also your body. To lead well in complexity, you have to move.

_Be breathless_. So what do you do? Get out of breath a couple of times a day. We’ve talked about breath already, and we know that a panting breath activates the sympathetic nervous system. So why would moving our body to be breathless help out? Two reasons: One is “parasympathetic rebound” which basically means that if you pump up your sympathetic system and then stop fast, you get a flood of parasympathetic goodness. (Remember, this is the way our nervous systems were always supposed to work together—a short burst of physical movement in the sympathetic causes a long, delightful, easy experience of the parasympathetic.) Second, moving fast uses up some of the stress hormones that are otherwise coursing through our veins like a bunch of bored troublemakers looking to knock over the mailboxes of your immune system just for a bit of fun.

So right now, go somewhere you can just run or dance and not feel entirely stupid (see, this is not a thing you can do in the middle seat on an airplane). Get up from your desk in your home office, head to the bathroom, pretend you need something upstairs. Put on music and see how your body wants to move. And move until you feel breathless. Then when you sit down again, see how you have just changed your entire physiology.[^4]

_Move fluidly_. OK, so this one is a little controversial from a science perspective, but we have found it to have an extraordinary effect in our lives and in the lives of our clients. There is some evidence that movement that crosses the midline of your body shifts the way the hemispheres of your brain engage. And there is at least one little study about creativity that shows that moving “fluidly” enhances your creativity.[^5]

Here’s our favorite fluid, midline-crossing motion, brought to us from the ancient art of tai chi. Stand up with enough space to move your arms. Plant your legs firmly on the ground, with your feet under your hips or a little wider. Then twist from your waist as though you were wanting to first look as far to the left and then as far to the right as possible. Pick up speed and let your hands fly along with you, wrapping around your body. If you do this to music and call this a dance, we won’t stop you.

Again, after trying two or three minutes of this motion, sit down and see what your body is now feeling, and notice the change. What you are likely feeling is the shift of nervous systems, and the possibility that you can now face into the complex challenges around you with more creativity, connection, and ease.

THE GENIUS OF SLEEPING

We can’t talk about shifting our internal state without mentioning shifting our sleep. If you are sleeping well already, skip this section and move on. But most of us don’t set ourselves up to get the seven to nine hours of recommended sleep opportunity each night. We know, as women who sometimes struggle with sleep ourselves, that telling people about the magic of sleep and how poor sleep is related to just about everything that frightens you (cancer, Alzheimer’s, stroke, depression, etc.) is not conducive to getting more sleep. Plus the things that help us sleep well (eliminating caffeine after noon, not drinking any alcohol within five hours of bedtime) can be real bummers.

But sleeping is an unexpected ingredient to activate our complexity genius. It enables so many of the features that allow us to be great at complexity—innovation, creativity, connection. Perhaps more importantly, when we give it up—often with the good intention to be more productive or efficient—we are setting ourselves up for big-time complexity challenges.

You might be unconvinced. How important can sleep be to your leadership practice when you are literally unconscious? Here are just a few mind-boggling facts to play with.[^6] To enable us to see patterns in order to address complex challenges, we need to be able to hold onto what we are seeing in the present. Sleep (particularly the deep sleep that happens early in the night) is astonishing at updating and pruning our memory as it moves memories from the brain’s short-term storage area to the more stable and longer-term memory space. Now you’ll be able to _do_ something with those things you noticed yesterday rather than having them simply slip away.

Sleep (in particular the sleep that happens in the morning just before we wake) also helps us make sense of the complex emotional soup we humans swim in. Without this sleep, we misread expressions in the face and in the voice, taking them (as you’d have guessed) for more threatening and dangerous than they are. We trust others less. We become less altruistic and more self-protective. Which makes people trust us less. (Once again, when our body is not at its rested best, we amplify threat at every turn.) This is a disaster for your complexity leadership: teams without trust simply cannot be agile enough to handle the interdependent and changing world complexity offers.

Anything you can do to help yourself sleep better will go some distance toward unleashing your complexity genius. This doesn’t mean you need to sleep well every night—we’re realists here with kids and pets and problems ourselves. But sleep is required for sustainable complexity genius, and these benefits happen immediately; every night you sleep well will offer some complexity goodness. You might be one of those readers who thinks you’re doing fine on the small amounts of sleep you’re getting. Research done with other people who say the same thing suggests that you’re not. (We know, we know, you’re totally different than those other folks. Could be true…)

Which leads us to a couple of GEMs to help awaken your sleeping genius.

_GEM: Treat Sleep as Part of Your Core Job_

If you think of sleeping as an annoyance that you would rather wish away, you are likely to minimize it, neglect it, rush it, and in so many ways, disrupt it.

If, on the other hand, you think of sleep as a core part of what you need to do to lead well, you will find ways to know that it is not slacking to skip the meeting at 10 p.m., it’s necessary.

As COVID shut down travel options, leaders began taking calls at absurd hours to handle the time zones they couldn’t cross in an airplane. It became routine to see leaders on the phone at midnight or 4 a.m. We started getting confused about whether some meetings were before a short and late night’s sleep or after a short and early night’s sleep. This sort of leadership shift work seemed like a necessity.

And yet.

A 10 p.m. meeting means your nervous system is amped up until well after midnight. If you have had to prop yourself up with caffeine or sugar, it might take you until 10 the next morning to clear your system for a night’s sleep. A system that isn’t ready to sleep at the times your body expects sleep literally misses the benefits of the sleep itself; even if you fall unconscious, it is not the restorative unconsciousness that works on your behalf. This means that much of what you did the day before will escape you and won’t encode into your longterm memory. It means that the decisions you make the next day will be lower quality. If your work is predictable and repeatable and you can do it by rote, it’s not so much a problem. But if you are doing work in complex conditions, you need all of your geniuses. That late-night meeting might steal the benefits of both workdays—and perhaps do lasting damage with decision-making or trust missteps.

If you believe that in order to lead well you will need to sleep, you’ll plan your nights as thoughtfully as your days because each of them is vital to the other.

_GEM: Stay in Bed Longer_

Planning your sleep during the day is only one part of the job. Now you have to follow through with what you’ve set out to do. And for many of us, even if we have the best intentions, what tends to happen is the classic reinforcing feedback loop. We don’t fall asleep easily, so we dread going to sleep, and we waste time doing mindless things on our phones or laptops to delay going to bed. This pushes our bedtime back longer, robbing us of the precious deep sleep that’s only available early in the night. Or we wake in the very early hours of the morning, our mind begins to spin out of control, and we give up and get out of bed, robbing ourselves of the very precious sleep that happens only at the very end of the night.

Here’s one of the simplest tips in this book: put down your devices and stay in bed longer. Don’t worry about whether you’re actually sleeping or not while you’re in bed (fretting about that just amplifies your sympathetic nervous system which, you guessed it, contributes to insomnia). Just know that if you have seven or eight (or more) hours in bed, you’re spending time wisely. In fact, if you’re not sleeping and your mind is just gently wandering, you can still be in both your sleeping genius and be activating some other complexity genius. So many of the other practices in this book can happen as you drift: noticing your body and breath, arriving in bed, and all of the practices of cultivating particular emotions that we’ll get to in future chapters.

When you feel sleepy at night, put away your phone and your book and your work, and slip under the covers. When you wake before your alarm, let yourself lie in bed and doze. Offer your body the opportunity it needs to sleep, and remember that your complexity genius is about resting as much as it’s about acting.

As you know, one of the key complexity rules is to start where you are now, to notice what’s going on now, and then to take action from there. Starting to shift a system by shifting your own state is pure genius. Now let’s expand that shifting to the whole system.

**CREATE THE CONDITIONS FOR THINGS TO CHANGE**

_The Genius of Experimenting_

Alison pulled out the chair next to her as Henry came in, his hands filled with two cups of coffee. “So, this seems to be a cool idea,” he said. The big screen of the coworking conference space was filled with silent squares of other folks in other coworking spaces all going about their day. This was the “Tuesday-viewsday” experiment someone had suggested. The idea was that people were missing the hustle and bustle of having others around, and it might be delightful to simply see action. So now on Tuesdays, people were encouraged to leave their cameras on, muted, as they worked. Just now there was a group in a coworking space in Denver having some intense conversation about something, and there was a pair working late in the day in Düsseldorf not speaking to one another at all. There were frames with people in their kitchens or living rooms. And Alison and Henry were visible to them too. Occasionally someone would look up and wave at the screen, but mostly they ignored each other. It was the sense of others working that seemed to help people feel connected.

“It is cool, isn’t it?” Alison tucked her feet under her on the chair. She liked that heading to the local coworking space meant that she could be around other folks and also wear her yoga pants to work. And she liked that Henry sometimes drove up to Edenville to work with her in the small coworking space in the town center. “But they don’t know that the second experiment will soon be added in.”

Henry barked out a laugh. “You know I think all this experimenting is wacky, right? I still don’t fully understand why we didn’t just roll out one of those plans our consultants designed—it would have been a more coherent approach, and they’ve done this before, so they know what works.”

“It’s the way they were thinking of solutions that bothered me, Henry. Those consultants have never faced a challenge quite like this, and their expertise and certainty in the face of this complexity made me nervous. Instead, handing the idea back to our people for them to come up with the experiments might be a little less coherent, but I’m guessing it’ll be a lot more effective. I know it sounds odd, but there’s some kind of genius that comes out when people are experimenting and talking about what they learned. When we tried that a few years ago, everyone began to dream and try things together. And we didn’t just learn about the solution to that problem, we learned about ourselves and about one another.”

Henry nodded. “I understand the intelligence of your perspective more as time goes on. And indeed, the early returns about this ‘weaving connection’ initiative are excellent. The budget is half of what the pilots would have been, and you’ve got more than 1,400 different people who are thinking about how to create the new culture together. Oh—and I guess this is the beginning of the next experiment.” His voice trailed off as the group in Denver was interrupted by a knock on the door as a food delivery person brought some unexpected, quirky snacks. The pair in Düsseldorf looked up, startled, as snacks were brought into their room too. Others from other offices started to stare up at the screen as people paused in their work and began to investigate the surprise deliveries. Soon people followed the simple instructions with their goodies, like “Call London,” and pairs of offices connected via audio and held up small wheels of cheese or packages of olives to show what they’d received. The team that had suggested and coordinated this little surprise snack and connection break showed up in what had been an empty Zoom box in Dublin, beaming and chattering with each other and pointing at the screens. It had been a lot of work to put this experiment together, but they seemed to be delighting in the fruits of their labor.

“The thing that has been most surprising for me,” Henry said as he waited for their own delivery, “is that even when the experiments don’t go well, it doesn’t seem to cost us any goodwill. In fact, it’s weirdly the opposite. With the whole company involved in creating and carrying out experiments that are specifically about creating connection, people seem to get more connected whether the experiments themselves connect them or not. That’s the strangest thing.”

“I agree with you,” Alison said. “It’s the same thing we’re learning in the diversity and inclusion space, I guess. It’s the spirit of trying and learning and moving forward—stumbling together in this new direction—that makes all the difference. We remove the sense that others are doing this to us, we remove the sense of perfection, we allow diverse voices to have power and influence in the system, and somehow people feel connected to one another in our humanity. That’s pretty cool.”

There was a knock on the door, and they found their own delivery waiting for them. The note, “Call Dublin,” was attached to the box of Irish shortbread cookies. The other three who were in Edenville today joined them in their conference room, and Alison connected to the Dublin office as they passed around the box. Aidan in the Dublin office, the genius behind this particular experiment, was eating shortbread cookies too. “Looks like people are having a lovely cup of tea together,” he said from the other side of the world. And indeed, the smiles on the faces in the squares were evidence enough of this delight. “I reckon we only need to do this every four to seven weeks—at odd intervals—to make Tuesday-viewsday really popular!” he continued. “People will never know which week we’ll have the surprise connection break, and so they’ll tune in every Tuesday for sure. And we’ll iron out whatever it was that made it not work so well for Austin,” he said as they all looked at the box inhabited by a grumpy trio in Texas who had neither snack delivery nor partner to call. “In fact, I think I’ll call them now.” Aidan left the screen and Kyra came into view in his place. “To experimenting with snack packs!” she said, raising her mug of tea. “To experimenting with snack packs,” everyone on both sides of the Atlantic said, laughing.

“To connecting in 1,400 different ways,” Alison added, raising her coffee.

“To connecting in 1,400 different ways,” the group said back, and Alison was pleased to hear Henry’s voice ringing out enthusiastically with the others.

CREATE THE CONDITIONS FOR NEW SOLUTIONS TO EMERGE

One of the most beautiful and difficult things about complexity is that you can’t make things happen. This is terrible—you can’t guarantee anything! But this is also delightful—you can invent brand new ideas that are so much better than anything that has ever come before! Each of the steps we have talked about so far is a piece of what we think of as creating the conditions for new solutions to emerge. This is a new way to think about what you are doing as you are leading in complexity.

This focus on “creating conditions” rather than on outcomes often begins with a sense of defeat, even, for some people, a sense of despair. As children, we believe our parents can make anything happen; as young professionals, we believe the CEO is the most powerful person in the world. If we become parents, we discover that we have never been more human, more lost. If we become a CEO, we discover we have never felt so powerless; all the direct controls are in the hands of others in the organization. This discovery can be heart-wrenching, and it can be terrifying. Every move of the teenager seems impervious to parental hopes and wishes; every change in the employee engagement scores seems disconnected from anything the leaders do or say (but oddly connected to quality of the cinnamon buns in the new coffee shop that opened up next to the main office). How could we care so much, work so hard, and still feel like we have so little control?

Perhaps it’s because we tend to focus on the wrong thing as we are moving through complexity. Our eye is on the result we wish for most. You might wish that your twelve-year-old brings her friends over to your house rather than spending time who-knows-where with her friends. You might be counting the number of new apps that were generated by your product team. Instead, as we operate in complexity, we have to focus on those things we can shape. In this case, you might imagine the conditions you can create for your daughter to spend more time at home with her friends, clearing out the basement to make a teenage girl’s paradise, draped in fairy lights and with a good set of Bluetooth speakers. Or you can imagine creating the conditions for the product team to talk to real humans who use the apps, setting up a temporary work station in a mall kiosk for a couple of weeks so that people stop by and test and talk, sparking curiosity and new ideas (and perhaps making people long for the quiet simplicity of their home offices).

Jennifer learned about the power of creating conditions when she was in college and working a holiday job making gift baskets for a gourmet store. Gift baskets were the cash cow of the store, and at holiday time the demand was almost impossible to meet. The “basketers” were crammed around tall tables in a basement room, boxes of butter cookies and tins of foie gras at the far edges of the light cast by bare lightbulbs. It was either too hot or too cold in this basement lair, and it would have been easy to begin to hate this job with the passion of a prisoner. But her boss, Terry, knew about creating conditions. Even though the room was ugly and the conditions grim, the spirit of the basketers was the best in the shop. Terry encouraged absurd competitions that made everyone laugh: Who can make the basket with the most pink things? Who can make a basket where every element has wine as an ingredient? He had experts from the wine or cheese departments come and teach cool facts about wine or cheesemaking. He kept bowls of gourmet chocolate to hand out at all hours. And when the basketers were exhausted, he would unveil a tray of canapés from the catering department.

Sure, organizations like Google are famous for their volleyball courts and napping chairs; it’s clear that people are thinking of “creating conditions” in clever ways. But what Terry taught Jennifer is that conditions can be created to encourage spirit—and with very few extra resources. The competitions encouraged creativity and thought; people got to know the products and their ingredients and began to think hard about the way the tastes and colors combined. They also made tired basketers laugh and connect with each other and experience tiny victories. More than anything, though, Terry created a sense of wonder, of curiosity, of play at a job that could have been mindless drudgery. Terry created the conditions for the basketers to use their creativity to connect to the idea that they were touching people’s lives and making their holidays brighter.

The next year, there was a different manager in charge of gift baskets, and this one was more worried about the end result. The only thing that counted was the number of baskets each person produced; a chalkboard broadcasted daily totals. This somehow turned the job into a mindless misery, the dark basement room depressing and exhausting. And ironically, the number of baskets they produced plummeted. The creativity and thoughtfulness for which they had been known simply melted away, like a soft cheese on a hot afternoon. Nothing much had changed except the conditions the manager created, which, as it turned out, changed everything.

COMPLEXITY: LEARNING THROUGH ACTION

But how do we know what action to take? Our regular habits were probably imported from the complicated world where we could figure out the best outcome and build a plan to get there. In that world we could use our past experience to figure out the various steps to arrive at our desired end.

In the complex world, that kind of step-by-step approach won’t work. There are too many pieces interacting with one another for us to know what will happen when we take one step and then the next. So instead of a plan, we need to move into action in a thoughtful, experimental way.

Remember the observation: right now, what is happening is happening. No matter how much you don’t like it, the particular context you’re watching is acting brilliantly to achieve what is currently happening. There’s that quote attributed to many but useful for us all: “Every system is perfectly designed to get the results it’s getting.” When you want some outcome to change, what you’re really wanting is for the system to change enough so that some different outcome arises.

OK, so this idea is a little mind-bendy for us, and if you’re paying attention, it might be mind-bendy for you. Because we tend to think of ourselves as people who make things happen, what we tend to want to do is make our desired change happen. We want to push, work, cajole it into being. But in complexity, that’s not the way. What we are saying here is that the interactions in the system itself are creating these outcomes, and so the way to experiment is to try and shift the interactions.

Take the earlier example of our quest for more racial diversity at Cultivating Leadership. Our system was perfectly designed to throw us into contact with folks who were like us. The more we searched, the more people like us we found. We were turning up the tap, but not changing the way the tap worked. So, once we noticed, we needed to try different things.

But the “trying” we were doing wasn’t right at the center of the problem. We decided not to “solve” this complex problem (because complex problems can’t really be solved) but to explore it. To that end, we started to pay more attention to the way we met people—our watering holes. We had the idea that if we changed our watering holes, we would change the system and perhaps a more diverse set of colleagues would arise. We know one central way we meet people who eventually join Cultivating Leadership is in our workshops for coaches—what we call our Growth Edge Coaching (GEC) workshops that we hold in the learning space we call The Meadow. We guessed that if we could change the composition of those workshops, we would learn something new about the way Cultivating Leadership was composed.

So we experimented: we offered a free place in our GEC workshops to any person of color or anyone from any group that is underrepresented in coaching circles. You could just walk up (or, er, click up) and get a free seat. We asked everyone in our network to get this offer out into the world—using whatever links they had with coaches who didn’t look like us. And then we learned like crazy.

This is a strange kind of action, though. There was a way that the action of giving free seats in GEC workshops seemed to have basically nothing to do with the outcome having more diverse colleagues in Cultivating Leadership. And indeed, it took us a long time to even have this idea because the connections were not obvious. But we tried it, and we learned, and we changed. It turned out that offering these free seats did expose us to a whole new collection of fantastic coaches of color from around the globe. But this is the complex world, and so things often don’t turn out the way we expect. We haven’t (yet) found new Cultivating Leadership colleagues directly through this initiative. But the word about this initiative got around, and somehow more people from all kinds of underrepresented groups came into our orbit in a whole variety of ways as they heard about our commitment to diversity. Now some of those are new Cultivating Leadership colleagues (we’re still not diverse enough, but we’re now headed in the right direction at last!). While the experiment didn’t work in the way we expected, it did change our system. So allow the unexpected to arise. We’re prepping more for jazz than for a perfectly executed sonata. For great jazz, we have to ignite our complexity genius and get ready to experiment at the edge.

THE GENIUS OF EXPERIMENTING

At first, though, we have to combat the fact that experimenting is generally not what we want to do when we are faced with a really tricky complex issue. When the stakes are high, we can lose our experimenting genius as our nervous system signals our need for narrowing and winning. To find it, what we want to do is have a direction we’re going in, but not an outcome in mind. This can be tricky to get your head around. If you’re attached to what it will look like when it’s “solved,” you’re probably looking for an outcome; if you’re excited about what you’ll learn along the way, you’re probably headed toward experimenting. To help us lean a little harder into experimentation, let’s explore some ancient ideas that have helped humans calm their nervous system and open their minds for centuries. Let’s experiment with ways to amplify our experimenting genius.

_GEM: Release Your Attachment to Outcomes_

To awaken this genius, the first thing we need to do is see if we can release some of our attachment to the solving, fixing, finishing urge that courses through our bodies and brains. The idea of nonattachment has been foundational in many traditions throughout human experience. The idea is to look at what you’re attached to (often a hope for the way things should be) and to try and loosen your grip a little. Nonattachment helps people decrease the suffering and frustration (and wrong action) that often arises when we face into a complex and unpredictable world. Leaning into nonattachment helps us activate our experimenting genius because we are led by our curiosity, not our grasping for an outcome. Part of our delight needs to be that we don’t know how it’s going to turn out. We should be desperately curious to find out what happens when we try it.

This isn’t to say you can’t be excited about making things better. You want your team to be more trusting, your priorities to be better shared, your strategy to take you forward into a better place. You want your children to care about school, and your partner to help share the housework. You might be attached to all of those things. But the way we’ll get to our experimenting genius—so vital as we are leading in complexity—is by nudging rather than knowing, by learning rather than proving. This idea of nonattachment to outcomes will awaken our complexity genius.

Try this practice: Imagine your experiment and then imagine all the good things that would happen if it “goes right.” Imagine, for example, that you want your team to better prioritize what’s most important—at the team level and not at their individual level. You come up with an experiment that is about everyone having a retreat to prioritize together, all buying into it, and changing the way they work. You see a future world where each of them puts down their individual interests to help one another, and the work of the team soars. All of this imagining is fueling your attachment. Let’s flip it on its head.

Now imagine the good things that will happen if it “goes wrong.” Minimally, you should have “learning” on the list. But you can be more specific than that. If this experiment goes wrong, you should be learning about the shape of the issue you’re trying to improve, as well as the humans who are working on that issue. In this case, if it goes wrong maybe you’ll learn about some of the other forces (the way individual goals are set and rewarded, for example) that seem to win out over this intervention. Or you’ll learn that your team doesn’t really disagree openly and well enough to work through their inevitable differences. Or something else. A clear focus on what you learn no matter whether things go right or wrong helps you get curious without too much attachment—that’s the experimenting genius.

_GEM: Lean into Humility_

Ancient philosophers taught us that humility—rather than hubris—is key for finding our way through the choppy waters of our lives. As we are experimenting, this humility can remind us to scale back our bold ideas about the one change that will fix it all. Our quest is for a small nudge, one that doesn’t try to solve everything, one that doesn’t need to be sold to everyone. And this isn’t because experimenting is about dreaming small. It’s just about dreaming a lot! If you need to get a lot of people to approve or requisition a big budget, or it’s going to take a few years to see whether this move paid off, you’re likely to dream less and strategize more about how to make things work.

So here the practice is to think of the smallest moves that might shift the conditions that are creating this particular version of reality. It means remembering that you don’t know the answer, that no one does, and so nudging and learning is all we can offer. It means that you have to get away from that part of your ego that says that you want to make a big splash, to show everyone your brilliance, to be the hero of the story. Leaning into humility means you don’t do this on your own. You are creating the conditions for everyone involved to be part of the solution. Engaging your experimenting genius requires that you have the humility to step out of the center stage heroic role and see whether you can enable a lot more heroes around you.

Let’s say you want your children to care about school. You might be a hero and make a big splash by mortgaging your house and borrowing against your retirement to send them to the fancy private school in the next town. In your dream, they feel eternally grateful and credit your sacrifice for making their lives happier, their futures more successful. That’s a legitimate choice to make, but a thing you can only do once, and it had better work. It’s not experimenting—and if it doesn’t work, not only do you have a big mortgage, but you have the conditions for a lot of resentment all around.

If you pursue this direction with humility, you’d take lots of small steps and learn from them. To move toward the direction of getting your kids to care about school, you nudge in one direction—perhaps showing your own interest more deeply. You sit down with them for two weeks as they’re doing their homework and ask them questions about it. You read the books they’re reading for the next big exam. And you nudge in the other direction too (because you’re curious, right?) and test whether showing _less_ interest might paradoxically get them interested in their own schooling. For three weeks, you don’t even say the word school if you can help it. You let them decide when and where (and, gulp, if) to do their homework. And you learn. And maybe, through these humble nudges, you get kids who find their own love of school. They’re the heroes at the center of the stage. You just helped them find their way. Your humility created the conditions for their greatness.

_GEM: Don’t Shy Away from Endings_

The final ancient element to unleashing your experimenting genius is a sense of temporariness, of mortality. The best complexity leaders are the ones who know that nothing they do will sustain forever. Their leadership is temporary. Their organizations—no matter how venerable or long-lived—are ultimately temporary. Everything is mortal. They understand that this idea or the next one, this problem or the next one, are like the flowers of a cherry blossom tree, like the gales that blow in from the sea. Life looks like this now: beautiful ideas, fierce problems. And then the day shifts and something else happens.

Oddly, this knowledge that it’s all seasonal, that no matter how good it gets, it’s never going to last, is not necessarily depressing and awful. When we reframe this lack of permanence as a key part of our humanity, it keeps us learning and awake and in our experimenting genius. You see this idea in many of our most ancient texts, that our own mortality is a kind of a blessing to remind us to live and learn and love in this moment. It also opens up a path of experimentation only rarely considered: the experiment of stopping something.

One practice is to put a potential end date on each experiment you try. As you craft some ideas about what to try, don’t imagine trying them forever or with everyone. Remembering that all of us and all of our changes are temporary might help you remember that the responsibility you took on to chair that board is temporary too, that the board itself might be temporary. Of course, if the experiment is going well, you don’t have to end it, but the prospect of it ending might make you a little more brave.

The second core practice is to pare back, to strip out, to end. In study after study, researchers find when they ask people to “improve” something, the improvement is nearly always an addition. If we’re not thoughtful about awakening our experimenting genius, we are likely to keep adding and adding more activities or projects or policies into schedules and minds so packed that the only outcome left is exhaustion. Ending something rather than always piling on new things is a key piece of experimenting genius.

Complexity is defined by change and uncertainty and interdependence. Anxiety is often created by change and uncertainty and interdependence. But learning and delight are also about change and uncertainty and interdependence. The experimenting genius means working with our nervous system so that we are not tossed into the miseries and grasping of our anxiety but are instead lifted by the delights of our humanity.

**EMOTIONS ARE THE NEW FACTS**

_The Genius of Laughing and Wondering_

“So, this is, um, unexpected,” Pete said, looking at the picnic Supriya had laid out in the storeroom of his flagship hardware store. There was a picnic blanket draped over the breakroom table, freshly squeezed lemonade in a pitcher, rotisserie chicken in a basket, something bright green in a Tupperware container, and bamboo plates, cups, and spoons.

Supriya’s face fell. “It’s too much? Too weird? When you said you didn’t have time to meet for lunch this week, I thought maybe I could just bring lunch to you.”

“It’s just that I didn’t know you were coming, and I was surprised and all…” his voice trailed off.

“That’s because it was supposed to be a surprise. I was hoping you’d like it.” Supriya’s voice was small and a little chilly now.

Pete knew that his discomfort was throwing everything off. He was falling in love with this woman and she had made a kind gesture, and the only thing he could think about was what the guys up front would say if they walked in. He took a deep breath and arrived in this room instead of being in that last call with his accountant. He looked at the rotisserie chicken and thought with gratitude what a miracle it was that his vegetarian girlfriend (Was she his girlfriend? Was he too old to even have a girlfriend?) had brought it over. He took in the unusual mix of cultures the table represented and the unusual spot in his life in the storeroom of his father’s first hardware store. And he laughed.

Supriya looked shocked for a minute, and then she began to giggle. Andre, who was working the back half of the store, heard the laughing and popped his head in and started to laugh too, although if you had asked him, he wouldn’t have been able to say why. Two customers, deciding between different bathroom tile shapes, stood in the doorway, holding their tile and smiling broadly.

“Is that mashed potatoes and saag paneer?” Pete asked as he laughed. “And are those biscuits next to the naan?”

Supriya was laughing in earnest now. “I also have dal and rice. And sweet potato pie for dessert. This is you and me, right?”

Soon they had sent Andre and the customers off with chicken and dal wrapped in naan bundles, and Supriya and Pete were at the table, their plates piled high with the various food Supriya had packed.

“What happened there?” she asked him.

“What do you mean?” Pete wondered while he dipped his chicken into the saag paneer and scooped it onto a biscuit.

“When you first came in, this was clearly not the surprise you were expecting—or wanting. You looked horrified, to be honest. I thought I had really screwed things up. And then suddenly you were laughing, and everyone was happy, and it seemed like the best surprise in the world. What changed?”

Pete wiped his mouth. “Actually, this was all about you,” he said thoughtfully. “You have been talking about the way our emotions are really a choice we are making, and you’ve been showing me ways to make it feel like a choice. In that moment, I was being a good student, choosing the emotions I wanted rather than being swamped by the anger that was probably a holdover from my call with the accountant.”

Supriya brushed the biscuit crumbs off her jeans, self-consciously. “Sounds like I’m talking about work a little too much.”

“No way! As you talk about your work—both the work you do with your clients and also the way you’re working on yourself—it helps me so much! I wish my talking about my work would help you. But I guess you’re not working on remodeling your kitchen or anything.”

“I’m not sure which is funnier,” Supriya said, reaching for another biscuit, “the idea that I might remodel the kitchen or that you could help me do it! I have never seen a less handy hardware store owner!”

Pete popped the last biscuit into his mouth. “OK OK, it’s true. I’m not much on DIY myself. But this weekend you can come over, and I’ll show you what a really decent biscuit tastes like. You bring the dal.”

IN A COMPLEX HUMAN SYSTEM, EMOTIONS ARE AS VITAL AS FACTS

We have heard leaders rage with frustration when they hear the irrational, emotion-filled complaints of others.

“The process was entirely fair!”

“We aren’t making job cuts, so there is no reason to be afraid!”

“Why can’t people get the facts of the situation instead of rushing to conclusions?!”

Basically, the idea that people often have is this: the facts of the matter are real, the emotions and rumors are false, and if we could just get over the fake stuff and get to the real stuff, things would be better. We understand this frustration and have deep sympathy for it: “fake news” can do unimaginable harm. Yet we know that in complex human systems, it’s not just the facts that matter; emotions, rumors, stories—all of these are core elements of human communities.

When any of us suggest that facts are material and emotions and stories are (or should be) immaterial, we miss out on what it means to be human. We miss that for us as a species, there are multidirectional connections between the facts, the emotions, and the stories. We waste our time and effort railing against emotional responses to things and longing for a wholly rational workforce, partner, child—or self. We also miss valuable information about how to shape the system. If we treat emotions as key pieces of data, we learn about how things are currently going. Without taking emotional data into account, we might have a picture that is both incomplete and unhelpful.

And without understanding the way that our emotions create our mindsets, our stories, and even the facts we see, we miss one of our most important ways to intervene in a system: by shaping our emotions, mindsets, and stories.

WE CONSTRUCT OUR EMOTIONS—AND WE CAN CONSTRUCT NEW ONES

Twenty-five years ago, Jennifer was reading Robert Kegan’s life-changing book _In Over Our Heads_ on a blustery Cape Cod beach when she stumbled across the idea that earlier in our lives, we simply have our emotions. But as we mature, we learn that emotions don’t simply arise in us, they are actually _constructed_ by us. Furthermore, as people understand the way they are constructing their emotions, they can begin to construct them differently. She still remembers her jaw dropping in disbelief. Surely this Harvard guy wasn’t suggesting that emotions—which occurred and moved through her like a common cold, coming unbidden and passing away in their own time—were actually made up by us? And that we could change them?

This idea was so puzzling and so captivating, Jennifer eventually ended up studying with Bob and writing her doctoral dissertation on this developmental theory. And now, twenty-five years later, it is still one of the most captivating ideas she’s ever heard.[^1]

Lisa Feldman Barrett takes some of these theories and puts neuroscience around them. Her work shows that emotions arrive in the body as sensations. Our brain very quickly checks out our context and converts the sensations into meaning without our even noticing. We call that meaning “emotion.” So we don’t feel “sad”—we feel sensations, our brain checks out our context, and then we call that set of context plus sensations “sad.” This is a radical idea to get your head around, so just hold it as a theory for a moment.

Sensations + context = the meaning we call emotion

The theory goes like this. Our body feels sensations on two basic dimensions: valence (how pleasant or unpleasant is it?) and arousal (how strong is it?). And then there’s a story about the context and the ways you have experienced that context in the past that give you the information to name an emotion. So if you adore roller coasters, as you strap into the Twisty Tornado, you might feel a sensation of your heart beating faster, your hands beginning to sweat, your stomach fluttering with butterflies, and you might experience this as very strongly aroused—this is a big feeling! And you might experience the valence as distinctly pleasant—this is a _delightful_ feeling! When you notice the emotion, you create the emotion by naming it: thrill, excitement, even joy.

If you are terrified of speaking in front of crowds, though, and it’s your turn to give a speech at a your sister’s wedding, as you step toward the microphone and hear the clinking of glasses that signals the crowd to be quiet, you might begin to notice a bunch of sensations: your heart beating faster, your hands beginning to sweat, your stomach fluttering with butterflies. You remember the last time you had this experience in a context like this, and you notice you are strongly aroused—this is a big feeling! And you hate it, you hate public speaking, you’re terrible at it—this is an awful way to feel. When you notice the emotion, you create a different emotion: fear, terror, panic.

And, you might be basically the same person, perhaps even on the same day, experiencing basically the same bodily sensations in these two different contexts.

So what is to be done? Our complexity genius is to replace one set of emotion-stories that might be unhelpful in complexity with another set of emotion-stories that are more helpful. This can intentionally shift not only our emotional state but also our nervous system—and, when practiced in company, the nervous systems of others. And in the meantime, you can be tracking the sensations you’re feeling and the emotion-stories you construct about those sensations. Let’s begin with a laugh.

THE GENIUS OF LAUGHING

Think of the last time you laughed hard. The snorting, crying, stomach-hurting kind of laughter. Can you remember it? Who were you with? And now can you remember what it felt like afterward? If a time like this springs to mind, it often lives in your memory in vivid, delightful color. If a time like this doesn’t spring to mind, it might be time to consider why you aren’t laughing so much.[^2] Laughter is a miraculous nervous system reset.

Laughing also turns out to be a complexity genius. Not only does it awaken your parasympathetic, complexity-friendly nervous system, but it lubricates basically everything you want for thinking and acting in complexity. It works on the individual nervous system level, and we’ve talked enough about that for you to know that’s a good thing. Laughing also seems to loosen our capacity for creativity and innovation. In study after study, doing something that makes you laugh—even a brief dad-joke kind of laugh—opens you up to new ideas, helps you be more resilient as you solve problems, and creates the context for novelty. These are necessary in complexity, where yesterday’s solutions (which are the easiest to come up with because, well, we’ve come up with them already) can block our way of thinking of tomorrow’s solutions.

And, like many of these geniuses, laughing also creates a context for teams, families, and communities to thrive. Laughing releases the hormone oxytocin, which is basically the hormone most responsible for bonding and a sense of safety together. (The other two main activities to release bursts of oxytocin are childbirth and sex, neither of which is optimal in a meeting.[^3]) Research shows that if people laugh together, they are likely to be more vulnerable together, to risk failure, to admit to mistakes. All of this is pivotal for creating thriving teams in complex times. Remember that complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity create the conditions for us to feel unsafe and to activate our sympathetic nervous system. Laughing together creates the conditions for us to feel safe together—all of us inhabiting our parasympathetic systems together.

You might be shrugging at all this, picturing the hundreds of ways your work (or your family) is simply not funny. The thing is, most of what we believe we know about laughter isn’t true. Our prime assumption tends to be that laughter happens when something is amusing. That is not what researchers find. They find that laughter is almost not at all about what is funny. You know this yourself from watching a movie with one set of friends and thinking it is hilarious and then watching it again with your partner or your kids and thinking it is mortifying (our sensations plus context give us the emotion). Researchers have found that laughter is primarily a social bonding experience: we do it to signal that we are comfortable, that we like someone. Researcher Sophie Scott tells us, “Most of the laughter that we produce is purely social in its origins.” She goes on to say: “If somebody makes us laugh, we will say, ‘Oh, they’re hilarious. They’ve got a great sense of humor. They make us laugh.’ What [we] mean is, ‘I really like them. I really like them, and I laugh when I’m around them so that they will know that I like them, and maybe they’ll like me, too.’”[^4]

OK, wait, what?

If you’re like us, this idea that emotions are constructed and that laughter itself is often about social bonding might turn some things on their head for you. Our impulse is to think, “There’s no laughing around here—I wish I had funnier coworkers/family members/friends.” But actually, what we should be thinking is, “The context for laughing here isn’t very good. I wonder what I could do to shape the context so that there would be more laughter?” This is one of the most complexity-friendly ways to shape your environment: look for something we want more of and begin to create the conditions for it to arise. In other words, let’s not have the complexity genius of laughing simply arrive. Let’s go fetch it.

_GEM: Practice Irony_

We can turn laughing into a practice by seeing whether we can intentionally reframe things in our lives that might otherwise show up for us as not funny at all. We bet you do this regularly now—you already have a genius in this regard. You know, like when you are feeling loose and cheerful over a long easy brunch with friends, and you accidentally pour salt into your coffee instead of sugar, and you drink a big gulp and then you spit it out and you laugh so hard that coffee nearly comes out your nose? It’s not that spooning salt into your coffee is funny—it’s just that in that moment, it’s hilarious.

Another moment, that same experience—you slept terribly, you have a difficult task ahead of you, and you’re racing out the door with your coffee and take a big gulp only to realize you put salt in it instead of sugar. You might feel enraged or burst into tears. That day, it’s the farthest thing from funny.

It’s not the thing, it’s what we make of the thing.

So what if we made it funny? Not in that exact moment. That’s too hard. But afterward.

We have seen our clients take on a practice, at the end of the day or with a friend at the end of each week, where they tried to find an element that was amusing or ironic about something that had caused some other, less pleasant emotion.

Benjamin struggled mightily with a particular quarterly sales review meeting with his boss, his boss’s boss, and a bunch of peers. Even when his numbers were good, he felt on the spot and anxious, and if his numbers weren’t good, it was a nightmare. His anxiety before this meeting grew and grew, like so many of the reinforcing feedback loops in our bodies and minds. He would feel more anxious, prepare more diligently by staying at his computer and going over the numbers one more time. His sleep would degrade, his performance would be worse, and the negative feedback would make him more anxious for next time. It was a mess.

To respond to that mess, he developed what he called an “irony practice” with one of his teammates who was also in the meeting. On the Friday afternoon, they’d meet up in a park or over video and go over the parts of the meeting that most wound them up.

“Ooph, when I started screen sharing and my computer froze, and it turned out I was showing my internet browser with all the tabs open to knitwear for the dog,” Benjamin would begin.

“When I thought the name of the new initiative was a joke and I burst out laughing!” his friend Silke would continue, laughing now.

“When there was that long anxious silence about the new targets and my stomach growled so loudly you could hear it through the microphone!” Benjamin said, laughing and cringing at the same time.

Before long, the two friends are snorting with laughter. And next time as they dial in, they feel a little closer to one another and a little lighter about the meeting, just knowing that this will feel funny by Friday.

_GEM: Treat Your Laughter as a Gift_

A second practice that has most powerfully changed our lives is this one: treat your own laughter as a kindness that you offer to someone else. Generally, people don’t think about it this way. Because we tend to think that laughing is a thing that arises out of our control, we cannot make it an offering or use it in any way. But knowing that laughing is a complexity genius can change this.

When we think, “I laugh when things are funny,” we are missing a million contextual pieces about the production of laughter. When we think, “Laughing will help make this meeting better” or “Laughing will help make this dinner less awkward,” we shift our relationship to it and then change the way we show up. This is not about fake laughing (although even that is better than nothing[^5]) but about making yourself more available for laughing, which creates a beautiful reinforcing feedback loop. Laughter is not only social, but contagious; when you laugh, others will begin to find more things funny as well. And when they start laughing, you’ll find things easier and more connected. Laughter is lubrication for the sticky social world.

Carolyn is famous for this. People talk about many things when they talk about Carolyn, but one of the things that always comes up is her ready laugh. She easily offers others the gift of her own laughing, and in so doing, the spaces around Carolyn become safer and more fun. People have a better time. And because they feel both funnier and more connected, people like themselves better in her company.

So the practice: see if you can loosen your ability to laugh with others. Remember that when others are attempting to be funny, your laughing is a kindness. Offer your laughing genius as a gift to them all.

_GEM: Beware of Power Lines_

Here’s a laughter practice that isn’t particularly funny—but it is seriously important. One of the common forms of laughing is in a cynical or mocking way—laughing at the misfortunes or quirks of others. We do this when we laugh at the proverbial person slipping on a banana peel or laugh at the story of a hapless colleague who spilled red wine on his new client over dinner. This is an edgy laughter on the boundary between laughing and disdain or unkindness. And that boundary is drawn—constructed—by each of the individuals involved. This is particularly true when there is some power difference between people. One friend laughing with another friend about the way he packed only dirty laundry for his business trip can say, “Oh! What a stupid thing to do!” and have it be funny. But it is a whole different thing if his boss laughs about this same thing and also says, “Oh! What a stupid thing to do!” Even if the boss means it with exactly the same kindness and softness as the friend, it’s not the boss who draws the boundary between kind laughing and caustic laughing: it’s the dirty laundry packer. So a rule of thumb: we can laugh at ourselves and we can laugh with others, but we cannot laugh at the quirks or mistakes of people with less power than us. The more status you have in a context, the safer you are to laugh at yourself and not at others.[^6]

But laughter is not the only gift we can bring into a tense situation. Sometimes it’s not even the best one. Sometimes we can choose another move that awakens a different emotion. We can activate another complexity genius in order to see new possibilities in a tough time.

Pete slammed the ledger shut and a cloud of dust filled the air. Terrance jumped a little at the ferocity of it.

“I don’t know how Dad kept this place open for so long,” Pete growled. “But I just can’t do it anymore.”

Terrance clicked through to another tab on the spreadsheet in front of him. “Pete, I know it’s been a bad year, but these are crazy times, right? And even in the bad year, it’s not utterly hopeless. We’re not losing money, exactly, even though we’re not turning much profit.”

“What this ledger tells me, Terrance, is that this weird year isn’t so weird. Our receipts have been falling steadily here since Home Depot opened twelve years ago. In my father’s careful handwriting, I see a story of continual decline that was just the precursor to the cliff we fell off of during COVID. He probably should have closed this store a decade ago. I’d be crazy to keep it running for another six weeks!”

A young man poked his head through the office door. “Hey Terrance, it’s Mrs. Jones. She needs some electrical supplies, but her card keeps getting declined. She’s insisting on seeing you.”

Terrance sighed heavily. “Ooph. That woman has had the worst run of any of us. Lost her father, her brother, her son, and her business all inside six weeks last year. Let me go see what I can do for her.” He closed the door lightly behind him and then opened it again. “Pete, I know you’re stressed out. But if closing this store was the right thing to do ten years ago, your dad would have done it. The fact that he didn’t do it must mean something, right? Aren’t you even a little curious about why that is?”

Pete bristled at the closed door. He could feel the heat rising into his face and noticed his hands had balled up into fists. What a totally stupid question Terrance had raised. His father had kept this store open because it was his first store and he was sentimental. Even as the neighborhood changed around them, even as their customers abandoned them for the big box stores in the next town, even as the receipts fell and fell and fell, his father had ignored the signs. It was an unusual blind spot for his dad who was, in all other respects a careful and thoughtful businessman who had built this small chain of hardware stores into thriving spaces. But on this issue, he was wrong.

Pete grabbed a few recycling bins from the storeroom shelves and began to load them with the accumulated detritus of years of work. He had been unable to face into this fact either, unable to throw out his father’s pencil stubs and ledger books, but he could begin now. Opening drawer after drawer, he pulled out old notebooks, packs of receipts, neat stacks of notes reminding someone to order more paint rollers or a particular sort of plunger. He came across sketches for a new display approach, for a small café stuck between the tiling section and the garden shop. And, as much as it hurt him, he tossed it all in the recycling bin at his feet.

How dare Terrance suggest that Pete wasn’t thinking things through clearly? Pete admitted that he was not his best self today. He had been up too late waiting for his daughter to come home from a party, and he had not slept well while thinking about the conversation he would need to have with Terrance today. Terrance had been working here for nearly twenty years and had been a store manager for ten. He was basically family to Pete and had stepped in to show him the business as Pete had been dizzy with grief and confusion over the loss of his dad and his former life. That’s why Terrance’s criticism stung so much.

Why had his father kept the store open, leaving one more problem for Pete to handle? He had such good judgment about so many things and didn’t seem to shy away from other tough business decisions. Why had he kept it open?

As the question played in Pete’s mind, he slowed down and took in some of the papers he was tossing in the bin. Who had made all these drawings of the café tucked into the shop? What was up with this stack of greeting cards in the back of a drawer? Pete flipped through them. Thank you notes from classroom field trips to the store, from folks who were remembering how the store had helped them when they had no money to pay, from those fresh out of prison who had found work in these aisles while they were remaking their lives. Each card was a story of how this place had made a difference in someone’s life. Each card was a rebuke of Pete’s conclusion.

As he closed the file with the cards in it, Pete’s eyes filled with tears as he noticed for the first time the label in his father’s careful penmanship: Alternative profit.

Terrance stepped back into the room. “Sorry about that. Your dad’s vision was always for this to be a place that gave back to the community as much as it profited from it. I know the profits are down, but the giving back hasn’t shifted that much.” He paused and shifted uncomfortably. “I get that you can’t keep this place open forever, Pete. And your dad didn’t live to see the set of experiments and possibilities he was always dreaming about here. I get why your decision is so clear to you.”

Pete blinked up at Terrance, taking in some of what he’d just said. “Turns out I’m the one that needs to apologize, my friend. I have about a million questions about what you just said, and I am utterly bewildered about what to do next. Can we think about it together?”

THE GENIUS OF WONDERING

When “wonder” is used as a noun, it means: “a feeling of amazement and admiration, caused by something beautiful, remarkable, or unfamiliar.” We have the experience of profound awe, the sense of the majesty around us. When “wonder” is used as a verb, it means to “desire to know something, feel curious.”[^7] We’d like to use both of these senses as we explore the way we can open up our minds to the creativity and possibility of wondering.

First, just remember the feeling of being swept up in wonder. Maybe you look up at a very dark sky and feel dizzy with the stars arcing overhead. Maybe you sit in a concert hall and feel your body vibrating with the beauty of the music. Maybe you walk through the forest and come upon a tree that was towering before your great-grandparents were born. Wonder in this case has a sense of majesty, a sense of how big the universe is, a sense of the story of the earth as told in a very nonhuman scale. And it’s a complexity genius, because it not only releases the cocktail of hormones we’ve been focused on here, but it also opens us up to a whole new set of possibilities, so that new solutions can arise. We bet you’ve had the experience of being caught up in some intractable work or family issue, spinning around, stuck without any new ideas. And then you stare at the ocean or notice the first yellow crocuses blooming in the late winter, and suddenly your challenge doesn’t seem so central to the functioning of the planet. As you loosen your grip on the challenge, new solutions begin to pop into your mind.

The problem is that we rarely find this sense of wonder in our everyday lives. It’s reserved for the times when we’ve got the time and space to look up, to look around. But we’re here to say that can change.

Before we get to our GEMs, let’s look around a little more, musing about the verb “to wonder,” to be curious. Curiosity is a powerful antidote to the perils of certainty. Certainty is like a poison in complexity, because it robs you of your senses—you become blind to new evidence, deaf to the perspectives of others, narrow in your view and in your data. Curiosity is a salve we can apply over the poisonous certainty, and it works to open up that which was closed, to restore our ability to sense into the unknown, to think and feel alongside others.

The thing is, we are often not so practiced in letting ourselves feel our curiosity. From our earliest years, we get the message that answers are more valuable than questions. From the time we are three years old and our questions become annoying (“But _why_ is the sky blue, Daddy?”), we begin to search to quiet our questions and speak our answers. From a complexity standpoint, this couldn’t be a more unhelpful lesson.

And this only increases as our status grows. In most organizations, we get promoted for the answers we offer, the problems we solve, rather than the questions we ask. Carolyn’s first boss’s mantra was, “Don’t come to me with problems, come with solutions.” Coming with unanswered problems was seen as a weakness and could get you in trouble. And, cleverly, we often sort out this “weakness” as Carolyn did, by developing a very strong action urge to skip straight past the curiosity to the solution. And her experience seems so common as to be the rule rather than the exception. We have had this conversation with dozens of senior leaders. Like Raul, who was the most senior leader in the room once as we were teaching about the power of asking different questions. During a break, Raul came up to us and pulled us aside, down a corridor into another room. His agitation palpable, he closed the door behind him.

“I’m not sure you realize what you are saying to us,” he hissed in a whisper. “You’re suggesting that we actually ask questions when we ourselves don’t know the answer! Imagine what a risk this is to our reputation, individually and as a leadership team! How will our people and our customers have any faith in us?” Looking in his eyes, we could tell Raul was terrified of the whole prospect. And that is what happens to us as grown-ups. Curiosity is judged as being as dangerous to our reputation as leaders as it is fatal to cats.

This sense of danger comes from the part of our nervous system that is devoted to keeping us safe. This part understands that curiosity—learning in general—is a threat to the status quo. And it’s not wrong. When we are curious, the odds are high that we will find something that disrupts our previous ways of thinking or acting. If we are operating from our complexity-friendly nervous system, we think of that as delightful, innovative, creative. If we are operating from our threat-oriented nervous system, we think of it as dangerous.

But remember that we don’t just have to take whichever nervous system presents itself to us at the time. We can intentionally shape our biology by choosing our focus. When we find ourselves feeling closed or threatened, we can begin to wonder. And since wonder is about both curiosity and awe, let's practice both.

_GEM: Wondering Wander_

While this feeling of wonder or awe normally just arises for us during certain experiences, we can also go out and seek it. One of our favorite ways is to take a wondering wander. This is where you head outside if at all possible and look around with the specific intention to feel wonder. Maybe you live in a city, and you notice that there is shockingly green moss growing between the cracks in the sidewalk. Maybe you live in a suburb and notice that there is a carpet of tiny white flowers hiding under a tree in your neighbor’s lawn. Maybe you live in the countryside, and you’ve forgotten to marvel at the way the sunlight slants through the fields in the late afternoon. The truth is wonder is all around us, and we can fill up on it if we just go looking for it.

There’s a way that humans have been seeking to create the sense of wonder for other humans for centuries. We have built soaring, tall cathedrals, written music for symphonies, landed a salto layout with two full twists as we dismount from a balance beam. These are astounding indeed. But perhaps all of that grandeur makes us forget that the world is generating wonder on a moment-by-moment basis. It’s in the hospital when we go to visit a loved one hooked up to a machine that is keeping his lungs filled with air. It’s in the look a toddler gives her father as he pushes her in a swing at the playground. It’s in the purple of a violet pushing up through the grass. It’s in the rainbow of the oil slick on the street on a rainy day. It’s in the pixels that show us the goofy smile of a colleague in a Zoom call.

It’s also inside us as we marvel at ourselves and what makes us feel joy—and at what makes us miserable. Which leads us back from the wondering wander outside and into the wonder of our psyche.

_GEM: Which Parts of Me Are Most Hooked?_

One of the most curiosity-generating questions we know in this space is another form of noticing (of course, by wondering about something that’s going on inside). When we find ourselves stressed or reactive, we can step back from the situation and ask: What parts of me are most hooked?

Notice the focus here. We are not asking: _What about this situation is most triggering for me?_ That’s a good question, but it tends to lean outside, into the potential for blame, which can increase our anxiety and stress and make us less fit for complexity. By wondering about our own internal processing, we begin to have a different relationship to what’s going on both inside us and around us, and we are able to get a handle on the only thing we can directly control when complexity is raging: ourselves.

Jasmyne was immersed in finally figuring out the answer to a tricky question on legal precedent when her email pinged. Her boss wanted her to drop this question and move to one that had just arisen as a crisis. She felt her face grow hot as she began to rage at that request.

How dare her boss treat her as a wind-up toy who could be redirected with a few sentences? She had been working on this issue for two weeks now, and she had just been able to compile all the precedents from a variety of global cases to build a solid argument. Two more hours and she would be able to capture it all in writing and get it out to the colleagues who needed it. It was offensive and unprofessional for her boss to pull her back now.

She paused, noticed her chest tightening, and (because she had been practicing) recognized this sensation and this context as anger. She took a deep breath into her anger, noticed the action urge to either ignore her boss’s request until she finished what she was doing or to send off a snarky text to one of her friends about the annoying precedent her boss was setting. Instead, Jasmyne breathed into her tight chest, and she felt her feet on the floor which helped her regain some stability. Then she could intentionally shift her focus to wondering.

She got really curious about what parts of her were getting so hooked here. As she unbraided the tangle of anger, she realized that there was one part of her that was dedicated to finishing a task before moving on—she could almost hear her mother’s voice in her head, lambasting her for giving up before she completed a task. Then there was the part of her that hated to take orders. She had always been somewhat rebellious, and it had marked her experience as far back as she could remember. Finally, there was the part of her that wanted to be liked and admired for doing excellent work—that part knew that the colleagues who were waiting for this piece of work might be disappointed in her. Now that she had her cast of characters around her, she could face her boss’s email again with much less of a grab to her nervous system. Because she was less triggered, she could take in more of the details of the email as well as the tone. This was a big crisis he was pointing to. And he had copied all the people on her current project so that they could see she had been pulled off it for a time. Now that she saw it, that was really thoughtful of him to make the effort to remember what she was working on in the first place. Suddenly it felt less like an order that risked her status and more like a plea for help in an emergency. She nodded to the part of her that was still frustrated by moving on before completing, and she took up the new task with interest.[^8]

One of the things that’s most overwhelming about complex and fast-changing times is that we feel out of control. Our reflex is to double down on our action urge to avoid the emotions that are so uncomfortable that they activate our sympathetic nervous system. But one of the core geniuses of us as humans is our capacity to not only change the world outside us, but to intentionally change what’s going on inside us. Remembering that our emotions are constructed means we have the ability to reconstruct them—to create a new context or practice or conversation rather than simply assuming, as we tend to do, that emotions arise and fall outside our control. Play around with your context and see if you can get more laughing and wondering in your life. You will find yourself not only better able to deal with complexity, but you’ll also be constructing a life that is a little sweeter for you and those around you.

**CONNECTIONS MATTER MORE THAN COMPETENCE**

_The Genius of Loving_

“So what are you going to do about Simon?” Alison asked, her gloves caked in mud as they took a gardening date in the backyard.

Mark tugged on a stubborn weed, which broke off at the middle, and he swore under his breath. “I have no idea. I’m really stuck here. I know I have screwed up by making promises in two different directions to two different people: to my boss to cut 10 percent of my staff (including Simon) and to Simon to not lay him off right now. I wonder why I get myself in these situations where I have no way through without making someone angry.”

Alison handed Mark a better trowel to help him with his wrestling. “I watch you do it with the kids all the time,” she reminded him. “I feel like in the moment you are just so bought in to what one wants—you see all the ways it’s sensible and good. And then in another moment you hear what another one wants and then that looks great too. You just don’t tend to remember that we can’t do both things at once.”

“Yeah, I wish I was more like you—clear about my boundaries and able to think through the repercussions of things before they bite me in the ass.”

Alison sat back in the dirt and looked thoughtful. “And I wish I were more like you in your ability to see what is great about so many things. I get stuck in my own perspective and argue just for that thing I think is best and miss what’s good about the other person’s suggestion.”

“I guess that’s why we are a good pair…?” Mark said, but even he heard the doubt in his voice as the sentence slipped out without any of his characteristic cheer.

“It’s been a rough patch, eh?” Alison said, patting a pansy into the ground. “I feel like we have been stretched so thin with work and parenting—and the unexpected difficulties of this move to what we thought would be paradise—that we have lost sight of what it takes to keep us connected through our differences.”

“I know. For most of our marriage I have found your intensity and seriousness and general devotion to your job to be so sexy. And this year it has felt exhausting and like it sucked all the joy out of our lives.”

Alison felt her defensiveness rise, but she also saw the truth in what Mark was saying. “Yep. I know just what you mean. For me it is your lightheartedness, the way you turn everything into a party with silly hats and feather boas. And this year that has felt irresponsible and frustrating, like I have three kids—four, counting the dog.”

“The dog is really trainable, though,” Mark said, with a hint of lightness.

Alison smiled weakly, but Mark could tell that maybe this wasn’t the time to try to get her to laugh. He tried a more serious approach, and instead of trying to jolt her out of her mood, he tried to listen to really see her. He took off his gloves and took her hand. “What’s the hardest part of it all, Ali?”

Alison was quiet as she weighed the options in her mind. “I’m exhausted. There are just endless decisions to be made right now, and each of them seems tied to a million others. The culture change at work seems to be going really well at times, and then there’s a shift in the market or a new conflict in the world and a whole new set of interwoven problems arises. And don’t even get me started on the kids and how hard it is to try and be a mom and a CEO at the same time. There’s a way it used to be simpler—we had to live near the office, and go in at appropriate times, and all that was pretty well programmed for us. I hated the limits, but I also liked them in a way. But maybe the worst part is that there are days when I feel so brittle that I just might break apart if one more thing doesn’t go my way. I’m sharp with the kids, I lash out at you—I know I’m not that nice to be around.”

Mark nodded and tried to mirror back to her what he’d heard. “You’re being pulled in all these different directions, and you don’t like the person you are when that happens?”

“That’s exactly it. How will anyone else like me if I can’t even like myself?” Alison wondered.

Mark felt the old action urge to disagree with her, to let her know that she wasn’t being so bad, that things were trending better. But he breathed into the urge, felt the sun on his back and smelled the warm earth, and tried again to appreciate where she was coming from. “It is so hard when you feel like you’re not up to the challenge, eh?”

Alison nodded and picked up the trowel again. “It is hard. But I do feel like I’m up to the challenge on most days. Just like I feel like _we’re_ up the challenge—on most days.” She smiled at him. “That was excellent listening, Mark-o. You must be sweating from the exertion! You didn’t make any suggestions or even crack a joke!”

Mark laughed and showed her his hands, crunched into little balls. “You cannot believe how badly I wanted to. I dug my nails into my palm to remind me to just listen! But I’m learning!”

“Yeah. We’re both learning, I guess. And that surely makes these tough differences easier to navigate.”

“Totally true. And even while it’s tough Ali, it’s the differences that make all the good stuff happen too, right? I mean, two people like me in this marriage would be a mess! And two people like you would be, er, um, very very efficient.”

Now Alison laughed for real. “Yes, and I guess that’s why it really is stupid to fire Simon right now just because he’s out of his creative groove. He’s not just a machine to churn out code; he adds a richness and a depth to the work of your team.”

“That’s just it. I just wish I knew how to weave together a stronger community at home and at work rather than constantly feeling like life is one big game and we’re trying to level up to the bigger house or the more talented kid or the best programmer. I get that sometimes my caring for people is part of the problem. But our caring for each other has to be a big part of the solution too, doesn’t it?”

IT’S THE INTERCONNECTIONS THAT MATTER MOST

One of the most surprising ideas that arises from complexity is that in a complex system, the thing that makes the biggest difference is the number and nature of connections among individuals rather than the excellence of any particular individual. Take that in for a moment. We, particularly in the West, are so focused on the skills and characteristics of particular humans. Want to make a project sing? Get a spectacular project manager. Want to solve a tricky problem? Hire the smartest person.

But watching complex systems shows us that this is not the pathway toward thriving. Imagine the absurdity of believing that what would make a healthy forest ecosystem was the most beautiful sort of tree. While of course a beautiful tree is a delight, it is the combination of all the living creatures that creates a thriving ecosystem. If you put a beautiful olive tree, a spectacular orchid, and your favorite songbirds together, you wouldn’t get a thriving ecosystem. What matters for thriving is the interactions between all of these pieces—they need to contribute to one another in some way.

One of the most extraordinary discoveries in this direction in the last decade or so is what Dr. Suzanne Simard coined the “wood wide web.” This is the underground network of fungal mycelia that connects the roots of trees. It turns out these mycelial networks enable the trees to send messages (“There is an infestation of insects over here—protect yourself!”) and even share resources (trees will dump their own nutrients into the soil to nourish a struggling tree nearby).[^1] Scientists have found that in forests, as in offices, it’s the diversity of the trees and the strength of the network that connects them that create the conditions for their thriving.[^2]

So if it’s true that in forests and in office buildings a thriving system has strong and plentiful connections, you can also see that systems break down as those connections weaken and fray. This was highlighted during the most separated days of COVID. Even though individuals were working their hardest and were often at least as excellent as they had always been, teams and organizations began to sputter as the threads of their interconnections weakened and became brittle in the face of their separation. In order to thrive in complexity, we need a whole ecosystem of connections—deep and lasting connections, weak and widespread connections. And this means that creating connections of all varieties is profoundly important for any of us who are creating or supporting human ecosystems in an uncertain world.

There are many ways to be connected to one another to create a thriving system.[^3] We’d like to go straight to the, er, heart of the matter and talk specifically about a word that doesn’t get mentioned much at work: love. We’d like to focus in on loving because it might be the most important thing we ever do, might be the reason our short and often difficult lives are precious and beautiful.

We are not pointing to the rarefied and somewhat meager vision of love that lights up movie screens. Generally, when we think of love, it is often romantic and sometimes familial; the Greeks had seven words for love, and in English we make do with just the one. Here by love we mean the deep caring for another person as a full human—not for their finest characteristics or what they might offer to us. We mean caring about the person beyond this context we share and across the full context of their lives. We mean supporting who this person is becoming and not just who they are today. And we mean being willing to give up some of what might be best for us in this moment for something that is more importantly best for them. Finally, we rest into love in a reciprocal way. As we look out for their well-being, we can also express our hurts, our fears, our deepest wishes, and we can expect that others will be there for us.

You can see these attributes are not just available to our lovers or our children. We can love the person in the next cubical if we simply care about her as a full person, we care about her in the fullness of her life and not just as our colleague who shows up at the office, and we make space for her to be different tomorrow. We love her when we notice and weigh her needs as fully important to us. And when we lean into the strength of her caring and offer her something of our joys, our difficulties, our vulnerabilities.

This is not a feel-good response for making teams less conflictual; if you do loving well, there will always be conflict as we express our natural differences. Nor is it the somewhat twisted approach of sucking more life out of employees by manufacturing the sense that they are a family. It is the answer to a fundamentally human need—the need to feel connected to those around you.

Loneliness is not only epidemic right now; it is also terrible for your body and, as you might imagine, puts your nervous system on high alert. Loneliness creates inflammation and is associated with depression, illness, and even death. Loving, on the other hand, is connected to the life we tend to want. When you read the research on longevity or on teamwork or on cancer, you see the centrality of love to our thriving and success. When you read ancient philosophy or spiritual texts, you see the centrality of love to our spiritual health.

All of this is important, obviously, but there’s another reason we want to call out the genius of loving as a way to heighten our complexity genius. Loving, like so many of these geniuses, is a funky mix. We have clearly evolved expressly for this (so much of our biology is given over to not just reproducing but to the requirement for connections for us to be happy and healthy). At the same time, we often mistakenly believe that because we can’t force it to happen, loving is utterly outside our control. People figure that loving, like laughter, like motion, like breath, just happens. Or it just doesn’t. And true, that’s often how it feels, but it could feel different. One vital move is to create the conditions that increase the odds of love arising.

LEADERSHIP AS LOVING

But talking about love and leadership can be a little unsettling. Like laughter, love can be a dangerous thing when misused and so perhaps we stay away from it at work (or we pretend to stay away from it at work). Years ago, as the Gallup Engagement Survey was beginning to get widely used in our part of the world (which at that time was New Zealand), the Kiwis reacted strongly to one of the sentences they were supposed to rate: “I have a best friend at work.” It’s not that New Zealanders didn’t have best friends at work, but the idea that their bosses would care about such things struck them as unwholesome somehow: a mixing of business and personal life.[^4] But in the years since—and particularly since COVID has sent many of us to work at our kitchen tables—we have found that there is no wall between our work lives and our home lives. Our lives are our lives. Our health is our health. Our emotions are our emotions. Our humanity is with us wherever we are.

Leaving aside our humanity is not an option; using our humanity well, though, is. Loving is a choice as much as an element of luck. This is why Gallup has this question about friendship in their engagement survey. It’s not that friendship happens to arise or doesn’t; it’s that the best leaders create the conditions for friendship to arise. The best leaders don’t wait for connections to happen; they create opportunities for connections to happen. And while there are health benefits to connections and financial benefits to those organizations that learn how to connect people well, we’d like to just point to what we have learned not only through our research but through our decades on the planet; our connections with others are not simply a byproduct of our living good lives. Our connections with others are the actual substance of living good lives. So let’s set about creating the conditions for loving to arise.

THE GENIUS OF LOVING OUR DIFFERENCES

Let’s look at forests again. There are two key things about the health of ecosystems: the number and variety of connections and the number and variety of elements. It’s connection in diversity that enables real thriving in complexity. Monocultures are efficient—in fields and office buildings. They’re neat and tidy. Every stalk of genetically modified wheat needs the same pesticide, the same fertilizer, and ripens at the same rate. And the more homogeneous our workplaces are, the more of us will share the same assumptions, backgrounds, and motivations.

The problem with monocultures in fields is that they are brittle—they don’t handle change and uncertainty well. If the weather pattern changes or a new sort of insect arrives, you could lose the whole crop. Fields are also not what nature creates, so there’s a whole lot of effort that has to go into creating a kind of unnatural, propped-up version of a thriving system.

The problem with monocultures in an office is similar—they don’t handle change and uncertainty well.[^5] If you just want to do what you’ve been doing in the way you’ve been doing it, diversity might not be your friend. But if you want to keep an eye out for unexpected threats on the horizon, if you want to come up with a really innovative idea, if you want to stretch into some new space, you’ll do better with a diverse set of experiences and perspectives on the team.

The challenge with this is threefold. First of all, our bodies can actually metabolize diversity as a threat. Remember that our sympathetic nervous system gets activated when we encounter the unexpected, the different—this makes it harder for us to go toward and feel wholly open in groups that are made up of folks who are different from us. Secondly, because our well-being as humans has so long been associated with our acceptance in groups, our bodies have evolved to reward us when we fit in and punish us when we stand out—this makes it harder for us to stand out when we feel different. Thirdly, this regard for those like us and disregard for difference is not just in our bodies but inscribed in our societies in a variety of practices, laws, and other systemic features that have encouraged us to be drawn toward one set of people and away from another set. We tend to be segregated by the schools we go to, the neighborhoods we live in, the workplaces where we spend our time. The default setting for modern humans—like for monocultures like corn or wheat—has become homogeneity. This is a fundamental weakness in our modern societies.

But this is not a book that condemns what is wrong in our bodies and our societies (though those books can be helpful too). The thing is, we have a genius here too. Loving our differences is as fundamental to the human story as being afraid of them. Our greatest love stories—for as long as such things have been recorded—are about the urgency of love across difference. Our greatest triumphs as a human race have been about reaching across our differences and becoming bigger, building, as our friend Keith Johnston calls it, “a bigger us.” But it doesn’t come without some practice. Here’s one of our favorites.

_GEM: Listening to See_

Perhaps the best way for us to love across differences is to really see one another in those differences—and to let others experience the way we see them. There are probably many ways to do that, but the one we find most consistently wonderful is a listening practice.

In earlier books, Jennifer has talked about the difference in the various intentions we might have to listen: Are we listening to win an argument? Listening to fix or solve a problem? Or listening to learn from the perspective of another person? You can imagine that that third way—listening to learn—is the one that is the most useful of those three as we try to manage a complex world because it increases, rather than satisfying, our curiosity.

We are indebted to the work of Vernice Jones and akasha on yet another listening distinction that might be the best way to switch on our complexity-friendly nervous system and to love our differences. They call it “listening to see,” and it begins with a fundamental desire to understand the unique perspectives of the person across from you. They make the point that if you are “listening to learn,” you are still trying to get something for yourself—new learning, new understanding. Listening to see is a gift you give another person, and in the same way laughter can be a gift, listening to see is a gift that changes the nervous systems of both the listener and the listened-to. You’ll also see that it requires other complexity geniuses to unlock this one: noticing, breathing, wondering.

Vernice and akasha name three steps to this form of listening.[^6]

_Inquire_. Here we ask questions to get at not the issue itself, but why this issue matters so much to the person. You might ask questions like:

• What is it about this issue that is most important for you?

• What is hardest for you?

• What feels most at risk for you?

• What seems most exciting for you?

You might have to ask that a couple of times to really get underneath the surface of the ideas. In any case, our inquiry is to understand not the actual issue itself, but the other person’s relationship to the issue. (By the way, although we are emphasizing this as a gift to the other person, understanding someone’s relationship to the issue—particularly when you are in conflict—is often the key that unlocks new possibilities.)

_Mirror_. Once you’ve inquired, maybe a couple of times, the next step is to mirror back to the other person so that they can tell that you’ve been trying to see them. (This step is important because we are not used to people listening to see us, and we are expecting people to listen to fix or to win.) This means you show them your sense of what they’ve said. Sometimes people call this “active listening,” and sometimes it sounds like parroting. What we’re looking for here is for you to say aloud the thing you usually just note to yourself in your own head. That way you can test to see whether the thing you believe the other person meant is the same as the thing the other person believes she meant.

_Appreciate—even if you don’t agree_. The final step is to appreciate the perspective of experience of the other person. You do this by letting them know that you see what matters to them, and their concerns are legitimate. Often, we hold back from this step because we confuse it with agreeing with the other person, and we fear that if we acknowledge and appreciate their views have merit, it will make it harder for us to win whatever argument we are engaged in.

It turns out, though, that appreciating even without agreeing is a counterintuitive step that opens a pathway to deeper conversation. It allows both people to be looking at a common problem together, making room for both of you to acknowledge that there are multiple reasonable perspectives about this issue. And it might just get everyone wondering about a different approach that would include these ideas and also not pit people against each other somehow. Your complexity genius knows that there are always multiple ways to look at any complex issue.

Listening to see helps us use our differences to become more curious. When we approach our differences—of race, culture, gender, or perspective—with the passionate curiosity of trying to understand another person without changing them, we find ourselves expanding who we are to include a new possibility of the world. And beyond what we gain in our own enlarged perspective, the quest to understand someone deeply without trying to fix or change them feels an awful lot like love.

_GEM: The Complexity Check-In_

You might remember from chapter 2]] how important it is for individuals to scan the present. But taking stock of the world as it exists right now is at least as important for groups as it is for individuals. After all, one of the amazing advantages of groups is their diversity of perspective and experience. Scanning the present while using that diversity creates a wide angle look at your situation—like climbing a tree to get a sense of the landscape. But we can’t access different perspectives without deeply loving our differences—otherwise we’re likely to get lost in smoothing out our differences or scoring a point instead of really looking around the widest possible view. This means we need to combine our system scan with a way to also engage our genius of loving. Here’s our clients’ favorite practice doing both: the complexity check-in.

Groups often use some kind of process of “checking in,” but our experience is that they rarely use that process to the highest advantage for both getting centered in the meeting and getting some collective and shared information about the present. Here’s a versatile process you can do fast (in just a few minutes) or leisurely (in a few hours) depending on the purpose and the set-up.

_Center people in the room_. You can do this with a quick reminder of the purpose of the meeting (“Welcome to you all. In this weekly staff meeting, we’re hoping to get a sense of what’s going on in the midwestern markets and also make a decision about a new proposal from our people team”). Or, if you have the latitude, you can activate another complexity genius and have people arrive and take a breath or two together. (This sounds weird at first, we know, and it’s an experiment to try.[^7])

_Give folks a question and time to write about it_. The question can be anything that you think you need to start the meeting—from quick and personal (“Up to seven words that describe how you’re thinking/feeling as you come into the meeting”), to the very tactical (“What’s the most surprising thing you’ve heard from our customers this month?), to deep and relationship building (“What makes it hard for us to ask one another for help when we need it?”). Give folks a minute to jot a note to themselves about the answer to this question (to avoid the group-think of people hearing other answers before they think about their own).

Listen to all answers without interruptions or judgment.

Now zoom out and see what patterns you notice. Ask a question to help people see their connection: What did we see that we had in common? Ask a question that helps people notice and love their differences: What did we see that was outside the norm? (Here the idea is to notice with gratitude all outlying perspectives.) And finally, ask a question that helps people look for the diversity they’re not seeing: What did we notice that was missing or absent in some way? (This teaches us how to look for the unsaid, which can sometimes be the most important thing of all.)

Using a complexity check-in might not feel like the kind of loving we’re used to. At first, like many of these GEMs, it might feel a little wooden and uncomfortable. But over time, this practice increases the way we listen to everyone, the way we honor difference, and the way we think together as a group. This is the beginning of creating conditions for the genius of loving our differences.

“I can’t believe you came!” Pete said, throwing his arms around Mark and then Alison and then back around Mark. “I’m so excited to see you!”

“We wouldn’t miss this for the world!” Alison told him. “How often do you get to see someone make an intergenerational dream come true?”

“Sit, sit!” Pete told them, “I’ll grab you some coffees and a piece of sweet potato pie. Continuing the intergenerational theme, it’s my grandma’s recipe.”

Alison and Mark perched on the comfy chairs which, like everything in Dad’s Workshop Cafe, were for sale. Both regular customers and those who generally shopped at Home Depot were checking out the new coffee shop and the new wares that Pete and Terrance had picked out for this opening day.

“Pete got caught up talking to a customer, but he asked me to bring these to you,” Supriya said, putting the coffees and a slice of pie down on the table.

“So you’re the famous Supriya!” Alison said smiling broadly. “We have been so excited to finally meet you! Can I give you a hug?” Supriya held out her arms as an answer and hugged first Alison and then Mark.

“Sorry for that clumsy introduction,” Pete said, putting down two more steaming cups and another slice of pie. “It’s unbelievable how excited people are about this place. But I’m at least as excited to have you folks meet each other! What do you think about Dad’s Workshop?”

“Love it! Plus the pie is delicious!” Mark mumbled with a full mouth.

“Yeah,” Pete said, looking around. “It was kind of amazing, actually, how the pieces just fell into place once I decided this was a worthy experiment. Terrance and I really dug into Dad’s dream and found that he had already done a heap of work for it. It was so important to him that this combine all the pieces he cared about: making people’s lives better, bringing together the community, giving people who were struggling a second chance. So with all that in mind it became easy to link up with the New Work in a New Land organization which was founded by a Syrian refugee to help other refugees find jobs. We have language classes here in the evenings, and a handful of refugees from all over the world are cooking for us and learning to make my Grandma’s recipes.”

“Plus the hummus is amazing,” Supriya added.

“True enough. It’s a pretty eclectic menu—which was also what Dad wanted. The neighborhood has changed over the years, and we want to serve all the people who live here now. It turns out Dad had a much bigger vision than running a small chain of hardware stores. He had the sense of what it meant to build a home, and then to build a community out of all those homes. He knew that he couldn’t make Jamaica Plain a dynamic, multicultural stew where people of all colors and backgrounds and political preferences could find common ground, but he could do his part to encourage that. And this little café with ten tables and a fancy Italian espresso machine was one little push in that direction.”

“I guess in a way we’re all in the business of creating communities that work,” Supriya said.

“I’m just realizing how true that is,” Mark agreed. “And, geez, have I found that out this month at work for sure. I don’t know if Pete told you the backstory, but I’ve just been through the ringer on a tricky set of negotiations to build my little community back at work. Making the decision to cut everyone’s salary by 10 percent to preserve all the jobs was a really high hill to climb—I had to get everyone from my team as well as my boss, HR, and finance all to agree. But once we had all decided it was the right thing to do, it wasn’t that hard to take the next steps. And the move has energized my global team like nothing I ever could have imagined. So yeah, for me it was knowing that I was more in the business of creating a strong and functioning work community that made all the difference.”

There was a crash behind the counter as the barista slammed into one of the new cooks, smashing the plate and the mug and splattering latte and egg yolk all over the floor. The whole store became silent, and then some of the customers started to clap. Soon everyone was laughing as the mess was swept away and the coffee and sandwich remade—with a more careful choreography this time.

“We’re all learning our way together,” Pete said, smiling as he clapped too. “It’s going to take some time to be able to share the space here, to know what to keep and what to prune. It’s going to take a lot of bumping into each other and breaking some dishes before we find a pattern that works. That’s what it means to hire these folks and then provide the support for them to grow. But everyone is super excited about this whole project, and so they’re willing to put in the work.” Pete raised his mug to the other three. “To dreams that arise out of the fog of confusion!”

Mark squeezed Alison’s hand, “And to dreams that get revised as life changes.”

Supriya joined them, “And to creating the conditions for a more humane world, each in our own way.”

DON’T TRY TO BE SUPERHUMAN—BE A SUPER HUMAN INSTEAD

We believe that one of the most important preconditions for connection, for love, is the idea that we are humans, full humans, with all human foibles, imperfections, and greatness. When we demand perfection, we immediately create the conditions for disconnection, for competition, for posturing. Humans fundamentally aren’t perfect, so the demand for perfection necessarily blocks connection, blocks loving. And, like nearly everything in this book, this practice begins with how we are engaging with ourselves. We cannot engage our complexity genius and use it only on others; it has to emerge from inside us as well. When we allow our own humanity, we immediately create the conditions for wholeness, collaboration, creativity, connection—and love. It is a more honest stance, and in that honest space we find one another, and we find ourselves.

One of the most astonishing discoveries we see in our work as coaches and teachers of coaches is what happens when people begin to release the perfectionist pull inside them. We often don’t even notice that we’re trying to be perfect because that quest looks different for each of us. Some of us have a kind of classic perfectionism: we want our work or our answers or our PowerPoint decks to be flawless. But some of us have more stealthy forms of perfectionism: we want to add value to every conversation, we want to remember every birthday, or we want to be kind to all people all the time. This urge to be perfect (in whatever way it occurs for you) was probably programmed into us by our schools and families when we were little. And it has been useful, up to a point. This quest for perfection often leads us toward excellence. But it leads us away from one another. And when we create or lead organizational (or family) cultures that are grounded in perfection, we are necessarily saying No Humans Allowed.

THE GENIUS OF LOVING OUR HUMANITY

Humanity is messy. But that is not just our downfall, it is also our genius. It is through our quirks, our differences, our brokenness that our different perspectives arise. It is those different perspectives that pull us toward one another, that keep us interested, and that together can create utterly innovative solutions for all of the big hairy problems that threaten us right now. In a world without quirky, imperfect humans, could there be creativity? Could there be innovation? Could there be love?

And yes, all of you perfectionists out there, we hear what you’re thinking. You’re thinking that it’s not perfection that you’re after, it’s quality or excellence or pushing yourself to be your best. You might not even think of yourself as a perfectionist at all, but as someone who is continuously improving. We get it: we have made all those arguments ourselves (and still do). And let’s face it—the two of us study and practice and teach and write about adult development. We have been encouraging change and growth in adults for basically our entire careers. Perhaps that helps us be well placed to say: there is a tension here that we need to balance. We know that the quest for excellence, for growth, for development is incredibly important for us to push ourselves to do something wonderful in the world. This probably doesn’t strike you as a surprise. You know this or else you wouldn’t even be reading this book.

On the other hand, what you might not know is the profound benefit of the opposite side of this tension. This idea that you are enough just as you are, that there is something whole and beautiful and coherent about you that is made up of all the various ways you are imperfect. And we have watched people’s lives change as they have worked to accept their whole humanity and not rail against it to fix or change it.

This paradox is one of the fundamental tensions of human growth and development. I want to be more than I am today. And I am enough as I am. When we hold both of these ideas as true and try to achieve something of a balance between them, we change what’s possible for us and for those around us. So let’s work to allow our own humanity and the humanity of one another. Let’s all be super humans and unleash the genius of loving.

OPENING OURSELVES TO OUR OWN HUMANITY

A thought experiment: Imagine that you popped into a video meeting, and, through some technical glitch, the others didn’t notice you were there yet. And it turns out they were talking about you.

Now, imagine what they were saying about you was delightful beyond belief. They made you blush with pride. See if you can name three descriptors these folks would be using. Did they said you were brilliant? Kind? Creative? Funny? Responsible? Jot a note to yourself about those words. It might be cringy, but it’s important.

Now, same scenario, different outcome. Imagine that what they say is the most awful thing possible for you. Their words make you want to crawl into a tiny hole. What are those words? Would they call you selfish? Shallow? Fake? Entitled? Jot a note about those words too.

Now you have two lists. And we are here to wager that those two lists have profoundly shaped the person you are today—they are the platform on which you stand. Yet over time, the platform creates the bars of a cage around the person you could become tomorrow. And, perhaps more importantly, the cage gets in the way of real connection and love.

Here’s how. Let’s say that your positive words were: curious, good listener, selfless. And your negative words were: self-oriented, manipulative, arrogant.[^8] Now, you might not notice it, but you are constantly trying to create a sense for yourself and others that you are that first sort of person. And you are constantly trying to create the sense that you are definitely not that second sort of person.

This has had all kinds of benefits up until now. You’ve been able to get closer to this ideal. When you are faced with the choice between listening and pushing for your own way, you might lean toward listening. When you are pressed to either say what you know or ask a question, you lean toward inquiry. That’s been helpful. People probably do use those words about you.

And, it gets in the way. Your attraction to the word “selfless” and your aversion to the idea of “self-oriented” means you don’t stand up for what you want. Your attraction to “curious” and your dread of “arrogance” means you might not step into your own power or knowledge.

This begins to shape what’s possible for you, and it creates boundaries about what you can and can’t do. These boundaries can be helpful—because they preference a version of you that you want. But, like all boundaries, they limit you as well. Generally, the things we dread become monsters we have to avoid at all costs, long past the time when our avoidance is helpful.

This doesn’t just operate on us alone, of course. These boundaries also build fences around our ability to connect as well, in two different ways. First, our desire and dread for these words for ourselves tend to make us fixate on those qualities in others. Someone who is allergic to nuts is (rightly) vigilant about anything that might contain a walnut, so someone who is allergic to “shallowness” might be (less rightly) vigilant to anyone who is playful or light or more general in their pursuits. This means we gravitate more and more to those who are like us, which gets in the way of connecting with those who have other perspectives, other gifts. Anything that limits our ability to connect to those who are different is unhelpful in complexity.

Secondly, over time these desired and dreaded words put us at war with ourselves. We hate the parts of ourselves that might be a little bit more slothful (what others might call “relaxed” or even “playful”), and we focus our self-judgment and self-loathing on that part. This makes us a little self-obsessed; we cannot be particularly open to creating the conditions for love to arise when we are busily at war with ourselves. Therefore, even when we are trying to stamp out all sense of our being “self-oriented,” we ironically become too self-centered to connect with others.

_GEM: Allow for Your Own Imperfections_

So, first a solo practice. When you find yourself heading toward one of the facets you most desire, just pull back for a moment and consider your options. Instead of following the action urge that these words create without your even noticing, take a breath. Is one of your desired words “smart” or “diligent?” Next time, instead of blindly answering all the questions you know the answer to, wait. Does “responsible” make your list? Instead of putting your hand up for the next task that you don’t want and don’t have time for, wait. See what happens when you offer yourself the gift of the pause. You can have an element as a key feature of your personality and not be driven by it without consideration.

Similarly (but exactly the opposite), when you find yourself keeping away from one of the facets you detest, see if you can take half a step closer. Afraid of being seen as disagreeable? Sure, that makes sense. But can you notice that fear and then experiment with disagreeing even if someone might believe you were a little bit disagreeable along the way? Afraid of looking stupid? That makes sense too: you’ve probably built your career in part on your intelligence and your expertise. Next time, resist the action urge that forces you away from stupidity. Take a tiny step toward “stupidity” and say, “I don’t know,” or “I could be wrong about this,” or “Geez, I’ve never even thought of that before.”

You might notice that this oblique way of changing yourself makes you better able to create connection with others. It might just activate the genius you have for loving.

_GEM: Share Humanity Stories_

Here’s a practice to try with others—in the evening with a glass of your favorite beverage or even around the virtual table of your Teams screen.

We know that sharing stories of our past or our dreams or our out-of-work life is connecting. But we two have listened to hundreds of such stories, and we know that the stories that generally arise in these conditions are ones that put a gentle shine on our reputations. Ask someone to tell about a difficult moment, and she’ll tell you of a time that was a challenge but from which she emerged heroically. Ask someone to tell about something that shaped him, and he’ll tell you about his immigrant grandfather who was illiterate but still made his way as a small business owner. These stories tend to highlight those things we want people to see about us and disguise those parts we don’t want to show them. (Just watch the way the desired and dreaded words above influence what stories you’re willing to tell). We think of these as our “polished vulnerability” stories, and all the leaders we know have them—they are genuinely moving, they awaken tears or laughter at just the right moment, and they advance our desire for our own version of looking perfect to the world.

But “polished vulnerability” gets us admiration, not love. Admiration feels nice, but it’s not a genius. For love we need humanity.

To do this, make space for a different kind of story. Set up the conditions for everyone on your team or around your table to tell a story, for everyone to listen well. Offer a description like this:

Here we’re looking for times when things didn’t go as you planned, and you were not the hero in the end. We want the stories you don’t tell often, the ones you don’t even like to tell yourself. The times you let yourself or others down, the times when you discovered you were less good than you hoped. It’s not that we want these stories to shame or downgrade one another but because these are a core part of who we are as humans. And a core part of this team is accepting who we are in the fullness of our humanity.

Then give everyone a chance to speak. Give everyone a chance to listen. And see how much more becomes possible when you lean into loving your humanity.

Talking about our failures and missteps openly is not only deeply connecting, but also creates the conditions for us to try and fail again. Amy Edmondson, who writes extensively about psychological safety, discovered this as she studied high-performing teams in operating theaters. We might guess that those higher-performing teams talk less about failure and mistakes—after all, their higher performance means they are necessarily making fewer mistakes! Quite to the contrary, however, Edmondson found that the highest performing, most creative teams talked much more often and more openly about failure than lower-performing teams. They made fewer errors, but they talked about more of them.[^9]

You want this kind of conversation whether the mistakes are happening at work or on your lacrosse team or in your community orchestra. You’re trying to train nervous systems in two vital ways here. The first way is to create the connections that make imperfection safe to talk about—to enable us to more easily have honest conversations about our errors and failures. The second way is to make talking about failure so commonplace that people adjust to it and, over time, find they have less of a sympathetic nervous system reaction to failure and difficulty. This way we can admit to ourselves as well as to others the core features of our humanity, and we can use our connection to one another as a strength we rely on to make us stronger.

CREATE THE CONDITIONS TO GROW LOVE AROUND YOU

The leadership task in complexity is to create the conditions for goodness to arise and trust that the outcomes will follow. Obviously one of the core conditions that matters is the way our surroundings encourage either our reactive nervous system or our complexity genius nervous systems to take charge. A workplace or family or group of volunteers that is stressed and living in their sympathetic nervous system is unlikely to be able to handle the demands of the current world, and yet the current world tends to stress us out. To create a whole collection of folks who can be creative and innovative together, we need to amplify everyone’s complexity genius.

And to do that, we can build in some practices that help our complexity geniuses arise at scale. Like everything that’s complex, we can’t force these outcomes. But we can experiment to create conditions and iterate and nudge in the directions of our highest hopes.

_GEM: Creating Conditions for Loving: The Gratitude Souk_

We could write a whole book on how to help create the conditions for loving. (In fact, we just did—every practice in this book supports this endeavor because being in our complexity-friendly geniuses always create a more fertile ground for connection.) One amazing avenue we haven’t yet explored is gratitude.

If there weren’t so many books written about gratitude already, we’d have added a chapter about it here. It is a miraculous relationship-building and nervous-system support emotion. Gratitude helps connect us to ourselves, to one another, to our purpose. It is often thought of as an individual emotion—one that you work on in the comfort of your gratitude journal. We would like to offer a high-energy, delightful way of lighting up the complexity genius of loving, what our friend and colleague Zafer Achi calls “the Gratitude Souk.”

This exercise works in any sort of meeting with any number of people, but often the more the better. We’ve done it in groups from five or six people to many hundreds. It can be as fast as ten minutes, and it requires no preparation, no notice.

Get everyone on their feet or, if you’re in a virtual space, create the conditions for people to be able to choose a breakout room with one other person.

Announce the directions:

We’re about to have an opportunity for you to say thank you to anyone else in this room for anything they have done that makes your life better or your work more successful. It can be as small as “Thanks for getting me a cup of tea when you got yourself one yesterday—it made me smile that you knew I needed it!” or as big as “Thanks for stepping in and taking the lead on that project when my daughter got so sick—it allowed me to really focus on her without fear about what I’d find when I got back to work.” Say thank you to as many people as you can in the next twelve minutes. Go!

Then let people just wander around and talk to each other. It’s messy (which is a great thing for people to get used to) and high energy and will likely make people laugh. There might be hugging or even tears.

When the time is up, carry on with what you’re doing. But you’ll see that though the room might be the same, all the people will be different.

We find that when leaders offer a Gratitude Souk regularly, it shifts the spirit in the group immediately and, over time, makes people alert to things they will be able to thank others for in the next meeting. This imbues groups with a culture of gratitude that is not only good for our nervous systems, but for all of our relationships.

We know that using the idea of “love” outside a family or friendship setting is unusual, and some folks might find it uncomfortable for a variety of reasons. There are excellent reasons to watch out for your heart, to be cautious about who you’re connected to, to try to maintain boundaries that keep you and others safe. Like many of these complexity genius ideas, though, our nervous system acts here without our knowing it if we’re not careful. It is likely to skew our reactions more toward protection than connection. And that’s a shame, because the deep sense of belonging that comes with love not only enables our nervous systems to relax but relaxes the nervous systems of others. And relaxing the nervous systems of others is the best way to lead a team or an organization or a family—by helping everyone access their own genius.

In this book we’ve been writing as though each of us has a nervous system that stands on its own, that cycles on its own, that falls into reactivity or complexity genius on its own. Here comes the more complex picture. As mammals, our nervous systems are entwined with one another. We have evolved to pick up particularly the threatening signals—anger, fear, overwhelm—from one another and to mirror those feelings in our own nervous system. But we also pick up these geniuses from one another. And as our connections strengthen, our ability to share these geniuses expands. Love is the superhighway of our interconnected nervous systems.

THE GENIUS OF COMPLEXITY

Life these days pushes us to the edge of our limits. Every day can remind us that we’re not really made for this—sitting in our basements or in our cars or in our cubicles and trying to be connected and creative in a world that seems to do its best to be disruptive and disorienting. But the truth is even more daunting than that; life isn’t doing anything to disrupt us. The force of life is and probably always has been disruption, change, disorientation. Disruption and change end when our lives end—and that is not a finish line we tend to race toward. Our yearning for something that is controllable, perfectible, knowable is psychological fool’s gold.

Learning to befriend complexity and disorientation is our life’s work. It is the work that many spiritual paths welcome us into, that developmental models describe. But we don’t mean to talk about that life’s work as a slog, as a difficulty, as an annoyance on the way to nirvana. The violence of the winds of change and unknowing and the fundamental tragedy of our mortality is what enables us to feel and recognize joy, what enables us to give a piece of our well-being to another in the relationship we call love. This is what makes the shimmering of our genuinely golden lives.

Complexity Genius: The natural ease and delight with which we handle our complex, confusing, and uncertain lives

![[151_1.png]]

And while we grow into these capacities, anyone who has ever spent time with a baby knows that we are born into them as well. The ability to handle and shape the world in which we find ourselves is perhaps the ultimate in human greatness. Our next challenge is to grow our ability to face into our fragmented world with grace, kindness, and with the wisdom to understand our interconnections. This is perhaps what we are most called on to learn: that we are one entangled jumble of life and love and fear and anger and hope and need. We make each other up. Everything we’ve ever done as a species might have brought us to this moment.

While humanity stands on the precipice of what could be a murky and dangerous future, each of us is a more influential actor in our collective story than we might imagine. The genius of complexity is that the living world is filled with paradoxes and does not unspool in a straight line: we are tiny and massive; we contain shadow and sunshine; we are alone and we are together. Our ultimate complexity genius is our ability to use the challenge of our current difficulties to grow the capacities we need to address them.

What we have tried to offer in these pages is not just a set of tools but a sense of hope for what we can craft together. As we awaken our own complexity geniuses and also create the conditions to awaken the complexity genius in our families, our organizations, and our communities, we bring out all that is most beautiful in our humanity. Each of us is small but powerful; together we make the world.  

**OUR GRATITUDE**

And now for a Gratitude Souk of our own. Join us as we mull around a room of our friends, family, colleagues, and clients and offer our deep gratitude for the ways these people made this book possible.

Anna Russell, Dominic Longo, Heidi Brooks, John Sautelle, Marco Valente, Mary Beth Robles, Marianne Stacey, and Nicolai Tillisch, our dear Cultivating Leadership colleagues: When you read our draft with such care and compassion, we were buoyed by your encouragement and challenged by the places you thought could be better. Your voices whispered in our ears during the whole of our extensive rewrite. We are so grateful for the brilliant holding of the paradox of challenge and support in this project and in all the places where we are lucky enough to dance alongside you.

Keith Johnston, Mindy Danna, and Wendy Bittner: Every time we think or walk or dine with you, we grow (and it’s not just the cheese). When we used these ideas to create workshops and team-building sessions with you—long before there was a sense of what this book might actually be—we not only saw the power of these ideas, but we also had the benefit of having them stress-tested again and again. You know, in the good way. Also, thanks for being on this French adventure together. We’ll need all our complexity genius for that one!

Laurence Monnery, Mark Rovner, and Sandra Ellison: When you sent emails as you were reading and you offered brilliant and manuscript-changing suggestions when you were done, you brought sunshine into the dark days of pulling apart a draft or an idea to make it better. Your encouragement was perfectly timed to bring us back to the computer, and your questions and suggestions were perfectly placed to open up a whole new line of possibility. We hope you can see the thousands of ways you have made this manuscript better—and also generally improved our lives. We are so grateful.

Aidan Harney, Dave Soergel, Debbie Hartman, Jeff Mcbride, Irene Hornero Garrido, Isabel Matthews, James Prior, Linda Armstrong, Stephen Finch: We learn from all our clients, but a special thanks to you all for the ways you have supported the unfolding of this book—as readers, experimenters. In our work together we have been so grateful for the ways you have offered feedback that was both challenging and loving—as great leaders do!

Steve Catalano, Cindy Lim, and Catherine Mallon, our team at Stanford University Press. Thank you for believing in this project and putting it in our hands with lightning speed. We are grateful for your competence and your kindness.

June Dixon and Laurel King: You supported us in so many ways: from helping us make sense of the thousands of pieces of feedback to formatting drafts to insisting that we schedule in twice as much writing time as we thought we needed. During this project and all the others we work on together, you have taught us so much about creating the conditions for goodness to emerge. We could not have done this without you.

Vernice Jones and akasha: You not only helped us listen to see, but you taught us about stumbling forward together. You have expanded our worlds and our minds and our hearts. We are proud to be your colleagues and prouder to be your friends.

Doug Silsbee: Friend, mentor, student, co-creator. We miss you.

Jim Garvey: Thanks, Dad, for seeing that this book is as helpful for leaders of choirs as for leaders of organizations.

Jim Harris: It’s not just Carolyn who knows you have a gift for creating the conditions for people to show up in their fullness. But she knows better than most. As she says, “In our nearly twenty-nine years of marriage, you have done this for me every day, and I have watched you do it for your adoring students, and most importantly for our three young adult children.” A true genius at the Genius of Loving.

Jim Wicks: You have taught us infinite amounts about what leadership looks like in complexity. We are grateful each day for your genius.

Michael Berger: Once again, in addition to being Jennifer’s husband, you’ve been draft-reader, box-packer, dinner-maker, dog-walker, pep-talk-giver. Would any of Jennifer’s books been possible without you? These thirty-five years of marriage have never been what we thought they might be, but it is a pleasure to have created this extraordinary life (and these extraordinary children) together.

Michael Milano: My goodness, you are a GEM in our lives. Thank you for your GEMs, for being alongside us on the days when all the words were hidden behind walls, and for the fierce and loving read of the manuscript once the words were sprinkled on pages. Jennifer particularly thanks you for teaching her about what deep and loving friendship really is these last twenty-five years.

Patrice Laslett: When you first came into our lives with your Reiki energy and your capacity for changing systems, we felt excited (and sometimes admittedly daunted). Who knew how much your capacities, your energy, and your brilliant weaving of somatic and theoretical would change our lives? This book would have been impossible without you.

Shari Davis: The expanding of our friendship and our ability to see things through your eyes does what love always does: it makes us more brave, more compassionate, and more creative.

Vasya Petrova: Thank you for bringing love and beauty and depth into our lives. This next chapter of yours looks particularly tricky, but with a sketch book and the right computer program, you can animate any future.

Zafer Achi: When you gave us feedback on the first few chapters, wow, we felt dejected indeed. But alas you were tragically right, and this book is intensely better because of the strength of that push. Whether in teaching or writing or thinking or living in the French countryside, you always make us better, and sometimes the pursuit is even pleasant.

To all the Cultivating Leadership, Growth Edge Coaching, and Lume Network colleagues and friends we haven’t specifically named: You are part of how we know that these practices not only make the world better, but also create conditions for growing, wondering, laughing, and loving.

To all the unnamed clients whose stories have illuminated our hearts and minds: The work we do with you teaches us each day about complexity, leadership, and growth. The chance to be a part of your stories and walk along the leadership path with you fills us with purpose and with love. Our nervous systems are so nourished by you.

To Alexandra Blaker, Eman Bataineh, Keith Johnston, Meg Odling-Smee, Michael Berger, Mindy Danna, Tony Quinlan, Wendy Bittner, Zafer Achi, le coeur de nos nouvelles vies: Thank you for co-creating a new world filled with nooks for writing, meals for sustenance, and plenty of complexity for inspiration!

From Jennifer to Carolyn: Who says sisters have to be related? We have braided together so many strands of our lives: working, mothering, New Zealanding, organization building, growing, learning, writing. And through it all, every complexity genius arises. My deepest gratitude is that I have gotten to know you and learn from you and be your friend.

From Carolyn to Jennifer: The way our lives—and the lives of our families—have intertwined and grown together over these past two decades is nothing less than a love story. In the arms of our friendship and partnership, we have adventured, laughed, cried, learned, and loved more deeply than I ever thought possible. Thank you, my friend, for all of it and what’s to come.

Abby, Aidan, Becky, David, and Naomi: Watching you five grow into glorious adults has been the greatest joy of both of our lives. You bring us into each of our geniuses. We hope this book helps you all make it through this next chapter of your lives with a little more ease and hope.

INTRODUCTION

[^2]: . Two caveats: 1. If you hated the story in _Unlocking Leadership Mindtraps_, we’re guessing you’ll hate it here too. Feel free to skip it altogether. 2. If you didn’t even read _Unlocking Leadership Mindtraps_, no worries—all you need is here.

CHAPTER 1

[^1]: . If you’ve read Jennifer’s _Unlocking Leadership Mindtraps_, you’ll recognize Pete as Leroy. We got feedback from a handful of our early readers that Leroy felt like an uncomfortable, stereotyping name for a Black character these days. You’ll see as you read that we are trying to act in a more helpful way in the complexity of our diverse world, so we took this feedback very seriously and changed his name to Pete. We are learning in public here. Our apologies to anyone who was offended by Leroy’s name and also to anyone who might be confused about the switch.

[^2]: . This is just a small piece of what Dave Snowden’s framework offers. See Snowden’s copious blogs on his website at www.cognitive-edge.com]] for his latest thinking. For perhaps his most famous text on this idea you can read David J. Snowden, and Mary E. Boone, “A Leader’s Framework for Decision Making,” _Harvard Business Review_, November 2007. Or you can read the book Jennifer and Keith Johnston wrote about this set of ideas: Jennifer Garvey Berger and Keith Johnston, _Simple Habits for Complex Times: Powerful Practices for Leaders_ (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2015).

[^3]: . People often ask us if the world is more complex than it used to be or if it just appears more complex because we have complexity theories and Twitter and ten billion shows to watch on Apple TV. We think it’s true that the world has always been more complex than humans like to admit, and also that the interconnectivity and speed of today’s world just is more complex than it was even twenty years ago.

[^4]: . We leave this quote uncited because we simply couldn’t find it in the original. But read anything Sapolsky has written, and you will find this idea all the way through his research and writing. Our favorite book of his we have read again and again, and each time we learn more: Robert Sapolsky, _Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers: The Acclaimed Guide to Stress, Stress-Related Diseases, and Coping_ (New York: Holt Paperbacks, 2004).

[^5]: . We don’t want to go too far into the complexities of this topic here, but it’s utterly fascinating and we could get carried away if our editors let us. Instead, we’ll just recommend that you do: Stephen W. Porges, _The Pocket Guide to the Polyvagal Theory: The Transformative Power of Feeling Safe_ (New York: W. W. Norton, 2017); Guy Claxton, _Intelligence in the Flesh: Why Your Mind Needs Your Body Much More Than It Thinks_ (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2016); and Deb Dana, _The Polyvagal Theory in Therapy: Engaging the Rhythm of Regulation_ (New York: W. W. Norton, 2018).

[^9]: . Carolyn first heard this phrase, which so viscerally evokes the felt sense of unconscious impulse to action, from Doug Silsbee.

[^10]: . We are grateful to our clients for teaching us so much about complexity and for allowing us to use some of what we’ve learned from them as we create little vignettes throughout the book. The names and most identifying information for all of their stories have been changed. Most of the names themselves come from a group of clients, colleagues, and friends who offered us their favorite names from around the world.

[^11]: . This, like so many things, is only mostly true. David Eagleman shows the ways our brain is constantly rewiring itself. So while it’s clearly true that the collective evolution of our nervous system will take many generations, it’s also true that your particular nervous system is learning and changing all the time. David Eagleman, _Livewired: The Inside Story of the Ever-Changing Brain_ (New York: Vintage Books, 2021).

CHAPTER 3

[^1]: . For more on this, see Jennifer Garvey Berger, _Unlocking Leadership Mindtraps: How to Thrive in Complexity_ (Palo Alto, CA: Stanford University Press, 2019).

[^2]: . Jennifer was soothed and illuminated by Daniel Leiberman, _Exercised: The Science of Physical Activity, Rest, and Health_ (New York: Penguin, 2020).

[^3]: . Amanda Blake, _Your Body Is Your Brain: Leverage Your Somatic Intelligence to Find Purpose, Build Resilience, Deepen Relationships and Lead More Powerfully_ (Trokay Press, 2018).

[^4]: . Jennifer and Carolyn have both had the astonishing experience of living in New Zealand, which was generally excellent for our nervous systems. In particular, we were both struck by the fact that when our young children were in US schools, naughty behavior often led to recess being taken away. In New Zealand schools, naughty behavior often led to students being sent out for a lap around the field. We were dazzled! Trying to stop our restlessness with stillness is a fool’s errand—particularly before we have developed the skills of self-regulation. But trying to burn it off with motion is a complexity genius.

[^6]: . Matthew Walker, _Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams_ (New York: Scribner, 2017), Kindle. Walker’s book is so mind-bending that as soon as you put down this book you should go and get that one.

CHAPTER 4

1. This, like many of our claims, is only mostly true. There are leaders who can take their experimenting genius into huge projects that will take years to bear fruit. And they’re still experimenting because they can imagine the ways the project might go the “wrong” way and still be right for the organization in the end. They can learn and learn along the way. And they know that nothing lasts forever. It is rare to be able to access the experimenting genius when the stakes are so high, though, because—you guessed it—having high stakes activates our nervous system.

CHAPTER 5

[^1]: . Bob’s book still defines the field for us: Robert Kegan, _In Over Our Heads: The Mental Demands of Modern Life_ (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press). Or you could try the book Jennifer wrote years later: Jennifer Garvey Berger, _Changing on the Job: Developing Leaders for a Complex World_ (Palo Alto, CA: Stanford University Press).

[^2]: . Stanford professors Jennifer Aaker and Naomi Bagdonas talk about about the “humor cliff.” “The average four-year old laughs as many as 300 times per day. The average forty-year old, by comparison, laughs 300 times every two and a half months.” Zowie. You can read more about this serious problem in their amusing book: Jennifer Aaker and Naomi Bagdonas, _Humor, Seriously: Why Humor Is a Secret Weapon in Business and Life_ (New York: Random House, 2021), Kindle, location 317.

[^3]: . Nursing a baby is also a great releaser of oxytocin and is one of the reasons we believe having babies in the office can be an excellent experiment.

[^4]: . This comes from a fabulous episode of “The Hidden Brain” with Shankar Vedantam, who was interviewing the neuroscientist Sophie Scott. January 14, 2019, [https://www.npr.org/transcripts/68396660](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/68396660\).

[^5]: . Sophie Scott has a bunch of different studies on fake and real laughing, and even fake laughing seems to have a bonding quality. Even when we can’t say consciously whether the laughing is real or fake, though, real laughter is more bonding and makes things seem funnier than “produced” laughter.

[^6]: . And status comes in many forms from the hierarchy of position to the dominance of culture or race or gender. There’s an easy rule of thumb for this: If you think you have more status, you do not laugh at others. If you’re not sure, you do not laugh at others. Laughing _with_ others (where they are laughing too) is allowed.

[^7]: . Both of these definitions come from the _Oxford English Dictionary_ at www.oxfodify.com]].

[^8]: . This approach has some of its lineage in Internal Family Systems work and, in particular, Parts Work. For a doorway into how your parts make you up, see Richard Schwartz, _No Bad Parts: Healing Trauma and Restoring Wholeness With the Internal Family Systems Model_ (Colorado: Sounds True, 2021).

CHAPTER 6

[^1]: . Lest we get carried away with the benevolence of trees, it looks like they also use this network to steal from one another. We’re not sure if they ever lie. But as humans have found out the hard way—nearly everything powerful can be used to build up or break down.

[^2]: . Our favorite author on this topic is the magical Robert Macfarlane (_Underland: A Deep Time Journey_ [New York: W. W. Norton]). He writes about this—and many other mind-bending things—in this epic and beautiful book.

[^3]: . It’s also true that weak ties and light connections are vital—in complexity and for our well-being. Feeling connected in a place—whether it’s the neighborhood or the synagogue or the company—means knowing a lot of people a little. It means knowing the name of the florist on your street, checking in with the lady who loves hats who always sits on the left side of the third aisle in your church, having the barista know just how you like your coffee. It’s not quite loving, but it is nourishing.

[^4]: . And of course New Zealanders weren’t alone in their wondering about this question. Gallup says it is by far the most controversial of all the questions on the engagement survey. But it is also one of the most important. Connection is vital to an engaged and productive workplace. Here’s how they think about it: [https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236213/why-need-best-friends-work.aspx](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236213/why-need-best-friends-work.aspx\).

[^5]: . The research on teams and diversity is both interesting and fraught with peril. Research shows that teams that are more diverse are more successful and less successful—depending on the study and the context of the team. This makes sense to us. Diversity when it’s not handled well is a liability. Diversity when it’s handled well is a strength. The problem is that diversity is a necessity when we are dealing with complex, fast-moving, and volatile times. So we’d better get good at it.

[^6]: . Want an example? Check out Mark listening to see Alison in the garden, above. Mark has been practicing!

[^7]: . We opened meetings like this with the senior partners in a law firm for three times in a row as an experiment about whether this “woo-woo stuff” was acceptable in their culture. When we skipped the centering part in our fourth meeting, one of the partners said in surprise: “Are we not going to start by breathing? I’ve realized that these sessions are basically the only time in my life when I really get to breathe.” It turned out to be an experiment that changed the culture.

[^8]: . OK, OK, let’s actually say that those are Jennifer’s positive and negative words. You have your own. But for the purposes of example, we’ll take hers.

[^9]: . Amy Edmondson, _Teaming: How Organizations Learn, Innovate, and Compete in the Knowledge Economy_ (Hoboken, NJ: Jossey-Bass, 2012).
