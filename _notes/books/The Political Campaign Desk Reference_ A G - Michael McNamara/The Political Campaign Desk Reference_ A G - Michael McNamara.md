# INTRODUCTION

---

One of the greatest generals, and the most read general, in the history of the world taught that a general who calculates and plans before setting out on a military campaign will most likely succeed over a general who plans very little. Sun Tzu was a military consultant centuries before Jesus walked the earth, but military leaders and campaign consultants read his words today. Sun Tzu wrote The Art of War which has become the standard by which successful generals, consultants, captains of industry, politicians, educators and any other professionals get ahead and stay ahead.

This manual is designed to provide an overview of the most important components of a campaign from grass roots to fundraising. This manual will guide the reader through the basic steps of planning and running a successful campaign. It does not reveal all of the secrets and strategies that I have learned and employed throughout the years. No book can teach many of the things that only experience and battle can teach.

What this manual will do, however, is provide guidance to a candidate or campaign manager. I hope that the information in this book will give the reader an advantage over an unsuspecting opponent.

This book will not win campaigns, and it will not raise money. Only a candidate and a candidate’s committee can do that. I strongly urge readers of this book to employ the tactics and strategies outlined herein. And if your opponent also has a copy of this book, then you should hope that he will discard the information or only use it as a conversation piece. This manual provides the direction, but your campaign is the vehicle of success.

A first-time candidate facing strong opposition should always consider hiring an experienced campaign consultant or manager. In fact, even seasoned candidates who have been through many political battles would be wise to employ a professional. A consultant will not perform all of the grunt work on a campaign, but he or she will be able to give it form. A skilled manager or consultant can employ the information in this book and create a plan and team that will be a formidable force in any election of any size.

The necessities to success are superiority in the four major resources of a campaign: time, information, money and people. The key to unlocking those resources and winning is careful planning, deliberate actions, well though out messaging and professionally executed delivery of the message. The details are truly important in planning, and a campaign should not be plotted out in a single evening. Care and time must be put into gathering and processing information.

It is important to point out that some campaigns are referenced in this book to illustrate a point. In the Appendix section, however, I use a fictitious candidate running for a fictitious elected seat in a fictitious county. The appendices help to demonstrate some examples of what various campaign materials will look like or to further assist the candidate or campaign manager reading this book.

Luck is generally not a factor one should count on in winning a campaign, so I will not wish you luck. I will wish you well and urge you to work hard. The euphoria you will feel at the moment of victory makes the many months of effort working up to it worthwhile.

Happy campaigning!

### A Few Simple Questions and Footwork1.1 Questions every candidate must answer

There are many reasons for running for office. Sometimes a candidate is disgusted at the way the current administration is running the show. Perhaps a candidate runs for office for professional advancement. Some candidates have made an entire career out of public service and have never held a job in any other sector. Others may want to run because they honestly believe they can make a difference. Whatever the reason a candidate chooses to run for office, there are a few questions that must first be answered.

Why am I running for office?

It seems basic enough, but if a candidate has made it public that he or she is running for office without thinking it through, this basic question can lead to embarrassing situations, and worse – lost votes. Few things are worse for a candidate than to be caught off guard by a basic question like this when at a debate, in a public setting or going door-to-door and not knowing what to say. Every candidate needs to know the reason(s) for running for office.

In addition to having an answer for this question, it is important to have a well thought out answer that the candidate is confident in giving. It needs to be credible and sound as though some thought has been put into it. Delivery of the answer should be practiced to the point that the candidate can present his or her reason without much thought. Candidates should look forward to answering this question because it is the first one everyone will ask - including the press.

One may think that only a new candidate could make such a blunder. One of the best examples of how a seasoned candidate from a political family can make the mistake of not thoroughly answering this question is the Presidential Election of 1980. Massachusetts Senator Edward “Ted” Kennedy had made the decision to run for President against incumbent James “Jimmy” Carter in the Democratic Primary. Carter was extremely unpopular, and Kennedy’s campaign had gained steam. Just as Kennedy seemed perched on the cusp of becoming the popular Democratic candidate and snatching the nomination from Carter, Kennedy agreed to appear on a television interview. The interview was the opportunity that Kennedy had waited for to take center stage and steal the show. Unfortunately, he was ill prepared and failed to adequately answer some of the questions including the basic question of why he was running for President. Kennedy’s popularity and seriousness as a candidate plummeted, and he lost the Primary to the widely unpopular Carter, who in turn lost to Ronald Reagan later in 1980.

The best answers include the message of the campaign, which is a topic that this book will cover. For example, a candidate may be running for office in a mayoral race in which the current mayor has done a seemingly poor job or there are specific points of weakness that the incumbent will face. The challenger in the race should use these weaknesses in the answer along with the campaign theme. Perhaps this challenger’s slogan is “Time for a change”, and the point of weakness of the incumbent is the fact that crime has increased under his watch. When asked why the challenger is running, he or she might say:

“I’m running because my neighbors and community leaders feel that we need change. Crime is increasing with no sign of getting better, and we need to keep our families and neighborhoods safe.”

This candidate answered the question saying that “neighbors and community leaders” agree that change is needed and uses the promise of safety to appeal to the voters. An answer like the one used above would generally appeal to voters. This particular answer may fall flat, however, if the proper research is not conducted beforehand to determine that crime truly is a major issue. Researching the issues will be covered later in this book as well. The point is simply to have an answer to this simple question that is effective, practiced and natural. A good answer should contain the message of the campaign.

A winning campaign once used a slogan that answered the question “Why are you running for office.” The slogan on all of the signs, letterhead, stickers and literature said “…because our taxes are too high.” This slogan was used by a challenger, and the incumbent lost by a very large margin. Although a slogan and answer to this initial question are not the only components that won that campaign, the reason for running for office was used effectively.

What office am I running for, and what are the qualifications and duties of the position?

It is surprising how many candidates will jump into a race without a firm understanding of the duties of the job for which they are running. For countywide offices and legislative offices, state laws will delineate the statutory duties of an office. For city or municipal seats, local laws, in addition to any state laws, will dictate the requirements and expectations of officeholders. It is important to gain a thorough understanding of the duties of the job prior to going public with an announcement of candidacy. This information is generally available through publications at any local board of elections or comparable agency. Most of the time, information on job requirements and duties is easily accessible on the Internet. The best resource is the knowledge from a person who has previously held the position being sought assuming that person is competent.

Also, it is important to understand any prerequisites for running for office. Some professional offices such as judge, prosecutor or sheriff may require professional training in order to be qualified to run. Furthermore, almost every office requires potential candidates to gather a certain number of signatures on a petition by a certain date for a candidate to be able to get on the ballot. If a board of elections or elections clerk requires 50 valid signatures in order to appear on the ballot, a candidate should gather three times the requirement or 150 signatures because it is rare for all signatures on a petition to be valid. Filing fees also often apply to run for office, and these fees are generally nominal and non-prohibitive. If a filing fee is cost prohibitive, there may be remedies available to potential candidates in order to waive the fee, but a candidate should seriously consider whether waging a campaign is a good idea if a nominal filing fee creates such a burden.

One important factor in seeking office is making sure the candidate meets residency requirements. Some races do not require a candidate to live within the jurisdiction of the office being sought. Most offices do require candidates to live within the jurisdiction. It is not advisable to run for an office if the candidate lives outside the jurisdiction or if the candidate recently moved to live within the district for the sole purpose of seeking office. A candidate must be able to answer questions as to qualifications for office as well as residency.

How much do I plan on spending, and how much am I willing to contribute myself?

Determining how much a campaign will cost will be covered later in this book. The most important part of determining the success of a campaign is how much a candidate will spend. There are many stories of candidates who win a race being outspent by many times by their opponent. Making decisions on such anecdotal information without knowing the other factors involved in the campaign in question is a common misstep in campaigns for the less experienced. There are many facets that go into a campaign that give certain candidates “political equity”.

Political equity can be manifest in different ways such as the amount of name recognition a candidate has, high public favorable status a candidate has, incumbency or other factors. For example, a candidate coming from a local family that is well known and has high favorability already has a leg up on other candidates, which will cause the challengers to spend more money to make up the perceived difference. Therefore, each campaign is unique and requires decisions about money to be made irrespective of the success of a candidate in another campaign.

Once a general budget is determined for a race, the candidate must decide how hard he or she will work to raise the necessary funds. A candidate must also make a decision on whether to make up the difference if the fundraising goal is not met. Some candidates will take a mortgage or second mortgage out on their homes in order to finance a campaign for office. Taking personal risk in the form of mortgages adds to the stress of a campaign and can lead to candidates making bad emotional decisions if there is no campaign manager or consultant making spending decisions in a race. Personal wealth is a legitimate means of financing a campaign as well.

Fundraising methods and sources will be discussed in a later chapter, but the point is to know that every campaign, no matter the size, requires a significant financial commitment, and a candidate must make the decision before running if he or she is willing to do whatever it takes to fulfill that commitment. If not, building a campaign plan on an unrealistic budget is almost as bad as having no campaign plan at all.

The three basic questions in this chapter are questions that should be answered before any formal announcement for office is made. If these questions are thought out and answered ahead of time, a candidate will be ahead of the game when the petitions for office are validated.1.2 Strengths and Weaknesses

Before waging a campaign, a serious candidate should perform a self-evaluation as well as an assessment of any opponent. The easiest, and best, way to do this is by creating a chart for the candidate and a chart for each opponent. The chart is simple – write the name of the candidate at the top of a sheet of paper, draw a line down the middle of the paper and on one side, write “Strengths”, and write “Weaknesses” on the other side. Create a new sheet for each potential opponent. It is usually helpful to do this with the inner circle of advisors identified for the team – a subject detailed in a later chapter.

In creating these charts in a meeting setting, using a marker and large pad of paper made for easels is most effective because the different sheets can be taped to the wall. The entire team can see the strengths and weaknesses of the candidates in the race.

In determining strengths and weaknesses, it is important to include experience, public voting record, fundraising capability, name recognition/identification (name ID), issues of the race, age, health, capabilities of each candidate, party affiliation, endorsements, individual supporters and every other factor that a team can think of regardless of how insignificant it is.

Sometimes a personal quality might show up in both the “Strengths” column as well as the “Weaknesses” column. For instance, youth and inexperience might be seen as a weakness. Waging a “time for a change” challenger campaign, those qualities should also be seen as strengths. Another example of something that can be a strength and a weakness is a voting record. Officeholders who have been in office for a term or more have established a voting record. Raising taxes might put the voting record in the weaknesses column whereas heralding popular legislation will put the voting record also in the strengths column.

![[00002.jpg]]

Assume that opponent(s) will employ this same technique of listing strengths and weaknesses. If they are honestly evaluating their opponent’s campaign, they will put that in both columns as well.

During this session of listing strengths and weaknesses, it is important to list any “baggage”. Although the people who share in this knowledge must be trusted to keep it confidential, it is important to be open and honest with the “inner circle.” A candidate must assume that if they have personal matters such as past convictions, marital indiscretions, experimentation with drugs or any other “indiscretion” that their opponent will find out and use it. Crafting a campaign plan without considering these factors because they are “private” or personally embarrassing could spell disaster or political death later on in the campaign. Everyone is human and makes mistakes in life. Making mistakes does not disqualify one for office, but not handling the issue responsibly with an electorate that wants politicians who are direct and honest could lead to political death.

Lists of strengths and weaknesses that the team creates should be kept for future reference – they will be used often during the planning stages of the campaign and should be referred to periodically throughout the campaign.

Only the individuals directly related to the strategy of the campaign should have access to these lists. If someone is a loose talker or is slightly untrustworthy, then that person should not be invited to participate in this process or be privy to its results. The security and confidentiality of campaign information is extremely important. Information “leaks” often occur on campaigns in which someone “in the know” begins talking to another person about the campaign. If the person who has confidential information wants to impress someone with their knowledge of the campaign, their closeness to a candidate or for any other reason divulges confidential information, then the campaign has been compromised. Politics is built upon people who have many relationships and networks. It is hard to tell who knows whom and who may let information leak to the opponent’s campaign. A successful campaign must be vigilant about its security of information.1.3 Gathering Political and Historic Data

A local board of elections or elections clerk will have valuable information needed to target voters, build a campaign database, budget and raise funds. The required items include:

- Requirements, forms and fees for running for office
- Election results for past elections
- Voter database for the district of the campaign
- Campaign finance reports

Requirements, forms and fees for running for office

Before running for office, candidates must obtain certain forms from the local elections office. Candidates must often obtain a certain number of signatures on petitions in order to qualify for the office being sought. There are also nominal filing fees that must accompany completed petitions. Every candidate plays by the same rules, and the forms required by the elections office are also public record. There are also timelines associated to the proper filing of forms. A candidate should always be familiar with deadlines on filing the required petitions and paying the required fees.

Once a filing deadline has passed, it is easy to find out who the official candidates are in a race. At this point, a campaign should acquire copies of the petitions and forms that any opponents have filed. A candidate may be able to gauge important information from these forms such as who is supporting the opponent and when and where the petitions were circulated. Different elections offices require varying levels of information, but obtaining opposition forms is a good start to the opposition research file.

Election results for past elections

In order to target areas to focus resources, it is important to retrieve precinct-by-precinct results for past campaigns for the same office being sought. For instance, a city council campaign will want the results by precinct for the last two city council elections. A county commission candidate will want precinct-by-precinct results for the last two county commission races. If a challenger is running against an incumbent, then the challenger will want results of his opponent’s last race.

Studying the results from past elections will help a candidate become familiar with their jurisdiction. Results will indicate which precincts turn voters out to the polls as well as precincts that have barely any turnout. By studying these results, a candidate will know which areas have the strongest turnout and where to spend time and resources on a campaign.

In a race in which a candidate is challenging an incumbent, it is important to examine results from the incumbent’s past election(s). It is important for the incumbent to do this as well in order to find areas of strength as well as weakness. Targeting techniques will be discussed later in this book, but knowing what to ask for and why in the “footwork” phase of the campaign is important.

Voter database for the district of the campaign

The voter database is a wealth of information. It is important to ask for as much information for each voter as the elections official can provide. A proper elections office should be able to provide the database in an electronic format that is easily convertible to off-the-shelf database or spreadsheet software. Information that an elections office might provide for voters includes:

- Voter history
- Date of birth
- Address
- School district
- Congressional district
- Legislative district(s)
- Judicial district(s)
- Phone (not all elections offices acquire these)
- e-mail (not all elections officials acquire these)

For city council races, candidates should only acquire voter information for the city. The same rule applies for county seats or school districts or judicial districts. Sometimes a race crosses county lines and the elections official in multiple counties should be contacted for the appropriate voter information.

The voter database is only valuable if it has the voter history for each voter in the jurisdiction for the office being sought. A campaign needs to be able to determine when the voters voted and for what party they are voting in primary races or races where data for party affiliation is available. With the voter database, a campaign will be able to determine who the most devoted voters are and who the inconsistent voters are as well as those who may never consider voting for a candidate based on party affiliation.

Campaign finance reports

Campaign finance reports are a wealth of information for candidates and campaign managers. In a race against an incumbent or someone who has run for office before, a campaign should obtain the historic finance reports of their opponent. From these, one can determine who has supported the opponent in the past, how much the opponent can potentially raise and the source of funds for past campaigns (self-funding versus fund raising) and if the campaign has any debt. But campaign finance reports have so much more information.

Campaign finance reports can also provide valuable leads on who may potentially give to any campaign. For this reason, a campaign will want to retrieve as many reports as possible for people in the area of the race. In a partisan race, a campaign can save a lot of time, effort and money by not retrieving the finance reports of the opposing party, except for the reports of the opponent. Campaign finance reports usually contain information about donors including the amount of giving, the date of giving and the donor’s address.

Campaign finance reports may also be a source of campaign issues. For instance, if a significant portion of a candidate’s finances come from out-of-state donors, then an opponent may want to question why that is. If a significant portion of a candidate’s finances can be traced to donors who work in a certain industry, a valid question to ask during a campaign is what interest that industry has in that candidate. Whatever the reason, a well run campaign will obtain appropriate campaign finance reports.1.4 Identify Issues

In a race that gains high voter attention, either because the press will cover it, a candidate will create urgency among the electorate or because it is an important race to individuals in the jurisdiction where one is running, it is important to know the right issues. Gauging the issues can be done in a number of ways depending on the budget, size of race and means available:

- Polling by a firm
- Automated phone calls
- Direct mail solicitation
- Monitoring the local press and public documents
- Direction from the campaign team
- Discussions with local elected officials
- Door-to-door

Polling by a firm

There are many firms that will assist a campaign in polling the local electorate. Polls can be very helpful because they can gauge the name identification and popularity of a candidate and any opponent(s), voter satisfaction in current officeholders and prioritize general issues (crime, taxes, traffic, environment etc.). A downside to polls is that they can be expensive. A poll for a countywide race that has extensive questioning can cost thousands of dollars. The sample size, or number of respondents, of the poll also affects its cost. The larger the sample, however, the more accurate the results will be.

A good poll will have cross tabs that will allow the reader to view how voters in a region responded to questions or how women responded versus men. Cross tabs can indicate if a candidate is strong with women or if an opponent is weak with the elderly. Not only will a good poll indicate what issues are priorities for voters, but it will also gauge which messages are strongest and with whom certain messages will resonate.

Another valuable resource in a poll by a firm is an option that prompts voters to provide responses to a question about issues in their own words. These responses, that should be recorded word-for-word, are referred to appropriately as “verbatims”. By reading through the verbatims, a campaign can identify common themes that voters have in their responses. Many voters are very articulate and can formulate a thought in just a few words that can sum up an important issue. It is through these verbatims that candidates may develop sound bites for their speeches, press releases or press conferences. Words commonly repeated by respondents to describe the current state of affairs, such as “violence”, “poverty” or other commonly repeated word can easily become the buzz words in the campaign because they are words and ideas already present in the thoughts and minds of voters.

Using thoughts directly from the verbatims can be extremely effective. Some candidates are seen as identifying with voters and knowing exactly what to say and how to say it. Candidates who become familiar with the verbatim responses, in correlation with the data from the poll, can develop some very powerful messages.

If a budget is too tight for a proper poll, other methods of determining issues exist. Also, it may be wise to learn more about any opponents before conducting a poll. Chapter 3 talks about opposition research and testing messages, and an initial poll may be the tool a campaign uses to test a message as well as information about an opponent.

Automated phone calls

Many people moan about receiving automated phone calls from a machine. The fact remains that automated phone calls with voice response or touch-tone response technology can be very helpful in determining everything discussed under “Polling by a firm” with the exception of verbatim responses. Advantages of an automated phone poll include the ability to reach a much larger sample size and obtain more respondents.

Automated phone calls generally require respondents to give “yes” or “no” answers. Anything more complicated should be handled by a poll from a live operator.

Phone polls can be more versatile in terms of identifying voters that take sides on any number of particular issues from abortion and character to 2nd Amendment and taxes. This sort of polling gets into micro “targeting”, and that is a subject that will be discussed in a future chapter. “Targeting” refers to how a campaign chooses exactly who will receive a campaign message.

Direct mail solicitation

Some candidates have used the tactic of mailing likely voters directly and including a survey for them to return. It is generally more difficult to gain participation through this method, but by using these means, a candidate sends a response vehicle to a prospective voter and receives a survey back with checked boxes and, hopefully, handwritten responses to questions that can be used in a similar way as the verbatim responses from a live phone poll.

This method is generally more expensive than automated phone calls on a per-contact basis but less expensive than a live poll if the mailing list is targeted to voters who rarely miss an election. Direct mail respondents are voters who want to have an impact and voice because they took the time to read the materials sent to them, respond in a written format and send it back with their own postage. These respondents can become a wealth of volunteers, potential donors and votes later in the campaign.

Monitoring local press and public documents

By going through back issues of the paper, it can become easy to determine the issues that have gained the attention of the local reporter or publisher. By knowing the issues important to the press, it is easy to determine the issues to which they will respond. These issues, however, may not be the same issues most important to voters, but they are issues that allow a candidate an opportunity to gain media attention. Media attention is important in a well-executed race.

Other resources to assist in determining the issues of a race include public documents. Minutes from council meetings, school board and commission meetings or legislative sessions can provide a wealth of information on the hot button issues of the day. Particularly helpful are any public comment sections of the minutes in which local residents addressed the council, commission or legislature. These community activists that took time to speak publicly on an issue potentially represent to voices of many others (similar to verbatims in a poll).

Monitoring media and public meetings is generally a very inexpensive way of gauging the issues. It can be very accurate, but this method does not provide the same benefits of polls and surveys.

Direction from the campaign team

The campaign team, an important group of people that will be discussed in detail in Chapter 2, can be a very valuable source of information on important issues if the right people are on board. A diverse and educated team, if comprised of close friends from various professions and regions in the jurisdiction of the office sought, can help guide the discussions on issues. The campaign team should never be the sole source of issue identification, but a roundtable discussion during the planning stages of a campaign can identify issues not previously discovered or bring up issues that may require further thought and research.

It is always good to have employers in the inner circle for guidance on issues about jobs and small business. If a candidate lives in an agrarian area, then having a farmer on board can be helpful with agriculture issues. Education leaders are also valuable to have on board not just for their issue expertise but for their popularity.

Discussions with local elected officials

One thing a responsible candidate for office should do is seek out meetings with appropriate elected officials and even appointed government employees to learn as much as possible about the issues of the region. Elected officials are an excellent resource since they are the ones dealing with issues on the front lines daily. Elected officials should be willing to meet with constituents to discuss the issues or, at the very least, have a knowledgeable government employee provide information. In seeking information from elected officials, it is not necessary for a potential candidate to discuss plans for running for office if an announcement has not been made. Strategically, there is no reason to alert potential opponent(s) to one’s intentions.

Even if a candidate has already announced, seeking meetings with elected officials will be beneficial. Although an elected official may be supporting an opponent, he or she will probably still meet with a candidate in order to gather their own information. It is more important to be a good listener in such meetings rather than a talker. If a candidate is easily disarmed by small talk, too many meetings with other officials could be undesirable. The goal is to gather information - not provide it.

A secondary effect of meeting with local elected officials is that it may engage them in a way that will be helpful in the future. It is also important to add local political party chairmen into the mix of people to know. Although knowing both major political party chairmen is a good idea, it is not a good idea to be too friendly with the chairman of the opposite party.

Door-to-door

A well-run campaign will have a strong door-to-door component. Since this operation will be discussed to a greater extent in a future chapter, it will suffice to say that a great amount of issue information can be gathered as a candidate knocks on the doors of likely voters. If a candidate going door-to-door is a good listener and note-taker, then the campaign will benefit from the information gathered.

It should go without saying that any information gathered should be written down while it is still fresh. A candidate should never be deceptive but should not feel compelled to reveal any intentions that are still private.1.5 Developing the database

One of the most valuable, and essential, assets of a campaign is a good database. Campaigns will have different databases with which it will work in order to target voters, build mailing lists, prospect donors or make phone calls. The campaign database includes information on every person with which the candidate or member of any of the campaign’s team come in contact. The database will include information on each person including name, address, phone number, fax number, e-mail address, dates and amounts of any contributions, where the person might stand on any issues, if the person is a volunteer, if the person wants a yard sign and any other important detail that allows the campaign to make effective use of each person in the database.

First time candidates must begin to build their own databases, and knowing everything possible about each person entered into the database will increase the ability to target each person for effective use as a volunteer, financial donor or information resource. If an incumbent has never created a database, then there is a lot of ground to make up.

Successful means of developing databases is to take the finance reports of other candidates discussed earlier in this chapter, any databases that other officeholders or former candidates may be willing to share, any friends or family of the candidate, and any friends or family of any member of the campaign team and add them all to the database. Each entry in the database should have a flag or field that describes the source of the record.

Once this initial database is created, each unique person in that database should receive a letter from the campaign in the mail. The letter should include a response vehicle, usually an envelope that contains fields for the respondent to fill out, that has the campaign address on it. As individuals respond favorably, they should be flagged in the campaign database indicating their answers, level of support and any other valuable information.

Once the list has been mailed, and ample time has been given for a response, those who did not respond should receive a phone call from the campaign requesting their support. Each time someone comes in contact with the campaign in some way, that person should be added to the campaign database. Anyone who attends a campaign function should be added. As the database develops, the management team should use it to begin executing the campaign plan.

It is important to note that the campaign database is different from the voter database. The campaign database is the listing of the campaign’s human resources – the people that have an interest in the campaign. The voter database is the listing of voters in the jurisdiction of the race. The voter database is the resource that the campaign will use to target and deliver message.1.6 Media contacts

Contact with the media is essential in a successful campaign. In the early phases of a race, the campaign should contact each newspaper, television station and radio station in the area and obtain a press contact at each. This person should be a reporter, assignment editor, news director or someone that in some way has influence on what political stories will be covered. Information for each contact should include name, address, phone, fax and e-mail address. In the early stages of a campaign, whoever calls each media outlet should not feel compelled to reveal the reason for gathering the information. This information is important for when a candidate wishes to make his announce-ment of candidacy. If one reporter gets advanced notice of a potential candidacy, he may “scoop” the other media outlets by reporting it first. If that happens, by the time an official announcement is made, it will be old news and less likely to be covered by the other outlets.

Campaigns should have a single person dedicated to speaking with the media. This person is the gatekeeper for information as well as access to the candidate from the media. The candidate will also work and speak with the media, but the designated media contact on the campaign is important. This person, be it the campaign manager, the press secretary or other designated spokesman, makes certain that the information supplied to the media is complete, accurate and consistent. Someone who does not have all of the information on a campaign and decides to talk to the press may say things that are inconsistent, inaccurate or incomplete to the press. The press contact is also briefed as to what information is appropriate to share. Campaigns would never knowingly supply tactical and strategic information to the opponent, and making sure the press does not transmit such information is critical. Every member of the campaign should understand who the media contact is and that any reporter who approaches anyone on the campaign should be directed to that person.

In relating with the media, it is important for candidates to keep their cards close to their vests. This does not mean one should be secretive, but a reporter is trained to ask questions, and as long as someone is answering, reporters will continue asking. Media should be treated with the same respect that anyone related to the campaign would receive, but knowing when not to reveal too much is as important as having that contact when the campaign needs to release information.1.7 Local Elected Officials and Community Leaders

As the campaign begins to take shape and the information gathering process is in high gear, an important list of contacts every candidate for office should have is a comprehensive list of local elected officials and civic leaders. These are the people that the candidate should begin contacting to gauge their level of interest in the campaign, whether or not they already support an opponent and if they would be willing to support someone.

These leaders are also an excellent source of information. Calling them or meeting with them as a courtesy to their office demonstrates that a candidate is serious about the race. Even if they support an opponent or are neutral in the campaign, they will probably let the people they talk to know that they met with a candidate and then give them their impressions.

The local elections office should be able to provide a full listing of local elected officials. The list should be complete including every level of government including congressmen, state legislators, county commissioners, county elected officials, city council members and mayors, township trustees and school board members, fiscal officers and clerks. If the position is elected, a candidate should know who occupies that seat.

The database of local elected officials should be built without regard to party affiliation – no one should be left out. However, party affiliation should be noted if available.

This chapter probably raised more questions than it answered. It is designed to do that. In order to adequately prepare for a race, a candidate or manager should have a lot of questions. What this chapter does is help guide thoughts so that the right questions are being asked, and the organization can begin taking form. Each subsequent chapter in this book relies on information gathered from the suggestions in this chapter. Laying a strong groundwork now can save immensely later in the campaign.   

# CHAPTER 2

### Building the Team

The campaign team consists of a number of components: the core team, the management team, volunteers, financial supporters, campaign committee, coalitions and endorsing groups and individuals. Another component not discussed at length but requires mentioning is the candidate’s family. The family of the candidate is as important to the campaign as any of the other components. The candidate’s family should be involved in the campaign as far as public appearances. They should be knowledgeable about what is happening on the campaign.

The candidate’s family, including the candidate’s spouse, should NOT be involved in the management of the campaign. Many times a candidate will make the mistake of allowing a spouse to have management control of the campaign. This situation creates an atmosphere in which the core team may not be honest in giving advice as they would with an objective campaign manager. Or this situation could lead to a loss of campaign morale and energy because the spouse is running a show that he or she may have little or no knowledge about. Other times, the family being involved in management decisions can lead to bad decisions being made by someone too emotionally involved with the campaign.

A properly run campaign will integrate family participation. The family is extremely important because a candidate will require the support and input from the family throughout the campaign. Input from the candidate’s family should occur directly with the campaign manager just as any member of the core team or management staff would do. A campaign manager exists in order to mange the campaign, and a spouse or other family member who does not understand the management dynamic can create a situation in which decisions are being made without the knowledge or consent of the professionals. There are instances of campaigns that have won when the candidate’s family is involved in big decisions, but those are rare instances and usually involve campaigns that did not have serious opposition. Do not take a few instances of lucky breaks as an indicator of future success by allowing a spouse, parent or child to run a campaign.2.1 Four commodities of a campaign

Simply put, there are four commodities in a campaign that cannot be replaced. They are finite and must be managed effectively. These commodities are Time, Information, Money and People (TIMP). A proper organization will be able to effectively manage these four components. Whereas the candidate is most effective at raising money, the campaign team should work together to help recruit the people necessary for the campaign. Time is the one commodity that remains fixed, but an effective manager and a well thought-out plan can free up time that otherwise might be tied up in a poorly planned and executed campaign.

Information is a commodity that the campaign can create in its communications and policy initiatives. Information also refers to intelligence from the field. Chapter One was about information. Chapter Two is about people. Future chapters will discuss money and time, but all components must be well coordinated for an effective, winning campaign.2.2 Core Team

The Core Team, also referred to as the “inner circle”, “kitchen cabinet” and other similar names refers to the very close group of supporters, ideally about six people, that act as a focus group for decisions, sound bites, speeches, direct mail or television spots. They help to guide the campaign direction by going to meetings, developing the lists of strengths and weaknesses, identifying issues, tapping their own networks of people for volunteers, putting their name to campaign materials when necessary, acting as surrogate speakers at community events, working with the campaign manager to identify areas needing attention and giving feedback to ideas.

The core team should consist of the candidate, campaign manager and a few friends who have been successful in business, civic associations or running for office themselves. An ideal core team will have a local elected official, a successful member of the business community, and a member of a local board of directors for a charity or foundation. Someone of equal caliber or level of success meets the requirements. The point is to surround oneself with people who are friends that have a personal interest in seeing their friend meet success. These members of the core team also have experienced a level of success in the community as well and have proven that their advice carries weight. Along with their level of success most likely comes a network of people who can help on the campaign either as volunteers or donors or both.

The core team should be kept apprised of all campaign functions. Meetings or conference calls should be scheduled regularly so that everyone can plan to attend. The campaign manager also needs to know that he can approach any member of this team at any time for assistance and vice versa. A good core team can make the difference between winning or losing or having an effective campaign or ineffective campaign.

The core team should never number too great. If too many people have input, then decisions become harder to make. Too many people leads to longer meetings and less activity. The key is to identify the handful of close friends that meet the criteria of success and community involvement and engage them in the race.2.3 Management Team

Depending on the size of the race and the budget, a management team can consist of one person or many people. They may be paid or volunteer, but these will be the people that will make sure that the “trains run on time”, the candidate is scheduled properly, the bills get paid, the campaign stays within budget, goals are met, voters are targeted and message is being delivered effectively.

Campaign Manager

Campaign organizations begin with the Campaign Manager. The campaign manager does just what the title describes. A good campaign manager will develop a strong staff and volunteers that will work together to make everything on the campaign function like clockwork. In smaller campaigns, a good campaign manager can be a student at a local university, a retired worker, a homemaker or someone who has extra time and good organization skills. The larger campaign, the greater the need is for a campaign manager with experience and one that can devote a good amount of time to the campaign.

If hiring a campaign manager full time, it is important to check references on other employers and on campaigns that the prospective manager has worked. The political business is a business that runs on reputation, and the most important qualities a campaign should seek are competence, loyalty, honesty and work ethic. The prospective campaign manager does not have to be the nicest or best looking individual in a group of applicants, but the one hired needs to produce good results and be completely loyal to the candidate.

If a prospective manager has lost races, then it is important to understand what caused the loss. Sometimes factors that a campaign manager could not control are what caused a candidate to lose (candidate baggage, inability to raise needed funds, etc.). Perhaps the prospective manager is willing to take on campaigns that no one thinks can win. It is also important to evaluate if the prospective manager has learned from past losses.

The bottom line when it comes to campaign management is that a candidate should never self-manage the campaign, and a family member can be equally devastating. An exception to this rule would be if a campaign’s manager is a family member, such as a brother, who is skilled. The important component for the candidate and the candidate’s family to understand is that the campaign manager is the person through whom all decisions are made. Input can be given to the campaign manager, but a family relationship between the manager and the rest of the campaign must take a back seat to the concept of making objective decisions. A good manager should be someone who can be objective, has ample time and good organizational skills.

Examples of siblings or other family members running campaigns exist throughout politics. Robert Kennedy ran some of the campaigns of his brother, John. Bay Buchanan managed campaigns of her brother Patrick who had run for President. Family involvement is important, but objective decision making takes precedence.

Other members of the management team for larger campaigns would include political director, communications director, scheduler, treasurer, finance director and volunteer coordinator. In congressional, statewide or large urban races, a policy consultant may join the team.

Political Director

The Political Director (PD) is an important cog in races at the county level or larger depending on the size of the jurisdiction and the diversity of the constituents. The political director’s duties are almost as varied and complex as the campaign manager’s. The PD will work closely with the campaign manager to implement strategy and execute tasks. While directing campaign staff in the execution of events, sign posting, volunteer activities and other coordination, a good director also builds a rapport with important community leaders, allies to the campaign, volunteers and other people with whom the campaign comes in contact. Essentially, the political director can act as the “glue” for a larger organization.

A political director should be able to evaluate how to fit each person touched by the campaign into the team. Does a person at an event become a contributor, volunteer, advisor, or campaign informant on community events and other field intelligence? The political director must evaluate whether a person he meets should take the campaign manager’s time or even the candidate’s time. In a political campaign, one of the most valuable resources the campaign has is time, and directing every person who has contact with the campaign to the candidate is not an effective use of the candidate’s time and distracts the candidate from other tasks such as raising money, attending events and staying on the campaign trail.

The qualities of the political director must include loyalty, diplomacy, tactfulness and initiative. The political director will be the face of the campaign with people when the candidate cannot be there. A political director must be a self-starter who can look at the playing field of the campaign, identify the important groups to meet and ally with and then bring them into the campaign fold. If the political director meets people who will be good volunteers, he should plug them in with the volunteer coordinator. As one of the chief intelligence gatherers in the campaign, the PD keeps a finger on the pulse of the people in the district. People who can give money, or tap the resources of other people, should be directed to the finance director.

Communications Director

The Communications Director is the person responsible for maintaining good relationships with the press and how the campaign image is projected through the web site and other media. The duties of a communications director range from meeting with each member of the media to develop a strong rapport and issuing press releases to working with the web designer and attending events to videotape the candidate and any opponents. Since the communications director works with pushing the image and message of the campaign, this person should work with the campaign manager in order to develop TV scripts, direct mail and other campaign communications. The communications director makes sure that all messages from the campaign are consistent and somehow develop the message of the campaign.

In order to ensure efficient delivery of campaign communications, the communications director should have or quickly develop a comprehensive list of all local media including large newspapers, community newspapers, television stations, radio stations and any other media outlet as well as the AP wire. This list should include a reporter, editor or news director’s name, phone number, fax number and e-mail address. Most media outlets prefer to receive e-mail notifications from campaigns, but it is important to use all means available to push campaign information to the press. An e-mailed press release may get more notice if it is also faxed. Most importantly, the communications director is responsible for making certain that each press contact is called when a release is sent out in order to confirm receipt of the release. This lets the campaign know that the release was received and viewed by the press thereby improving the chances of the item getting “play”.

A communications director works with the other members of the management team to determine the worthiness of an item for a press conference. In addition to the press, a communications director should build relationships with known bloggers or recruit web bloggers themselves. With the advent of the Internet, the way in which people receive information has changed, and an effective campaign will take advantage of all means necessary. Any allied bloggers should also receive press releases. Furthermore, the communications director should also maintain and nurture a campaign e-mail list for regular updates.

The communications director is also responsible for monitoring the news media and recording television news and political ads, clipping papers and recording radio programming or ads pertinent to the campaign. All records from the media should be kept in a well-organized file or cabinet. Electronic records, if possible, are preferable.

Scheduler

The Scheduler works with the campaign manager very closely to manage the candidate’s time. Most candidates for office have jobs or businesses of their own and require time to conduct business. When the candidate is available, the campaign team should be working to gain exposure for the candidate either attending breakfasts or lunches with civic organizations, attending new business openings or ribbon cuttings or going to community festivals, parades and events. When the candidate is not meeting voters, then the scheduler should focus efforts towards fundraising phone calls or attending a campaign event such as a coffee, fundraiser, rally or volunteer appreciation get-together.

An effective scheduler also works closely with the volunteer coordinator to make sure that someone is with the candidate at events or to drive the candidate. The scheduler must also be a pleasant person due to the amount of contact with supporters this person has. From scheduling and confirming events to gathering event information, the scheduler will have as much contact with voters and potential supporters as the candidate.

Finance Director

The Finance Director works directly with the candidate and scheduler to carve out time for raising money. The finance director maintains the donor portion of the campaign database and keeps the candidate disciplined to make calls. The finance director will make follow-up phone calls to potential donors that the candidate contacted and will generally be responsible for retrieving checks or making sure they are mailed in. The finance director will track all pledges and donations as well as the responses of potential donors who have not yet committed to the campaign. The finance director will work with the campaign management team to schedule and execute fundraising events as well as decide who is invited to each event. Each person who comes in contact with the campaign is a potential donor, and the finance director should add those people to the list for the candidate to call.

The finance director will work closely with the campaign treasurer to make certain all reporting requirements are satisfied. In addition, the financed director will assist the treasurer in meeting deadlines for reports. The finance director is the source of much of the information required by the treasurer, and the finance director will also often be the one to deliver donations to the treasurer for deposit.

Volunteer Coordinator

The volunteer coordinator works with the campaign manager, political director and scheduler to determine how to manage volunteers and coordinate their activities. The volunteer coordinator will access the campaign database to recruit workers for the campaign to be with the candidate when out in public. The volunteer coordinator will make sure campaign events are properly staffed with workers, coordinate envelope stuffing for mailings, coordinate phone banks and make sure that volunteers are out representing the campaign at events where the candidate cannot attend. The volunteer coordinator also ensures that campaign workers have the proper wardrobe and campaign materials to hand out if needed. The volunteer coordinator also makes sure volunteers are adequately trained for each assignment, have directions or maps to get to where they are going and are properly taken care of if food or beverage needs arise.

Policy Advisor

For larger campaigns that require the campaign management team to focus on campaign activities and communications, a campaign may enlist the help of a Policy Advisor to assist on issues development, issue research and message development. The policy advisor would work closely with the core team and campaign manager to develop message and determine what issues are strongest for the candidate. As the chief information officer of the campaign, the policy advisor must understand the finer points of issues and be capable of briefing the candidate. The policy advisor will work closely with the communications director on campaign communications.

Treasurer

In all races, without exception, a treasurer is required. The treasurer is often a volunteer, but it is one of the key positions that operate the machinery. The treasurer is responsible for maintaining the campaign account, writing checks, depositing money and filing finance reports. Furthermore, the treasurer reports to the candidate and campaign manager on all activities and keeps them informed of the account balance. The treasurer works with the finance director to properly report in-kind donations, and to make sure that all reportable items are properly reported. Reimbursements go through the treasurer. The treasurer, in short, must become an expert on campaign finance rules, laws and procedures. A bad treasurer can sink a campaign. Since it is a back office function, the treasurer position is a thankless job, and good treasurers are seldom recognized for their efforts.

Candidate’s Family

The saying goes; “blood is thicker than water” meaning a family relationship would trump any other type of relationship such as friendship or business. In a campaign in which the candidate has an interested or active spouse or children of the age that they wish to participate, the campaign manager and candidate must decide early on how the family will be involved. The campaign manager must be the person through whom the members of the family will take direction – not the candidate. If family members are asking for direction and taking it from the candidate, then when they have problems or suggestions about the campaign they will go to the candidate.

By not establishing the chain of command early on, a campaign manager can quickly lose control of a campaign. For instance, an excellent campaign staffer might not work well with the candidate’s spouse. If the spouse works directly with the candidate and not the campaign manager, then the campaign manager might wake up one day missing one of the most important members of the staff and some important information. Conversely, if the campaign manager has to eliminate a weak link from the campaign, but the staffer who is being let go has a friendship with a spouse who does not understand the management dynamic then the campaign manager now has a subordinate who can effectively trump decisions.

Everyone on the campaign must understand and respect the chain of command on the campaign. The candidate and the candidate’s family must respect the decisions made by the campaign manager. If these components do not occur, and the campaign manager does not have control over the management of the campaign, then the likelihood of success is diminished as is the morale of the team and the efficiency of the political machine.2.4 Volunteers

Volunteers are an incredible resource for a campaign. They can create momentum and project an image of strength and support at public events. Volunteers will work tirelessly for candidates they believe in whether it is on the phones, stuffing mail or placing yard signs. The most important thing that a campaign must do with volunteers to make sure they feel useful is engage them on the campaign. Volunteers need jobs to do, or they will lose interest in the campaign.

Volunteers can help out with tasks that the management team may not be able to do. Volunteers can write letters to the editors of papers, proofread campaign communications, recruit other volunteers or perform any number of tasks on a campaign. Many volunteers are even happy to run errands for the campaign, pick up checks from donors or even help keep the campaign office clean. As long as a volunteer knows that he or she is performing a needed task and contributing in some way, then the campaign will keep them on board when tasks become more important. If the volunteer coordinator fails to properly engage a volunteer, thank the volunteer or feed the volunteer when appropriate then it will become easier to lose volunteers than it was to recruit them. In addition, each volunteer should have a small supply of literature to keep in their cars for their friends, family and neighbors along with a campaign t-shirt that they can slip on if the opportunity arises at an event they attend.

Some volunteers have strengths and likes in one area but not in another. If a volunteer does not want to make phone calls but wants to place signs, go door-to-door or attend an event, then that volunteer should be plugged in where they are willing to work. Sometimes a volunteer, once satisfied with doing one or two of the higher profile jobs, will be happy to stuff mail or make phone calls. A volunteer should never be turned away because they have thoughts about where their own strengths are. An effective campaign will eventually be able to train people in areas that the volunteer may have been initially hesitant.

Also, it is important not to burn out volunteers. For campaigns with a small handful of volunteers, they will begin to recognize that they are the only ones showing up at events. This type of overuse can lead to resentment and a loss of a few excellent workers. Good managers always attempt to keep a large group of volunteers ready to work and give them breaks. The more volunteers on the campaign, the fewer burdens each one carries.2.5 Financial Supporters

Some people are unable to give their time to a campaign but are able to give money. A place exists for everyone who wants to be involved in a campaign. Financial supporters make it possible for the campaign to produce television and radio ads or send out direct mail. Financial supporters are important because they appear on the campaign finance report, and every campaign should count on the opponent obtaining a copy of its report. It is important to have a large number of contributors as well as contributors at all levels of giving. A candidate with a small number of high dollar donors may have an issue explaining that those donors do not have undue influence. Likewise, many low-dollar donors can create an impression of mass support.

Some financial supporters will also be on the campaign committee while others may be willing to hold a fundraiser in which they access their own network of friends, associates, coworkers and family. Some people will give $1.00 while others may contribute the maximum amount allowable by law.

“Small dollar” donors on a campaign are just as important as larger donors. Small donors can many times become as powerful on a campaign as large donors when they come out in numbers. Success stories include Howard Dean’s campaign for President in 2004, Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign and Ron Paul’s 2008 campaign. These candidates were able to raise massive amounts of money in a short amount of time from a large volume of small donations. Furthermore, small donations are a sign that a campaign has bedrock support from people who do not regularly give to campaigns. It is more impressive for a campaign to raise $1 million from 10,000 people than a campaign to raise $1 million form 100 people. Campaign plans should incorporate donors of all categories small and large.2.6 Campaign Committee

Not to be confused with the core team or the management team, the campaign committee is a list of influential community leaders who will allow the use of their names as supporters of the campaign. The campaign committee may include members of the core team as well. Chapter One discussed the importance of making contact with local elected officials. It is important to evaluate the appropriateness of each person asked to be on a campaign committee. A good campaign committee will show power in different regions of a jurisdiction as well as individuals from different professions along with any elected officeholders recruited. Having a doctor, esquire, or other professional credentials next to a name enhances the prominence of the campaign committee. All elected officeholders should be referred to as “Honorable”. Their constituents in their area will recognize the name.

The campaign committee will appear on the campaign web site as well as the letterhead. Some direct mail or print advertisement may also use the campaign committee or specific members of the committee. For instance, a campaign may include the mayors of two local towns. When direct mailing voters in Town A, the campaign will use the mayor of Town A but not Town B and vice versa.

A campaign committee is often a “living” body meaning that it can grow over time. Once a committee has been formed, a campaign should utilize it to its greatest advantage. Some may just be willing to allow use of their names and not wish to give support any other way. Others will contribute time, money and effort. Each person has a spot on the campaign if only to allow the use of his or her name.2.7 Coalitions

Coalitions are important to developing a lot of support within a large group with a relatively small amount of effort. Many different groups build coalitions that will work en masse on behalf of a candidate that they believe in. Furthermore, it is important to reach out to coalitions because they want to vote for someone they understand is sympathetic with them or will, at least, listen to them. Unions, Christian conservatives, gun owners, African American organizations are just a few groups that seek out candidates that will work with them. Coalitions become even more responsive to those who proactively seek them out.

Building coalitions can lead to procuring a large amount of volunteers with just a little effort. Building coalitions also instantly increases name recognition within a group and can enhance the momentum of the campaign.

Some coalitions may be undesirable. A campaign would rarely want to work with groups that support the legalization of drugs or promote extreme controversial views. Sometimes it is difficult to decide if a group is a good ally or an undesirable ally based on the subject matter. A pro-abortion candidate may not wish to have the support of pro-abortion groups although they would seem like natural allies. The decision about with whom a campaign builds coalitions should be a carefully considered process. Although a candidate may personally believe one way on a particular issue, the people that candidate seeks to represent may largely disagree. A campaign is under no obligation to broadcast its candidate’s views on issues not pertinent to the office sought. Therefore it is sometimes wise to downplay a personal issue so that other issues rise to the forefront of the campaign.

It is important to identify the various coalitions in an area and determine which ones are most likely to both agree with the positions of the campaign and be desirable allies. Coalition support may even come with an endorsement from a like-minded organization or prominent individual or multiple organizations and prominent leaders. Leaders from coalitions with a campaign should appear on a campaign committee such as the President of a local NAACP if the campaign is aligned with that organization.

Coalitions form around issues such as the environment, pro-life and pro-choice, law enforcement, gay rights, community values and many others. Many groups may exist on each side of an issue, and they may often communicate with each other and join in supporting like-minded candidates thereby forming coalitions.2.8 Endorsements

Many groups endorse in political races. Some groups are part of a coalition being courted by the campaign. For instance, the local Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) that endorses may be part of a law enforcement coalition that includes multiple FOP organizations. Having law enforcement on the side of a campaign is generally desirable. A good campaign plan will include money, time and effort being invested in endorsements, and subsequently, coalition building.

Groups that traditionally endorse include newspapers, local political parties, Right-to-Life, National Rifle Association, unions, Sierra Club, Anti-Tax Political Action Committees (PACs), and other similar organizations.

Political Action Committees are political entities chartered with a local Board of Elections, elections clerk or the Secretary of State’s office. Some Political Action Committees have large memberships and have a significant fundraising capability. Not only can a PAC endorse, it can contribute money to a campaign. For a list of PACs that may be available for solicitation, a campaign should check the local elections office as well as the Secretary of State’s office. Many Secretary of State Offices have the PAC information on the Internet.

Endorsements can be selectively used on campaign literature, web sites and ads. In sending out a pro-law enforcement direct mail piece to voters, an endorsement from the FOP would be good to print on that piece. Consequently, leaving off an endorsement from trial attorneys would be a wise decision. A good campaign will make certain that any organization that endorses its candidate will have the endorsement prominently displayed on its web site. Voters of a local Right to Life organization are much more likely to visit the web site of their organization than the web site of a campaign, so it is important for them to view the endorsement when they view the organization’s site.

Building a strong campaign team will relieve a lot of stress during the campaign. A team that can take initiative, build good relationships, plan ahead and execute plans properly will reduce the amount of “campaign emergencies”. Every campaign that has worthy opposition will encounter situations that require immediate action, but a good team can adapt easily to such challenges.

Everyone has a place in a campaign. Take someone’s help as far as they will allow. If a campaign fails to ask for help, then it likely will not receive it. Campaign team members must feel as though they are contributing, feel appreciated and never go home hungry or thirsty. If volunteers are treated well, it is surprising how effective they can be.

Coalitions and endorsements should be sought in a wise manner. Once a bond with a group or individual is formed, a campaign should exploit it fully. The groups and individuals who do endorse or support candidates wish to be used in a campaign because it promotes their issues as well as their candidates, and it elevates their recognition and status with the general public.

### Message and Strategy3.1 Opposition Research

Many first-time candidates shy away from discussion of “opposition research”. They often feel that it is just another way of saying “digging up dirt on the opponent”. Although that interpretation is one way of looking at opposition research, a well-prepared campaign conducts research that examines opponents through a thorough study of public records. Opposition research may reveal facts that seem unsavory about an opponent, but the goal of opposition research is to know who it is a campaign is running against, how they think, why they do what they do, how they may have voted in the past, what their record of success failure and support is and their fitness for the job. Whether or not a campaign publicly discloses any of the research gathered is a matter of strategy and personal choice. It would be a mistake not to spend a small amount of time to be forearmed.

Various resources are available to begin a thorough research operation. The first thing a candidate should look at is any record of voting that an opponent has. If an opponent is or was a city councilman, township trustee, legislator or held another elected position, a public record exists of his or her decisions. The first step is to contact the clerk or secretary of the body upon which this opponent served. It is most helpful to receive information in electronic format whenever possible. If a list of votes for a candidate can be produced in a word processing document or spreadsheet document, it becomes easier to search for key words, sort by date or sort by other criteria.

Once a complete record of the decisions made by an opponent has been compiled, highlighting controversial votes on issues, issues in which taxes or fees were raised and issues in which the opponent may have had special approval for travel expenses to distant locations or any other expenses which may have been reimbursed or granted is important. Careful accounting of an opponent’s attendance should be noted. Some candidates have lost their elections because they took many trips out of state for “seminars” or “development” with little or nothing to show for it. Other incumbents have lost their elected positions because they failed to appear at many of their scheduled meetings. Voters, most of whom are employed, can easily become offended if their hard-earned money is being spent on what they perceive as personal junkets or if the person they hired in the last election fails to make it to work regularly.

Once key legislation or controversial issues are identified, a list of the dates of those issues should be made. This list can be taken to a local library that has microfilmed copies of the local newspaper or news source that may have covered the decisions. A search of the dates of the decisions in question as well as the issues of the newspaper a few days leading up to the decision as well as a few days after may reveal damaging headlines or stories. When high profile issues arise, media hype tends to begin before the meeting in which the decision is made, and it will last a few days after. A check of the opinion pages for editorials about decisions an opponent may have made as well as letters to the editor about the opponent may produce usable material. A printout of all pertinent articles should be made with notations detailing where they were printed and the date of the publication. These headlines and quotes will become useful in future campaign communications should the campaign feel it necessary to hold its opponent accountable.

Other information a campaign should seek includes any criminal history available in public record format. A quick search of the local clerk of courts records can reveal any past indiscretions, altercations, liens, bad business ventures or anything that may be filed in the courts in the area. A point should be made to check court records in surrounding jurisdictions and areas in which an opponent has business dealings. Bankruptcy information may be found in a federal court, but there should be indications of that bankruptcy beginning in lower courts because creditors will often file actions or liens against bad debts before the creditor pursues bankruptcy. Voters have a difficult time putting someone in charge of their tax dollars that has demonstrated a failure in their own lives to manage their own finances.

Candidates who are not felons but continually accumulate speeding or traffic tickets generally make easy targets. A quick request for information from the local police station for records relating to an opponent might yield some surprising results.

Searching for property records of an opponent through the local auditor, recorder or clerk’s office will help in the opposition research phase. By searching property records, one may be able to determine if an opponent has received a personal benefit by holding a position or stands to receive a personal benefit if elected. By regularly checking mortgage records filed with the proper authority, a campaign may be able to determine if an opponent has decided to leverage some of his or her assets in order to wage their campaign. It is important to find out where an opponent owns property, with whom they may own that property and how much property is owned.

Another easy but essential piece of information is a voter history of any opponent. A quick trip to the Board of Elections or clerk will yield a history of voting frequency, if this opponent votes Republican or Democrat and how consistent the opponent is or if elections are frequently missed. A voter history will also have your opponent’s voting address, and a campaign should verify that the opponent actually lives at that address. Some voters have been known to register at an address where they do not live in order to maintain eligibility to run in an election.

If the opponent currently holds an elected office, he or she may be required to file an ethics report or a disclosure form of some sort that will list assets, gifts, investments, sources of income and business relationships. It is important to request this disclosure from the proper authority and check it against information gathered from other research.

Human intelligence can be just as valuable as the public record documents detailed in this section. Human intelligence means talking with people who know the opponent. Conversations with past acquaintances, business associates, school friends and even family members can provide insight into the opponent and of possible shortcomings. It is important to weigh the value and validity of each person with whom the campaign speaks. Some people will be more credible than others, and some informants may try to provide a campaign with misleading information or red herrings. Good notes are important, but all human intelligence must be verified.

With the availability of information on the Internet, one of the quickest and easiest means of gathering information on a person is by conducting some searches on the World Wide Web. Internet searches can yield information about positions an opponent may have taken on issues in the past, undesirable organizations that may have endorsed or any number of details about an opponent that may eventually be useful. A thorough search should be conducted by someone who has extensive knowledge of finding information on the Internet.

An opposition research checklist is provided at the end of this chapter to assist in the gathering of information. Once opposition research is finished, or as new information is added, a campaign should go back to the “strengths vs. weaknesses” charts created in Chapter 1 in order to make all information current. Good opposition research will yield both strengths and weaknesses of an opponent.

One resource may also include seeking out organizations opposed to a specific candidate. If an organization or PAC is opposed to a candidate, it may be because they have gathered their own information that they are willing to share. It costs nothing to ask for such information, and the results could be fruitful.

A campaign should include thorough research on its own candidate as well. While conducting opposition research, a campaign should perform the same tasks to research its own candidate. Conducting research on one’s own candidate will most likely yield information that any opponent will also accumulate. It is extremely important to understand the information an opponent will have to use in the campaign.3.2 Determining the Message

The most important part of an effective political campaign is developing a message that is both relevant and will resonate with voters. Based on the information gathered in Chapter One, the campaign’s core team should be able to form the message.

Chapter One discussed the gathering of issue information. Part of this information gathering requires understanding the mood of the electorate. If the people who are voting are generally positive and upbeat about how things are going, then the message will be different if voters feel that government is on the wrong track. Determining the issues foremost on the voters’ minds will also determine the direction a campaign’s message will take.

Once the campaign has completed the information gathering in Chapter One, built the team as described in Chapter 2 and conducted the important opposition research in the first section of this chapter, there will be enough information to begin formulating the theme and message for a campaign.

The overall message of a campaign is determined by four factors:

1. Issues important to voters
2. Priorities of the voters (an issue may be important to a voter, but a campaign must evaluate the priority of that issue among voters)
3. Strengths of the candidate
4. Weaknesses of the opponent

The campaign team should evaluate the issues important in a race and determine which ones are most important to voters thereby prioritizing the issues. For instance, being pro-life may be very important to voters in a certain district, but if their concern is currently focused on economic problems, then the “life” issue may not be one upon which they make their decision. Once the strongest issues have been prioritized, the campaign team must evaluate the issues in which the candidate has strengths. Once the list is narrowed to the issues people care about and the candidate is strong, they should then be compared to the opponent’s weaknesses.

A campaign that follows this process will usually find only one or two issues that are important to the voters in which the candidate is strong and the opponent is weak. A smart campaign will also reverse the process from the opponent’s point of view to find the issues important to voters in which the opponent is strong and the candidate is weak. Knowing the issues that the opponent must emphasize is as important as understanding the issues one’s own candidate must use.

The way in which a campaign uses its message will depend upon the type of campaign. Whether the race is a reelection campaign, challenging campaign to a current incumbent, a field race in which more than one candidate will be elected or an open seat in which the current officeholder is not seeking reelection, the campaign will use its message information differently. Different scenarios require different approaches to the message.

An incumbent facing reelection

If a campaign is one of incumbency, then it should reflect any successes in office. A common theme for incumbents who had specific benchmarks from their campaigns that they met is “Promises Made. Promises Kept.” It is also important to know where an opponent will try to attack in terms of issues. If the opponent uses the theme of “Failure in Office”, then the incumbent’s theme needs to counter that sentiment. “Experience That Matters”, “Working For Us” or “Leadership That Works” are also common themes for incumbent campaigns. A general campaign theme of “Keep Jane Smith Working for Us” works well if voters have a generally positive mood about the leadership. If an office has won awards and the candidate is running for reelection as mayor, the theme “Jane Smith – Your Award Winning Mayor” will help the rest of the message resonate.

Cases in which the electorate is unhappy or feels the government is on the wrong track, the campaign should work directly with the issues on the forefront of people’s thoughts. If crime is the biggest issue, a message that reflects a tough record on crime would help serve the campaign. An ill prepared campaign for an incumbent will allow itself to be constantly on the defensive. Knowing the issues people care about and knowing one’s own strengths and initiatives in those areas ahead of time will allow a campaign to promote a winning message before a challenger has a chance to define where the incumbent is on the issues.

This is where the lists of strengths and weaknesses discussed in Chapter One become important. By promoting strengths and knowing the weaknesses an opponent may attack, a campaign will be prepared to talk about strengths and a successful record before the attacks begin. Knowing an opponent’s weaknesses will allow the campaign to respond with a message of “John Doe wants to attack Jane Smith on crime, but Jane Smith has been working to make our streets and families safer while John Doe has a poor record of his own when it comes to the law.” Then the campaign lists the successes of Jane Smith’s administration.

When the campaign is one of incumbency:

> - Play to strengths

> - Know the opponent’s weaknesses

> - Know the issues voters care about

> - Tailor the message to fit the incumbent’s strengths into the issues voters care about

It is also important to know which areas of the jurisdiction have different demographics. For instance, some areas may have lower income residents, higher priced homes, seniors, young families or empty nesters. Knowing each area and being able to tailor a message that fits and appeals to each can be more effective than using a general blanket message. It is important not to contradict oneself among various areas in a jurisdiction.

Once a campaign has a message that voters are listening to and like, it is important to repeat it often. Tactics on grassroots and media, which allow the campaign to broadcast the message, are discussed in later chapters.

Challenger of an incumbent up for reelection

Based on the opposition research conducted in the first part of this chapter as well as the general background information gathered during Chapter One, building a case against the incumbent becomes the task. Voters generally need a reason if they are going to vote against an incumbent. If there is no apparent reason to vote against the incumbent, then it is the job of a challenger’s campaign to educate the electorate as to why the incumbent does not deserve reelection.

Common themes in the challenger campaign include some variation of “It’s time for a change”. As a general rule, the “time for a change” theme does not resonate unless the reason or reasons for change become apparent. Voters will not elect a change for change’s sake. Therefore it is important to study the top issues foremost on the minds of the voters and cross-reference those against the list of the opponent’s weaknesses. Regardless of the issues that are foremost on voters minds, if an opponent has done something dishonest or illegal in office, those points of weakness should be used. Using the transgressions of an opponent to go on the attack is more effective if the challenger campaign can present itself as the better alternative. General dissatisfaction with an opponent among the electorate is not necessarily enough to win an election.

One of multiple spots in a field race

In a race for city council in which the top four vote getters win a seat, or a township trustee race in which the top two candidates wins a seat, the goal now becomes one of getting more attention than the other campaigns. Some people find this job easier while others find it difficult. For instance, it can be difficult to set a candidate apart when the top issue among the electorate is taxes, and everyone has the same anti-tax message. A field race can easily become a political shouting match in which each candidate is trying to be the loudest one in the crowd.

If a candidate is in a race in which everyone is trying to “out conservative” the others or “out patriot” the others, it is wise to find a way to make that work. Making a candidate out to be the sensible choice, the consensus builder or the only one with a plan can make the difference in a shouting match. “Jane Smith, the consensus builder with a plan” can become a theme that separates a winning campaign from everyone else.

Open seat in which the incumbent is not running

A race in which there is a single open seat can be similar to the field race if multiple candidates are seeking the position. However, if only one opponent is seeking that position, then the race for an open seat is a heads-up match with similar characteristics of a challenger campaign.

Perhaps the opponent is someone who is the hand-picked successor of the former officeholder. If that is the case, then the issues of the predecessor may become the issues of the campaign. A candidate would not wish to be the hand-picked successor if the officeholder doing the picking is seen as unpopular, dishonest or unfavorable.

An advantage in winning in an open seat race without an incumbent is to be able to define the issues and the candidates in the race before anyone else does. That is not to say that the first person who announces for a seat is effective in defining the issues or candidates. For instance, a candidate might voice an intention to run for a seat four or six years before the current officeholder is term-limited, thereby making the candidate a presumptive successor. However, if that candidate who hastily announced early on is not able to begin doing the preliminary worked discussed in the first three chapters of this text, then the campaign may easily be overtaken by an newcomer to the race who is more successful in delivering an effective message to the voters. Being first is not the same as being effective.

In a field race in which one seat is available, a candidate cannot be satisfied with being one of the top vote getters – being number one is the only option. Multiple candidates for a single office create a situation in which unlikely candidates can win a campaign. Open seats with multiple candidates seeking that seat require aggressive grassroots campaigns or “ground wars” in addition to the traditional message delivery. A field race also forces a campaign to pay more attention to securing coalitions and endorsements earlier than usual.

A winning campaign in a field race will determine its message on a number of factors including geography, the purpose of other candidates seeking the post, the messages being delivered by the other candidates and the particular strengths and weaknesses of the opponents.

An example of a tough race for Congress occurred in 2005. A Congressman left his position mid term in order to take another position. A special election occurred which allowed for approximately 6 weeks of campaigning. Eleven candidates filed to run for the vacated post. The person who ended up winning was a candidate who many presumed had no chance. Three of the presumptive front-runners campaigned extremely hard and constantly maligned each other while the candidate who won ran an aggressive grassroots campaign and did not engage in campaigning “against” any of the other candidates. In the end, the three candidates who spent most of the money in the special election had driven each other’s popularity down to the point that the candidate who had stayed out of the fray and stuck to message and a strong ground war narrowly won by less than 1,000 votes.

The challenge that campaigns face is finding the right message, the right tactics and identifying the right people to target. The effective campaign is able to use the four resources of time, information, money and people (TIMP) to make it all work. The four types of campaigns described above build their messages in different ways, and sometimes a campaign can actually benefit by the presence of other campaigns in the same race. The fundamental need to determine the right message, however, does not change even when the approach to the campaign does.3.3 Defining the Issues

Much has been said to this point about gathering information, conducting research and defining strengths and weaknesses. Once a campaign gathers its information and defines the type of race it has and how many opponents it will have, and its blanket message (“time for change”, “your award winning incumbent” etc.) it is time to define the issues.

Defining issues is different from identifying issues. A campaign defines an issue in a campaign once it identifies the issue that it must define. Identifying issues occurred during the information gathering and message building processes of the campaign. By the time a campaign is ready to define an issue, it should have an abundance of information at its fingertips. The art of defining the issue is explaining to voters why it is important, how the campaign addresses it and how the opponent does not in either a 2-sided direct mail piece or 30 second television spot.

If high taxes are the issue in a race, and the incumbent has a record of either raising taxes or doing nothing to lower them, then the campaign message for Challenger Bob Smith can easily become “Smith – Because taxes are too high.” The campaign should have numerous opportunities through press releases, press conferences campaign rallies and other means to point out why taxes are too high, how they can be lowered, what Bob Smith will do to correct it and where the incumbent failed. Furthermore, the campaign will be able to define why taxes are too high in its direct mail, telephone, door-to-door or television advertising. Regardless of what the message is, a campaign must take certain steps to define the message:

- Present the message in a way voters understand (keep it simple)
- Appeal to the hearts of voters first and grab their attention
- Back up initial emotional appeals with evidence
- Tell a story of how the opponent fails to address issue
- Explain how the candidate is the answer to the problem

Because of all of the elements and steps involved in defining the message, a well run campaign will not introduce too many issues into a campaign. One or two good issues are enough. Some campaigns feel it might be a good idea to constantly introduce new issues in a campaign or that the opponent has so many weaknesses that all of them should come out. A campaign that engages in such a “shot gun” strategy, trying to hit the target with as many little jabs as possible, may not be able to accomplish victory as smoothly, easily or inexpensively as a “sniper” strategy that calculates how it will define its one or two messages.

Expense is also another concern. With each issue that a campaign wishes to address, it has to spend money to educate the voters. If a campaign budget is $20,000, it does not make sense to communicate six different messages when one or two will do. If voters are not swayed by the two key issues in a campaign, introducing a handful of new ones will only serve to confuse them. In order for a message to resonate, it must be repeated, not obfuscated by other issues.

A campaign message of “Because taxes are too high” can become increasingly effective, as well as repeated, if the opponent has a record of voting for increases, misusing money, overseeing failed projects or poor attendance at meetings. The single message of high taxes is repeated every time the campaign issues a new TV spot, direct mail piece, press release, e-mail or phone message. If the opponent has raised taxes, the campaign can issue material talking about how high taxes are while the opponent raised them. If the opponent also oversaw failed projects, then the next message issued by the campaign repeats the high tax message by describing how taxes remain high while the opponent fails to complete projects or stay within budget. Each successive repeat of the issue can have different information backing it up, but the theme must be a common thread through the campaign.

Effectively defining a message requires the issue to resonate with voters, be easily understandable and consistent through the campaign.3.4 Targeting

Chapter One discussed obtaining both a voter registration database with voter history as well as election results from previous campaigns. This section will explore various methods of targeting individual voters as well as targeting precincts, wards and other jurisdictions. Targeting refers to how the campaign chooses who specifically will receive campaign communications.

Targeting Individuals

Effective campaigning relies heavily on the ability of a campaign to target to likely voters and to deliver a message that will resonate with each targeted voter. By using the voter database, a campaign manager can begin the process of eliminating those voters not likely to vote in the election. The purpose of targeting individuals is to maximize the effectiveness of each dollar spent on the campaign. By eliminating those registered voters that are unlikely to vote because of an inconsistent voting history, a history in which they only vote in presidential elections or other determination, a campaign can more effectively deliver messages to those likely to vote. Also, by eliminating die-hard members of a rival party, a campaign can further target directly to voters who are more likely to be receptive to the message.

When looking at a voter database, the first people it is wise to eliminate are inactive voters – voters who have not voted in four years or more. These voters may have moved, died or decided not to vote or are unable to vote. By spending money on voters who are inactive, a campaign takes money away from the pot that can be effectively used on active voters more likely to participate in the election.

In any race, the database should eliminate all voters outside the jurisdiction of the office being sought. For instance, an elections office may provide a database for the entire county, but the race is for city council. All voters that cannot participate in the election should be eliminated from the database. Although this suggestion seems like an obvious move, there have been races in which a campaign relied on someone else’s database for their targeted list, and a significant amount of mail and phone calls were delivered to voters outside the district. A campaign should always rely on its own information because it controls every aspect of the database and knows that it came directly from the source. Relying on someone else’s targeted list is a gamble and always runs the chance of being outdated.

A list can further be targeted by eliminating multiple voters in a single household. By sending a direct mail piece to a family in a single household, a campaign eliminates unnecessary duplication. Some candidates with larger budgets will send literature to every voter in a household because they feel it will have a greater impact. They may be right, but when a campaign is on a budget, sending a single piece of literature to a household is nearly as effective as mailing individually to everyone at the address, and it will save significantly.

If a budget forces a campaign into a situation where it is required to target only those with a high likelihood of voting, then the campaign should eliminate everyone who has not voted consistently in a similar election. For instance, a candidate may be running for city council in an off-year election. By eliminating all voters who have never voted in an off-year election, then the campaign has eliminated a significant amount of voters who have never shown interest in a city council race.

Once the campaign has narrowed its database as much as comfort allows, another method of further targeting is to identify as many of the remaining voters as possible. The least expensive way of voter identification is to call each of those voters with a survey of questions very similar to the one discussed in Chapter 2 in the section “Developing the Database”. These questions can be used to determine which voters are planning on voting, which ones have made a decision already in the race and which voters will be receptive to which messages. This method of targeting is referred to as “microtargeting”. It can be a very effective means for candidates to get the most out of each dollar spent on the campaign.

For voters who did not have published phone numbers or did not respond to the telephone survey, a direct mail survey can be sent to them in order to help microtarget the remainder of the list. The process of microtargeting can yield potential donors and volunteers as well.

Targeting Precincts, Wards and Other Jurisdictions

When looking at a database, it is sometimes important to target only specific geographic areas. For instance, perhaps a candidate is challenging a township trustee who voted to put a strip mall near a specific neighborhood. Perhaps this idea was an unpopular decision among the residents in precincts surrounding the new shopping center but popular with precincts in the same township that are not as near the strip mall. A campaign may wish to send a specific mailer reminding the residents near the shopping center of the opponent’s vote while excluding residents with whom the shopping center is popular. In order to do that, a campaign will specifically target the precincts near the shopping center for this mailing.

Targeting specific jurisdictions is important in larger races because each local area faces different issues. There may also be some precincts that have very low voter turnout based on results of past campaigns, and a campaign may wish to remove those precincts. The voter database from the elections office should also signify in what precinct a voter lives as well as the state legislative district, congressional district, judicial district and school district.

Another reason to target precincts is to have the candidate in a race go door-to-door in the precincts of the highest turnout. If the size of the race or time availability of a candidate does not allow for door-to-door in every precinct, then targeting should occur for the precincts with the highest turnout. In addition, precincts that historically leaned heavily towards candidates with similar values or message as one’s own campaign should be targeted precincts. Such precincts may be more likely to be “low hanging fruit” in terms of support, yard sign locations and volunteers.

As the campaign conducts literature drops, or lit drops, towards the end of the election, precincts that are “swing” precincts should be targeted. Swing precincts are precincts in which voters will sometimes vote one way and sometimes vote another. For instance, a swing precinct is a precinct in which both Republicans and Democrats have the ability to do well or a tax levy that fails on one ballot might pass on another. Finding swing precincts can be done by comparing election results for local candidates and statewide or national candidates for an election or over the course of multiple elections.

Simply put, swing precincts represent areas that can be swayed one way or another based on the aggressiveness and message of a campaign.

If a candidate is against a highly unpopular school tax levy, it may be wise to target voters by school district and deliver the campaign’s message regarding the levy only to them. This same concept can be applied to any number of political subdivisions if appropriate.

Targeting is a means to maximize message delivery to likely voters. A campaign can easily save money and time resources by using information resources effectively. Voters that can be identified as less likely to vote or less likely to support a candidate can be eliminated thereby making it more possible to focus on votes a candidate can obtain.3.5 Testing the Message

There are different methods to test messages with voters. A campaign will generally want to test its message with a smaller audience before fully investing in the message. Different means of testing a message may include telephone surveys, focus groups, direct mail or any other method that will yield feedback from a representative group of people. A campaign is seeking messages that “move” voters, which means a voter once hearing a message will move from an opponent’s camp to becoming undecided or from undecided into a candidate’s camp.

If a campaign has not yet conducted an initial poll, or baseline poll, to gauge the race, working the message into the poll would be a good expenditure. By giving voters a message and asking “would you be more likely or less likely to vote for Jane Smith…” then it can measure their responses. A poll is a good method by which one can test any messages against an opponent.

A focus group is a small gathering of different people who will listen to a message or read about a message and provide feedback. It is important to do this without prompting them with what a campaign wishes to hear. Typically, a campaign would want a third party to conduct this type of focus group. The questions asked of focus groups ask them how they feel about certain messages and gauge their reaction to the messages. Understanding what a representative sample of voters likes and dislikes about a message helps the campaign to craft an even stronger, more resonate message.3.6 Building Name Identification and “Favorability”

In addition to crafting a message that works, a candidate must be seen and heard. In order to have confidence in voting for a candidate, voters need to know and have trust in the candidate. Future chapters will discuss manners in which to increase name recognition or name identification. A candidate must understand that in order for a message to have the maximum effect, voters need to know the person from whom it is coming. Throughout the campaign, a campaign manager will need to place primary importance on the candidate’s exposure to voters through any means necessary prior to spending the bulk of the budget on communicating the message.

Along with name identification is how voters perceive a candidate, or popularity. A campaign is generally difficult when a new candidate comes out of nowhere with a negative message. Negative messages drive the favorable rating of the opponent down, but they also have a detrimental effect on the person delivering the negative message. Therefore, a well-planned campaign will begin with a positive introduction prior to leveling attacks at the opponent.

Crafting the right message that meets a candidate’s principles and resonates with voters is a complex process. Smaller campaigns generally wage campaigns with an untested message that may or may not be well thought out. There are ways for even small campaigns or campaigns on a budget to craft a solid message and test it before investing an entire budget into it. By taking the steps outlined in these first three chapters, a campaign will move on towards the planning stages confident that it has a good campaign message that will not only be heard but be influential.

### Opposition Research Checklist

The following list is not a comprehensive list of items that a campaign can look for, but it is a listing of the most common sources that tend to yield important information. It is important for a campaign to conduct the same research on its own candidate that it conducts on it’s opponent.

|   |   |   |

### The Campaign Plan4.1 Budgeting

The most important aspect of formulating a budget is to prioritize where the campaign’s dollars are going to go. Figuring out where the campaign will get the largest return on its investment requires discipline. Return is measured by votes and not money. Candidates for office often spend far more money to seek an office than the office salary pays. Political campaigns are not about seeing how little a campaign can spend. A candidate trying to relate a campaign budget to how much an elected job pays is not viewing the campaign from an objective point of view.

A campaign budget should never rely on the potential future earnings of an elected office. The campaign budget relies on how much money a campaign can raise and how much a candidate is willing to contribute to win an election - nothing more. A campaign is completely irrespective of the office being sought as far as expenses are concerned. If a candidate is counting on a win in order to finance the campaign, then the likelihood that rational budget decisions will be made is reduced. A campaign is separate from an elected office.

Future sections discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each type of message delivery a campaign can use. In formulating a budget, a campaign must answer the following questions:

- How much is needed to run an effective media campaign?
- How much can the campaign raise from donors?
- How much is the candidate willing to contribute?

Once a campaign has an idea about how much it will be able to spend on the campaign, it must prioritize. If the campaign cannot raise much money, and the candidate is not willing to contribute much to the campaign, then efforts will primarily be focused on grassroots. If the campaign will have more money to spend beyond a grassroots effort, then a media campaign or “air war” can be discussed. Most aspects of an air war also have a production cost associated in addition to air time or postage. Components of an air war can include television, radio, telemarketing, direct mail and the Internet. Components of a ground war include signs, handbills, t-shirts and volunteer needs.

A campaign will generally budget starting from the ground and working up. This means that the components of the ground war should be quantified in the budget first. The money costs associated with a spirited grassroots campaign are far less than an air war, but the human resources needed to be effective are far greater. Once the ground war has been budgeted, the campaign now focuses attention on remaining money for the air war.

For smaller campaigns, an air war will consist primarily of direct mail. A smaller campaign such as a township or municipal election generally does not require the wide appeal and reach of television. Multiple targeted direct mail pieces can be delivered to select households in order to communicate the campaign message. Many campaigns of this size will place the remainder of their budgets, after accounting for a ground war, into direct mail.

For larger budgets, an air war can expand to telephones, radio and into television. Factors that should be considered before placing money in these mediums include how much saturation can be attained, if the message will be diluted by media from other races and if the opponent will be using a certain medium.

Each item in the budget requires its own line:

1. Yard signs
2. Road signs
3. T-shirts
4. Handbills
5. Web site
6. Direct mail
7. Design for direct mail
8. Telephone marketing
9. Radio time
10. Radio production
11. Television time
12. Television production

Some campaigns will have more line items and others will have less. All costs associated with a campaign should be placed in the budget so that the management team can get a good snapshot of the race.4.2 Tactics

There are numerous methods of message delivery in a campaign. Some are more effective than others. Once a campaign knows how much it will have to spend, and it has an idea of how much it will spend in each area. This chapter touches the surface of the various tactics involved in a campaign in order to provide an idea of how to prioritize the tactics on the budget. Chapters seven and eight will discuss how to utilize these tactics in greater detail.

Trinkets

Candidates will often want to spend money on trinkets to give out at festivals and parades. Trinkets include cups, nail files, fans, water bottles, rulers, change purses, pencils and any number of items that will most likely be thrown away and serve no purpose for the candidate. Trinkets cannot vote, and they seldom raise candidate awareness. They appeal to candidates because they are tangible items with the candidate’s name, and the candidate feels as though something is being accomplished as these trinkets are distributed. Unfortunately for people who think this way, nothing could be further from the truth.

The important thing to remember about campaigns is that they are marketing campaigns, and producing items that will be thrown away or sit in a drawer somewhere for months after an election are not wise investments. Vendors that peddle trinkets are usually very persuasive and create a sense of urgency in a candidate to make a purchase of trinkets immediately. Trinket peddlers also produce a large volume of junk that has a very low unit price. They use every trick in the book to fool inexperienced campaigns into buying things they do not need.

Campaign budgets should focus on expenditures that help raise candidate name recognition and deliver the campaign message. Advertising such as direct mail, television, radio and road signs can contribute to the overall success of the campaign. In order to win, candidates must be seen and heard, and trinkets are ineffective.

Signs

In campaigns that require name identification and awareness, signs will be necessary. Prices vary based on quantity and size of signs. If the campaign is for a city council race of a small town, a campaign may want to budget for only 500 small signs whereas countywide or Congressional races will have larger sign budgets. Some media vendors want campaigns to avoid signs so that more money can be spent on media. Signs are an important, cost effective means of raising name identification of a candidate, and the signs are sustainable through a campaign. People will pass them many times and gain awareness over time of the candidate’s campaign. Signs are not, however, effective in message delivery, and for this reason are frowned upon by some media consultants.

There are many different varieties of signs, and size does matter in a sign campaign. A campaign can invest $30 and produce a large 4’ x 8’ sign that has high visibility from far away. For the same price, a campaign may also be able to produce 20 small yard signs that are not very visible until a driver or pedestrian is right on top of the sign. The goal in a sign campaign is to be seen. Campaigns should consider spending money on large signs in high traffic areas moreso than small signs in low traffic areas. Small signs are good for neighborhoods, but larger signs are excellent for thoroughfares.

Handbills

In an aggressive door-to-door campaign, handbills are essential in communicating who the candidate is and the reasons for running for office. The quantity of handbills that should be budgeted is based on the number of houses that the candidate will visit and leave the literature, how many pieces will be needed for literature drops and how many pieces are needed for community events and civic meetings. Also, handbills are good for distribution at the polls on Election Day.

T-shirts

T-shirts are helpful for volunteers to wear as mobile billboards at community events and meetings. When going door-to-door, volunteers should also be wearing campaign t-shirts. The cost on shirts should be kept low, but the campaign should have enough for all volunteers. Also, volunteers working polling locations on behalf of a candidate should wear campaign t-shirts. The budget should include enough t-shirts for all activities that require them.

Television

Some races make it impractical for a campaign to purchase television time. Television has production costs. Also, the message on television must be repeated many times across many hours over many days in order to have an impact on the voters a candidate is attempting to reach. Unless a candidate is able to saturate the airwaves effectively with a message, it may be better to focus on less expensive message delivery tools such as direct mail, telephones or even radio.

If a campaign has enough for television, the amount budgeted will be dependent upon whether the campaign is purchasing broadcast network affiliate time or specific cable channels. The duration of the spot is also a consideration. Some spots can be fifteen seconds long while most are thirty seconds long. Also, the longevity of the spot is a consideration. The dates over which the spot will play will factor into how much is spent on television.

Unless a significant dollar amount can be spent on television, this medium should not be considered. Other air war activities such as telephones or direct mail may be more appropriate expenditures for a small dollar amount.

Direct Mail

Direct mail is probably the most effective means of communicating a campaign message. Whereas television reaches a broad audience that includes voters and non voters, direct mail allows a campaign to target a specific voter. Through direct mail, a campaign can speak directly to any voter it targets with a tailored message. And direct mail is generally less expensive than other media, so multiple messages can be delivered to a specific voter over time, and the likelihood is high that the targeted voter will see most, if not all, of the direct mail messages. Campaigns of any size will invest a large portion of its budget into direct mail. In small campaigns, the remainder of the budget after the ground war is budgeted is placed in direct mail.

Telemarketing

Telephone messages can be effective, but they also can be ineffective. Too many phone messages left on voicemail can seem intrusive, so in budgeting, it is wise not to spend a large portion of a budget on telemarketing. The advantage to phones is that they are so inexpensive, and specific households can be targeted by phone.

In prioritizing the budget, begin with the ground war and work up to the air war. Signs and handbills are important for candidate recognition and door-to-door message delivery. Direct mail is extremely effective in the air war followed by telemarketing, radio and television. Each expenditure in a budget requires its own line item. A budget can only include expenditures for how much it knows it will have to spend.4.3 Building the Timeline

The timeline is the part of the campaign plan that describes when tactics will be implemented on the campaign. It is wise to begin the timeline at Election Day and work backwards. The reason a campaign builds a timeline in reverse is that most money is spent in the last week or two of a campaign. If a campaign were to work a timeline from six months out from election day and try to distribute where money is spent during those six months, it is likely that the campaign will have little to no money left by the time the campaign heats up in the final two weeks.

Therefore, a campaign must exercise discipline in wisely timing message delivery. Once a timeline is set, every effort should be made to stick to the plan. Of course, a campaign plan is a living document and subject to frequent corrections, but the general timeline should not need much change.

The bulk of electronic media, radio and television, will play during the final week of the campaign. For campaigns with larger budgets, electronic media may begin as early as two weeks out from Election Day and build in frequency until the day before the election. It is generally considered wasteful to spend too much money on media after early morning on Election Day although some campaigns feel that they still reach viewers and listeners after those hours. In most campaigns, the media purchase is heaviest on the day before an election as well as the weekend leading up to the election.

Direct mail should be targeted to land 2-3 days after it is mailed at the post office. Because direct mail is usually sent as bulk mail, it is important to allow those extra days for delivery whereas first class is more dependable in being delivered the day following its mailing. The final piece should be scheduled to land the Saturday before Election Day. If the campaign has multiple mail pieces, they should be sent approximately three to four days apart from each other so that they do not get delivered at the same time. Therefore, a campaign timeline should include both the mailing date of direct mail as well as the anticipated delivery date of that mail.

Telemarketing is very important in that it is more effective the closer to the election that it is used. Unfortunately, it loses its effectiveness if multiple candidates are utilizing it. A campaign will generally schedule a telephone message to be delivered the day before the election as well as one to two messages the week prior to the election. Multiple calls should never be made on the same day. It is not wise to exceed three or four telephone calls on a campaign.

Handbills are needed for poll workers on the day of the election, and the campaign should order enough for the poll workers it will have. Working backwards from Election Day, the campaign will also plan to distribute handbills through literature drops to doorsteps. The candidate should personally walk targeted precincts throughout the campaign with the most important precincts being walked the weeks leading up to the campaign. More handbills will be used at community events and civic meetings. The campaign should decide in advance how much total printed material will be used for these grassroots activities and order at one time. A single order of handbills will be more cost effective than multiple orders. Of course, if the content on the literature changes, then the campaign will need to reorder new handbills.

Although poll workers are only used on Election Day, the planning, recruitment and training must begin sooner than that. A campaign timeline should reflect when these activities begin so that the campaign manager can follow up with the assigned person to see how much progress has been made. A campaign must arrange what materials poll workers will use. Once a campaign determines that poll workers will use signs, literature or other materials, it must distribute these materials to the poll workers and provide adequate training so that each voter is greeted or contacted by the poll worker in the manner that the campaign wishes. Each component of handling this operation must be added to the timeline.

Almost every jurisdiction allows for absentee or mail voting beginning roughly a month out from the campaign. The handling of absentees and how to court absentee and mail voters will be dealt with in a later chapter, but the campaign timeline should reflect each day that absentee and mail ballots are being sent out from the elections office.

Community events are usually fixed dates that are not subject to campaign needs. Therefore, any community event in which the campaign plans on participating should be placed on the timeline so that campaign rallies, fundraisers and other events can be scheduled around them. During the final weeks of the campaign, the highest profile events should be targeted over lesser profile events. Grassroots efforts begin to increase during the final two months of the campaign, and volunteers should begin feeling as though they are truly contributing by the final two weeks. Everyone gets a break after Election Day. By the time the polls close, all campaign resources should be depleted including time, information, money and people.

Each member of the management team should have a copy of the campaign timeline, and it is the duty of the campaign manager to oversee the implementation of the timeline. Every aspect of the campaign timeline must run like clockwork. If an event is being held on a certain date, and invitations are mailed three to four weeks in advance, and an RSVP deadline is included, a complete timeline should include each step. Each member of the campaign team has the duty to add pertinent information to the timeline including the candidate, scheduler, campaign manager, political director and volunteer coordinator. Only one person in the campaign should oversee the timeline. Whenever changes are made to the timeline, all members of the management team, including the candidate, should receive the revised timeline.

![[00003.jpg]]4.4 Assigning Responsibilities and Duties

A campaign plan, like any other project management plan, will have duties assigned to certain people. Whenever a campaign activity appears on the timeline, a name or names should appear next to it so that the campaign knows who is responsible for making the event successful.

The duties in the campaign should be assigned according to the TIMP resources. Smaller campaigns will have fewer people to whom duties are assigned while larger campaigns will have a more complex management structure. Time is a resource that should be managed by the campaign manager, the candidate and the scheduler. The campaign manager is responsible for prioritizing when and where the candidate is going as well as the campaign timeline. In addition, the campaign manager is responsible for managing the other coordinators in the campaign.

The candidate generally has two jobs during a campaign: making money and meeting people. The candidate should be scheduled for door-to-door heavily during the final two months of a campaign. If the candidate has more than 30 minutes available between events during times appropriate for door to door, then the best use of time would be for the candidate to be knocking on doors in targeted neighborhoods. The campaign manager should work directly with the scheduler to manage the candidate’s time.

The execution of the air war falls on the shoulders of the campaign manager. When it comes to media, a campaign will generally hire a third party firm to handle production and buying of time. In the event a third party is involved, the campaign manager is still responsible for ensuring that all benchmarks are being met and that the timeline is being followed. The campaign manager must follow up with the vendors associated with the campaign to keep them to task.

The ground war generally falls under the responsibilities of the political director with the help of the volunteer coordinator. Everything from assisting in the candidate’s door-to-door and scheduling events to literature drops and poll workers, the ground war is the foundation of a campaign.

The poll worker operation should be entrusted to a member of management, such as the political director or volunteer coordinator, because of the importance of the operation. The timeline involved requires a diligent person who can recruit, train, assign and supply volunteers for the job. Poll workers and volunteers are human resources, but their activities are part of the political machine. A campaign can involve both the volunteer coordinator and the political director in the guidance of volunteers.

Absentee and mail ballot operations should be conducted by the volunteer coordinator. The timeline should reflect when the mail ballot operation begins. The mail operation is dependent upon the local elections office. Campaign volunteers respond to the ballots being sent out from the board of elections by sending out campaign literature to the same list of recipients. Since timing is important, each day the local elections office sends out mail ballots, volunteers should be mailing literature to the corresponding voters. This is not an operation that can be “batched” or backed up. The timeline should reflect each day that mail ballots are distributed.

The campaign manager is the sole arbiter of how duties are distributed among the campaign team. Each duty in the campaign should be listed in a chart with a corresponding team member assigned to it. Also, a roster of team members should be kept with a listing of each member’s duties.4.5 Laying It All Out

Once a campaign has developed a budget, conducted research, built a team, created a timeline and assigned duties, the campaign plan is complete. The campaign manager should be able to take a tabbed binder and open it to the section dealing with everything that was discussed in the first four chapters of this guide. If the campaign manager wants to access the timeline, then the tab for “timeline” is immediately available. The same concept goes for the budget, timeline, opposition research, election results, finance reports, listings of officeholders, media lists and all the other information gathered early in the campaign.

The campaign plan should have the following components available in an organized format:

1. Abstract on campaign message
2. Description of issues in campaign
3. Charts of strengths and weaknesses of candidate as well as any opponents
4. Historical and political data on the jurisdiction of the office being sought
5. Media contacts
6. Listing of local elected officials at all levels
7. Campaign team
8. Campaign committee
9. Opposition research
10. Budget
11. Timeline
12. Assignment of duties

The campaign plan is a living document. Team members may change over time. The timeline may be adjusted during the campaign. The budget may fluctuate. A campaign must be able to adapt to changes in the environment. However, a campaign without a plan is going to be considerably weaker than a campaign that has a plan. The campaign plan provides a structure for the decisions in the campaign. A study of failed campaigns would probably demonstrate that losing campaign often have undeveloped campaign plans if any plans at all.

The campaign plan will also have a finance plan. The finance plan is how the campaign will raise the money necessary for the campaign. The next chapter discusses fundraising and building the finance plan. Once the finance plan has been completed, it should be added to the overall campaign plan.

Because the campaign plan has an enormous amount of sensitive information, only the campaign manager and candidate should have unfettered access to it. Portions of the plan are accessible to other team members, but it could be devastating if a copy of the campaign plan found its way to an opponent’s camp.

### Fundraising5.1 Opening the Candidate’s “Black Book”

When the candidate begins fundraising, the first people that should be considered for giving are friends, family, business acquaintances and anyone who may have benefited by being associated with the candidate. These potential contributors are referred to as “low hanging fruit” because they should be easily reachable donors. These prospects are also the ones who will most likely be friends of the candidate throughout his or her political career.

Before contacting the people in the candidate’s “black book”, a campaign should sit down with the candidate and make a comprehensive list of all relevant people who can give. The list should include name, address, all available phone numbers, fax, e-mail address and the level at which they are capable of giving. Plugging this information into an easily sorted and updated spreadsheet will be helpful throughout the campaign.

Most candidates, especially first time candidates, underestimate the power of their own list. They often are hesitant to list someone because they do not want to ask them for money for their campaign. Sometimes a candidate will feel as though fundraising is begging for money. The important aspect of making this list is that these people are not giving charity as much as they are making an investment in good government by supporting the campaign. When it comes to fundraising and making the list, the candidate should look at the campaign the same way as raising money for a church or other organization.

This list should be created early in the campaign. A good database is one of the most important assets a candidate can have, and it must be vigilantly updated. The more thorough the job of research and database building that is done in the beginning will increase the chances for success later on. The candidate should personally approach the people with whom he or she has preexisting relationships rather than having a campaign team member do it.5.2 Making the “Ask”

Asking for money from friends, family and potential donors is not as hard as many people think. It requires getting past a certain level of comfort most people have when it comes to the subject of money. Some candidates do not like he idea of asking for money because they feel it is a form of begging and is beneath them. Other candidates fail to be effective at fundraising because asking for money requires effort, and making that effort worthwhile is difficult. Others do not like the idea of rejection and feel that they would rather pay for their campaign out of resources personally available to them. If a candidate looks at fundraising and finds it impossible for any of these reasons, perhaps running for office should be reconsidered.

The most successful candidates are ones that make fundraising calls positive contacts. The calls for money do not have to be unpleasant. They can include some amount of small talk. More successful fundraising calls may have a candidate listening to the concerns of a prospective donor so that a campaign staff member can follow up on those concerns. The components of a successful call include:

> - Introduction

> - Brief small talk

> - Overview of why candidate is calling including why the candidate needs money to run

> - Assigning a reason as to why the person the candidate is calling has a stake in the race

> - Making the ask for financial support

A sample dialogue of how a successful campaign call can go appears at the end of this book in Appendix L. It is a campaign’s responsibility to be aware of any restrictions local, state or federal law places on fundraising activities. The campaign treasurer and finance director must work together to ensure all laws are followed. The treasurer and finance director must become experts in campaign finance law. Also, prior to the phone call, the amount that the prospective donor can contribute should be researched and known. This can be gauged by viewing what they contributed to other candidates, what they do for a living or how close they are to the candidate.

It is always a good idea to ask for more than what the prospective donor may be able to give. When donors are asked for money, they can be flattered by the fact that they are viewed as able to give at such a level. Sometimes they will make an extra consideration and contribute what is asked. At the very least, a candidate can reduce the request when the donor expresses an inability to give at a suggested level.

The best fundraising call is one in which the candidate enlists the help of a potential donor to raise money for the campaign. In making the candidate’s list of friends, family and associates, there will undoubtedly be individuals on the list who have larger networks of their own whom they may be willing to tap for the campaign. A candidate should always be willing to ask those donors if they will help the campaign raise money by accessing their own networks. They can host an event such as a breakfast, lunch, after hours cocktail or an evening fundraiser at their home or other appropriate venue. They may also be willing to make a direct appeal without the need for an event.

In situations that fundraising events are involved, the campaign staff must work closely with the donor to make sure all invitations and printed materials comply with applicable election laws. It should remain the host’s responsibility to secure venue, guests/donors and pay for the event. The campaign benefits by the benevolence of the donor’s network and is involved only to make sure everything complies with law, that the event runs smoothly and money is collected.5.3 Identifying Potential Donors

Once the candidate has compiled the list of all friends, family, associates, colleagues and others who may be willing to invest in the campaign, other avenues of donors should be pursued. The candidate should expand the universe of potential donors to include anyone locally who has given to other candidates in the past. This identification requires gathering the finance reports from these past candidates and officeholders. Such compilation should occur with the permission of the person whose reports are sought. Local election boards and clerks are excellent sources for this information. Some secretary of state web sites contain information for statewide officeholders and legislators.

The campaign will have more success in partisan races by sticking with donors to candidates of the same party. Some areas prohibit the use of other lists for prospecting purposes so understanding the local rules for use of other candidate finance reports is important.

Another way of obtaining the lists from other candidates is to simply ask that candidate for their list. Many candidates will be reluctant to share their list because it took them a long time and a great deal of effort to build their own database. However, if the campaign team worked the way it should have from the beginning in Chapter One, the campaign should have some officeholders in the campaign committee who have a vested interest in the success of the candidate. These officeholders will be more likely to provide their lists upon request.5.4 Refining the Database

Once the campaign has compiled the various lists of friends, colleagues and historical donors, the next step is to enter these individuals into a database that can be used by a word processing program to personalize letters. When sending a letter to a prospective donor, never address it “Dear Fellow Republican/Democrat” or “Dear Township/County Resident”. If a direct mail piece looks like bulk mail, then it will more likely than not be placed in the trash. However, if Robert Jackson receives a letter with the salutation “Dear Bob”, the likelihood that the letter will be read is increased significantly as is the prospect of a response.

As soon as the database is compiled and duplicate records have been removed, the campaign is now ready to mail a letter to the prospective donors. The “prospecting” process is discussed in the next section.5.5 Prospecting New Donors

There are two components that are necessary in all campaign communications that are going to prospective or current donors and supporters. These components are applicable to mailed communications as well as e-mail communications. These components include:

- A personalized communication
- An opportunity for a response

The personalized communication is a letter or e-mail specifically addressed to each person on the list. As stated in the last section, a salutation of “Dear Bob” to Robert Jackson is considerably more effective than “Dear Knox County Resident”. In addition to the personalization, the initial communication to the prospective supporter should be brief and contain relevant information about the candidate and should speak to the message of the campaign. A seasoned campaign manager with good writing skills will be able to draft a prospect letter quickly. For first-time campaigners, this first prospect letter should go through many drafts to comply with the components: brevity, relevance and message of the campaign. An example of a prospect letter can be found in Appendix B.

The prospect letter can come from the candidate, or it can come from a known, respected community member writing on the candidate’s behalf. For instance, if Jane Carpenter is running for State Representative, a letter from the current State Representative asking for support on behalf of Jane Carpenter may be more effective than a letter from Jane herself.

A mailed letter should also be signed in blue ink. The purpose of signing in blue ink is to let the recipient know that the signature was written instead of printed from a printer. That personalization leads the recipient to believe that he or she is part of an exclusive group that received the letter. After all, candidates cannot sign thousands of letters themselves. A campaign staff can sign on behalf of the candidate if the candidate permits. This proxy signature is recommended for large mailings exceeding one or two hundred letters.

If e-mail is the communication of choice, the e-mail should also be personalized. There are a number of software programs that allow e-mails to be personalized on the market and can be found at most computer software stores.

The second component required in all communications is an opportunity for the prospect to respond. In mailings, the response vehicle is a self-addressed envelope to the campaign. Ideally, this self-addressed envelope will have an extended flap upon which the prospect can write their personal information and mark appropriate boxes indicating their level and scope of support. An example of a good return envelope is in Appendix C.

For e-mail communications, a link should be placed at the bottom of the communication that gives the prospective donor an opportunity to donate, volunteer or lend their support with the ease of a mouse click. A campaign should never make it difficult for someone to give it money. The easier it is to give money, the more likely someone will donate to the campaign.5.6 PACs

Political Action Committees (PACs) are a good potential source of donor money. Choosing the right PACs is as important as the initial communication to the PAC. For instance, there are PACs on each side of many issues. A campaign does not want to market itself to a pro-abortion PAC such as NARAL and take money from NARAL if the campaign has a pro-life message. It also does not want to court gun control groups if the campaign is also courting pro-2nd Amendment organizations such as the NRA. Working both sides of an issue, wittingly or unwittingly, can be just as defeating as taking money from the wrong group.

A listing of local PACs can be obtained from the local elections board or clerk. A listing of statewide PACs can be obtained from most secretary of state offices or websites.

The best way to approach a PAC is to be introduced by a current officeholder with a relationship with the PAC. Once an introduction has been made, and the campaign has had an opportunity to listen to the PAC president, board or administrator, quick follow-up is important. Always assume any opponent may be contacting the same PACs. A campaign does not want to lose potential support because it was “out of sight, out of mind.”

Many PACs seek candidates out. They have web sites, provide questionnaires and promote their endorsement process. When filling out PAC questionnaires, the campaign manager should always be involved. Candidates may feel as though they can fill out a questionnaire without assistance. If the candidate misses key points, the effectiveness of a questionnaire can be impacted. Two sets of eyes is better than one when filling out questionnaires. A campaign does not want to lose support or money because of a simple error on a question.

The campaign should invest in 2-pocket folders. Place a campaign lapel sticker on the front cover of the folder. On the inside, place a business card on the pocket with the appropriate slots. Inside the left pocket should be an introductory letter personalized to the PAC. Pertinent press releases or news clippings of the campaign should be placed in the right-side pocket along with one or two pieces of campaign literature. The press releases and clippings should relate to the issues in which the PAC is interested. If those are not available, then clippings and releases demonstrating the strength and activity of the campaign can also be effective. After all, a PAC wants to back a winner.

The packet should be sent within 24-48 hours after the initial meeting. Once a few business days have passed, the PAC contact should be called to follow-up, confirm receipt of the packet and to listen to any thoughts the PAC has. By making effort to stay in contact with the PAC, they know that will have someone that will listen to them in office. If a campaign was introduced to the PAC, the person who made the introduction should also make a follow-up phone call or letter geared towards energizing the PAC towards the campaign.

Once the lines of communication are working, it is reasonable to invite the PAC to campaign fundraisers.5.7 Fundraising Events

Most of the critical fundraising will be done over the phone and through prospecting and PAC contributions. There are people who will expect an invitation to a fundraising event before they send money. Fundraising events should be targeted and cost the campaign very little. At best, the campaign will hold the fundraiser at the home of a supporter, and the host will cover the costs of the event. If this is the case, the host must be made aware up front of any expectations. If expectations are not clearly communicated and put into writing in some form (an e-mail confirmation and detailing of expectations should suffice), then the campaign might find itself saddled with the costs of a fundraiser, which will reduce the amount of usable money raised.

In order to hold a strong fundraising event that requires little from the campaign, the first course of action should be to recruit a host committee for the event. A host committee is a group of people listed on the invitation who are responsible for inviting paying guests to the event. Expectations of the host committee should be clearly laid out at the onset of planning. Benchmarks for the host committee should also be established so that the campaign can track the success of the event. Good communication should be maintained with the host committee so that any members who have the proclivity to procrastinate will have the required motivation to work.

Once a host committee is formed, the campaign must decide how large the event will be, how many people can attend and how many will be invited. If the campaign wishes to have an event for 50 people, then the host committee might be 10 people who are required to bring 5 paying guests to the event at the predetermined amount. It could also be a 5 person host committee with a 10 person commitment. The host committee should be prepared to make up the difference of the amount raised if they fail to bring in the goal. For instance, if the expectation of a host committee member is to sell five tickets for $100 each, then any member who sells less than five tickets will buy their unsold tickets. If the host committee members agree to that stipulation, then the campaign has a guaranteed minimum level of funds from the event.

Fundraising etiquette suggests that drinks and hors d’ oeuvres be complimentary with admission to an event. A campaign does not want to alienate a supporter for the lack of common sense hospitality.

Additional invitations to an event can also be distributed or mailed out. These invitations can go to the prospects in the database built in the earlier sections in this chapter. A good host committee will consist of names that might compel a potential donor to attend the event who otherwise may not attend. For instance, if the local sheriff, state representative or county commissioner is on a host committee, there may be people who will attend who do not know the candidate but want to have exposure to the dignitary on the host committee.

Another tactic is to have an extremely large host committee in which the members are only expected to purchase a ticket. A candidate may have between two and three hundred host committee members to an event with the expectation that each person will buy one ticket. The key to making an event of this type a success is for the candidate to personally solicit host committee spots making the expectation clear that a ticket must be purchased to be on the committee.

If a prominent member of a local country club or member of a local church is the host for the event, consider inviting the entire membership of that country club or church. This holds true for any other organization of which a host is a member. It is a form of prospecting that may not provide a high rate of return, but the campaign will most likely obtain new supporters it otherwise would not have had. Sometimes the directories of these organizations are difficult to acquire, but the returns can be great.

A fundraising event should be as high-dollar event as possible in order to make it worth the amount of effort expended. There are a lot of things the campaign needs to work on, and an event that does not yield much funding would be a net loss for the campaign. Make sure that the event host and host committee of the event understand the need to raise the expected level of funds.

At times, a campaign may hold low-dollar events. These events are usually cookouts and have a ticket price less than $50. This type of event will raise a small amount of money, but it is geared towards the more grassroots oriented people in the campaign. These people will most likely comprise the volunteer base. Having a low-dollar event serves as a mechanism by which they can feel financially vested in a campaign. A good event of this type will serve as an energizing event.

### Defining the Candidate and the Opponent6.1 Building the Image – Setting the Candidate Apart

In building an image for the candidate, consider four things: 1) the population of the jurisdiction of the office sought, 2) the differences between the candidate and any opponent, 3) the issues most important to the voters, and 4) the appearance of the candidate.

Knowing the people in the district served by the office the candidate is seeking is important to determining how to present the candidate. People are more likely to vote for those with whom they identify and are comfortable. If the make-up of a district is mostly suburban families, a campaign will wish to utilize _resources/books//The Political Campaign Desk Reference_ A G - Michael McNamara of family whenever possible. If the district is comprised mainly of young professionals, _resources/books//The Political Campaign Desk Reference_ A G - Michael McNamara of a candidate as a successful professional are important. Voters feel more comfortable with candidates whom they feel they share a common bond. They identify with candidates who appear to be more like them and can understand the issues important to them.

Highlighting the differences between the candidate and an opponent is what will allow a candidate to rise above the pack in a field race or in a heads-up match. For instance, differences in levels of education, experience or affiliation can create a stark contrast that allows a candidate to stand out. The key is being the one to use it first and use it effectively. If a candidate is the only one with an advanced degree, experience as a prosecutor and a member of the National Rifle Association, and these qualities appeal to voters in the district, then much of a campaign’s literature and materials will focus on these aspects. Building a visible contrast in a campaign is important to running an effective race. The building blocks to this process occurred in Chapter One when the campaign built the “Strengths” versus “Weaknesses” charts.

Once the top two or three issues in a district have been identified, a candidate should become educated and focus on those subjects. If crime, taxes and economic development are the most important issues to voters in a campaign, the candidate must speak to those issues instead of education and traffic issues. Speaking to the wrong issues will make a campaign seem out of touch with the voters, and this disconnect will be reflected at the polls.

Pulling the aspects of image discussed in this section together in a campaign requires discipline. Many times campaigns will begin with a direction, message and image that follow the principles outlined in this book. Many campaigns, at one time or another, gradually deviate from the path they set out upon. Sometimes this deviation is a result of the candidate talking to a voter who is passionate about an issue that few voters in a district find important. An alert campaign manager will maintain discipline. If the campaign changes course, a campaign manager must be able to bring it back on track.

The key to image is simplicity. The campaign has a single underlying message, and the image of the candidate should not be complex. The same goes for the opponent. In defining the candidate or the opponent, a campaign team must focus on the one or two outstanding qualities of each person that resonate with voters. Once these qualities have been identified, then repeating them in the message throughout the campaign is essential.6.2 Campaign Logo

A campaign logo – the image that is imprinted on signs, literature, television and all other materials, is something that some campaigns spend far too much time creating. Some candidates will want to incorporate an image of a house if their last name is House, or a hammer if the last name is Hammerstein. Making a campaign sign too “gimmicky” will detract from the message of the campaign.

Simplicity, again, is the rule when creating a logo. The logo should never be cluttered, difficult to make out or use fancy fonts. A logo should be straightforward, easy to see, easy to understand and pleasant to look at.

The best logo is one in which the last name of the candidate is the most visible part of it. The office the candidate is seeking is next most important, and a campaign slogan is ancillary. Sometimes party affiliation is important and should be added. Lighter letters on a darker background work very well. The use of artsy fonts is discouraged as is the use of too many distracting elements such as curvy lines, stars and extraneous wording. In addition, the use of more than two or three colors will also detract from the purpose of the logo and signs. The simpler the design, the better the chance a campaign has of connecting with a voter.6.3 Wise Expenditures and Unwise Expenditures

The decision to spend money unwisely can reveal a lot about a candidate. It can also impact how a campaign is perceived by its donors.

Invariably, a candidate has an urge to spend money once the war chest begins to swell. Candidates are capable of making decisions about buying trinkets ranging from nail files and flying discs to yard sticks and water bottles. Unfortunately, trinkets have never won a campaign for anyone. Trinkets generally do not communicate a message especially in the repetitive manner that a campaign requires. Trinkets are generally pricey and have little monetary or message value. When a candidate brings up the concept of trinkets, think through very carefully about what the campaign is trying to communicate with trinkets, how widely the message will be distributed and the overall effectiveness of the idea for the campaign.

Once the campaign has thoroughly thought the idea of purchasing trinkets through, it will become apparent that the idea was probably ill conceived because campaign money can be more effectively spent elsewhere to win votes.

Also beware of the temptation to spend large amounts of money on temporary advertising for special events. For instance, a candidate may spend hundreds or thousands of dollars on the idea to fly an airplane with a banner over a big football game. The impact will be small because spectators have to remove their attention from the field or concession stand at the right time to look up and see an object that they may or may not be able to read. It would cost the campaign very little to post large signs near the game that traffic going to and from will see before and after the event. No one gets distracted or annoyed during the event, the saturation is two-fold, and everyone will see them as opposed to just a few spectators. Signs can be taken down and reused. Mission accomplished for little to nothing as opposed to a creating large dent in the campaign treasury.

Wise expenditures include broadcast media such as television and drive-time radio if a campaign can afford it. Signs in a campaign are important for increasing name awareness. Direct mail is important for message delivery and reinforces the broadcast media message. Telephone marketing and Internet based message delivery are also generally good expenditures. Unwise expenditures generally include newspaper advertising, trinkets, and expenditures that do not effectively communicate the campaign message (airplane banners etc.).

When making spending decisions, consider the budget laid out in Chapter 4 as well as how people may view expenditures. Ask the question: Does this item/activity effectively communicate the message of the campaign?6.4 Importance of Consistency and Repetition

A well thought-out campaign will make certain that the message and look throughout the campaign is consistent. This means that the issues important on television communications should be the same issues in radio ads and direct mail. If there is a slogan on the yard signs, then using a different slogan on television and direct mail diminishes effectiveness of message delivery. If the campaign signs for a candidate are in yellow and blue, but the colors on TV are orange and black and the fonts are different, then the effectiveness of the campaign will be significantly reduced.

A candidate has to compete against opponents in the same race. What campaigns must understand is that they have to compete against all of the other races during the same cycle in order to be seen and heard. The best way to promote a message is to repeat it and keep it consistent. Voters are busy with many distractions in their lives. If voters only see or hear a campaign message once before an election, then that campaign has been ineffective. In order to penetrate into the minds of voters, a campaign has to be seen and heard many times, and the look and message have to be consistent. If a campaign message is heard on television and received in the mail but the _resources/books//The Political Campaign Desk Reference_ A G - Michael McNamara and messages are different, then the voter may just as well have been contacted by two different campaigns. Keep it simple.6.5 Important Images for Candidate

Images drive a campaign’s air war. If a voter receives a direct mail piece that is nothing but text, then no one will read it. If a television spot runs, and the _resources/books//The Political Campaign Desk Reference_ A G - Michael McNamara are not compelling, then it will be less effective than a compelling spot. Much of a campaign is visual, and it is important to use the proper _resources/books//The Political Campaign Desk Reference_ A G - Michael McNamara to promote a candidate.

Choosing the proper _resources/books//The Political Campaign Desk Reference_ A G - Michael McNamara in a campaign relies on what issues are important to voters as well as what interests the voters. If crime is an important issue in a race, then a candidate needs some strong, pro-law enforcement _resources/books//The Political Campaign Desk Reference_ A G - Michael McNamara. A candidate talking to one or two uniformed men who look like police officers can create the image that the candidate understands crime as an important issue and that law enforcement listens to that candidate. The “officers” in the photo do not have to be police officers. Most police departments do not allow their officers to appear in political literature. However, sheriff deputies are sometimes allowed as are private security guards. The voter does not need to know what the patch on the uniform says. Most voters will not even take the time to inspect the uniform, and if they do a skilled campaign manager will make sure the identifiers are unreadable. The important aspect is to make sure that the voter sees an image of the candidate speaking with law enforcement. Voters will draw their own conclusions and no representation needs to be made about the origin of the uniformed talent in the photo.

If the environment is an important issue in a race, then the candidate can be pictured planting trees somewhere in the district. If the district has many young families, then the picture can have children helping plant a tree with the candidate.

In highly agricultural districts, a candidate should have _resources/books//The Political Campaign Desk Reference_ A G - Michael McNamara of being on a farm. It is generally a good idea to have a farmer in the photo as well. If the image if one of a farmer and the candidate talking in front of a tractor, the voter will fill in the blanks and make assumptions that they are discussing issues of agriculture. A candidate should not, however, be shown in a photo doing something that the candidate would not normally do. Talking with a farmer in front of a tractor is one thing, but for a suburban candidate to be seen bailing hay on a farm when that candidate has never bailed hay before may look unnatural, and it will open the door for an attack by the opponent.

Appropriate dress in each photo is also important. A picture of the candidate conducting a board meeting would obviously have the candidate wearing a suit. If the candidate is talking to a farmer in front of a tractor, however, it might be wise to have the candidate wearing jeans and a flannel shirt.

Below is a list of suggested photos to obtain of the candidate. Some of them are appropriate for some races and not others. These suggestions are to serve as a guide and to provide ideas. It should not be considered an all-inclusive list.

Suggested photos of the candidate:

- Professional head shot
- Candidate with law enforcement
- Candidate going door-to-door (senior answering door, young couple answering door)
- Candidate hunting with proper attire and following regulations
- Candidate conducting board meeting in suit
- Candidate speaking to elderly couple at “kitchen table”
- Candidate with officeholders (individually and collectively if possible)
- Candidate with farmer
- Candidate planting trees
- Candidate with family (not too formal, and not too casual)
- Candidate with parents (if available)
- Candidate in regional settings (local city halls, county courthouse etc.)
- Candidate surrounded by many supporters in campaign shirts
- Candidate visiting local business
- Candidate at a gun range
- Candidate speaking at a podium
- Candidate at desk working
- Candidate addressing a jury (if attorney)
- Candidate with veterans
- Candidate in uniform (if appropriate)
- Candidate on a bench in a robe (if a judge)

When taking the pictures, there are a few things to remember. It is important to make sure other distractions are minimized. Too many people in the background might detract from the impact of the image. Too many extraneous objects can also have the same effect. Objects in the background can also be distracting. If a shot is outdoors, the candidate should not be positioned in such a way that it appears as though a tree or plant could be growing out the candidate’s head. Pictures with statues in the background should be avoided. For instance a family picture taken at a church may have the unintended addition of a family member in the photo if a statue is behind the family.

Make certain that the expressions are appropriate for the picture. If the person speaking with a candidate looks angry, bored or too amused in a photo, then the impact of the image is diminished. The person in a photo should be engaged. Many shots should be taken of a single image to make certain a usable image is captured. Digital cameras make it very easy to take hundreds of photos and check them before moving on.

Environmental factors can also be controlled to make a picture more appealing. For instance, a common picture is of a candidate working at a desk with a pad of paper or a document. By closing the shades in the room, turning on a desk lamp on the desk and dimming the room lights a little bit, the picture can now look as though the candidate is burning the midnight oil. Try photos in which the candidate rolls up the sleeves, takes a tie off or changes the appearance to go from formal to casual. It is impossible to take too many pictures, and it is important to select just the right one to use.

Whatever pictures the campaign decides to use, they should be dynamic. A candidate can look exciting, or dull. Discretion should be used when taking pictures with individuals who may be unpopular or take controversial positions on issues.

If “extras” or volunteers are used to fill in space in photos, such as a make-believe jury or children planting a tree with the candidate, then a Talent Release Form should be signed by the people in the photos. If the talent is a child, then the form should be signed by a parent. The purpose of a Talent Release Form is to document that the campaign has the permission of the person to use the image, and that any compensation has been satisfied. It is generally unnecessary to have someone endorsing a candidate sign a form. The form is to protect the campaign from someone who may want compensation later on or to remind someone that they indeed gave permission in case they forget the details. Whenever the campaign produces an image, the possibility exists that it will appear in print, on television, on the Internet or in any other medium.

Whenever a campaign engages in taking pictures or shooting film, it should always hire a professional photographer or videographer. Hiring a professional raises to probability that the pictures will turn out well and that all of the important elements will be considered. Professionals in photo and video are like campaign professionals – they have spent years of their life mastering their craft. They understand what is required to produce the desired end product. Professionals are more dependable than volunteers because their livelihood depends on their performance.6.6 Common Mistakes

Every campaign makes mistakes. Sometimes these mistakes are so small that they are unnoticeable. Other times, candidate mistakes are so profound that they signal the end of an otherwise spirited race. A candidate should understand that opposing campaigns are always watching for anything that can be used to help define the candidate in a negative way.

Below is a laundry list of mistakes commonly committed in campaigns:

1. If a candidate has facial hair, consider shaving – people trust a clean-shaven candidate over one with facial hair
2. Avoid useless trinkets – they are a drain on campaign funds and have little impact. They also do nothing to promote message delivery
3. Prepare for press conferences and public appearances. The more prepared a candidate is, the less likely that inappropriate statements or comments will be made
4. Always have a fresh perspective from outside the campaign to review all materials. Sometimes campaigns stray from the theme so far that they produce literature and ads that have little to do with the message or may even turn voters off because of inaccuracy, meanness or irrelevance.
5. Always be concise. Long-winded answers and wordy content on a web site only serve to provide ammunition to an opponent. Brevity is a key to success.
6. Always have sound bites or “snippets” ready for the press if contacted by a reporter for a story. Reporters generally know what they want their subjects to say, but a prepared interviewee will have the comments ready so that the reporter will be unable to “cherry pick” certain quotes out of context.
7. Be uncomplicated – It is counterproductive for a campaign to create _resources/books//The Political Campaign Desk Reference_ A G - Michael McNamara or literature that are too “busy” or have too much information for a normal person to digest. If an average person’s eyes would glaze over looking at something from the campaign, then consider revising it.
8. A candidate should NEVER run his or her own campaign. A member of the candidate’s family should also NEVER run the campaign. A third party, advisably a professional, should run the campaign.
9. Place a disclaimer on EVERYTHING. If in doubt as to whether an item requires a disclaimer, then use one. Everything from stickers to phone calls to direct mail and television ads should clearly state who paid for the item.
10. Be mindful of all election laws no matter how small. An elections violation can be a distraction a campaign does not need and can yield unfavorable press coverage.
11. If an opponent violates local, state or federal election law, and it is a “slam dunk” case (failing to display disclaimer, claiming the candidate already holds the office being sought when it is an open seat etc.), file a complaint. Too many campaigns get cold feet on filing complaints because they are afraid the opponent will file a complaint as well. If a candidate has violated an elections rule, assume the opponent will file the complaint anyway. Getting a successful “conviction” on a complaint can force an opponent off message and to spend time, money and resources on defending the complaint.   

# CHAPTER 7

### Message Delivery

Every campaign must have a strategy for getting its message out to voters. The various means of message delivery are discussed in this chapter. A campaign must remember to always be able to clearly document all claims made in campaign materials. Whether they are positive statements about a candidate, a contrast statement or a negative statement about an opponent, a campaign must back up what it says. In a race in which an opponent is impugned, a complaint may be made. A campaign is hurt if it makes claims that cannot be substantiated, and the last thing a candidate needs in a race is for the campaign to be hit with an elections violation.

Campaigns must also keep in mind that nearly every state requires a proper disclaimer to be visible on all campaign communications from e-mails and web sites to broadcast media and direct mail. Campaigns must take responsibility for the items they produce. A disclaimer usually includes the name of the campaign committee, the address of the campaign committee and the name of the campaign chairman or treasurer.7.1 Direct Mail

One of the most effective means of message delivery is direct mail. Direct mail is not generally viewed as intrusive as phone calls into a person’s home or e-mails to a person’s e-mail account. People have a general tolerance for junk mail and, consequently, political mail. The drawback to direct mail is that the lifespan of a piece of direct mail is basically from the mailbox to the trash can. Therefore, in order for direct mail to be effective, it must be eye-catching and deliver the campaign message that can be read in 30 seconds or less.

Direct mail is most effective when used repetitively. This means that the campaign should plan a direct mail campaign so that the target audience receives literature multiple times prior to a campaign, and it should be delivered in near-rapid succession. A well thought-out campaign will have direct mail delivered to the target audience every 3 to 4 days prior to the election for as many deliveries as the campaign budget will allow.

For a campaign on a shoestring budget, a recommended series of three direct mail pieces might look like this (Election Day is November 2):

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Order|Topic|Date mailed|Date delivered|
|Piece #1|Introduce Jane Smith|Oct. 20|Oct. 21-24|
|Piece #2|Jane Smith on Issues|Oct. 24|Oct. 25-28|
|Piece #3|Contrast with Opponent|Oct. 28|Oct. 29-Nov. 1|

Topics for direct mail pieces range from introducing the candidate to attacking the opponent. The first mail piece should always introduce the candidate and the campaign message. Too many words and too few photos can eliminate the effectiveness of the piece. Furthermore, the name of the candidate should be the largest element on the literature. If a person picking up the mail sees nothing else, they must see the candidate’s name for the piece to have any effect.

The information gathered in chapters 1 through 3 will now be utilized in the Direct Mail portion of the campaign. Issues information, strengths and weaknesses, opposition research as well as microtargeting data all come into focus in the direct mail campaign. Campaigns generally stick to a few certain types of direct mail:

- Introduction of Candidate
- Candidate on the Issues
- Candidate Endorsements
- Call to Action
- Inoculation
- Contrast with Opponent
- Attack on Opponent
- Response to Attack

Introduction of Candidate

The direct mail piece introducing the candidate is the first and most important piece of literature. The introduction defines the candidate and the message of the campaign. The introduction must be eye-catching, informative and make the candidate look exciting to the voter. An introduction uses qualities of the candidate that will appeal to the voters of a district. Also, the candidate’s logo should appear somewhere on the introduction piece. Almost all of the literature produced by a campaign will have the campaign logo.

The introductory piece is the chance for the campaign to appeal to the voters hearts. The introduction does not go heavy into issues because the direct mail pieces addressing issues, and therefore appeal to the voters’ minds, come later. Voters have to first like the candidate before they will consider their positions on issues.

In order to appeal to voters in an introductory piece, the _resources/books//The Political Campaign Desk Reference_ A G - Michael McNamara of the candidate are important. Family photos are generally excellent _resources/books//The Political Campaign Desk Reference_ A G - Michael McNamara to use as well as a professional head shot of the candidate in appropriate business attire. Other _resources/books//The Political Campaign Desk Reference_ A G - Michael McNamara that can be used include historical photos of the candidate in a past career (law enforcement, military, skilled labor etc.). Any image that defines the candidate, fits the message in some way, and appeals to the voters of the district should be used.

If roots in the community are important to voters, a candidate should emphasize any aspect that establishes them as long-standing members of the community. If the district is a largely white-collar area, emphasize any professional background of the candidate. A story of how a candidate worked their way up from having little to living the American Dream and having much generally works well with any audience and helps promote a message of hope while also inferring that the candidate is a hard worker and identifies with others who struggle.

An introductory piece may also list professional and civic affiliations of a candidate in order to identify with members of those organizations and their families. Incorporating the background and _resources/books//The Political Campaign Desk Reference_ A G - Michael McNamara of the candidate that correspond to the community is part of the key to an effective introductory piece. The introductory piece tells a story about the candidate in pictures and uses as few words as possible. The goal is to introduce the candidate in a way that appeals to voters’ hearts.

Candidate on the Issues

Depending on the budget and the number of issues in a race, the campaign may choose to produce one direct mail piece addressing issues, or it can produce many. A campaign may also create issues pieces for general consumption among the voters in the district, or it can use the microtargeting data collected from earlier chapters in order to tailor a message to specific voter households.

In creating “issues” pieces, the campaign has the opportunity to define why an issue is important and to present the argument as to why the candidate is the right choice in the race to handle that issue as an elected officeholder. If handled improperly, the campaign may also alienate voters while also gaining voters. It is important to avoid polarizing too many voters in a race by addressing topics that are unpopular with many people. A campaign must choose the issues that most of the voters agree upon.

An effective issue piece will present the problem the district is facing. Whether it is high taxes, illegal immigration, quality of life or any other issue, the campaign defines the issue. The campaign must define the issue in such a way that the voter knows that the candidate identifies with him or her. Perhaps using a verbatim quote from an earlier poll that expresses how many people view an issue coupled with a prominent picture that exemplifies what is bothering people is a compelling way to catch the attention of the voter receiving the literature. Similar to the introductory piece, pictures are as important in communicating the issue as words are. The campaign might use _resources/books//The Political Campaign Desk Reference_ A G - Michael McNamara of foreclosed properties, people in line at a soup kitchen, or derelict vehicles in the front lawns of residents to communicate tough economic times.

It is important to articulate the issue on one side of the direct mail piece and to present the candidate as the solution on the other. A campaign does not want to associate its candidate as part of the problem, so it should create the separation by using the opposite side of the direct mail piece. Using 2-sided oversized postcards is the preferred method of direct mail. Using brochures that open up or envelopes with multiple pages of information will more likely get lost in junk mail and thrown away. An issue should be presented on one side, and the solution on the other. The candidate’s logo should also be prominently displayed on the solution side along with pertinent photos.

At times, the issue in the race may be tied to the opponent. If that is the case, then the opponent should appear in some unflattering way on the problem side of the issue piece.

Candidate Endorsements

If a candidate has multiple endorsements or even a very strong endorsement from a popular personality in the district, then a direct mail piece dedicated to endorsements may be appropriate. Endorsements that are inappropriate are endorsements from people who are unpopular in the district or endorsements from polarizing figures – people whose endorsements will have both a positive and negative impact.

A compelling image to use is one of the candidate surrounded by popular figures in the district. The image should be prominent on the side of the direct mail piece that the address is on so that when the voter looks to whom the mail is addressed the picture and accompanying text is inescapable. Messages such as, “The people we trust, trust Jenny Smith,” or “Jenny Smith – Trusted by those we trust” or “ENDORSED – Jenny Smith,” or “10 out of 10 people agree – Jenny Smith is the right candidate” can be compelling. At the very least, the piece has drawn the interest of the reader, and the flip side of the card will most likely get viewed.

The flip side of the card should have testimonials from the people who endorsed the candidate. Too many testimonials will make the piece too wordy. Again, pictures of the candidate with those making the endorsements or the candidate in action poses that are descriptive of the testimonials are effective. Testimonial statements should be short and relevant to the theme of the campaign. Many campaigns will write the statements for the person making the endorsement, and then obtain approval for the quote from the appropriate person.

Endorsements can also be added to issue mail pieces. For instance, a piece whose topic is crime and law enforcement may have an endorsement by the County Sheriff for the candidate prominently displayed. Whenever this occurs, a short quote from the endorser should accompany a photo in order to maximize the visual connect the reader can make.

Call to Action

The call to action piece is a direct mail vehicle that requests the recipient to respond in some way. A call to action is generally accompanied by a self-addressed envelope or postcard. The call to action has two components: 1) exposition of candidate and the candidate’s request, and 2) response vehicle.

A call to action piece is generally delivered in an envelope or folded mail piece as opposed to the other types of direct mail discussed in this section. Some calls to action contain a letter informing the recipient of some facts that the campaign wishes to communicate. The call to action is then accompanied by a survey or possibly a solicitation for money. Other times, the call to action may have a card that merely needs signed, stamped and sent to a pre-addressed destination.

The Call to Action can be used in fundraising as well as microtargeting. Chapter 7 is about message delivery. When it comes to message delivery, the call to action generally has limited use.

If a campaign has identified supporters or likely supporters through the use of telemarketing, surveys or other means, then the campaign should make an effort to secure those votes as early as possible. Many states allow for voting by mail or absentee voting. There is generally a period of time, usually about a month, in which voters can vote early. In order to participate in early voting, a voter usually has to request a mail ballot. One type of call to action piece may be a brochure that contains information about the candidate but also has one or two tear-off postcards. The post cards are request forms to the local elections office requesting a mail ballot. The voter would ideally remove the card, fill it out, stamp it, send it in and wait for the ballot in the mail. A short tutorial should be part of the direct mail piece so that the voter will fully comprehend what is being asked.

Another type of call to action piece might be one in which a challenger wants to inform people in the district about an unpopular vote or action by the incumbent. The campaign can produce a direct mail piece that informs the recipient about the activity of the opponent and has one or two postcards attached. The first postcard is one that requires a stamp and is sent to the opponent. It is a message to the opponent from the voter stating that they did not like their recent action. Information on these cards to the opponent should be minimal so that the opponent must look up addresses and phone numbers in order to respond. The second card is a card that goes back to the candidate’s own campaign in order to identify voters who sent the card in. This card requests the voter’s name, address, phone and e-mail. When the postcard comes back to the campaign, the information should be added into the campaign database. If the campaign does not want the expense of perforating or folding a direct mail piece, then it can direct voters to call the office of the opponent to tell him how they feel. This type of call to action can create grief in an opposing campaign and force the incumbent to spend time and money responding.

Another type of call to action is a slate card that presents a list of candidates for offices on the ballot to the voter. The voter is asked to vote for the people listed in each race listed. Slate cards are generally used by local Republican or Democrat parties. Other third-party organizations use slate cards as well. An effective slate card is personalized to each recipient letting them know: 1) the date of the election, 2) the times that polls are open, and 3) the location of the poll for that individual.

The call to action is generally more expensive because of the added processes involved in producing the literature. The call to action should be clear in the request it is making to the recipient as well as concise.

Inoculation

One of the reasons a campaign must conduct opposition research on its own candidate as well as create a list of weaknesses for its candidate is to understand what information the opponent may use in a campaign. A well-planned campaign will take into account the weaknesses of its candidate and prepare in advance for an attack. One way to answer an attack before it occurs is to inoculate or address the issue before the opponent does.

An opponent may never go on the offensive. Therefore, the decision to inoculate should be carefully considered because the campaign runs the risk of exposing the voters to an issue that they may have never known. It may also be foolish to attempt to inoculate every potential issue. An opponent’s campaign also has a budget and a strategy of its own, and it cannot address all of the weaknesses it might consider. So a candidate must consider what weaknesses an opponent will choose to exploit and decide whether or not to address them in some way.

Inoculation serves a few purposes: 1) it allows the candidate to take control of an issue and define it before the opponent does, 2) it can show that the candidate is forthright and honest in choosing to address an issue, and 3) inoculation can become a positive issue for a candidate if addressed properly.

The best way to approach a weakness is to find a way to turn it into a positive issue for the candidate. For instance, a candidate may have a history of making controversial decisions or voting on controversial issues. By being the candidate to bring up the issue first, explain the reasons for the decisions and how they impacted the district, it is possible that voters will gain respect for the candidate even if they disagree with the message. Simply knowing exactly where a candidate stands on an issue is sometimes better than supporting an opponent who has untested positions.

A direct mail piece can address an issue and inoculate it. By using strong visuals and succinct language, a skilled campaign can take a weakness and possibly convert it to a strength. At the very least, a campaign can answer to a weakness and control the conversation before an opponent has an opportunity to attack.

For instance, if a Bob Smith has been caught for experimenting with marijuana or alcohol much earlier in life, and the likelihood that the opposition has proof either through anecdotal evidence or a citation, a campaign may want to inoculate against it. Bob Smith might create a direct mail piece in which he is candid about what he did as a youth and that he encourages children and young adults to make good decisions today. Adding in a picture and a quote from a local police chief or sheriff will also demonstrate that the candidate is now on the right side of the law. Of course, this inoculation tactic works well if the law that was broken was a minor misdemeanor. More serious crimes present tougher challenges for a candidate and can affect the decision about whether to run or not.

Inoculation should be used only when serious or devastating issues face a campaign. If the campaign tests a weakness in a poll and finds that voters do not care about the issue or are apathetic to it, then raising awareness to the issue is an unwise use of resources.

Contrast with Opponents

A contrast piece is one in which the candidate uses the strengths vs. weaknesses charts prepared in chapter 1. In essence, a contrast piece is one in which the voters get to see the candidate’s strengths while also seeing the opponent’s weaknesses. It is important in contrast pieces that all of the information is true and accurate and can be supported by documentation. A campaign does not want to lose relevance in a race because it used inaccurate information.

Campaign cycles have many candidates for many different positions. Chances are that voters are receiving a lot of mail from a lot of candidates. As is the case with all other direct mail, the contrast piece must stand out.

One type of contrast might have two resumes side-by-side on one side of the literature. One resume is for the candidate sending the literature. The other resume is for the opponent. Obviously the information on the candidate’s resume is flattering while the information selected for the opponent is not. The flip side is a positive statement about the candidate repeating one or two key strengths from the resume on the other side.

Other types of contrast pieces are similar in content but might change the look. If two people are running for judge, then the scales of justice might show the scales tipping towards the candidate and away from the opponent. Instead of resumes, the contrast might be depicted on make-believe case files. Whatever device is used to attract the voter’s attention to the piece, it should be relevant and not distract from the message.

The contrast piece may set the information up in a table in which the first column is a statement such as “Endorsed by the Fraternal Order of Police.” The next column would have a picture and caption of the candidate art the top and a blue or green “YES” or check mark in the field next to the statement. The third and last column would have the opponent’s picture and caption with a red “NO” or “X” in the field next to the statement. The table may be five or six rows long. Although there may be 20 strong differences between the candidates, a campaign should pick five or six to go with. Any more makes the piece crowded and hard to read.

Attack on Opponent

Attack pieces on an opponent are similar to the contrast with the exception that the negatives of the opponent take prominence in the content of the piece, and the candidate issuing the mail may not even be mentioned. The reason a campaign uses attack pieces is to erode the support of an opponent. If an opponent is extremely popular or far ahead in polling, a candidate may not be able to make up the gap by the remaining undecided voters. Therefore, an attack on the opponent is necessary in order to bring balance to a race in which someone is far ahead of another. The risk that a candidate runs in any negative attack is the loss of one’s own support. If an attack is perceived as mean-spirited, unwarranted or particularly vicious, then the attacker may also lose support.

Making an attack piece seem responsible is a challenge for a campaign. In order for an attack to be effective, the opponent must be identified with an action, issue or condition that is unpopular. For instance, an area may be suffering economically, and the opponent is a county commissioner who makes decisions on local taxes, utility rates and other fees that impact the lives of voters. The challenger to the incumbent may use an attack piece that paints a grim picture of the current state of affairs and pins the responsibility for those conditions on the incumbent.

Another attack may look at the record of an opponent. As the campaign gathered information discussed in chapters 1 through 3, extensive research should have been done on the opponent’s record including votes, attendance record, criminal record and many other areas. A campaign may decide to attack any weak point. Nearly every voter understands that if he or she misses so many days of work that they will be fired. If an opponent has missed a significant number of meetings over the course of the last year or term in office, then a candidate may decide to paint a picture of an opponent who uses an office as a personal playground and shirks responsibility while the residents of the district are struggling to get by.

An effective way to present an attack is to replace bombastic and hard-hitting statements with leading questions. In the case of the absentee officeholder, the negative statement “Robert Baker missed 1 out of every five meetings last year while we worked hard,” might be replaced with “Is it fair that Robert Baker missed 1 out of every five days of work last year?” Very few voters would answer the question with a “yes.” Even Robert Baker’s supporters will be angry at the question because they know that the only honest answer is “yes.” An effective piece is one that creates a sense of urgency in the opponent to spend time and money responding to the charge. While Robert Baker is responding to the direct mail piece about how he has missed more work than most working people are allowed in a year, the challenging campaign may be coming out with another attack piece asking another question Robert Baker that will keep him on the defense.

A good attack campaign does not directly attack an opponent, and it does not generally make statements as much as it asks questions. If voters answer a question about a candidate the way in which they unknowingly were directed to, then they feel as though the conclusion they reached is their own. The voters are engaged because they answered the question in their own minds, and the literature that merely posed a question has now planted a seed of discontent. If a campaign has the money for a full scale attack, there will be a total of two or three questions asked of the opponent. Since the questions were asked through the mail, and not in a public debate or other medium, the opponent is forced to spend money answering the attack. Since campaigns are not forced to disclose their direct mail lists, the opponent can only guess as to who has received the attack pieces.

If the campaign has done its job in eliminating the opponent, the opponent’s family and the opponent’s known supporters from its database, then it has increased the amount of time between which the message was delivered and the opponent will respond. If enough time passes between the attack and the response, then the opponent, in answering the attack is actually bringing the issue back up again. Unless the opponent goes on the attack, which often happens, then the advantage will belong to the candidate waging the attacks.

Another method of using direct mail for attacks is to present the words of a third party to denigrate an opponent. For instance, if a local union boss or pastor or other respected leader makes a public statement about an opponent’s absenteeism, mismanagement or other issue, then the quote is fair game for a direct mail piece. When third party comments are used in a “What are people saying about Robert Baker” piece, then the campaign waging the attack shifts a portion of the burden of waging an attack to the third party making the statements.

The relationship that the campaign has with the media is important in creating an attack campaign. A skilled campaign manager can craft an issue in such a way that it stands alone without need for the candidate to attack the opponent. Reporters are trained to be investigative, and a campaign that can effectively start an investigation that will lead to favorable results will get a story in the paper or on television. Once a story hits the papers or airwaves, effective quotes for a direct mail piece can be gathered and used, and the source is a third party. In this manner, a candidate never had to take a public stand to go on the attack.

Going on the attack is a risky proposition that is generally only done in circumstances that require it. If an opponent is so far ahead that remaining undecided voters cannot bridge the gap, then going negative may seem like the only way to go. The proper way to wage an attack campaign is to engage the voter in such a way that the conclusion a voter reaches seems like their own. It is also wise to use third party comments when available so that the burden of the attack is spread around to others. A campaign should always finish strong, so finishing a race with all negatives and no positives for a candidate is not wise.

Response to Attack

In close races and campaigns in which a candidate is polling ahead of another, a campaign team can count on an opponent going on the offensive. If the opposing campaign is wisely attacking a candidate, then it is most likely attempting to place a candidate in a permanent defensive position. As a candidate is spending resources answering one attack, the opponent is waging another attack that the candidate must now answer. If a candidate is constantly on the defense, then the message of the campaign is not being effectively communicated. Furthermore, a barrage of attacks that put a candidate in a defense mode will eventually take its toll on valuable campaign resources including time, money and people. A campaign can lose steam and become demoralized if it is not effectively handling attacks.

The best way to respond to an attack is to answer the attack and go on the offensive in the response. For instance, an opponent may choose to attack a candidate for holding numerous elected positions over a short period. In answering the attack, a candidate can talk about how the opponent chooses to talk about the number of positions John Doe has held. “Opponent X is attacking John Doe because John Doe has something Candidate X does not have: Experience.” So in one mail piece or ad, the campaign has turned the issue from a negative to a positive and even went on the attack.

A campaign may choose to also ignore an attack. If an opponent chooses a weakness that does not resonate with voters, the best response may be no response. Sometimes responding to a non-issue can lend legitimacy to the issue and create a problem for a campaign where it never would have been before. An example would be an opponent attacking a candidate for smoking marijuana decades before. If the issue is tested in a poll and found that voters are generally disinterested, then the candidate would be wise to ignore the charge and continue with the campaign. By addressing the charge and focusing more attention on the issue, a candidate may open the floodgates of questions such as, “how long have you used?” “How much have you used?” “Did you sell marijuana, too?” So the campaign message is derailed as the media and voters now read about the details of a marijuana user instead of the platform of a distinguished candidate for office. If voters are interested in an issue, however, ignoring it can work to the campaign’s detriment.

The most effective direct mail piece a campaign can produce, in terms of timing, is one that lands in mailboxes the day before the election and is personalized to the recipient household. The piece will inform the voters in that household of when they vote and the address of the polling location. Times that the polls are open should also be printed on the literature. Many of the voters who receive this literature will take it with them to the polls on Election Day.

The more difficult a piece of direct mail is to read, the less likely someone will read it. The use of pictures and brevity has already been discussed. The design of the direct mail piece is also important. Generally, everything a campaign wishes to communicate should be done on two sides of an oversized postcard. If a voter receives a folded brochure that must be unsealed and opened, the likelihood that the entire piece will be read is decreased. Some issues are too complex to fit on two sides of a card. A folded brochure or pamphlet should only be used if the issue is compelling enough to warrant voters taking the time to open it along with all of the other mail they receive on a daily basis. If the issue is simple, and the message is brief, a double-sided, oversized postcard will effectively communicate the message. Multiple issues on a single piece are not generally advisable unless the direct mail piece is recapping information delivered in previous pieces.

Furthermore, oversized postcards are generally less expensive than a direct mail piece that requires folding and sealing. Campaigns are almost always on a budget, and costs associated with printing and mailing can begin to impact the war chest. So not only are brochures more difficult to access and read all of the information, they generally incur higher costs. Also remember that each campaign is competing with all of the other campaigns to get noticed. It is easy to get lost amidst the other mail from other candidates for other offices. The challenge is to get noticed before being discarded.

Many candidates may be compelled to create a pamphlet or brochure mail piece. Generally, the candidate wants to add statistics, figures, evidence to support a point or other information that appears relevant. If a campaign chooses to create a direct mail piece that must be opened in order to read, then the outside of the piece must be so compelling that the recipient will take the time to break the seal and open the piece. If the inside is filled with drivel or statistics or charts or organized in such a way that the reader’s eyes will glaze over and become numb, then the direct mail piece was ineffective. A small handful of voters may read every piece of mail from cover to cover, but most voters need to have information delivered in easy-to-read pieces that have impact.

Most printers can work with campaigns on developing direct mail. Campaigns should use bulk rate postage available to political races in order to save on mail costs. A good printer will have the ability to print bulk rate indicia on the literature or use a bulk rate stamp. When mailing to a database, a campaign should never send literature to the opponent or any known supporters of the opponent. A campaign does not want an opponent to know the content of its literature, when its mail is being sent, how often mail is being sent or to whom. All direct mail should be targeted to voters who have not yet voted and are unknown in their support.7.2 Electronic Media

A popular method of mass communication in a campaign is electronic media. Electronic media includes television and radio advertising. Although television may seem expensive, the results make it worth it. Television allows candidates to speak directly to voters when they are watching and listening. The three facets most important in dealing with electronic media are 1) ad placement, 2) message, and 3) budget.

Electronic media is more realistic than a large direct mail campaign in larger districts such as congressional races. Television costs much more than direct mail to reach each voter in small races, but as the size of the universe grows, a campaign will get more return on each dollar spent from television than it will with direct mail.

Placement

The general strategy is to place ads on television during news programming because many viewers of news programming are concerned voters. During sports season, placing ads during popular games can also be effective. A primary race will have different dynamics than a general election race. Placement of ads on cable programming specifically geared towards a target audience should be strongly considered. The bulk of the electronic media campaign budget will be in television.

On radio, effective ads are placed during drive time for commuters on popular stations and during programming on talk radio. Radio is not as effective as television, but the price per ad is generally much less. Radio should never become the dominant expenditure in a campaign. Radio is a medium to which only a select segment of voters listen. Spending significantly on radio is generally inadvisable.

Television and cable stations can provide needed demographic information of viewers that will help determine which stations and what times will be most beneficial to a campaign. This information is used in order to target voters. A campaign manager or media buyer should check rating points for who is listening or viewing and when.

Message

Campaigns usually do not have enough money to produce multiple spots that will gain enough saturation with voters to have an impact. Therefore, it is important for a campaign to choose one or two messages to promote in a broadcast media campaign. Also, a campaign should budget for a response spot if the campaign anticipates an attack.

A campaign must decide what it wishes to accomplish in 30 seconds. Is it to raise name identification with the candidate? If the campaign is trying to raise name identification, is it because the grassroots, direct mail and other facets of the campaign are failing, or is it because the district is so large that television is the only method of raising name identification? By asking the right questions, a campaign can decide what it wants to accomplish. Each spot should have one message and one message only. Therefore, if a campaign has two messages then each message should be in a different spot. A campaign must also determine if it has the ability to make more than one message penetrate the target audience, meaning that most of the target audience will hear or view the spot enough times for it to be remembered. If the campaign has enough money for only one message to penetrate, then it should seriously consider not producing two messages.

In the Direct Mail section of this chapter, various types of message delivery were discussed, and each type generally warrants its own direct mail piece. On television a campaign has 30 seconds to communicate whatever it can to the audience. If the campaign tries to accomplish too much, then the ad will be largely ignored. For instance, an ad that tries to introduce a candidate, tell a story about the candidate’s life, talk about the candidate’s credentials, list one or more endorsements and use _resources/books//The Political Campaign Desk Reference_ A G - Michael McNamara of the candidate as a child then as an adult will have no impact on voters except to send some of them into convulsions trying to understand what they just saw.

A campaign will generally create an introductory ad that raises awareness of the candidate. An introduction should never try to accomplish too much.

A campaign can use 30 seconds to introduce a candidate’s credentials for office. A 30 second ad can address a specific issue and how a candidate will handle that issue. The goal of a television ad is to make the viewer want to vote for a candidate. The purpose is not to overload the viewer or provide too much information. A television ad should play to a candidate’s strengths or an opponent’s weaknesses. And a 30 second ad can tell a story.

Campaigns are generally unable to produce a series of television or radio spots that can tell a story in the same way that direct mail can. In direct mail, a campaign can grab voter’s attention and appeal to their hearts. The campaign can address several issues or inoculate an attack. The campaign can go on the attack or list endorsements with direct mail. And direct mail allows a campaign to call votes to perform an action. Just as each type of direct mail piece is its own production, so should a television ad. Instead of telling a story across multiple ads, a story has to be told in 30 seconds. The message of the story should be clear and not confusing.

If an opponent attacks a candidate on television, then the response must be made on television. A response should always occur in the same medium that the attack was made. The purpose for responding in the same medium is to reach the exact same voters that the opponent reached when making the attack. If an opponent makes an attack on television, and a campaign responds on the radio, then two things have just happened. First, the television viewers who saw the original attack have most likely not heard the response. Second, the radio listening audience that did not see the original attack ad is now aware of a previously unknown issue.

Candidate endorsements can be incorporated into an ad. A Call to Action can occur on an attack ad or an issues ad. Inoculation rarely occurs on television. The time on television is too valuable and scarce to spend on addressing an inoculation issue.

Budget

A campaign makes many of its decisions based on the campaign budget. Whether or not to place time in television or radio depends on how much the budget has. In order to adequately penetrate, prospective voters need to view or hear an ad repetitively over the course of its run. If a campaign can only run ads for a single day, then it really needs to evaluate if it is spending its money the best possible way it can. Television usually requires a significant investment in order to properly deliver a message.7.3 Phones

If used properly, a campaign plan that incorporates telemarketing can be very effective for a relatively low cost. Telephones can be used effectively in a campaign, but telephones can also be improperly used. A telephone campaign is generally a cost effective way to raise candidate awareness, advocate on behalf of a candidate, conduct virtual town hall meetings, gather information, and microtarget the district.

Some states or jurisdictions do not allow for recorded phone messages to be transmitted en masse. Political calls are generally exempt from such laws, but a campaign should be very aware of the laws regarding telemarketing and what is allowed. Even if a candidate feels that a court challenge to a law prohibiting political calls is winnable, the campaign should consider if the cost and risk associated with such publicity is worth it. Some areas have laws to prohibit calls because the people in those areas simply do not like them. Most jurisdictions also have disclaimer rules that require a short disclaimer at the end or beginning of a call that identifies who paid for the call along with a contact phone number.

When considering adding phones in the campaign plan, the campaign team must consider the goals. What will be gained through the telephone portion of the campaign? Sample phone call scripts are found in Appendix M.

Raising candidate awareness and advocating a candidate

During the final weeks of a campaign leading to Election Day, many campaigns employ a tactic in which voters receive phone messages urging them to vote for a candidate. The calls are recorded messages sent out to voting households usually by a firm that specializes in telecommunications. Sometimes the call is recorded by the candidate, and sometimes the call is recorded by a third party in support of a candidate. The purpose of such a call is generally twofold: to raise name identification of a candidate and to say good things about a candidate.

An effective strategy is to plan on 3 or 4 calls to be delivered over the course of the last two weeks of the campaign. Too many calls may become a nuisance. The first three calls are generally successful if recorded by a third party supporter. Popular officeholders that are already elected in the same district are effective as well as other members of the campaign committee that have some stature in the community. An ideal call should be less than thirty seconds including the disclaimer. The call should use the name of the candidate multiple times and speak to the message of the campaign. Rehearsing the call prior to recording is important so that it sounds natural and not forced.

If the first call begins two weeks from Election Day, and the campaign is conducting four messages, they should be spaced three to four days apart from each other. If the calls are placed too closely together, then it may seem like overkill to the voter. The time of day that the calls are placed is very important as well. It is generally advisable, when delivering advocacy calls, to reach as many voicemail and answering machines as possible. If someone picks up the phone and listens to an obviously recorded message that is not interactive, the likelihood of them listening to the entire message is low. However, if a voter is listening to voicemail, then he or she is expecting recordings – that is the nature of voicemail. The likelihood of successfully delivering the entire message is increased.

The final call should be delivered on the day prior to Election Day. The final call is recorded by the candidate and is a reminder to vote coupled with a direct appeal for the listener’s support.

Virtual Community Forum

Something that some telecommunications firms offer is termed as a virtual community forum similar to a town hall meeting on the phone. A virtual community forum is an event in which the candidate is available on a teleconference to speak to people in the district. A virtual forum can be an event that is advertised in which people may call in, or it can be an event that the campaign plans in which it calls targeted voters to provide the instant opportunity to participate in a town hall session.

A virtual forum usually also requires a moderator with a computer who can see what voters are calling in or see what voters are participating through the campaign’s solicitation. The moderator can speak to each caller privately to screen their thoughts before being given the chance to speak. The moderator can also join the live town hall to help guide the candidate to stay on message if a rogue caller gets off topic.

A virtual forum is an opportunity to raise candidate awareness, but it also provides other unique benefits. A candidate can express the campaign message or views on issues important to voters. The forum also allows participants to feel as though they have invested something into the campaign of a particular candidate. A forum may be a good time to acquire verbatim responses or feelings of the participants. Forums can also provide access for potential “virtual hecklers” as well.

A forum is an expense for campaigns that should only occur if certain other telephone elements have already been used such as information gathering and candidate awareness. A virtual forum will be more effective and garner greater participation if the participants have heard of the candidate.

Gathering Information and Microtargeting

Telephone polls have been around since almost the advent of the telephone. In the past, polling the electorate has been conducted by live operators asking questions from a phone script. Technology now allows for interactive sessions with a recorded operator and a live participant. Such sessions use voice activated software to discern “yes” and “no” replies as well as other basic responses.

The telephone poll is important in a campaign to determine the issues, the impact of the campaign, what demographics support a candidate or position and what issues will move voters towards or away from supporting a candidate. A poll is simply gathering data so that a campaign can make decisions about how to use different issues or if it needs to inoculate a candidate on an issue. A poll can tell a campaign if it needs to focus on women or men, seniors or young families, whites or blacks, or any number of cross tab breakdowns. Polls also provide benchmarks for a campaign. Is it gaining or losing voters? Are undecided voters breaking towards the candidate or the opponent?

Other types of polls can be done by live or recorded operators. Recorded interactive polls are generally much less expensive and have the ability to reach everyone in a district affordably. An interactive poll can be used to identify each household that participates in a call as to where it stands on various issues. In order to promote participation, the poll should be recorded in the voice of the candidate and be as short as possible. It is valuable to identify households that are pro-life or pro-choice, pro-2nd Amendment or pro-gun control, and other so-called social issues. In close races, a campaign team may look to its microtargeting data and decide to send decidedly targeted messages to the micro-targeted households. This type of campaigning is also referred to as identity campaigning.

Telephones can also be used to secure sign locations, identify potential supporters and prospect donors. In the past, campaigns would schedule days or weeks of volunteers to make phone calls to voters in order to secure yard sign locations. A smart campaign can now add a question about allowing the use of a yard sign into an interactive poll. After the participant answers the targeting information, he or she is then asked if they support the candidate. “Yes” answers are followed by a solicitation for a yard sign location and/or if they would like to be a donor. Keeping the poll brief is important to maximize the number of participants that complete the entire survey.

The timing of an interactive survey should be during the evening. Since recorded surveys can be broadcast inexpensively, most firms will make three attempts to contact households over two or three days - twice in the evening and once in the morning. The goal of an interactive survey, as opposed to an advocacy message, is to reach as many people at home as possible.

Many candidates overlook the value of using telephones in a campaign. Telephones are like any other medium in which a campaign delivers message. Finding the right balance between too little and too much when it comes to phone campaigns is important. Phone campaigns through firms can also be used to free up volunteers who would otherwise be on the phone so that they can participate in other volunteer efforts. The information gathered through a telephone campaign can also be used in other facets of the campaign plan such as direct mail.7.4 Web Site

Almost every campaign has a web site regardless of the size of the race. From township trustee and city council to the Presidential races, nearly every campaign has a presence on the Internet. The Internet can be an incredible resource for candidates as well as voters seeking information. As with everything else in the campaign, the web site should be crafted to deliver the message of the campaign and to incorporate the proper _resources/books//The Political Campaign Desk Reference_ A G - Michael McNamara of the campaign.

Certain information should always appear on a campaign web site. Some information is nice to have but unnecessary. There is also information that should never appear on a campaign web site. The important thing to consider about the web site is making it appear seamlessly along with the rest of the campaign. The web site should incorporate the _resources/books//The Political Campaign Desk Reference_ A G - Michael McNamara and captions being used in television and direct mail. The campaign logo should be prominent on the web site. The message is the same on the web site as everywhere else in the campaign. In essence, the campaign web site is a virtual embodiment of the campaign.

Essential information on a campaign web site includes a professional photo of the candidate, also known as a “head shot”, the campaign logo, disclaimer and a short introduction from the candidate expressing why he or she is running for office. Other important links to have from the home page include an endorsements and testimonials page, a press page, a campaign committee page, a donor/volunteer page and an issues page. An “about the candidate” page is also important to have.

Secondary information for a campaign web site might include photos from the campaign trail, external links, information about the district, electronic copies of literature, radio and television ads. Information that should never show up on a campaign web site includes a campaign calendar, a blog from the candidate, personal candidate information, and extraneous campaign information.

The prominent placement of the campaign logo helps connect the web site to the rest of the campaign. A head shot on the web site will help connect the candidate to stories about the candidate in the paper. The head shot should also be on the site as a resource for members of the media who have not received it from the campaign. A discussion of earned media occurs later in this chapter. A disclaimer is almost always required by federal or state elections law. The central portion of the home page for the campaign’s web site should be a brief statement from the candidate. The statement should answer the question as to why the candidate is running for office and highlight the two or three strengths of the candidate without going into detail.

The campaign web site should also have a link to an “endorsements” or “testimonials” page in which all of the campaign’s committee members are listed. Any organizations that have endorsed the candidate should also appear on this page. Pictures of prominent or highly recognizable team members should be present on the page. In addition, quotes from those endorsing the candidate can be placed on the endorsement page. It is one thing to list someone as a committee member, but to have a quote on the web site implies a different level of engagement in the campaign.

A press page should contain press releases from the campaign as well as links to stories about the candidate. A head shot should be available for the press on this page. Reporters covering political races rely on the Internet as a resource, and a campaign should make it as easy as possible for reporters to find the information they are looking for.

An “issues” page should appear on a web site. Any issue that the candidate has expressed a view on should be on the web page. The description of the candidate’s position on each issue should be brief and broad. Becoming too detailed on an issue can create a situation in which an opponent might use a candidate’s own words against the campaign. Just because a candidate has an opinion on an issue does not mean that it should be on the site. A campaign should be judicious about what information is included on the web site.

An “about the candidate” page can be a narrative story about the candidate, or it can be a reproduction of the candidate’s resume. People want to know about the candidate as a person, and the “about” page is the campaign’s chance to humanize the candidate. Pictures should be used on all pages to enhance the appearance and interest of the site, and the “about” page is no exception.

No web site should be without a page or button that allows a visitor to donate money or time to the campaign. At the very least, a campaign web site should have a way of allowing the visitor to provide e-mail and contact information to the campaign. Volunteers and donors can begin as simple visitors looking for information.

A campaign should never print a calendar of events on its web site. Only campaign staff and pertinent volunteers should know where a candidate will appear. Events can be posted after the fact with pictures to show that the candidate is on the campaign trail. Adding a calendar to the web site allows any opponent to know what events to attend. A calendar is also a resource for opponents to organize an embarrassing protest of a candidate because they know where to go and when. A calendar also may have an unintended consequence of missing events in the area and thereby offending people that the campaign does not wish to offend. Campaign calendars are a bad idea for a web site.

Some candidates for office think it is a good idea to post a web log or “blog” on a web site. The problem with a blog is that the people who will read it most is a campaign’s opponents. A campaign should assume that its opponent is always looking for a way to embarrass a candidate or trip a candidate up. It is effective to attack a campaign by using the candidate’s own words. A blog presents opponents with potential ammunition in a campaign. Campaign blogging should be accomplished through third parties and with volunteers who blog. A candidate with a blog creates a potential problem.

Some campaigns have “secret” pages on a web site and web based database management. Anything that a campaign does not want an opponent to view or access should never post it on the web. Campaign security can be compromised by a good hacker, unsecured computer or Internet connection, disgruntled staffer, former employee of the candidate and other means. It happens, and campaigns that rely on web-based technology to manage a campaign run a greater risk of a security breach. A campaign database is one of the most useful and valuable assets in a campaign, and placing it on the Internet increases the opportunity for corruption, loss of data or unintentional data transfer to third parties.

A web site can be an incredible resource for pushing information out to voters. A good web site can also be a fundraising tool as well as a tool to aggregate volunteer information. Campaigns should always have a web site but also be cautious about what information is placed on that site.7.5 Letters to the Editor

Letters to the editor of local papers are among the most effect means of using newspapers. Although political newspaper advertising is generally not effective, unless the ad itself becomes a topic for news, letters to the editor are. Letters to the editor are also inexpensive as the only resources they require are time, information and volunteers. Many readers of publications, especially local newspapers, will read the letters written to the publication. Assuming that the letter writers use their own stamps or computers to submit their letters, money is not involved with letters to the editor.

An aggressive letter campaign can be used to communicate the same information that the campaign is communicating through direct mail, phones or electronic media. In a well-run letter writing campaign, the campaign team will assemble a list of local publications pertinent to the district with ever possible means of submitting letters listed such as snail mail, fax, web or e-mail. If a newspaper accepts submissions through a web form or e-mail, then that should be utilized because the paper will not have to recreate the letter – it will already be in electronic format.

Volunteers who write letters should be told to expect a confirmation call or e-mail from the newspaper. Many newspapers will not publish letters unless they can confirm the authenticity of the author. All volunteers should have the list of publications so that they can submit their letters to as many as possible. Letter writers should also be provided with a sheet of campaign talking points. It is important for writers to stay on message, so they need to know the message.

Letter writers are also excellent third parties that can bring up a potentially negative issue for the opponent without it coming directly from the campaign. Readers of the publication who visit the letters section go there to find out what other people are thinking. An aggressive letter campaign can help guide public opinion on certain subjects.

Some volunteers do not feel comfortable articulating issues by themselves. It is not unethical for a campaign to prepare a letter that reflects the views of the volunteer and then to give it to the volunteer for their changes. The volunteer is ultimately the one who submits the letter and takes responsibility for it. Most volunteers take the prewritten example and use it merely as a guideline.

A campaign should always aggressively engage in letter writing. It is relatively quick, easy and inexpensive and usually has fast results. Letter writers can be guided to stay on message, and it is a good way for a campaign to go on the attack through a third party. Opponents will usually have their own letter writing campaign, so it is important to have a large amount of people writing as well as discipline to stay on message.7.6 Earned Media

Earned media is exactly as it suggests – media exposure that does not cost the campaign money resources. Earned media refers to news programming and other events that gain some sort of media exposure either on television, radio, print publications or web sites. Campaigns can gain earned media through many tactics such as press releases, media advisories, press conferences, campaign events, community events attended by the campaign, or interviews on a topic. The next section goes into more detail about successful press releases, media advisories and press conferences.

Campaign events can include rallies in which high profile people will speak to volunteers to promote the candidate and energize the troops. Another type of campaign event might be a big weekend day near the election in which dozens of volunteers will door-to-door or perform other volunteer activities to reach voters. The two keys to a successful campaign event that generates coverage are volunteers and reporters.

A lackluster event in terms of volunteer turnout, with media present, could turn out to be a poor story for the campaign instead of a positive one. If a campaign stages a rally or has a volunteer blitz and invites the media, then the volunteer coordinator and political director must work together to drive turnout to the event. Members of the media, after witnessing a large group will then want to see some kind of plan or organization. In essence, they want structure and a point to the event. It might be a good idea to have media shadowing the candidate going door-to-door speaking with voters. At a rally, the media should have access to the candidate as well as the high profile people present that are supporting the candidate. If a reporter obtains a positive quote from a voter or high profile supporter and puts it in the story, then the campaign has scored another win. The first win was getting a story at all.

If the campaign receives intelligence that a community event is going to be covered by the local media on a specific date and time, then the campaign has a prime opportunity to be seen and gain exposure at the event. For instance, a community picnic or festival is happening at a local park. Volunteers in campaign t-shirts should arrive well in advance of the media and circulate through the crowd. If the campaign invested in stickers, then festival patrons should be given them to wear on their shirts. A campaign volunteer that is not in campaign clothing should also be available if the media present decides to conduct a “man on the street” interview. The interviewee can mention how great it is to see so many people from a certain candidate’s campaign supporting the event. If the camera pans the crowd, it will hopefully pick up the many campaign revelers at the festival. If the candidate is attending the festival, the media may take the opportunity for a “spontaneous” interview. Earned media is often being at the right place at the right time.

Some issues are more important to certain areas than others. If a candidate is an expert or authority on a hot-button issue in an area, then the media should be encouraged to use that candidate in an official capacity. Oftentimes this happens with incumbents for office speaking about local issues. If they use their office wisely, they can gain media time and exposure that is not subject to equal time laws because of its official nature. Incumbency is a powerful tool that a candidate can use. It usually falls under the “strengths” category. If an issue important to voters can somehow be addressed by the office a candidate currently holds, then every effort should be made to positively address the issue in a way that voters will favor. If a candidate is not a current officeholder or incumbent, being an expert speaker at a high profile conference or civic event might also gain earned media attention.

Earned media can be as powerful as a television spot or publication advertisement. A difference is that people watching the news are more apt to see a news story about a candidate than a television spot. A negative difference is that news stories are generally on a 24 hour cycle. An event with a candidate may only play once in that period as opposed to television spots that play numerous times on numerous channels. A campaign would much rather have earned media than not.7.7 Press Releases, Media Advisories and Press Conferences

Nearly every campaign, at one point or another, will come in contact with the media. An effective campaign builds a relationship with the media that ideally develops into a positive long-term, professional relationship once a candidate takes office. A campaign can meet this goal by keeping the media informed of its activities and events.

Chapter 1 discussed information gathering and acquiring the contact information for all media that cover the race or within the jurisdiction of the office being sought. An individual should be identified at each outlet that can be contacted whenever a communication is sent. Also, developing a relationship with reporters is important because they will be more apt to act quickly on a potential story if they have a relationship they value with the campaign. News outlets thrive on information, and the people who provide the most information that is relevant are more valuable than people who provide inane or useless information. Therefore, it is not only important to establish a good relationship with reporters, it is important to also provide relevant news.

Press Releases

The easiest way to push information to reporters is through the use of press releases. Press releases are also most effective when they are written in AP style, which is the same style reporters use to write stories. In essence, reporters use a technique commonly referred to as the “inverted pyramid”. The pyramid is an abstract representation of how a story should be written. The most important information in a story appears at the beginning and answers the questions of who, what, where, when, why and how. Moving down the pyramid is less important information such as quotes. At the bottom of the pyramid is the least important information such as ancillary background information that is not necessary to the story but enhances it and is still relevant.

Entire college courses and textbooks teach what the last paragraph talked about. It takes some people years to master it. A campaign does not need to master journalistic style, but it is most helpful to a journalist if the same rules they follow are employed in a press release. For instance, as a journalist writes a story using a press release as a reference, the journalist will most likely write the story according to the style described above. As the journalist writes the story, it is helpful if the progress of the press release matches the natural progression of how the journalist will write the article. In essence, the journalist can follow the press release down and incorporate it while writing the story. Campaigns that use this style are much more successful in communicating their thoughts right into print than campaigns that ignore common journalism devices.

Press releases should also be sent vie e-mail whenever possible. In an age of mobile communications, reporters are often out of the office or on the road following a story and writing and submitting stories electronically. Furthermore, it is much easier, and leaves less room for error, if a reporter can cut-and-paste a quote from an e-mail press release rather than re-type a quote from a hard-copy release. Therefore, merely sending a fax to a reporter with a press release has become obsolete. Conventional wisdom, however, suggests that a fax copy of the press release should also be sent to the media at the same time it is being e-mailed. If there is an avenue for message delivery to the press, it should be used.

Circumstances in which press releases should be sent include any event that is newsworthy that involves the candidates. From campaign rallies and functions to third party events in which a candidate receives an award. If a candidate is releasing a policy statement or taking an opponent to task on an issue, press releases are appropriate. Press releases are excellent for announcing a person’s candidacy or filing petitions for office. Press releases can also be used to attack an opponent’s weakness on an issue. If a candidate challenges an opponent to debates or responds to a charge, press releases are appropriate. Press releases communicate any information that the campaign wishes voters to have. A press release does not always get printed or reported, but that should not dissuade a campaign from sending releases out with relevant information.

Press releases should always be brief. Just as news stories in the paper do not go on page after page, a press release should not either. Ideally, a press release is a single page that covers all of the information a campaign wishes to communicate, provides relevant quotes supporting the campaign’s story, and supplies the contact information so that a reporter can make a follow-up contact when writing the story. Contact information should usually be that of the campaign manager or press aide so that reporters and their questions can be fully vetted and the candidate prepared before returning the call to the media. Press aides should only handle background information, but quotes should go to the candidate. It is the candidate who is running for office – not the press aide or campaign manager. It is helpful to the candidate to have the questions from a reporter ahead of time. Candidate preparedness also favors a reporter because a call back from the candidate will usually be shorter and on topic so that the reporter can write the story in a more timely manner and have less extraneous information to sift through in order to do so.

Some reporters may demand to speak directly to a candidate and not wish to supply their questions before the candidate has a chance to call back. Reporters who act in such a manner should be approached with caution because they may not trust that they will get an honest answer if a candidate is prepared, they may want to catch a candidate in an unguarded moment or they simply do not wish to talk to a press aide because of self-importance. It is important that a candidate become well practiced at staying on the topic the candidate wishes to talk about. Prepared quotes are important, and they should roll off the candidate’s tongue as though they are natural responses. A candidate should review and have the press release nearby when speaking with a reporter.

Often an uncooperative reporter is the result of the campaign not developing the proper relationship at the beginning of the campaign. If the campaign did not take the proper time to introduce itself to the reporter, supply information to the reporter and maintain communications with the reporter, then should anyone on the campaign be surprised when a reporter is more guarded? The campaign press contact, when making the first introduction to the reporter, should create the understanding that campaign staffers, including the press contact, should never be quoted if possible and that campaign quotes should be attributable to the candidate. Professional campaigns make every effort to keep the candidate in the news and not the campaign staff.

Press releases are an important tool in a campaign, and some thought should be put into them before sending them out. All of the information contained in a release should be correct and everything documented. Hyperbole should be used with caution because a release that is too outrageous may be discarded. Spelling and grammar should be impeccable. Information in a release should also be relevant – a campaign does not want to get a reputation for sending out a press release for inconsequential matters.

Appendix D contains some sample press releases that provide relevant reasons for sending a press release as well as the style that should be used.

Media Advisories

A media advisory is a type of press release. It is distributed in exactly the same way as a press release, but the amount of information contained in an advisory is small. A media advisory is generally used as an alert that a newsworthy event is about to occur or that a campaign is going to hold a press conference. A media advisory contains the basic information that the media needs to know in order to be at the right spot at the right time in order to report the newsworthy event.

The format of a media advisory should be easily readable. A media advisory does not require professional journalism style or a narrative format. The ideal advisory has headings with a brief description under each heading. The headings are “Who”, “What”, “Where” and “When”. Sometimes a campaign will add a short quote as a teaser for the event. The description under the “what” heading is the campaign’s opportunity to grab the interest of the reporter or news desk assignment editor. Advisories should only contain enough information to convince the press that they should attend an event and where and when to attend.

If the advisory has done a good job of piquing interest in the press, the campaign may receive calls in advance of the event. The campaign can determine how much information it wishes to supply in advance, but allowing one outlet to scoop all of the others may make the event “old news” before it even happens. Some reporter may have demonstrated their willingness to print or air much of what the campaign supplies. It is a general rule to keep the outlets that are most receptive to campaign communications in the “front line” of information.

Media advisories are appropriate to announce press conferences in advance or to let the media know when and where the candidate will be such as when the candidate files petitions for office, attends a rally for an issue or is invited to be with a dignitary who may be visiting the area. Media advisories are also appropriate to inform the media that a candidate is available to comment on an issue thereby allowing access to the candidate for occasions that do not rise to the level of press conference. Media advisories are inappropriate for communicating complex subjects that a press release can do.

Press Conferences

A press conference is an event in itself. A campaign holds a press conference because it wishes to generate a high level of awareness on an important topic for the campaign and to generate exposure of the candidate. Press conferences are driven by both message and image. A skilled campaign will marry the two seamlessly in the press conference. Attention to detail during press conferences is extremely important.

A campaign will generally announce a press conference about 12 to 24 hours prior to the event. Sometimes something occurs that necessitates short notice for press conferences such as events or charges that require a quick response. Whatever the reason for the press conference, a campaign should e-mail an advisory to reporters and assignment editors when appropriate. If a press conference is a planned event that is not necessitated by factors the campaign cannot control, then the campaign should choose to hold it on a day and at a time that news crews will be available. Planning a press conference for days and times in which reporters are generally covering other stories, meetings or events is a bad idea and a recipe for poor press attendance.

The location for the event should be accessible by the media. The proximity should be near the area where newspaper and television crews can quickly be present. Being near an interstate or area that is familiar to the press is ideal. Parking should be ample so that reporters do not need to struggle to find parking, pay for parking or walk far from their vehicle to the conference. Making the press conference accessible does not guarantee success in recruiting participation, but it does help. Sometimes a reporter may be in transit from covering one story to another, and if the location and access is convenient, the reporter may decide to cover the conference.

Sometimes the location of a press conference itself is an illustration of the press conference. If a candidate is running against an incumbent and wishes to announce a jobs package while criticizing the incumbent for a recent loss of jobs, then the campaign may select a location outside a recently closed factory or business. If a candidate wants to talk about crime, holding a press conference outside the county jail might be appropriate. In instances such as these, the campaign should make provisions for any permits required in advance. A candidate does not want to arrive at a press conference about crime and end up getting a ticket or being arrested for lack of acquiring proper permits.

Once the initial advisory is broadcast, the campaign should immediately call the members of the press to confirm receipt and to gauge interest. If interest is low, or the time turns out to be bad, then the campaign may need to make a quick adjustment and re-broadcast a new advisory with follow-up calls. If more than a few hours notice was given, the campaign should re-broadcast the media advisory a few hours prior to the press conference. The same assignment editor does not always sit at the newsroom desk every minute of every day. A media advisory that was received by one editor six hours ago might be a different editor than the one currently covering the newsroom. Therefore, making sure the right people have access to the information at the right time is important. After follow-up calls and re-broadcasts, a campaign should have a good idea as to who is covering the press conference.

The set-up of the press conference is as important as the message of the press conference. The staging of the candidate should be in an area that is camera friendly. If appropriate, campaign banners or signs should be clearly visible behind the candidate regardless of the angle that a camera shot is taken. A podium is generally a good idea so that notes and water can be within reach of the candidate, and a sign can be placed on the front of the podium. Media microphones can also be placed on a podium. It can be impressive to see a candidate at a podium with multiple media microphones, but the candidate should be situated so that the microphones do not obscure a shot of the candidate.

If supporters or a group of people will be standing with the candidate, they should be situated so that they complement the candidate but do not distract from the candidate. The candidate can be slightly raised above the others by just a few inches, or the supporters can be situated far enough behind the candidate that they are visible but slightly out of focus.

Some campaigns will use visual aids. Any visual aids should be enlarged and placed on boards suitable to be displayed on an easel. Visual aids should help tell a story, but they should not be distracting. The information on them should also be concealed prior to the beginning of the press conference. Visual aids can be anything from charts and graphs that illustrate a point to pictures or diagrams. Whatever aids are used, they should be relevant. If the candidate can communicate a message without visual aids, then they are not required.

The area of the press conference should be well lit. The candidate should wear colors that are friendly to television and contrast with the background. A slight amount of make-up or powder, even for male candidates, can be appropriate in order to remove blemishes or “shine” from the face. A campaign should reduce the chance that a viewer will be distracted from the message of a press conference because of a shiny spot on a nose or forehead.

Refreshments can be served but are not necessary. Reporters do not wish to feel as though they are being coaxed into doing a good story for a campaign, but at the same time it is important to have a certain level of comfort. Refreshments should be no more complicated than coffee and water and perhaps some cookies or pastries. If the campaign chooses to supply them, refreshments should not be in the same room as the press conference.

Press conferences should begin on time. If an outlet has not arrived within five minutes after the time the conference was scheduled to begin, then the press conference should still occur. If the outlet finally arrives, the reporter can catch up at the end or get an “exclusive” interview although the rest of the reporters already have the story. For media outlets that did not participate, the campaign should make every effort to supply them with the information from the press conference. It may be advisable to offer to have the candidate go to the television station of the local affiliate that did not attend in order to speak with a reporter there and go on camera. Most news outlets do not like to be “scooped” by competitors, so they may make an effort to reciprocate in accommodating the campaign.

When the press arrives at a press conference, reporters should be greeted and escorted to the press conference area. Reporters should also receive a press packet with a copy of a press release about the press conference. The press release is the campaign’s version of what is said at a press conference and will be a point of reference for the reporter when writing the story. Any visual aids should be included in the press packet. In addition, all contents of the press packet should be e-mailed to the media after the event. A campaign should make it as easy as possible for a reporter to tell a story it wants.

Press conferences are ideally short. Reporters have a lot of area to cover and a finite amount of time. The actual statement portion of a press conference should be no more than 10 minutes. After the statement portion is over, a question-and-answer session is probably appropriate. If a candidate takes questions, then the campaign team should have prepared well in advance by playing the role of reporters to the candidate and asking the most likely questions. This role play will allow for a more prepared and relaxed candidate.

Once a press conference is over and the proper follow-up has taken place, the campaign should arrange to have any broadcast stories on television or radio recorded. Footage and still shots from a successful press conference can be a compelling image on television, the Internet or in direct mail.   

# CHAPTER 8

### Grassroots Campaigning

Before television ads, direct mail or telephones, grassroots campaigning existed. The term “grassroots” refers to campaigning on a personal basis in which the campaign has direct contact with voters. The grassroots campaign is the “ground war” of the campaign whereas direct mail, Internet, phones and broadcast media constitute the “air war.” As discussed throughout this manual, campaigns use the four TIMP resources – time, information, money and people. The air war uses money and information while the grassroots ground war requires heavy amounts of time and people to make it effective. Chapter 8 will discuss how to utilize these resources effectively.8.1 Door-to-Door

There are few things that a candidate can do in a campaign that are as effective as door-to-door campaigning. Door-to-door campaigning allows the candidate, or a well trained surrogate to meet voters one on one and appeal directly for their votes. Few candidates have enough personal time to knock on every voting household in a district, so the operation requires targeting in order for the candidate to canvass the most important precincts to winning the campaign.

The candidate should have certain tools when knocking on doors in a precinct. These tools include a walking list of voter addresses, absentee or mail ballot request forms, campaign handbill, pen, nametag and a bottle of water. With these tools, a candidate will be able to effectively win votes in many of the houses in which contact is made.

The walking list for a precinct should be sorted by street name, then by house number and then by last name. This allows a candidate to travel the precinct and reference the current street. By sorting by house number, the candidate can skip houses in which no relevant voters live. For instance 101 Union Street may have three voters but no one registered as a Democrat. If the candidate is running in a Democratic primary race, then 101 Union Street is an address that should be skipped. Furthermore, a candidate can also see how many people are registered at a single address, their names and how they vote. A campaign team should customize a walking list so that the candidate has room to mark whether an address will allow a yard sign, will vote for the candidate or to write other pertinent notes.

Absentee or mail ballot request forms are necessary for the people that the candidate identifies as supporters. Anyone who is identified as a supporter should be encouraged to vote early by mail if allowed. A campaign encourages early mail voting to ensure that every possible supporter in fact votes for the candidate. Many races in American history have been decided by a handful of votes or even a single vote. Sometimes this occurs because someone who meant to vote did not either because of forgetfulness, emergency, very recent death, vacation or any other reason that prevented a voter from going to a polling location on Election Day. A close race cannot afford to allow votes to slip by. Request forms should not be distributed to voters whose support cannot be gauged.

Campaign handbills are important for door-to-door because they provide the essential information about a candidate that a voter needs. Handbills remind voters that a candidate visited their home, and they serve as a reference for voters. A handbill should be visually appealing and image driven very similar to direct mail. An effective handbill communicates the message of the campaign, has appealing pictures of the candidate and contains some background information as well as a web site address. The handbill can be something a candidate can use to focus the attention of the voter when canvassing a neighborhood and the candidate can reference information directly from the handbill.

A pen is necessary for taking good notes for the campaign team to transcribe into the database. A nametag is important so that the voter knows who they are about to talk to when peering at the stranger in front of their door through their peephole or curtains. A nametag helps to disarm a reticent voter who might otherwise be unsure about opening the door to a complete stranger. The voter also does not know that the candidate has information about each voter on a walking list. A bottle of water is for the candidate to stay refreshed while walking neighborhoods.

The candidate, in making the initial introduction to a voter at their home, should begin by explaining the reason he or she is running for the office. By the end of the 10-15 second introduction, the voter should have a copy of the handbill in hand. The candidate can follow up with a quick listing of their top two or three strengths and then go into the “listening” part of the conversation. A candidate should take notes if a voter is particularly passionate about an issue especially if the issue is one that the candidate can affect once in office. At the end of the conversation, the candidate should ask if they can count on the support of the voter. If the answer is “yes”, a note should be taken on the walking list. All “yes” responses should be encouraged to vote early by mail.

Follow up all “yes” or “maybe” responses with a request for a yard sign. Indicate the voter’s wish for a yard sign on the walking list. Since the precincts walked by the candidate are the most important targeted precincts, the presence of yard signs will have a greater effect than in other precincts. Ideally, the time spent at each home will be 2-3 minutes. Some voters require more time while others will require less.

Not everyone will be home, and it is good for neighbors to see the yard sign of the candidate in their neighborhood. In the event a voter is not home or does not come to the door, the candidate should have a number of handbills that have a pre-written “Sorry I missed you” note on them. The handbill should be left in an easy to find as well as easy to access location so the voter will see it when they return.

Some door-to-door campaigns add extra steps to increase effectiveness. About one week prior to walking a precinct, the targeted households receive a post card from the campaign that announces that the candidate will be visiting voters in the neighborhood. These post cards assist in name identification for the candidate but also commit the candidate to going door-to-door there. The pre-walk postcards also help to break the ice with voters in the precinct because they are expecting to see the candidate. Some candidates, to save on costs, may opt for a pre-walk recorded phone message. Phone messages are less effective because not everyone that will be visited has a phone number listed.

Some campaigns will follow up with post-walk cards or phone calls from the campaign as well. The message on the card or call is as simple as a “thank you” and a repeat of the top two or three points the candidate went over during the visit. The pre-walk and post-walk effort also impacts the people that were not home.

The direct, personal contact and appeal for votes made by the candidate in door-to-door operations is one of the most effective appeals in the campaign and is more likely than any other aspect of the campaign to have a high ratio of voters reached to votes gained. A poor door-to-door operation, unprepared candidate, bad message or unappealing candidate can have a negative effect in door-to-door operations. Candidates should always make an effort to be upbeat, look professional, be prepared and confident in order to “close the deal” when talking to voters.8.2 Coffees

Campaign coffees are events that the campaign team sets up with volunteers and supporters. Little to no involvement of the candidate is needed in planning and preparing a coffee except to appear when expected at the coffee. Coffees are effective for candidates to gain exposure in neighborhoods in the home of someone who lives in a targeted area. Coffees are host driven events but require coordination with the campaign.

The traditional coffee event is a gathering of homemakers in a neighborhood on a morning when the candidate can make the best use of time. The host will work with the campaign team to set date and time. The host invites the attendees, and everyone arrives 20-30 minutes before the candidate arrives. The host provides coffee, tea and whatever other refreshments are appropriate. When the candidate arrives, the host introduces the candidate. The candidate will speak and answer questions for about 20-30 minutes before leaving for the next event.

Once the candidate leaves the event, the host should have sign-up cards for the campaign and envelopes for donations. These cards and envelopes should be distributed to the attendees and collected by the host before everyone leaves. The campaign should follow up with the host quickly in order to obtain any information or donations and to update the campaign database.

Coffees have evolved over time to no longer necessarily be simply coffees. Coffees also are not necessarily women-only events and not required to be mid-morning events. In fact, the only part of the coffee model that necessarily remains the same is that it is host driven. Coffees can also become neighborhood gatherings, bar-b-q or reception.

Some candidates will find that certain areas prefer a family oriented event or a backyard gathering to a coffee. The point to the coffee is that it is a good way for the candidate to spend just a little time to meet multiple people and for the campaign to gather information and possibly money. As long as the elements of the event are incorporated (being host driven, takes little of the candidate’s time and gathers information and supporters), then the format of the “coffee” is up to the host and the campaign. The campaign should be cautious of becoming involved with a large-scale event that requires time and effort to help the host to plan. If the campaign has to spend inordinate amounts of time, money and people resources into an event, then the purpose of the host driven event is lost.8.3 Rallies

Rallies serve many purposes. They generate energy and help build momentum on a campaign. Rallies allow people who do not know much about a candidate to learn a little bit more and meet supporters. Rallies can also be events in which materials and tasks are assigned to campaign volunteers. Rallies can be instructional in nature. They can be open to the public, or they can be by invitation only. The overall purpose of a rally is to generate “buzz” and interest in a candidate and campaign.

A rally is not a fundraising event, so a campaign has to understand what it wishes to accomplish from a rally before choosing a date, time and venue. Time, money and people resources are going to be utilized in executing a rally. Therefore, the campaign should utilize the rally to accomplish as much as possible in a short amount of time spending as little as possible to do it.

Timing of a rally is important as well. With so much time, money and people being expended for a rally, it would be unwise to hold one more than a week or two before Election Day unless to purpose of the rally is to kick off the campaign. The rally must also be held at a time that is convenient for people to attend and at a venue that is easy to access and has plenty of parking. The campaign must choose wisely in order to make it as easy as possible for people to attend the rally.

Unless a race is a presidential campaign or a hotly contested statewide or congressional contest, a campaign will probably have a small number of rallies and not weekly or regular rallies. Smaller races have to plan what must be accomplished during the event. A rally will not work without one thing: people, and a lot of them. A rally is not a rally without people, and recruiting people to attend a rally is the toughest challenge of a campaign.

A campaign may start by creating a reason for the rally. If the campaign makes the rally an event that volunteers will receive handbills, t-shirts, signs and poll assignments for poll working on Election Day, then volunteers will more likely show up. Volunteers alone generally do not make a rally. A campaign will also want to get interested people to attend the rally. By welcoming families and having snacks and drinks available, the campaign may be able to drive turnout to those who may otherwise stay away for lack of child care. The voting households in the precincts surrounding the venue should also receive post card invitations about two weeks out followed up by a phone call placed by a volunteer within a week of the event. All members of the campaign committee should attend.

Another way to create a draw for the event is to invite other elected officeholders or community leaders as “headliners” or guest speakers. Top billing always goes to the candidate, but the addition of popular people to the event makes it more enticing for voters. In addition, other elected officeholders have their own campaign teams and volunteers. If those elected officials are participating in the event, then their organizations should also be invited thereby increasing attendance and creating a bigger event with more momentum and energy.

If a campaign knows that attendance will be good, the media can be invited to attend. Having media attend a rally is a good opportunity for reporters to gain an impression that the campaign is strong and energized. An article that reflects the energy in the crowd is a good thing if the rally is executed properly. If the media is invited to attend, a special area near the area where people will be speaking should be secured just for them so that they are able to hear, take pictures, shoot footage and be in the middle of the crowd and its energy.

Voters who decide to attend a rally do not want to show up to an empty hall and be the only people there. If an event looks like a bomb, some people may just pass it up. In order to make the event look as though it is someplace people want to be, the campaign should have the volunteers and campaign committee arrive about 30 minutes early to cover any required business. People who are early arrivals will already see a crowd and become part of the rally near the beginning.

The rally area should be roomy with very few seats. Standing during a rally helps to promote energy. Campaign signs should be all over the area. Volunteers should have rally signs to hold. The area directly behind the speakers should have campaign banners and signs hung so that they appear in any camera shot.

As people arrive, they should be greeted by a campaign volunteer. If people not previously affiliated with the campaign arrive, they should be given campaign literature, stickers and a card to fill out that captures their contact information. The card should also ask for yard sign locations, volunteers for poll workers and other tasks for which the campaign needs volunteers. After the event, all of the new information gathered by the campaign should be immediately updated in the database.

Press arriving at the rally should be greeted and escorted to the media area. Reporters will no doubt wish to mingle among the crowd in order to gain information for any story. Reporters should be given a program of events that lets them know when the speaking begins and who is going to be speaking. The press thrives on information, so it is important for campaigns to provide the information it wishes reported.

The program of a rally is relatively simple. A rally begins with a period of mingling in which people arrive, fill out cards and get refreshments. A handful of campaign staff will want to work the crowd and engage people who may seem withdrawn, overwhelmed or not participatory. At some point that seems appropriate, when most people have arrived, a short program begins. The program is meant to energize the crowd, so it should be brief and motivational. The master of ceremonies can be a local celebrity, officeholder or someone selected to get everything started. Whatever speakers are invited to participate should build up to the final speaker, the candidate. Each speaker should only have 2-3 minutes each, and there should not be more than 3-5 speakers prior to the candidate. The candidate can go a little longer than the rest of the crowd.

Volunteers should be directed to respond appropriately to the candidate’s comments. If a candidate makes a big point, the volunteers should make sure that the applause go around. It can easily drain the energy from a rally for a candidate to make a point and the crowd fails to react properly.

It is a good idea for a campaign to take pictures of the event and possibly record it for Internet distribution if appropriate. The campaign manager or press secretary should also make sure the needs of the press are met. When the event is over, all campaign materials that can be salvaged should be.8.4 Signs

Some candidates feel as though they have to have more signs than their opponent, or they will lose a race. The attitude that a campaign must have more signs than anyone else in order to “win” a “sign war” is the wrong way to look at a campaign’s sign campaign.

A campaign should step back from the traditional method of looking at the sign campaign. Placing hundreds of small signs along a road where a candidate has no permission to place them not only is illegal but makes the campaign look bad. People who live in an area do not want to see their landscape littered by unauthorized signs.

Campaigns also make the mistake of placing most of their money in hundreds or thousands of small yard signs that can only be seen by drivers and passengers just as they are passing. Campaigns should instead approach the sign campaign from a different perspective.

Signs come in all sizes from the small signs that go in peoples’ yards to the large signs that can be placed along major thoroughfares. The idea is to raise name identification and awareness rather than flood an area with senseless signs that cannot be seen or read.

In order to begin a sign campaign, a campaign team should study the area of the race. A list of high priority, heavily trafficked roads should be made. These roads will be the thoroughfares that the campaign’s largest signs will be placed. Then the campaign should look at the precincts that are the most important in terms of targeting. Precincts with high voter participation are important to target as well as precincts in which a candidate may be weaker than others in terms of support. Once the campaign knows where its priority areas are, then it can choose what type of signs it needs and how many.

The highly trafficked areas should have large, corrugated plastic road signs that range in size from 3’x5’ to 4’x8’. Signs should be placed as close to the road as the local laws allow and put up as early as local laws allow. It is the major routes that name identification will be greatest. A large sign will cost a campaign between $20 and $40 each including the posts and ties required to root them to the ground. No small yard signs should be placed along major routes because they will be ineffective. Small signs can only be seen from a short distance, and the words on them can only be read from an even shorter distance. Therefore, small signs along routes with fast moving traffic are a waste of time and money.

Small signs should be placed in the targeted neighborhoods. This is not to say that non-targeted neighborhoods should be skipped, but priority should be placed on the areas that a candidate could use help. The objective of small signs is slightly different from that of large signs. Whereas large signs are used to raise candidate awareness, small signs in a neighborhood make more of a statement. They should look exactly like the large signs. The difference is that people driving into their own neighborhood will see the signs of the candidate and understand that the neighbors feel like this candidate is alright for them. It helps to inspire confidence in a candidate, build momentum and energy for a campaign while also doing its part to raise awareness.

Campaigns should never invest in billboards. Billboards are very expensive and amount to nothing more than a large sign location. A well placed large sign that costs the campaign $25 can do the same job as a $500 to $5,000 billboard. Campaigns should never waste money on billboards when a large sign can do the same job. Billboards from an outdoor advertising agency are a relative waste of money.

The easiest way to procure a sign location is to call the homes of people along the major thoroughfares and target precincts. Volunteers can introduce themselves, deliver a 15-20 second advocacy message supporting the candidate, explain that the campaign is calling for yard sign locations and respectfully request permission to place a yard sign that will be removed by the campaign after the election. Most people will say “no”, but some will approve the sign. Once the phone operation to procure sign locations is complete, the campaign should have a healthy database of sign locations. The campaign now knows how many signs it will need and how many it should order for the locations. In order to come to a good number for ordering, the campaign should order 10% more large signs than it has locations in order to replace lost and damaged signs and to fill in areas that need them. In addition, a campaign should place a large sign at the highest priority polling locations if permitted.

As discussed in Chapter 6, the sign logo should be easily readable from a distance. The sign should not have distracting shapes and too many words. A proper sign does not mix dark colored words on a dark colored background. A good campaign sign emphasizes the candidate’s last name above all else and then details the office being sought. Other information for signs is extraneous and should generally be avoided.

It is important for a campaign to follow-through on a sign campaign even after the election. Signs should be removed as quickly as possible. Win or lose, there will always be another campaign, and a candidate does not want to lose supporters for failure to pick a campaign asset back up.8.5 E-mail Campaign

If a campaign has a web site, and it should, then it has the ability to acquire and e-mail supporters and voters. The challenge to having an effective e-mail operation in a campaign is to send out just the right number of e-mails and to make the e-mails relevant, interesting and short. As the campaign’s database grows, so should the people that the campaign e-mails. Campaign staff should make it a habit to update the campaign database with e-mail information whenever someone comes in contact with the campaign.

Some officeholders and candidates are about as interesting to listen to as watching grass grow. Those politicians somehow become just as unexciting and droll in their e-mails. When a campaign sends out an e-mail, it should be relevant and interesting. The e-mail can link to an article or articles in the paper, but it should not reprint an entire article. A campaign e-mail is the campaign’s opportunity to tell supporters what an article said. Once the campaign links the article, then it is up to the supporter to read it if so desired. The campaign should not care if the recipient actually reads the article as long as the important information of what the article said is communicated. Many campaigns can eliminate scrolling down through an e-mail for its supporters by simply supplying a brief synopsis and links. In an on-demand society, this style is a plus.

E-mails, like direct mail and television, should be visually appealing. The campaign should use eye catching graphics and pictures in such a way that they enhance the interest in the e-mail without distracting from the e-mail. Each e-mail should also incorporate the campaign logo. The text should be large enough to read without squinting.

Some campaigns feel like they need to e-mail supporters every day. Campaigns that frequently e-mail supporters with inconsequential information will find nearly all of its e-mail ending up in spam folders. A campaign that chooses to send e-mails only when it has a purpose is a campaign that understands and respects the time of its supporters.

Valid reasons for e-mailing supporters include announcing a new television spot with a link to it, reporting a campaign’s press conference immediately after the conference, thereby granting exclusive access to the campaign before news outlets have an ability to report it, or reminding people of upcoming events or rallies. Every e-mail should have a link at the bottom that allows supporters to contribute as well as a link that allows the supporter to apply for a mail ballot. An opt-out link might also be required by local or state laws. An opt-out also is a good idea because a campaign does not want to e-mail people that do not wish to have the e-mails.

Because of the speed at which information can be distributed through e-mail, it is a powerful tool, and a campaign will want to control information distributed over the Internet. E-mail also has the tendency to become “viral” meaning the people who receive the initial e-mail can forward it to other people and so on. If a campaign sends an e-mail out at noon on Monday to 1,000 supporters, it could possibly spread to an exponential number of people by noon on Tuesday. Not every e-mail is viral-worthy. If a campaign is selective about how it distributes e-mail and makes an effort to not inundate supporters with information overload, then the few e-mails a campaign sends will be more effective than the daily e-mails others might send.8.6 Blogs

As information technology evolves, so do the many ways that people talk about politics. In any given area, there may be dozens of political blogs, or web logs, run by individuals or organizations that comment on local officeholders, candidates and government.

Although blogs are not widely read by the general public at large, even if a blog is one of the more nationally known blogs, the people who do read the blogs can be influential. Many times news stories will begin in the “blogosphere” because information that is not yet suitable for print, or unsubstantiated information, can circulate on the Web. As time progresses, blogs develop their own sources.

Television and newspaper reporters, always on the lookout for a story, sift through the blogs. Blogs are a good place for tips or to understand how people might feel about a subject. A campaign may want to have volunteers scouring the blogs and to make favorable comments about a candidate in posts. Blogs can be used to see how less-than flattering information about an opponent will resonate. Very few rules govern the content of the Internet although information posted should still be true and valid if posted by someone from the campaign.

Too much time spent on blogs is not wise. A small handful of volunteers can skim them daily and make appropriate comments. The readers of blogs tend to be reporters, other blog writers, and members of campaign teams, so comments should be made keeping that in mind.8.7 Community Events

As summer approaches, many communities will have picnics or festivals. Churches have carnivals or fundraisers. In the fall, some areas will have harvest festivals or an Oktoberfest. Whatever the event, it will most likely draw large crowds. Many voters will probably be among those in the crowds, which make these community events good places for campaign exposure. During a campaign, the candidate’s primary tasks are to meet people and raise money. Community events are a good way for a candidate to meet potential voters.

A good way for a campaign to properly work an event is to have volunteers going door-to-door in campaign t-shirts in the neighborhood where the event is on the day of the event. Instead of knocking on doors, volunteers can cover more ground by simply delivery or “dropping” literature at homes in the neighborhood. This type of operation is referred to as a “literature drop” or “lit drop.”

After conducting a lit drop for 1-2 hours, the volunteers then attend the event wearing their campaign t-shirts. Volunteers may even distribute campaign literature at the event unless event organizers do not want it being distributed. The campaign t-shirts are walking billboards for the candidate at the event, and it is good for the attendees to see that a candidate supports their festival.

Since community events draw large numbers of people, having campaign signs posted near the venue or along routes that terminate the venue are a good idea. Placing signs where people can see them will assist in raising awareness of the candidate.

The best way to maximize the candidate’s effectiveness when attending an event is to meet and greet people. The candidate should walk among any dining areas with 2-3 volunteers. As the candidate greets people, makes an introduction and gives a short spiel about the campaign, volunteers can hand literature or other campaign materials to the potential voters. Community events provide an opportunity for a candidate to meet a large amount of people in a short amount of time. The drawback is that there is no way to identify whether a person attending the event is a voter.

Some events will allow candidates or local Party organizations to have a booth. Booths are good for storing materials, but they do not actively greet voters like a candidate does by mingling in a crowd. If a cost is associated with a booth, it may be an unwise investment unless volunteers are able to staff the booth for the duration of the event. It is generally a good idea to team with a local Party organization in order to split costs and staffing responsibilities. Booths sitting by themselves do not gain votes or deliver message. It takes a candidate or a campaign team to engage potential voters at an event.

Community events may also be a good place to obtain volunteers, e-mail addresses and other information. Campaign staff assigned to the event should have sign-up forms or volunteer cards in order to gather as much information as possible. Some people may give the candidate or staffer a business card. All contacts should be entered into the campaign database after each event.

A candidate’s time at an event is more productive with a few volunteers. Visibility of the campaign is also increased with additional volunteers. A candidate may attend numerous events in a single day. Each event should have a different set of volunteers in order to “work” the event when the candidate is not present. Staffing levels are dependent upon whether a campaign has enough available volunteers at any given time.8.8 Town Hall Forums

Some campaigns do not generate much interest. Races for President, Congress or statewide office have a greater potential of drawing crowds for a campaign event than do for city council, township trustee or other down ballot race. In races that have high interest or that have the ability to affect a volatile issue, town hall forums may be a good way to reach voters. A town hall forum is essentially a one-sided debate in which the opponent is not invited.

Town hall forums are generally in the evening at a venue that is easily accessible with ample parking. Attendees are greeted at the door and handed a sheet that asks for their input as well as contact information. Attendees are also given a pen as well as a campaign handbill. Light refreshments should also be available. The comment sheets of the attendees should be collected at the end of the forum and the information added to the campaign database.

A town hall forum should be advertised through earned media as well as e-mail and direct mail to known supporters. For a town hall to be effective, a campaign must drive turnout of people, and it is important to get as many undecided voters into the audience as possible. The campaign volunteers and supporters can be present to provide support, begin applause at appropriate moments and to listen to what the undecided voters around them are saying.

Other methods of driving turnout include sending a direct mail postcard to targeted precincts and neighborhoods or voters of a certain age depending on the issue. The campaign can also make phone calls into homes of targeted voters to attend the event. A town hall is a voter’s chance to have a say in policy or the policies of a candidate. High school and local college students can also be invited. If word of the event is spread through a high school civics department or college political science department, then students may be given an incentive to attend the event.

Town hall forum formats are controlled by the campaign. The topics the campaign talks about are dictated by the campaign message. Other topics may arise from a question and answer session that follows a presentation by the candidate. The candidate should be knowledgeable and articulate on the issues that will come up in the forum. The same rules of preparation that would apply to a debate would also apply to a town hall forum.

Town hall forums should have a moderator that takes questions from the audience or brings a microphone around to attendees that wish to ask questions. The presence of a moderator that controls a microphone also allows the campaign to control the duration and direction of the event.

As the town hall forum winds down, attendees should be encouraged to fill out their comment forms and to write their areas of concern on their cards. The campaign can use these forms to identify any issues that a poll or other research did not. Issues or priorities of issues can change during a campaign, and a skilled team will always be alert to these shifts. Town Hall forums should only last an hour or slightly more so that the candidate can make the best use of time. Meeting as many people as possible on the campaign trail is one of the candidate’s primary objectives.8.9 Handling the Hecklers

Sometimes a campaign will encounter an opponent that engages hecklers or has people that show up at campaign events or community events to make a scene or gain attention or distract the campaign. It is important that the campaign proceed with its plans as though any hecklers do not exist and prepare in advance for any potential hecklers.

For all campaign events, it is important to control the venue and its surroundings. Because an event is put on by a campaign, and a fee is paid for a venue, and attendance is by invitation, the campaign can use security and facility personnel to help handle hecklers and escort them off premises. It is always wise for third parties to handle hecklers instead of campaign personnel. Hecklers generally have video cameras because they are trying to incite the opposing campaign into doing something embarrassing or unseemly. It does not give hecklers or the opponent’s campaign any good material if a police officer or facility manager is escorting them off premises for making a scene.

Sometimes a heckler may show up at a community event and hound the candidate. It is important that event personnel are made aware of any nuisance. At no time should the candidate address a heckler directly. Attention is what a heckler wishes to have. The more attention a heckler gets, the greater the scene that will be created. If a campaign staff can place distance between the candidate and any hecklers without using contact, then the candidate can still meet voters and gain support.

It is important that a campaign is trained to identify people who are potential hecklers. Observe people near the candidate, and if someone becomes boisterous or tries to incite the candidate, then campaign staff should step in. Handing a heckler a business card and telling him to call the office to set up an appointment will generally suffice to diffuse a situation. Meanwhile the candidate has moved away and moved on. Hecklers will make themselves look bad if they are interrupting other people who wish to talk to a candidate. Unfortunately at community events, people at the facility will generally ask the heckler and the object of his heckling to leave the premises. In such instances, the campaign should comply and seek another time to attend the event when no hecklers are present.

Campaigns should count on the eventuality of dealing with hecklers. The key is to place distance between them and the candidate and to have third parties, whenever possible, escort them from a venue. Never get into a fight or verbal altercation with hecklers.   

# CHAPTER 9

### Nuts and Bolts

This manual has covered everything from starting the campaign, conducting initial research, developing message, waging an air war and conducting a ground war. Someone reading this manual should know how to create a campaign plan, budget for a campaign, prioritize expenditures and schedule a timeline. This manual should guide a reader as to what basic background information they need to start a campaign and to find out about opponents as well as where to go to get it. A reader of this manual knows the four resources of a campaign (time, information, money and people) and how to use them. In essence, this manual is an excellent reference on the basics of organizing and running a campaign.

Most manuals do not get into the finer points of how to manage effectively. Entire college courses and majors are designed to teach management skills. Sometimes campaign operatives take years to build good management skills. This chapter will provide some useful techniques and thoughts regarding effective management and decision making. It is not a complete guide. However, this chapter will deal with common situations that arise in campaigns and how to approach them.9.1 Effective vs. Ineffective Meetings

Something that can drag a campaign down is the need to have too many meetings. Sometimes the candidate will want to have meetings for reasons ranging from insecurity about the campaign to trying to micromanage aspects of the plan. There are very few campaign meetings in which the candidate will need to be present. The nuts and bolts of the campaign should be taken care of by the team. By having the candidate at campaign meetings, the campaign team opens itself up to constant scrutiny, tangential conversations and a complete derailing of a normal meeting with a candidate present.

It is the campaign team’s responsibility, and the campaign manager’s duty, to effectively manage the candidate. If the candidate is being managed professionally then the candidate should have neither the time nor inclination to attend meetings. A candidate who feels as though he or she is being managed effectively will tend not to meddle. That means that the campaign manager must be the liaison between the candidate and the rest of the team, and the campaign manager briefs the candidate about meetings. The campaign meeting is directed by one person this way, and not two.

An effective meeting will have an agenda that will generally start by looking at the schedule for the coming weeks. Each member of the campaign team will take their assignments based on the campaign schedule. Any questions about how to approach certain people or tackle a specific problem can be easily answered while discussing the schedule and who will be responsible for each coming task. Careful note should be taken regarding who is responsible for each task in order for the proper follow-up to occur.

After the scheduling discussion, each member of the campaign team should report on how the past week/days have gone. Team members should bring up issues that they have had or explain how they handled certain situations. This meeting time is to work out any bugs from past events so that future events are smoother.

After individual reports, the campaign manager can communicate anything that the candidate wanted to pass along. The campaign manager should also set the tone and pace for the coming week and what to expect. It is not appropriate to admonish any team member during a meeting. Individual one-on-one meetings are appropriate for such things. Campaign meetings are designed to get everyone on the team on the same page without the presence of the candidate. The candidate does not need to see, nor should the candidate have the desire, to see how the proverbial sausage is made.

After each campaign meeting, team members should receive a summary along with tasks and assignments so that there will never be a question as to who will be responsible for each aspect of the campaign for the coming week or weeks. If these basic steps to an effective meeting are followed, campaign meetings will be relatively short and generally effective. If tasks are not clearly assigned or the candidate is involved with managing the campaign , then meetings will not be effective, and team members will leave without a clear direction or understanding as to the power structure of the campaign.9.2 Weak Link in the Team

Effective campaigns require team members with “can do” attitudes and people who are able to seek answers to things they do not know about. A campaign cannot suffer team members who need to be hand-held through everything they have been assigned. Campaign teams also need to be confident that when a task is assigned it will be done, and if there is a problem, the person assigned will not wait until it is too late or an emergency to fix it. A campaign cannot suffer team members who “don’t do windows” meaning they will not do whatever it takes to win. Volunteers have more ability to name their own tasks and jobs, but senior staff, paid staff or team members with titles do not have that luxury.

Weak team members sap the vitality of a campaign. Other team members immediately identify “slackers”, “whiners” and “drama queens.” These types of personalities suck the morale out of a campaign team, and can severely impact the effectiveness of a campaign. Political campaigns, based on their temporary existence and fast-paced environment, have a lower threshold of tolerance for bad personalities. The best way to deal with such team members is to either re-task them or terminate their involvement on the campaign. The sooner action can be taken, the better. Damage is done each minute such a person is on the team.

The campaign manager should handle all personnel issues discreetly and amicably. Discretion is important in order to allow the team member a level of dignity. If a situation is handled with privacy and discretion, other team members will know that their own personal issues will be handled with such professionalism. Proper handling of situations builds trust among the team.

If a team member is not working out in a position for any of the aforementioned reasons, an option may be to re-task the offender. A good manager will be able to identify specific situations in which the team member has not responded appropriately or fulfilled duties. Options should exist to retain a person who earnestly wishes to help the campaign. A manager should never create a situation in which the team member becomes bitter and tries to sabotage the campaign in some way. If the team member is not amenable to re-tasking, then termination remains as an option to a manager.

Any time a team member leaves a campaign, for any reason, it is essential that any passwords or locks are changed. A team member who knows the procedures of a campaign and has passwords and keys to the campaign office is a disaster waiting to happen. It protects both the campaign and the former team member to take necessary precautions in order to safeguard information and material assets.

There is an infinite number of scenarios that can occur, but a campaign manager has to be able to make swift and just decisions. A campaign manager has the responsibility to maintain a well-oiled campaign machine and to keep morale high. Campaign issues should never become issues that a candidate should deal with. A candidate should be aware of all issues and have faith that the campaign team is equipped to handle it.9.3 Security

Team members should always be in the habit of doing certain things that protect the resources of the campaign. Although espionage, computer hackers and people sifting through trash sound like the makings of a spy novel, campaigns must always guard their resources. Espionage occurs in the spy world, the corporate world and the world of political campaigns. The most important resource to protect is the information resource. Opposing campaigns would like to have access to the other’s database, campaign plan, budget, strategy, e-mails and paper waste that allows them to see what is going on.

Campaign computers should never be left running overnight unless they are being used. Whenever a team member leaves a computer, all programs should be logged off. If the campaign computer network has a wireless router, then it should be encrypted, and each individual computer should have a firewall.

A campaign should always have a good shredding machine. All e-mail communications have potentially sensitive information. If they are printed, they should be shredded before discarding. All campaign documents should be shredded before they leave the campaign office.

The campaign manager often has information and documentation that is sensitive and only available to a select few. If the campaign manager does not have an office that can be independently locked, then all sensitive information should be stored in a lockable cabinet. The cabinet or office should remain locked when not directly under the campaign manager’s supervision.

The campaign office should be secured whenever it is empty. Stepping out for lunch and leaving the office for five minutes to bring something back creates an opportunity for someone claiming to be a potential “volunteer” to step in and have access to sensitive information. Only trusted members of the campaign team should have keys. Volunteers and junior staff members should rely on senior staff to grant access to the campaign office. An improperly supervised office can be a costly information leak for a campaign.

Many basic security measures are a matter of common sense. However, it is easy to become comfortable with the people in an office, and procedures designed to protect the information as well as the people in the office can easily slacken. Discipline in maintaining proper security will grant peace of mind to a campaign as well as the candidate.9.4 Preparing for Debates

Debates are events that challengers usually want to participate in while incumbents generally try to avoid them. Sometimes incumbents cannot avoid a debate and therefore must prepare just as thoroughly as the challenger.

A debate offers a challenger the opportunity to point out problems with the incumbent. A debate also grants a challenger a certain level of legitimacy that an incumbent will want to discourage. Chapter 8 discussed town hall forums. If an incumbent wants to get in front of the debate issue and avoid the confrontation, then town hall forums are a good way to fill a void. An incumbent can answer a challenge to debate by replying that the town hall forums are a much better way for voters to interact with their current officeholder, ask questions and have an impact while a debate will only serve to deprive voters of such an environment. A debate can also offer an incumbent a forum to talk about successes in office.

If a debate is unavoidable, then the campaign and candidate should prepare adequately. In preparation, the campaign team should revisit the information gathered in Chapter 1 as well as the opposition research gathered in Chapter 3. In particular, the strengths vs. weaknesses charts become important. These rules apply to challengers as well as incumbents.

The campaign should adequately brief the candidate on all issues pertinent to the office. Issue briefs can be 1 page with bullet points covering the issue as well as the candidate’s solution to any problems. In addition to issues, the candidate should be briefed on the strengths and weaknesses of the opponent. A skilled debater will be able to use an opponent’s weaknesses to stay on the offensive. It is in the best interest of a candidate to keep the opponent on the defensive while showcasing his or her own strengths. A candidate should also be aware of his own shortcomings in order to properly prepare for any attack.

Once a candidate has had a chance to review all of the materials, a role playing session is a good idea. The campaign should have a well prepared stand-in to play the opponent in such a session so that the candidate can respond to potential attacks. Good research is required to anticipate the opponent’s attacks. A handful of campaign team members should act as moderators asking questions. The candidate’s responses should be evaluated and fine-tuned. The questions should be asked until the candidate’s answers come across as thoughtful, genuine and polished. It is helpful to have a video recorder and television available for playback. Sometimes the candidate can adapt to a question through self-evaluation along with the input of others.9.5 When Is It OK To “Go Negative”?

One of the toughest decisions a campaign may make is whether to “go negative” or not. Going negative refers to a strategy in which one campaign spends resources to highlight the weaknesses of an opponent. Going negative takes many forms including overt attack ads to issuing a mild comparison direct mail piece. Going negative does not necessarily mean that a campaign is “slinging mud” or taking a low road to win a campaign. A campaign can go negative in a responsible manner that does not erode the integrity of a campaign as long as the issues in the negative advertising are truthful, relevant to the race and documented.

It is generally unacceptable to go negative on a candidate because of an issue that is not related to the campaign. For instance, an opponent’s child may be caught in the middle of an illegal act or an opponent’s brother has financial problems resulting in bankruptcy. A campaign that chooses to draw a parallel between the shortcomings of a relative and a candidate runs a high risk of a negative backlash. Voters generally do not respect a campaign that will attack someone who is not running for office if the candidate under attack had nothing to do with the relative’s misfortune. A campaign should avoid attacking a family member of an opponent.

Business associates, mentors, and close acquaintances can become an issue in a campaign if the opponent’s association with a person affects the opponent’s beliefs or actions. Whether it is fair or not, people are often judged by those with whom they associate. For instance, a contributor to a candidate may be convicted of committing a crime. The candidate with whom this person is associated may also become tainted by the crime regardless of the candidate’s involvement or lack thereof. Such association can be overcome with the passage of time if the candidate had nothing to do with the crime, but it will require campaign resources of money and information to do so.

If a campaign is calculating about when it wishes to release damaging negative information, it will want to do so at a time that allows the opponent little chance to respond before the election. Releasing information too close to Election Day, however, may diminish the impact of the information. If a campaign had information for months that was only released days before a vote, voters may view the information as suspect and disregard it.

A popular way to go negative without appearing negative is to create a comparison between the candidate and the opponent. A campaign can use any of the tactics described in previous chapters such as press releases, direct mail, or broadcast media in order to create the comparison. It is wise to stick to issues and avoid personal characteristics in making distinctions. What candidates believe about social issues such as 2nd Amendment rights, abortion and many other topics can be valid comparison issues if voters are concerned about them. The past actions of candidates in regard to raising taxes, meeting attendance, or votes on key issues may also be valid issues. The campaign message will determine what issues are the most important. Remember that it is important for third parties to make an attack whenever possible.   

# Appendix A –  
Sample Campaign Plan

### Keep Helen Troy, Cook County Solicitor  
Campaign Overview

### Background

The position being sought by incumbent Helen Troy and former State Representative Howard Johnson is Cook County Solicitor.

Helen Troy is the current Cook County Solicitor. Her strengths include the fact that she has held the position since January 1997, her gender, the awards her office has won, her business experience and her legal experience. Troy has a small amount of money on hand and should be prepared to raise at least $160,000 for the Solicitor’s race. Since becoming Solicitor, Troy has improved customer service, increased efficiency and returned money to the county’s General Fund – all positive issues for the campaign. Potential weaknesses for Troy include a potential issue from office document migration (implementing technology), which may also become a strength if marketed properly. An obstacle all Republican candidates must overcome is the trend that Cook County is experiencing in which countywide Republican candidates receive fewer votes in each election – a trend that is evident since at least 2000.

Troy’s opponent for the Solicitor’s office is Howard Johnson. Johnson is a former State Representative from Ohio’s 100th District and former mayor of Happy Valley. He was defeated in 2002 by Barry Wilkes in a closely watched rematch after Ohio’s redistricting. Johnson will use his experience as a real estate broker to explain why he is the most qualified for the position. He will also use the fact that he has been an elected officeholder before and possibly use _resources/books//The Political Campaign Desk Reference_ A G - Michael McNamara of him with Columbus officials, swearing in _resources/books//The Political Campaign Desk Reference_ A G - Michael McNamara and statewide endorsements. Johnson will also likely attempt to re-create his image in the form of a Republican taking note of some of the Republican legislation he supported in Columbus. Johnson’s time in such organizations as Cook County Municipal League and the Cook County Community Action Association, among others, has provided him an opportunity for countywide networking. Between the years 2000-2004, Ohio Secretary of State’s web site shows that Johnson was able to raise $180,523. This figure does not account for what he raised during his years on Happy Valley Council or as Mayor. He has experience and training in raising funds from his time in Columbus, and Troy’s campaign must assume that he will raise enough to run a strong campaign.

Howard Johnson has also kicked off what he terms as a “exploratory tour” akin to the Hillary Clinton tour that launched her Presidential campaign. The tour idea is a gimmick but demonstrates that Johnson is thinking hard about what to do with his campaign. He will most likely have some sort of conclusion event (press conference, press release or rally) that will be the platform from which he will make criticisms of the current office. A key weakness to Johnson is that he took at least $1,300 from pro-abortion groups in three different donations from his time in Columbus.

Troy’s campaign must use the power of incumbency to her benefit. A “makeover” should occur in the office so that Troy is referred to as Cook County’s “Award-Winning” Solicitor. The addition of the “Award Winning” mantle sends a message to people that not only will Helen Troy tell you she’s a good Solicitor, but third party entities have evaluated her performance and agree. Troy must also place more emphasis on her background as a small business owner thereby making her a contributor of the economy and an elected officeholder sensitive to the economy. The economy will be a large issue in the 2008 elections. Johnson can be painted as being part of the problem, and he was subsequently a one-term State Representative. He will blame his loss of his seat on redistricting. That argument will not hold water against the counter argument that voters would have returned him to office if he had done a good job – how dare he suggest that the voters in Cook County cannot make informed decisions.

A well thought-out campaign will evaluate Troy’s past performance since 1996 and list geographic areas of the county where she is very strong, neutral and weak. The precincts of the county in which Troy has both won and lost elections will be highly targeted. A strong campaign will also shore up support in strong areas. Attention given to weak areas of support will be limited to improving name identification and spreading the “award-winning” message.

Looking at historic numbers from 2000 and 2004, one can see a trend in the Solicitor’s race. The most notable trend is apparent erosion between 2000 and 2004 of the percentage that Troy won by in a heads-up match. Troy also experienced erosion in the percentage of votes to total ballots cast in the election. The most disturbing figure is the raw margin of votes that separate Troy from her opponent in 2004 versus 2000.

If 1/3 of the voters who skipped the Solicitor’s race in 2004 decided to vote for Jim Maxwell, Helen Troy would not be Solicitor today. This is a figure that astute Democrats will not ignore. Furthermore, Troy’s race is a snapshot of a larger trend in which Republicans in Cook County have to spend more and work harder for the votes they earn. Finally, we see that the larger the voter turnout, the less Troy wins by. 2008 promises to be the most energized election in over a decade. That fact, along with the changes in absentee voting law that have gone into effect since 2004, will drive turnout in the election higher. Democrats will be particularly energized because they see a real opportunity to win back the White House, and Ohio will be seen as a key state this year – especially since the statewide Democratic sweep in 2006.

### Budget

A strong countywide race will require the use of direct mail, TV and a grassroots campaign. The budget outlined below is an estimate of anticipated costs. The pages following will give a brief description of each of these costs.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|TV Network|$150,000|
|TV Cable|$60,000|
|Signs|$20,000|
|Direct Mail 1(pre-absentee)|$20,000|
|Direct Mail 2 (pre-absentee #2)|$20,000|
|Direct Mail 3 (lands 8-10 days out)|$20,000|
|Direct Mail 4 (lands Wednesday/Thursday before Election Day)|$20,000|
|Direct Mail 5 (lands weekend before Election Day)|$20,000|
|Phones|$20,000|
|T-shirts, stickers, letterhead, etc.|$4,000|
|Web Site|$5,000|
|Consulting|$3,250|
|Absentee Chase|$19,500|
|Total|$381,750|

### TV

In a down-ballot race, such as the Solicitor race that is not going to be a race that drives voters to the polls, name identification is the primary factor determining success. Message and image will set the candidates apart once high name identification is achieved. Therefore, an aggressive television campaign is essential in securing a victory for Helen Troy.

In an election that has the potential of being drowned out by a heated race for President on both sides of the aisle, it is important to reach as many Republican and independent voting eyeballs as possible. A network and cable plan will present message and raise name identification. Traditional Republican channels and programming (Fox News, Golf Channel) will be targeted to shore up the base on cable, and network will deliver the message to a broader audience during news hour programming.

In order to maintain continuity of message, a single message should be crafted for television that will reflect the message of the campaign. The spot will highlight Helen Troy as an award winning Solicitor, subtly reinforce her gender and speak to her business background.

### Signs

The Troy campaign will use large signs and yard signs to boost name identification throughout the county. The emphasis of effort should be focused on acquiring large sign locations along major thoroughfares in Cook County. The budget reserves $10,000 for signs.

Sign location acquisition will occur through the use of some volunteer lists. In addition, the Troy campaign should use a phone calling firm to acquire sign locations in areas where coverage is weak or name identification needs help. An advocacy message will be delivered along with an “ask” for sign locations.

Signs should go out 4-6 weeks from Election Day as local ordinances allow.

### Direct Mail

The direct mail campaign will be the most effective portion of the campaign. This is where the Troy campaign delivers the message to targeted voters on award-winning Solicitor, business background and incumbency (past performance). Direct mail is also where the voter receives the image of the candidate, and the campaign solely controls it. The message in the direct mail mirrors that of the other media ads. There will be 5 targeted mailings (based in swing areas and areas of support):

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Mailing 1)|Introduction – Helen Trooy is “Our Award Winning Solicitor”|
|Mailing 2)|Business Experience – Speak to Helen’s paralegal experience as well as her former business.|
|Mailing 3)|Endorsements – Rundown of party and local endorsements with a final tag of the most important endorsement of all – experience.|
|Mailing 4)|Comparison – “Helen Troy is the only candidate for Solicitor who…”|
|Mailing 5)|GOTV – Slate card and instructional for recipients on their voting location. We create slate card, or other group creates slate card for us (but we pay for).|

Direct mail will be delivered in the areas targeted by the campaign. Due to the size of Cook County, it is unrealistic to mail all voters throughout the county. A discussion of targeting is detailed in another section.

### Phones

Telephones will be used heavily by the Republican and Democrat candidates for President. Targeting phone calls to weaker areas as well as strong areas will help to reinforce support from traditional sources and to move voters towards Troy. Democratic voters will be eliminated from the lists. Messages can be from Helen as well as some surrogates:

Call 1) Advocacy call requesting sign locations – this is the most expensive set of calls. It is countywide and recorded in Helen’s voice. The system used is voice-activated. The respondent hears Helen’s voice on the phone asking questions and providing information about herself. The last question is an ask for yard sign locations. Occurs in mid-late August.  
Call 2)Helen Troy call with introduction – 1-2 days prior to absentees beginning  
Call 3)Surrogate call on behalf of Helen – 4-5 days prior to Election Day  
Call 4) HElen call – 1-2 days prior to Election Day

Advocacy Call Overview  
The advocacy call also serves as a microtargeting call. If the Troy campaign utilizes the technology that allows for caller interaction, it can identify voters who are more likely to vote for an award winning Solicitor, a female Solicitor, a Solicitor who takes a tough stand on illegal immigrants or a Solicitor who has strict policies protecting personal information.

### Grass Roots

A strong grassroots campaign will be essential to victory in the 2008 General Election. A timeline will be developed to include dates and times of targeted festivals and celebrations where members of the general public will be.

Precincts will also be targeted for weekend “lit drops” in which volunteers in Troy shirts will deliver literature to households that are likely to vote. Lit drops will begin in late Spring and should be coordinated in precincts where large community festivals will be that weekend. Volunteers can go to festivals after dropping in neighborhoods, and festival attendees will see the Troy team at the festival and find its literature at their home.

Volunteers will also send in letters to the editors of the local community newspapers. These letters should reflect the themes of the campaign and therefore be written from talking points developed by the campaign, but letters should be in writers’ own words.

### Door to Door

Beginning in summer 2008, Helen Troy and the team will begin going door to door in targeted precincts at the homes of likely voters. The precincts she visits will coincide with areas where festivals are occurring or where large voter turnout is expected – particularly in the “swing” areas. Walking times include evenings after work and late morning through the afternoon on weekends.

Troy will have literature, walking lists, voter registration forms and absentee ballot forms for door-to-door. All pro-Troy voters that the campaign identifies should be provided with an absentee ballot application.

### Internet Campaign

An aggressive Internet presence and campaign will complement the air war. The Internet campaign will consist of:

- Web site
- E-mail acquisition of likely voters
- Presence in the blogosphere
- Donations from the web
- MySpace Page
- Facebook Page

Every campaign has a web site, but a web site does not do anything for voters if they do not look at it. By pushing the web site content to voters through an aggressive e-mail campaign, we can increase web traffic to the campaign site. The Web address for the campaign site should go on all literature and campaign materials as possible. In addition, an e-mail push during the final legs of the campaign will bump traffic exponentially.

### Incumbency

Helen Troy has the unique power of incumbency to promote the good deeds of her office and to speak publicly on issues that affect voters. As a current officeholder, Troy should be submitting monthly or bimonthly columns to the local Community Press newspapers – especially those in targeted areas. Topics can range from identity theft and how government officials in any capacity can protect against it, how government officials in any capacity can help fight illegal immigration, predatory lending and other hot button issues.

Furthermore, the message of the office must reflect the numerous awards that have been won.

Troy can also testify on various bills in Columbus thereby getting press for her trips. As such she will be able to claim that “she has had more of an effect on current legislation than Howard Johnson has had, and perhaps that is why voters sent him packing six years ago.”

### Targeting

In reviewing the 2004 performance of candidates, a comparison of George W. Bush’s performance to that of Helen Troy will be helpful in determining where Troy can improve her vote totals in 2008. Areas that stick out as needing improvement include:

- McKinley Township
- McKinley City
- Taft City
- Harding Township
- Hayes Township
- Garfield City
- Grant Village

In particular, George Bush outperformed Troy by more than 8.5% in the 102nd Ohio House District – the district now represented by William Hackforth. Bush received more than 9,000 more votes than Troy, and this area accounts for the largest disparity in performance between Bush and Troy in 2004. As a graduate of Maple Hills, this should not be a difficult task to reconnect with the West Side.

Other areas that Helen Troy received between 47%and 53% of the vote (areas that can be improved) include:

- Lochland
- Mt. Joy
- North Freemont
- Columbus Twp.
- Fieldspring Twp.
- 25th Ward – Taft City
- 4th Ward – Taft City
- Autumndale

Geographically, the Troy campaign should focus attention on natural coalitions to bolster support. Republican clubs, women’s organizations, conservative groups, pro-life, pro-2nd Amendment and other organizations are ones in which the Troy campaign should spend some time.

### Images

Images requested for campaign:

- Old campaign signs or logos
- Any swearing in photos from the past
- Photos with parents
- Family Photo (if possible)
- Photo with any parents
- Photo with Sheriff
- Photo with Clerk
- Photo with Congressman
- Photo with State Legislator
- Photo going door-to-door
- Photo with sea of supporters in “Troy” shirts

### Opposition Research

Having been an elected officeholder for many years, Howard Johnson has a history of votes that are part of the public record. Also, it is important to obtain information from past ethics reports as well as contributions. Information to be gathered should include:

- All votes on Council
- All votes and initiatives as Mayor
- All votes as a state legislator
- Any “silly” programs
- All proposed legislation
- Any intelligence from other legislators
- Attendance to meetings – did Johnson have a high rate of absenteeism?
- Personnel files from past employers
- ethics disclosure reports
- Past contributors from State of Ohio
- Past contributors locally
- Property records
- Records of real estate dealings he has participated in or his employees
- Any record of money or advantage gained on property or otherwise in areas he had influence as elected officeholder
- Any delinquent taxes
- Liens/Judgments
- Tickets/criminal
- Past campaign expenditures
- Voting record from BOE

Sample Prospect Letter

### Keep Helen Troy, Cook County Solicitor

A prospect letter is a fundraising letter that is sent to prospective donors. Prospective donors can be identified from past donor lists of other candidates, voter database files, phone call identification, members of friendly organizations and other methods.

The point of a prospect letter is to personalize it to the individual being asked to contribute, and to create a need and urgency for the donor to want to give. It is also helpful if a candidate can supply a specific purpose for the particular donation being sought.

John Doe  
555 Ohio Drive  
Taft City, Ohio

Dear John,

Two months from today is Election Day, and I need your help.

Labor Day has now come and gone, and this summer flew by. The Troy campaign was out in force at the various community festivals, and we are looking forward to the Oktoberfest season!

The Democrats have targeted my race, and Howard Johnson has been raising money to defeat me. Although we have been raising money as well, we have to compete and educate voters about our success in office over the past four years.

We need to tell people how we have won awards for customer service, our web site, our computer system and the efficiency our office has improved since you last voted for me four years ago.

We have a great staff of people who work hard to serve the public and bring incredible service to those who need us.

Unfortunately, Howard Johnson is telling people that we are not doing a good job. He doesn’t tell people about the many awards we have won or how we are spending less now than four years ago. Howard Johnson will say whatever he has to in order to get this job.

Under the Helen Troy administration, we have raised our service to a level never before seen,and we have cut costs doing it.

The Troy campaign needs to tell its success story on television, and we desperately need your help to do this.

Enclosed is a self-addressed envelope that I ask you to take a few moments of your time to fill out. I also ask that you consider sending along a donation to help the Troy campaign tell its story on television.

Your generous contribution of $100 will be helpful in our television effort. $100 allows us to play one spot on the local network morning show or one spot on cable news in the evening. If you are unable to give $100 but still wish to contribute, then I ask you to consider a smaller gift of $50 or $25.

Every little bit helps.

If you would allow us to place a yard sign in your yard, please indicate so on the enclosed envelope as well, or you can sign up to volunteer.

John, your help is greatly appreciated, and I cannot win without you.

Please send the enclosed envelope to my campaign at your earliest convenience.

Thank you for your support, and I look forward to seeing you on the campaign trail!

Sincerely,

Helen Troy  
Cook County Solicitor

Troy Makes it Official  
Republican Solicitor Files to Keep Seat

(Taft City, OH) Cook County Solicitor Helen Troy has filed his petitions to keep the seat to which she was elected four years ago after unseating long-time Solicitor F. Gilbert Quinlan.

“In the time that I have been Solicitor, I am pleased with the work we have done,” said Troy. “I am particularly proud of the effort we have made to protect consumer information in Cook County. The advances we have made in our computer system and office efficiency serve the people of Cook County well.”

Troy will run her campaign highlighting her experience as a small business owner and employer for over 20 years as well as her extensive legal background and experience as an assistant prosecutor and County Solicitor.

Issues that Troy has put at the top of her priorities include consumer protection, efficiency in government, and customer service.

“One of the biggest problems Ohio faces is protecting consumers from fraud,” Troy said. “We must make our records accessible but safe so that the public is served best.”

Troy is partner in the law firm of Troy and Roma providing legal services to Taft City and surrounding townships. She is a lifelong Cook County resident living in Taft City with her husband Perry. They have three children William, Laura and Anthony.

### Troy Unanimously Endorsed By Bar Association

(Taft City, OH) Republican Solicitor Helen Troy’s support from the Cook County Bar Association was reaffirmed this evening in a vote by the Bar’s full membership. The vote for Troy’s endorsement was unanimous.

“I am honored by, and thankful for, the confidence the Cook County Bar has placed in me,” said Troy. “I am working hard to serve Cook County, and I am working just as hard to run a campaign.”

“The Bar Association is an excellent cross section of the County, and they know me and my opponent well. I look forward to keeping this seat in firm conservative, Republican hands for many years to come,” Troy said.

Troy is a Taft City attorney and has operated a successful law practice for over 25 years with her law partner Frank Roma.

Troy blasts former State Rep. for excessive staff travel

In response to questions about having the highest absentee rate while a State Representative, Howard Johnson suggested that the reason he missed nearly one out of every five meetings in 2002 is because he was traveling. The Troy campaign has learned that Johnson’s staff racked up quite a travel bill on the taxpayer’s dime.

Sample Letter Requesting Public Information

---

### Keep Helen Troy, Cook County Solicitor

Public information is generally accessible through the Internet or by phone. A person doing campaign research should identify the authority from whom certain public information is available. After exhausting resources on the Internet, the researcher should then attempt to gather the information with a phone call. When none of that works, a letter is generally the next step. Professional government agencies should not withhold public information, and it is generally considered improper for a government employee to ask why the information is being requested. Many government employees are nosy and will tell a researcher that by knowing why they want the information, they can better serve them. Either the information exists, or it does not exist, and the government employee does not need to know why the information is being requested.

The request should come from someone not closely tied to the campaign. Although there is nothing wrong with requesting public information, by having a top campaign volunteer or official request information, the likelihood of the opposition discovering the request increases. This type of mistake generally allows the opponent to know what a candidate is seeking and what the candidate will find. Consequently, the value of the information gathered will decrease.

Sample Fundraising Script

---

### Keep Helen Troy, Cook County Solicitor

Chapter 5 discusses how the candidate is the campaign’s best fundraiser. Donors will more likely respond to a direct appeal from a candidate than most other people. Therefore, a candidate must become comfortable in asking for money.

Below is a sample script of how a conversation may go between a candidate and a donor. Conversations will vary greatly from candidate to candidate and donor to donor. The important elements for a candidate to remember are:

> - Short small talk – donors like to know that the candidate has taken a personal interest in them – a good candidate will have notes from which to work that include names and ages of spouses and family members, employment information and any interests gathered from past conversations

> - Acknowledging any past contributions the donor has made

|Helen:|Hi, Bob, this is Helen Troy, how are you doing?|
|Donor:|Helen, it’s good to hear from you! How is the office doing?|
|Helen:|We’re doing great. Did you see in the newspaper where we won an award last month for taxpayer protection by refusing to put personal information on the Internet?|
|Donor:|I did. That’s great news. You’ve made us all proud that we supported you.|
|Helen:|Thanks, Bob. How’s Marcy and your boy William?|
|Donor:|Marcy’s fine. I’ll tell her you asked about her. She’d love to get together for lunch with you sometime. William is in his sophomore year at Ohio, and I think he wants to be a lawyer like his father. I’m really proud of him.|
|Helen:|Bob, that’s great. If he needs a reference, I would be honored to be on his resume. I know how hard of a worker he is.|
|Donor:|Thanks, Helen.|
|Helen:|Bob, I really appreciate the support that you and your partners gave me when I ran last time. I couldn’t have done it without you, and you gave me the boost that I needed to win.|
|Donor:|Helen, we need you in that position. Your predecessor was a disaster. All of my people tell me now that your customer service is through the roof, and you respond to requests quickly.|
|Helen:|Thank you for letting me know that. It will encourage my staff to know that people notice their hard work.  <br>Bob, you know that I’m coming up on my reelection, and I have tough opposition from Howard Johnson. He’s going to get a lot of money from the unions.|
|Donor:|I saw that, Helen. We need to make sure he doesn’t win. He has no experience, and he doesn’t understand the office. That’s why he lost his legislative seat after only one term.|
|Helen:|I understand. That’s why I am in full fundraising mode right now. I am calling all of my friends and a lot of people I don’t know. I just found out that Howard is going to spend $100,000 on television during the last week of the campaign. I don’t have the funds to compete with his big donors yet. Bob, I need your help. Can I count on your support this time?|
|Donor:|Helen, you can always count on my support. You talked about $100,000. I can’t do that much, but what are you looking for?|
|Helen:|I’d like to know if you would host an event where you would be the main host for $15,000 and invite your associates and friends for $1,000 each. I’d like to raise $50,000 in one night. That would send a strong message that we’re going to be tough.|
|Donor:|Wow. I can probably host an event for you. In fact, I’d love to host an event for you. That’s a lot to raise in one night, though.|
|Helen:|I know it is, but it’s not too much more than what you did for me last time. Please know that I am grateful for the help you have already given me.  <br>  <br>Can I ask for a home hosted event where you commit to $10,000, and I’ll add my own people into the invitations to help get to $50,000?|
|Donor:|How close will $50,000 get you to your goal?|
|Helen:|Bob, your event could make my race. $50,000 makes us competitive on television, and I’m planning on another fundraiser to give us an advantage. I’m going to throw some of my own money into this if I have to.|
|Donor:|Alright, Helen, I admire your tenacity. Count on me and Marcy for $10,000. We’ll host the event, and I’ll ask my associates to contribute as well. I might need your people to make some calls to your lists to get us to $50,000.|
|Helen:|That’s great! Thank you for your support. Should I have my finance chairman call your secretary to set up the particulars?|
|Donor:|That would be fine. Give me about 6 weeks to work on it.|
|Helen:|Thank you, Bob. You don’t know how much this means to me.|
|Donor:|I’m glad to help. Thanks for doing a good job as Solicitor.|   

# Appendix M –  
Sample Phone Scripts – Advocacy

---

### Keep Helen Troy, Cook County Solicitor

A common tactic that campaigns use is the recorded telephone message. The idea of the recorded telephone message is to deliver an advocacy message on behalf of the candidate in 30 seconds or less. The message can come directly from the candidate or a trusted third party such as a popular elected official.

Successful recorded messages are generally delivered to phones at times when people are not typically at home. The idea is to get the message on the recipient’s voicemail so that when they check their messages, they will listen to the whole spiel. Whereas many people get perturbed by recorded calls talking to them when they answer their phone, the nature of voicemail is such that they expect the messages to which they are listening to be recorded. Therefore, an advocacy telephone message is best delivered on voicemail.

Below are a few sample scripts that contain some key elements:

> - Message is short

> - Candidate’s name is mentioned multiple times

> - There are not multiple themes in each call – Each call should be focussed

> - Disclaimer informing who paid for the call
