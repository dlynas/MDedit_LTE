## Preface

This book is about solutions to the crisis that is destroying our planet and so many of its inhabitants. It is not another warning that will only make us more depressed about the problem. Neither is it a quick fix designed to make us feel better for now, as the problem only festers. It is about staring the problem in the face and being honest with ourselves about the changes we have to make to truly solve it.

Because the exploitation of the planet is interrelated with exploitation in human societies, the ecological crisis is very much a question of justice, reparations, or revolution. Consistent with the critiques I present here about climate apartheid and green colonialism, all of the author proceeds from sales of this book will go to Indigenous initiatives against ecocide and for the recovery of their territories in Indonesia and Brazil, to communities who supported this book by giving interviews and arranging for its translation into other languages.  

## Acknowledgments

I want to send thanks to my editor, Neda Tehrani, for the scrutiny and the ideas on the outline that really helped me understand the book I was writing.

I am extremely grateful to all the people who sat down for interviews, giving this book a global scope and amplifying the voices that are often excluded. Above all I am grateful to the people who put their blood, sweat, and tears into the initiatives and battles covered in the interviews. They are the true creators of the knowledge this book attempts to focus and transmit.

I want give a special thanks to Zenite for the enthusiasm, the help finding amazing sources, and the translations from Portuguese. Thanks to the comrades in Indonesia who made the world smaller, more connected, with their solidarity and dedication. Thanks to Baky for the encouragement and the conversations about one of the more controversial aspects of this book. Thanks to Adrianna for our vagabond dialogue exploring rootedness and interrogating power across three continents.

Thanks to Xander for the good conversations, the support, and all the pdfs and research recommendations that proved invaluable for this book. Thanks to Return Fire for the encouragement and sources. Thanks to T Châu for sources and insight on engaged Buddhism. Thanks to Gabriel Kuhn for generously sharing his book with me. Thanks to Tawinikay for pointers on the Indigenous struggles that provided the necessary context to what is happening today in so-called Canada.

Thanks to Lp for helping me with therapy when I couldn’t afford it, and thanks to X and Kevin for financial support. Thanks to M for handing me down that clunker of a laptop from 2006, and to Vayra for helping me spring for a new (used) one.

Thanks to my mom for nurturing in me a love of the natural world and always encouraging me to write, and to my dad for those early walks in the woods to check out what the beavers were up to, and for teaching me how to garden.

Love and fire to all my comrades who have fought alongside me against this insatiable machine, leading the charge or watching my back: you give me life; to the generations who struggled before us: we carry you with us; and to the land and water that give me sustenance as I write these lines.

Thanks to Gali for the love and cuddles during a winter of pandemic and confinement, and for jumping up in my lap to distract me from writing just the right amount, neither too often nor too seldom. Finally, a sweet thank you to R for making it so hard to finish.


The Solutions Are Already Here




THE BARE BONES: THE SITUATION NOW AND OUR LIKELY FUTURES

IN THE BIOSPHERE EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED: THE ECOLOGICAL CRISIS BEYOND CARBON

HOARD THE PROFIT, SHARE THE BLAME: THE ANTHROPOCENE RECONSIDERED

The changes associated with the ecological crisis are so huge, many geologists favor naming a new epoch beginning with the appearance of anthropogenic or human-caused changes to the planet, whether deforestation, carbon emissions, or nuclear radiation. This is a big deal. The geological epoch that still officially encompasses the present moment, the Holocene, has been going on for 11,650 years and without anthropogenic climate change would probably have lasted for a great deal more time. The epoch before it lasted for two and a half million years, and the one before that lasted for three million years.

The proposal for the name of the new epoch is the Anthropocene, the geological age defined by humans, _anthropos_, even down to the rocks and the chemical processes of the planet. How fair, how accurate, is it to blame these changes on humans?

Though the society that is causing this major ecological crisis is truly global, it only became global through a particular course, and not everyone has the same relationship to it. It might not be “my” society in the same way that it is “your” society. To understand why this is so, we need to take a little jaunt through the history of the ecological crisis and the society that has produced it.

_Homo sapiens_ diverged from another early hominin 300,000 years ago. However, human-related problems capable of destroying life systems on a planetary scale only began to emerge some two hundred years ago. What’s more, human social and technological evolution is nothing like a smooth, linear progress from less to more ecocidal behaviors. The society that today reveals itself to be undeniably ecocidal is not some machine that was 300,000 years in the making; the vast majority of human history did not contribute to the present moment, and the idea that human technology is synonymous with ecocide is baseless and, on inspection, racist. It erases the vast majority of human experience, especially that which is external to Europe and its cultural offshoots.

Because a planetary ecological crisis is unprecedented, we can try to find its roots in continental and regional-scale ecological crises. In fact, such crises go back about four thousand years, or just over 1 percent of human history. And because the idea of a unilinear human history is such a pervasive myth, we should also be clear that ecocidal behaviors do not constitute the most recent 1 percent of human history. Rather, ecological crises were extremely rare three and four thousand years ago, happening in just a tiny portion of humankind’s overall territory.

What kinds of human societies have caused the collapse of entire ecosystems? As it turns out, there is a clear pattern of major civilizations destroying their soil through deforestation and overexploitation, and then experiencing some kind of political or population collapse. Sing C. Chew documents how, throughout the history of Chinese civilization, economic expansions correlate with increases in catastrophic flooding; both in turn are related to deforestation.[^66] Deforestation dramatically decreases the absorption of rainfall, leading to flooding, and economic expansion in an accumulative, statist society means the construction of massive palaces, temples, and navies, the clearing of complex forest gardens for denuded, monocrop fields, and robust fuel consumption not just for human needs but for export economies based on metal, brick, and ceramic production. Deforestation can also spell the disappearance of resources on which a city depends, as when the capital of the Japanese state, Heian, was largely abandoned in the twelfth century CE after the surrounding forests were all cut down.[^67]

A multifaceted ecological crisis was perhaps the major cause of the decline of the city-states of Classical Greece. Deforestation, loss of soil fertility, water and air pollution, the local extinction of species like the lion and leopard, localized climate change towards greater aridity and higher temperatures, the subsequent spread of tropical diseases like malaria, all were caused by the state-building and economic accumulation of the Greek city-states. Cities like Athens built commercial empires through colonial outposts from the Black Sea to Iberia; through trade or war and enslavement they made local populations dependent on manufactured goods produced in the center, and in turn had them send back metals, grain, timber, hides, wool, meat, perfumes, and enslaved humans. Athens and the other metropolises were dependent on the colonies for most of their food needs, especially as deforestation in Attica, Macedonia, and Peloponnesus sharply decreased domestic agricultural productivity. They also had to feed an inflated work force of artisans and slaves, such as the 11,000 laborers who toiled in the 87 miles of tunnels of the Laurium silver mines to dig up a metal of no biological utility. All that accumulation attracted the greed of neighboring states and sparked internecine disputes for dominance: Athens practiced genocide against cities that defied it, but their heavy-handedness only provoked more resistance. Attica was definitively deforested to build the warships that would defeat the Persians (449 BCE) and that would sink to the bottom of the Aegean and Ionian seas in the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BCE). In that same century, Athens would have to export its metallurgy industry to be closer to remaining wood sources. Attica lost about half its population between 431 and 313 BCE. The silting of harbors from erosion triggered by deforestation was so extreme that multiple port cities lost their access to the sea: the coastline moved out, and coastal cities like Priene, Myus, and Ephesus became inland cities.[^68]

There is also evidence that deforestation contributed to the collapse of the Roman Empire, something the government itself recognized when the Empire started taking measures—too little, too late—to preserve their forests.[^69]

All these examples concern ancient states. States are relatively rare in human history, and only in the last few hundred years have they come to dominate the entire globe. But one thing it seems all states do is destroy their environment.[^70] States need to be able to rule a subject population and exploit wealth from them. This leads them to impose monocrop field agriculture. Monocrop fields are easy to tax because they all become ripe at the same time, the amount of tax due is easy to calculate on the basis of simple geometry (much of which was developed for exactly this purpose), and the subject population cannot simply run away from state territory—a primary response of people to state authority right up until states became universal—because their food security is tied to fields that can easily be found and destroyed. On the contrary, stateless populations that have to exist in defiance of state authority tend to rely on diverse practices of food autonomy, favoring a mix of hunting, gathering, forest gardens, and root crops that are easy to hide, easy to disperse through a non-flattened, “illegible” stateless landscape, and that can be harvested when most convenient for the harvester.[^71]

Incidentally, and in a clear confirmation of the usefulness of the concept of social war, state-resistant food practices encourage people to exist sustainably as part of a robust ecosystem, reject authoritarian forms of organization, and facilitate defensive guerrilla warfare, whereas statist practices of monocrop agriculture make it easier to surveille, extort, and control subject populations, destroy biodiversity, and they eventually lead to ecological crisis.

There are also plenty of examples of states passing laws to protect portions of their environment, though “states will act to prevent environmental degradation only when their economic interests are shown to be directly threatened,”[^72] and, I would add, when their social control or “national security” are threatened. This has several implications. Often, because of the nature of tipping points, states tend to take action too late. Furthermore, the purpose of state conservation is never to restore ecological health or even to protect the survival and quality of life of its subject populations, it is to preserve its wealth and power. This is one of the origins of the very concept of conservation: roping off an area of designated natural resources to protect it from human usage, though at the same time to preserve it for other usages the state deems strategic. Conservation, therefore, tends to be an act of enclosure, an attack on the very practices of commoning that actually make it possible for humans to respectfully take part in an ecosystem. The French state provides a good example with the creation of the artificial Landes forest throughout the nineteenth century, draining off extensive wetlands that supported a largely autonomous pastoral population in favor of pine plantations to benefit the timber and turpentine industries.

There are other grave implications to the logic of state-driven conservation. Since the objective is strategic, state conservationism is accompanied by ecological imperialism. The game is about protecting your domestic resources, while destroying or occupying the resources of your neighbor. The British Navy—which was the primary vehicle for Britain’s massive colonial empire—ensured a supply of large trees needed for ship construction by expropriating communal forests and excluding peasants from the forest ecosystem they had long relied on, on pain of death. The government even began applying the death penalty to anyone who obscured their face with charcoal, a practice peasants had taken to so as to be able to gather firewood or hunt in anonymity.[^73]

Bestseller Jared Diamond has told a story about forest conservation during Japan’s Edo period that has become something of a parable for many environmentalists desperate to believe that the _right_ government can flick a switch and begin protecting natural resources as a sheer act of will or mere policy divorced from any other considerations.[^74] What actually happened is more complex. Statist militarism and warfare were major drivers of deforestation in sixteenth century Japan. After a bloody series of wars to establish centralized control, the Tokugawa Shogunate tried to preserve state power and prevent collapse by encouraging feudal relations between classes. The military/political class had rights of exploitation, but subject to clear limits, and the laboring class had a high degree of economic autonomy (as compared both to imperial slave economies and liberal modernity). The shogunate passed laws preserving the mountainous areas as forest land—in part hunting reserves for the elite and in part village commons—but it was local village councils and not the government that carried out the actual practices that restored the decimated forests.[^75] In other words, the state undertook these measures to provide a social release valve and avoid the combined threats of social collapse and economic collapse. They did not have the capacity to carry out their dictates or manage reforestation. It was largely left to common people to do this.

The feudal compromise allowed the Japanese state to survive, and the next chapter in the story illustrates why it is not a good idea to entrust states with power over the environment: because state policy reflects the state’s interests, not our own. With the Meiji restoration, state power centralized rapidly and industrialization proceeded in leaps and bounds as the fledgling empire sought to compete with neighboring states and intruding Euro-American powers (militaristic competition being an inherent problem where states are concerned). The Meiji government legislated forest protection, but these protections were on paper only—another recurring theme when it comes to state-led conservationism—and the bountiful forests of the Edo period were quickly cut down for railroads, building construction, and factories.[^76] In tandem, the Japanese state began an aggressive drive towards resource imperialism, conquering Taiwan, Korea, Manchuria, and other territories, and setting itself on a path to carry out some of the major genocides of the twentieth century. In the post-war period, Japan was able to replenish its depleted forests around the time its emerging high-tech economy favored the importation of cheap forestry products from poorer neighbors that could not afford the luxury of ecological protections in the new neoliberal economy. The Japanese market has been one of the major drivers of deforestation in the tropical forests of Malaysia and Indonesia.

While it seems that all states are ecocidal, not all societies that damage their environment are states. However, social hierarchies still play a role. The Rapa Nui society (called “Easter Island” by colonizers) experienced a population collapse when their soil failed due to deforestation around 1600. Rapa Nui oral history speaks of a more centralized, hierarchical political system before the decline. Carving and transportation of the _moai_, stone statues that elevated the elite status of clan leaders, required extensive scaffolding and especially rolling logs, and was one cause of deforestation together with extensive agriculture. Deforestation was so extreme that several tree and other species went extinct and the topsoil eroded, leading to severe food shortages. I should point out that several white writers have likely exaggerated the extent of the collapse and spun lurid tales of cannibalism, despite a scarcity of evidence of increased interpersonal violence.[^77] It is telling that white writers tend to place all the emphasis on the population decline that occurred before European colonization of Rapa Nui, and not on the collapse caused by violent colonizers. The former resulted in a population decline by a factor of about five, the latter—European colonization—resulted in a population decline by a factor of over twenty.

States tend to lock people into fixed ways of living in demarcated territories, even if those ways of living are unsustainable, in order to hold onto power. Stateless societies are more able to change their ways. Of the three earliest civilizations—societies based on irrigated field agriculture and at least some prevalence of city construction—one of them, the Indus Valley or Harappan civilization, appears to have been stateless, and certainly exhibits far fewer archaeological indicators of statism than the Nile Valley and Mesopotamian civilizations, such as monuments to rulers or supreme deities, wealth inequality, food poverty among the lower classes, and a militarized architecture or other signs of permanent warfare.[^78] If they had a ruling class, the rulers left no sign of their passing, in stark distinction to all known ancient states.

Rather than entering into a cycle of imperial expansion and eventual collapse, like the other two, the Harappan civilization was the only one to walk away when ecological conditions no longer favored large field agriculture and dense urban living. In this case, the crisis was probably not one of their own making (also a relevant distinction), but a natural interruption of the monsoon cycle and a decrease in precipitation. In response, Harappan society migrated upland to a territory that still had sufficient natural irrigation, and shifted to a more decentralized, small-scale settlement pattern.[^79]

This response is especially relevant when we compare it to Mesopotamia, which existed as part of the same world system as the Indus Valley cities, enmeshed in intense networks of trade. Deforestation linked to economic expansion in Mesopotamia caused increased flooding, the silting up of irrigation channels, and the salinization of fields, making it increasingly difficult to grow crops. In the Indus Valley, rainfall decreased around 2200 BCE, by which time the Harappan cities had already begun a slow decline and after which they changed their settlement patterns more rapidly.[^80] This suggests they began to give up on their more exploitative, labor-intensive lifestyle as soon as the ecology became unfavorable, perhaps even starting this transformation before the climatic shift. Yet the decrease in precipitation in Mesopotamia began earlier, with important droughts throughout the fourth millennium BCE and again around 2200 BCE,[^81] yet the advanced bureaucratic state took no notice and forced its subjects to carry on with business as usual. The ecological crisis eventually became unavoidable. In the Early Dynastic Period, 3000 to 2350 BCE, crop yields stood at 2,030 liters of grain per hectare. By 1700 BCE, this had dropped to 718 liters per hectare. But rather than read the writing on the wall, elites simply forced lower classes to work harder in squeezing every last drop of blood out of the stony earth, such that cultivators began seeding more intensively and skipping the vital fallow years, leading to further degradation of the soil. The state mandated surplus production, captured entire populations, and put them to work in towns focused on large-scale textile production to keep their economy humming. It was a lost cause: the cities of southern Mesopotamia faded away, and power shifted to the north with the rise of Babylon.[^82] But Babylon had learned nothing, and its days were also numbered. Much of the region of what was once lush forest and fertile gardens is still a desert today.

There may have been processes of adaptation and abandonment similar to the Harappan experience in the Mississippian, Maya, and Tiwanaku civilizations of the Americas. Around 1000 CE, a large civilization arose along the Mississippi river based on the cultivation of maize. They built large earthen pyramids that played a role in a more centralized, hierarchical spiritual system. Perhaps in response to the declining quality of life among the incipient lower classes due to state effects like increasing warfare and stratification, deforestation and biodiversity loss, possibly compounded by climatic changes, the civilization was abandoned around 1400–1500 CE and the population diffused to live in a more decentralized manner, selecting which of their society’s technologies—from maize cultivation to mound-building—to preserve and readapt on a smaller scale.

The Maya civilization erected huge cities and great monuments across the Yucatan Peninsula and beyond. Millions of Mayan people still live in the same region today, though Western journalists, historians, and educators tend to speak about a “disappearance” or a “lost people.” This Indiana Jones-style trope combines the racist erasure of the Other with the tendency of statists to view stateless periods of history as “Dark Ages.”[^83] Amid all the scholarly articles on the “Classical Maya collapse” of 800–900 CE, it is difficult to find any that take into account oral histories passed on by Mayan peoples today. What occurred was not a disappearance, no one vanished, rather they changed where and how they lived. Most notably, over vast areas they stopped building cities and high-status monuments, and no longer submitted to the political authority of theocratic rulers. Significantly, “regions that were less integrated and hierarchically organized in the Classic period experienced less dramatic collapse.”[^84]

The causes included a long drought caused largely by deforestation and exacerbated by soil depletion from large-scale agriculture, and increasingly lethal warfare as different monarchies struggled for dominance. Biodiversity loss was also a factor, as deforestation led to the collapse of many animal populations, the disappearance of opportunities for hunting, a less diverse diet with less protein, and thus greater susceptibility to famine.[^85]

Some kind of popular rebellion also played a role, whether a massive refusal or an all-out revolution, as people abandoned or toppled the ruling elite and in at least some areas refused to maintain centralizing spiritual, political, and agricultural practices, instead favoring more decentralized, egalitarian, ecological practices, or in the words of one study, “less tolerance for hierarchy and centralization” paired with a “collective ethos” and an ability to organize collective works.[^86] This was more an adaptation than a collapse, as they preserved much of their spirituality, arts, and knowledge systems up to and beyond the Spanish invasion. The social mobility that allowed them to survive the havoc wreaked by their governors also allowed some of them to escape Spanish domination for nearly two centuries by moving to the geographies most illegible to European colonization.[^87]

The Tiwanaku civilization in the Andes existed from about 550 to 1000 CE, erecting stone cities dominated by great temples. It was a theocratic system in which a diversity of gods and spirits were unified under the central authority of the Sun God, access to whom was controlled by a professionalized caste of priests. Andean oral history speaks of a primarily spiritual rebellion against Tiwanaku centralization and an abandonment of the civilization that left the region stateless for several centuries.[^88]

In a contrasting example, social elites may take advantage of ecological crises they cause in order to augment their power. It seems possible that in both Ancient Egypt and Hawai’i before colonization, an ecological disaster created a population of environmental refugees who could be exploited in ways that popular social values previously would not have allowed, granting elites access to a subject population and a dependent labor force necessary for accumulating wealth and power.[^89]

We have found one piece of the puzzle. Humans do not destroy the environment, but states do. Stateless societies are by no means perfect, but they are less likely to carry out ecocide and more able to adapt and change their ways. Entrenched hierarchies inside and outside states often encourage ecocidal behaviors and prevent adaptation. Throughout human history, revolution has been a commonsense and effective response to the ecocide conducted by ruling classes. _If we do not revolt in the face of ecocide, the likely result is that states will increase their power and intensify their exploitative practices._

The regional ecological collapses we have just looked at present a clear precedent to the kind of ecocide we are faced with today, but we must find another cause for two important changes: the extreme quantitative shift from regional disasters to a global disaster; and a qualitative shift from cyclical histories of centralization and rebellion to a linear history of exponential growth in which all territories are locked into an insatiable process of accumulation and ecocide.

Industrialism is an obvious candidate, but I would argue that placing the blame on a society of smokestacks and fossil fuels is to confuse cause with effect. Massive deforestation in North America was already well under way before the widespread deployment of steam power and the advent of industrialism. Early settlers, scientists, and politicians, from Christopher Columbus to Thomas Jefferson, advocated deliberate deforestation to “improve” the climate.[^90] Meanwhile, sixteenth-century deforestation in Britain fueled the emigration of poor settlers to the colonies.[^91]

Industrialism was the consequence of the exponential expansion of capitalism. The engine for that expansion was colonialism. In order to take off, industrialism needed access to liquid capital for large-scale investments, it needed captive markets, and it needed the reliable availability of cheap resources like sugar, cotton, and animal skins. These were the products of colonialism, from the Spanish silver mines of Potosí that used Indigenous slave labor, to the Spanish, French, and English sugar plantations of the Caribbean and the cotton plantations of the North American mainland (all of which relied on the mass enslavement of Africans), to the French fur-trapping empire farther north, to the cycle of accumulation engineered by the Dutch in Southeast Asia.

The cause of the global ecological crisis is colonialism. It is no coincidence that the political, economic, and cultural institutions that were developed by the most successful northern European colonizers are the ones that are now global. These institutions—from stock exchanges and corporations to universities, land privatization, political parties, and property-based legal systems—were spread throughout a world system that was created by wars of conquest and acts of genocide, with all other ways of life being brutally stamped out. The British, whose empire came to cover 25 percent of the planet’s land area, used an effective combination of tactics. They conquered footholds in territories they wished to colonize, decimated local populations in vicious acts of warfare, gave defeated societies the chance to become British allies, sold them European weapons to serve as effective proxies for the capture of slaves and territory, imported enslaved peoples from other areas to jumpstart a plantation economy and destroy any practices of commoning, and further integrated colonized peoples with missionaries and with treaties that offered the hope of survival—adapting to European ways in order to be recognized as human by European overseers—even as treaty-guaranteed rights were progressively whittled away and forgotten. Other colonizers, from major players like the Dutch to relatively minor players like the Swedish, used similar methods.

The kind of economic growth that accompanied colonialism was extractivist and genocidal. From the islands of the Taíno to the Andean highlands, Spanish colonizers forced Indigenous peoples to mine gold and silver, cutting off their hands if they did not meet their quotas. Belgium applied similar tactics in central Africa. When part of the population of the Maluku Islands refused to continue supplying spices for the Dutch, the Dutch massacred them and imported an enslaved population from other islands, building a new society from the ground up, designed for maximum productivity and discipline. When the Dutch, Portuguese, British, and others could not conquer China outright, they conquered trading posts and began to organize large-scale opium production in South Asia, importing the addictive commodity in order to jumpstart a capitalist economy. Over twelve million people were kidnapped in Africa and enslaved, sent to work in sugar and cotton plantations in the Americas.[^92] One to two and a half million died in the terrible conditions of the transatlantic voyage, and many millions more died from the wars encouraged by European slave traders in order to get their captives. Europeans also began a profitable commerce that continues in Africa to this day with murderous results: the international arms trade.

Cotton went to supply the looms of the first industrial proletariat on the planet, many of them child laborers. Marshlands were drained and forests were cut down for fuel, for the building of ships, and for the establishment of plantations. The machine kept accelerating; next it turned to coal as a fuel source, and the destabilization of the planet’s climate, already begun thanks to deforestation, was now fully under way. The society responsible for colonialism and for capitalism would throw anything and anyone into its furnaces, whatever the consequences.

Such were the origins of the global economic system we have today: resources extracted by the most ruthless means available, rationalizing the pillaging of living ecosystems and the crushing of human spirits and aspirations so that everyone and everything that does not belong to the owning and governing classes is squeezed for profit or left to rot in surveilled sacrifice zones; natural wealth shipped across the globe to be transformed by machines and workers treated like machines, turned into commodities and sold for a profit that goes not to the ones who did the work but to the ones who were given the privilege of organizing these circuits of exploitation; profits reinvested in similar exploitative ventures, or in fatuous gambling on the likelihood of such ventures to turn a profit, on future prices and currency values, anything that satisfies the fundamental imperative of capital to accumulate more capital, growth _by any means necessary_.

Never before in human history had capitalist logics been hegemonic in human life and the life of the planet, with a new model of the state, effectively fused with capitalist accumulation, conquering the globe and effectively criminalizing and destroying the commons everywhere, forcing the entire human species out of its myriad ecological niches and into a suicidal dependence on a growth-based economy.

Official decolonization after World War II did little to change this dynamic. Because it had to occur according to the colonizers’ timeline and criteria, governed by coups, fresh invasions, debt bondage, and structural adjustment, it is more accurate to speak of neocolonialism than of any substantive end to colonization.[^93]

The shift to new forms of colonialism only strengthened the implantation of Western institutions. If colonialism created the possibility for a global ecological crisis, the crisis is currently accelerating not through inertia but because the same global system, in updated form, has intensified. More powerful than ever, the stockholders and governors of this system not only hoard the wealth; they are uniquely responsible for the devastation caused by an extractive economy. The wealthiest one percent is responsible for double the CO2 emissions of the poorer half of the global population.[^94]

While some humans are profiting immensely off the destruction of the planet and doing everything they can to prevent meaningful change, other humans are doing everything they can to protect the land and preserve healthy relationships between humans and the rest of the ecosystem. Consider that 80 percent of biodiversity on the planet is to be found on Indigenous territory. Saying that “humans” are responsible for ecological devastation is a continuation of colonial racism, and it is an insult to the peoples who have fought against obliteration to preserve their way of life and their relationship with their territory. It is also an insult to the many people who, despite growing up in a culture totally infused with the values of capitalism, have risked their lives and freedom to defend the land and halt destructive development projects. And it is an insult to the hundreds of millions who are subjected to extreme poverty or absolute precarity by the very same economic order that profits from ecocide, who have to worry about their personal survival and that of their family and community, and do not have the luxury of choosing between different job opportunities and consumer products based on how “ecological” they might be.

As Kathryn Yusoff argues in _A Billion Black Anthropocenes_, the framework of the Anthropocene is racist, and it also serves to obscure our view, to hide the actual system at the heart of the problem.[^95] People in the Global South—people dehumanized by Western slavery, colonialism, and racism—finally get included in the category “human,” just in time to share the blame for the devastation caused by a social system that has ravaged them far more than they have profited from it.

The ecological crisis is not only the greatest crisis we face, it also encompasses nearly every other crisis and conflict, including the economic crisis that subjects billions of people to precarity or crushing poverty, the crisis of legitimacy that is plaguing governments worldwide, and the technological crisis that juggles problems of totalitarianism, surveillance, and mass unemployment.


The Solutions Are Already Here




GOVERNMENT PROMISES AND MARKET SOLUTIONS: THE PROFITABLE FAILINGS OF PARIS, THE NGOS, AND CLIMATE CAPITALISM

RELIGIONS OF CONSUMPTION: ECOCIDE AND ENTITLEMENT

PRISON CELLS AND DEATH SQUADS: THE REAL FIRST RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE

In April of 2009, representatives of the 28 member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) met in Strasbourg, France, and just across the border in Kehl, Germany. The largest military alliance on the planet had climate change on its agenda at a time when politicians in most member states were at best inactive and at worst actively denying the reality of the situation. What solution did they propose to climate change? Increasing “border security” as well as biometric IDs and more surveillance for their domestic populations, and reemphasizing their goal of normalizing the domestic use of military forces in urban environments by 2020. A strategy paper released in advance of the summit said plainly that “Security challenges are predominantly socio-economic, not military-technical, in character.”[^88] The paper goes on to make clear that “socio-economic” threats are those posed by poor people, climate refugees, and others angered or harmed by the current state of affairs, and as such, member states should continue to integrate police and military action and be prepared to deploy the military in their home territories.[^89]

Anyone who is shocked by this response, or sees it as some kind of _non sequitur_, has failed to appreciate the true nature or scope of the ecological crisis. World governments, particularly those in the Global North, understand the crisis as a security issue. They know the problem is real, and they know growing deserts and rising sea levels will force hundreds of millions of people from their homes in search of their very survival. Their solution is to further militarize the borders—those borders of Fortress Europe and the American southwest that are most definitely “designed to kill”—so that people fleeing for their lives will be dissuaded by the very real possibility of dying in their journey.[^90]

To put it simply, the major militaries of the world, already among the greatest producers of toxic waste and greenhouse gases, propose killing even more people to shield themselves from the consequences of the crisis they are in large part responsible for. And they also propose increasing the repression against their own citizens, fully aware that the lower classes everywhere will bear the brunt of the crisis, and rebellions are to be expected in the North as well as in the South.

While the rich and powerful rubbed shoulders at the summit, thousands of anarchists and other anticapitalists took to the streets, battling with police and burning down banks as they tried to disrupt the NATO summit. Though the media condescendingly portrayed them as a mindless horde bent on evil deeds, they were perfectly aware of what NATO was proposing and the stakes for all the rest of us. Their response might be characterized as the most reasonable and intelligent, at the very least if we compare it to that of the scientists and NGOs who continue to dialogue with the same governments sponsoring the summit.

Three kinds of people with the most experience and the most effectiveness at resisting the ecological crisis have been systematically excluded from the official conversation on solutions to climate change: Indigenous peoples trying to protect or recover their land and their traditional forms of life; people most affected by the ecological crisis, including climate refugees; and radical environmentalists, radical in the true sense of going to the root of the problem, and therefore, typically, participants in anticapitalist and anticolonial movements.

These should not be thought of as three separate groups. Many Indigenous people are anarchists and socialists; many migrants, or activists opposing incinerators or coal mines in their neighborhoods, are Indigenous, or anticapitalists, or both. Instead, we can think of these as three different frontlines that intersect on countless occasions.

It is significant that the state treats people on all three of these lines as social enemies to be surveilled, as threats to be eliminated. NATO is not exceptional. From Borneo to Brighton, when people start taking action to defend the Earth and fight for a dignified survival, the default response of governments and the economic interests they work with hand in hand is to resort to death squads or prison cells.

On Borneo, one of the main threats to the environment, to Indigenous communities, and to poor people stuck between small farming in an inhospitable economy and forced urbanization with unhealthy conditions, is deforestation carried out primarily in connection with the palm oil, logging, and paper pulp industries which constitute the main sources of revenue for the local oligarchy. Deforestation causes deadly air pollution, destroys soil, and spells an end to the small-scale farming many communities depend on. Those who resist face violence from police or paramilitary thugs working on behalf of the oligarchy.

One activist from Borneo who works on agrarian issues and Indigenous land struggles, particularly with several Dayak communities, told me how the state neutralizes resistance. “In the worst cases, the state murders its opponents.” Though that happened more frequently during the New Order era, after a US-backed dictatorship murdered over 500,000 people, it still occurs today. The state also “criminalizes and arrests Dayak activists or cultivators … to cover up the actions of the palm oil companies … Sometimes, arrested activists die in police custody.” The activist described one case of a dissident journalist who was tortured and mutilated after writing critically of the business oligarchy that controls politics on the island. The journalist subsequently died in questionable circumstances. “I could name other cases of repression, but it’s a bit psychologically exhausting.”

During the week that I was working on this section of the book, two Indigenous land defenders were killed in Honduras. José Adan Medina and Félix Vazquez, of the Tolupan and Lenca peoples, respectively, were assassinated for opposing hydroelectric dam construction and other land abuses.[^91]

According to the NGO Global Witness, between 2002 and 2018, over 1,700 land defenders—people trying to stop the destruction of the environment or human rights abuses related to resource extraction—were murdered in 50 countries. Some 40 percent of the dead were Indigenous and the killers, the vast majority of whom committed their deeds with impunity, were police, military, and paramilitaries working at the direction of the state or of multinational companies.[^92] A record number of land defenders were murdered in 2019, with 212 deaths recorded and many more unrecorded.[^93] Colombia, the Philippines, and Brazil topped the list for murders (with the caveat that extractivist violence in many African countries is underreported, in part for reasons we will look at shortly).

In Brazil and especially in Colombia, paramilitary death squads created with the support of the United States attack communities that stand in the way of the large economic interests that destroy the rainforest to establish mines, logging operations, and plantations.

In Colombia, Dole Food Company, Chiquita Brands International, and other companies paid paramilitaries several million dollars to protect their interests, including killing union organizers among their workers. The companies would pass the names of labor organizers, community activists, and suspected leftists to the paramilitaries, who would then execute them.[^94] Between 1997 and 2004, paramilitaries committed 4,335 homicides and 1,306 forced disappearances in communities near Chiquita plantations.[^95] And while it was on the Chiquita payroll, the AUC paramilitary group forcibly evicted 60,000 people from their homes in the banana growing region of just one state. Even after the group was declared a terrorist organization by the US State Department (a move that came only after decades of public pressure, given US government complicity with the paramilitaries), Chiquita was sending them money and smuggling in thousands of assault rifles for the AUC using the company’s international distribution facilities.[^96] They were punished with a small fine after a 2007 legal action, in which they were protected from serious consequences by attorney Eric Holder, whom President Obama would soon appoint as Attorney General.

Throughout the Colombian civil war that began in 1964 in large part due to the United States’ Cold War policies, 262,000 people have been killed, 82 percent of them civilians, and 120,000 are still missing. The lion’s share of confirmed civilian killings were carried out by paramilitary death squads (100,000), even though mainstream media citing the same study I am presented the news in a way that suggests leftist guerrillas were responsible for more killings (35,000).[^97] The Colombian military, which received billions in aid, training, and weapons from the US, also had plenty of blood on its hands. Killings by the military became so systematic, officers began establishing quotas and offering cash rewards for higher body counts, leading to soldiers executing more than 10,000 civilians just between 2002 and 2010—largely homeless people or people with mental disabilities they had kidnapped or lured away from the cities—they falsely identified as leftist guerrillas in order to increase their kill counts and claim the rewards.[^98]

In 1995, Ogoni writer and activist Ken Saro-Wiwa was executed by the Nigerian state, together with eight other activists who had been nonviolently protesting the destruction of Ogoni lands in the Niger Delta by the oil industry, particularly Royal Dutch Shell. His last words were, “Lord take my soul, but the struggle continues.” He was right. In December 1998, a youth conference of the neighboring Ijaw people committed to a campaign of direct action against the oil industry, albeit nonviolently. The Nigerian military invaded the region with over ten thousand troops and opened fire on a protest march with machine guns, killing at least three. They again opened fire on a march demanding the release of those arrested, killing at least three more, and then invaded communities, terrorizing the people and raping women and girls. In January 1999, a hundred soldiers directly attached to a Chevron facility attacked two Ijaw villages, killing and disappearing dozens.[^99] Despite this extreme level of violence, the Ijaw did not give up, and one might say they could not give up.

The oil industry makes their lives impossible. Frequent leaks and explosions poison fields, destroy forests, rivers, and coastal waters, and kill workers and neighboring villagers. Since Dutch, British, and US companies began oil extraction in 1956, they have leaked one and a half million tons of oil into the land, or a current rate of a quarter of a million barrels every year.[^100] Increasingly, local Ijaw and Ogoni people cannot feed themselves from the fields, forests, and fisheries on which they had traditionally depended. This is a perfectly acceptable state of affairs within the sort of development framework favored by the World Bank and similar institutions: people _should not_ feed themselves from the land. Subsistence agriculture is dismissed as a primitive activity. Rather, they should get jobs and then pay for food from industrialized and globalized producers (relying, of course, on oil to power their machinery, manufacture their chemicals, and transport their product). However, this is also not an option for the peoples of the Niger Delta, as all the profits of oil extraction go to foreign companies and the central government.

The Ijaw took up arms to defend their lives and formed groups like the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta. MEND sabotaged oil facilities and kidnapped highly paid North American and European oil workers. Their actions and those of similar militant groups led to major reductions in Nigerian oil production, for example shutting down 10 percent of production with a single attack in 2008[^101] and leading to widespread reductions over the better part of a decade. The Nigerian military responded with bloody repression, including aerial bombardments of Ijaw communities. The US military also stepped in to help the government better defend its oil platforms in the name of fighting piracy,[^102] helping oil production in the Niger Delta to grow again.

The state-sanctioned murder of activists using what the West deems to be legitimate (nonviolent) tactics to defend their lands and their livelihoods frequently drives their communities to take up arms just to survive. Subsequently, they often become more able to attack and stop the companies responsible for poisoning them. However, when they are then massacred by their governments with weapons from Europe and North America, human rights NGOs no longer count their deaths—or those of the community members supporting them and giving them shelter—in their lists of land defenders and environmental activists killed each year. So, in fact the above-cited figure of 1,700 murdered land defenders is woefully inadequate.

The violence is by no means a phenomenon of the Global South. It is the result of the colonial, capitalist relations that transect the entire world. The profiteers and the shot-callers can be found wherever there are major concentrations of political and economic power, from Brasilia to London. Contrary to the illusions of civility that are central to every democracy, the violence, while unequal, is also global. As the European Union promotes itself as a model for the green capitalist future, it also profits off the same, gory repression. In the last few years, seven Romanian park rangers have been murdered and over 650 have been assaulted or threatened for going up against logging interests connected to an Austrian company, with the line between legal and illegal logging “increasingly blurred.”[^103] And environmental activists have been threatened or have had to go into hiding due to attempts on their lives after they investigated logging, hydroelectric dams, and other industries. Incidentally, these hydroelectric dams and these forests-turned-logging-plantations are the ostensible carbon sinks and nature preserves that lie at the heart of the European Union’s model for profitable environmental action.

In North America and Europe, the government classifies people opposing pollution, deforestation, and global warming as “extremists” and treats them accordingly. In the US, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security listed “racial and environmentally themed ideologies” as primary motivators for domestic terrorist attacks. As for those “racial” ideologies, the FBI focused a great deal of attention on so-called Black Identity Extremists, its way of discrediting those who are outraged by racist police murders. The property damage of antiracists and environmentalists merited such attention while white supremacists were carrying out hundreds of attacks, many of them lethal, including full scale massacres. Activists who carried out civil disobedience against oil pipelines—simply turning off valves—were placed on the same “extremism” lists as those responsible for mass shootings in Black churches.[^104]

As Andrea Brock has documented, Europe is no stranger to the same dynamics. Those who set up encampments to defend forests are treated as enemies of society and met with militarized repression and marginalization by interlocking consortia of public and private security, elected officials and corporate board members.[^105] As we shall see in the next chapter, farmers and anticapitalists occupying the land and opposing the construction of an airport at Notre-Dame-des-Landes, France, were repeatedly attacked by a militarized police force, with one young person having their hand blown off by a flash bang grenade. German police defending the expansion of an expanding coal mine that is destroying the Hambach Forest regularly brutalize protesters. Numbering in the thousands and backed by military grade weaponry, they have cut protesters down from six-meter-high tree sits, shot them with high pressure water cannons in below freezing temperatures, struck people with vehicles, attacked them with dogs, and kicked their teeth out.[^106]

Italian police shot anarchist Carlo Giuliani in the head, killing him, during heavy protests against the G8 in Genoa in 2001, where they also raided a protest convergence point, brutally assaulting and torturing dozens of people trapped there. At the G8 protest in Evian, France, in 2003, police cut down an activist suspended from a bridge, causing him to fall twenty meters and almost killing him. In 2014, French police killed an environmental activist during heavy repression against a campaign to stop deforestation associated with a new dam. The campaign was eventually successful, and the dam was canceled.

At anticapitalist and ecological protests across North America and Europe, police routinely attack protesters with less lethal weaponry, regardless of whether they are being peaceful or combative, occasionally causing deaths and more frequently leaving people permanently injured. Hundreds of people have had eyeballs shot out or suffered brain damage from high impact munitions. At the protests against the Free Trade Area of the Americas in Miami in 2003—a major neoliberal initiative that would have accelerated ecocidal practices across both continents and which was defeated thanks in part to fierce opposition from the streets—police raped detainees. Sexual assault by police during arrest, especially against women, nonbinary, and trans people, is common.

To preserve the illusion of democracy and the beliefs of privileged citizenry that the institutions of power are on their side, police forces in the Global North use a higher proportion of “soft” counterinsurgency techniques, but these come with their own forms of violence. Many participants in the George Floyd Rebellion in 2020 associated counterinsurgency with discourses of reformism and nonviolence that facilitated the isolation of participants in the uprising, exposing them to the violence of the police, National Guard, and prison system, all of which could be naturalized if they were seen as being used against a criminal minority and not against the movement itself.[^107] This interplay illustrates how soft and hard counterinsurgency methods go hand in glove.

Effective soft counterinsurgency requires massive intelligence gathering. Spying on politically active people in the northern democracies, even to an extent that violates the applicable laws, is systematic. This includes the long-term infiltration of anticapitalist movements. In the UK, around 150 police agents went on deep infiltration assignments against anticapitalist, environmental, and other leftwing movements since 1968, living under assumed identities and participating in those movements for several or even a dozen years. Agents routinely began romantic and sexual relationships with activists they were informing on, using the forms of manipulation they had been trained in. Several of these undercover cops impregnated activists, committed to forming a family with them, and when their stint was up, disappeared.[^108]

Though the details that have become public are horrible, we should assume the truth is far worse: police were caught destroying a large quantity of documents they had been ordered to preserve concerning the infiltration program since the 90s, when it expanded and shifted largely to environmental and anarchist groups.[^109] Since the scandal broke in the news, the UK has introduced a new law to officially allow domestic police to carry out illegal acts while undercover, with support from both major parties.

Between 2010 and 2014, the Spanish state directed its substantial anti-terrorism apparatus against a new public enemy, anarchists, carrying out raids in a half dozen cities, smashing down doors, waking people up with guns in the face, stealing all electronics, disappearing all cash, and hauling more than fifty people off to jail.[^110] In those years, anarchists had increasingly and effectively taken part in popular struggles against austerity measures, evictions, and deportations. They had also gotten the government’s attention with animal liberation actions and campaigns against the MAT, a high-tension power line from France to Morocco connecting energy markets and extending the distribution of nuclear, coal, and green energy.

In the US, the use of antiterrorism against ecological struggles can be traced back to the ’90s, when the logging industry popularized the concept of ecoterrorism amidst the fight to save the redwoods. With massive resources, PR firms, and connections to the media, the logging industry tried to convince the public that those who broke laws and damaged inanimate property in defense of the Earth were terrorists and a threat to society.

Hollywood responded to the needs of industry with an enthusiastic entertainment/propaganda drive that undermines US society’s self-image of having a free media. Since the ’90s, over a hundred movies and TV shows have been cranked out to summon the specter of ecoterrorism, featuring bad guys who wanted to kill, cause mayhem, or destroy the entire human species for vague environmentalist motives. These works of industry propaganda span the spectrum from comedies to Michael Crichton thrillers, James Bond adventures to crime shows. On the contrary, very few movies and shows feature people suffering from environmental racism, and even fewer show people breaking the law as an act of conscience or necessary resistance. Protagonists in environmentally themed movies are nearly always white lawyers, journalists, or citizen activists like the protagonists of _Dark Waters_ and _Erin Brockovich._

Industry lobbying paid off. In 2002, shortly after the attacks of September 11, 2001, and in the midst of the new War on Terror, the US government declared radical environmentalists to be the number one domestic terrorism priority, at a time when lethal white supremacist attacks were already on the rise and groups like Earth First!, the Earth Liberation Front (ELF) and the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) were not even accused of having committed bodily harm.[^111]

In the Green Scare, the US government brought its full repressive weight against these movements. Jeff “Free” Luers and Craig Marshall were arrested in June 2000 for setting fire to three SUVs. Luers was given a 22-year prison sentence, later reduced to 10 years only thanks to a well-organized support campaign. As part of Operation Backfire, in December 2005, the FBI indicted 13 alleged members of the ELF for dozens of arson and sabotage attacks against the Vail Ski Resort, power lines, genetic engineering research facilities, luxury housing developments, and other targets. They were threatened with hundreds of years in prison. One detainee, William “Avalon” Rogers, committed suicide shortly after arrest. Most non-cooperating defendants ended up with prison sentences of six to seven years only because the FBI had to offer plea deals to avoid revealing what were probably illegal surveillance tactics should the cases go to trial.

In 2006, Eric McDavid and two others were arrested on conspiracy to bomb a dam as part of a plot that was funded, organized, and pushed ahead by a paid FBI informant who had become romantically involved with McDavid as part of her infiltration activities. Initially, McDavid was sentenced to 20 years in prison, but had his sentence reduced when the defense discovered that the FBI had withheld thousands of pages of evidence regarding the role of their informant. Also in 2006, six members of Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty, a group that coordinates aggressive boycott actions against Huntingdon Life Sciences, one of the largest animal testing companies in the world, were sentenced to three to six years in prison for sending large numbers of faxes to HLS or “internet stalking.” They were convicted under the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act, a law that allows the government to grant special punitive protections to companies that abuse and exploit animals.[^112] A year later police in the UK, Netherlands, and Belgium coordinated a series of raids and arrested 32 people connected to SHAC. When HLS was on the verge of bankruptcy because the pressure campaign had effectively driven off other companies from doing business with them, the UK government stepped in to help the company secure financing.[^113]

In 2009, Marius Mason was sentenced to 20 years in prison for an arson attack against a university lab involved in genetic engineering research funded by Monsanto, arson of logging trucks, and attacks against the construction of luxury homes. Like other Green Scare prisoners before him, Mason is being held in a Communications Management Unit, an opaque corner of the federal prison system that uses extreme isolation and a prohibition on communication with the outside world as a form of psychological torture. CMUs are used almost exclusively against prisoners of the War on Terror, anarchists, and radical environmentalists.

This policy of treating land defenders as terrorists has not ended. At the end of 2020, two people in Washington state were given federal terrorism charges for blocking a rail line as part of a campaign against the construction of new gas pipelines.[^114]

Corporate involvement in such repression also continues. It was recently revealed that agrochemical giant Monsanto runs an “intelligence fusion center” to compile information on and conduct disinformation and harassment campaigns against journalists and activists who threaten the company’s financial interests through their research or organizing. “Fusion center” is the same term the FBI uses for its counterterrorism centers. In just one example, Monsanto targeted a Reuters journalist investigating the carcinogenic effects of the company’s star product, glyphosate, or Roundup. Their campaign included coordinating “third parties” to post negative reviews of the book, hiring scientists to cast doubt on the book’s conclusions, pressuring the journalist’s editors at Reuters “very strongly every chance we get” in the hope “she gets reassigned,” covering up their financial relationship with scientists claiming their product was safe, accusing the journalist of being a “pro-organic capitalist” activist, as though there were big bucks to be made in opposing some of the world’s largest chemical companies, and contracting search engine optimization (SEO) experts to make sure that their alternative facts, their negative reviews, and their various slanders of said journalist would appear in search engines above results showing how Roundup causes cancer.[^115]

The above case illustrates how corporations can orchestrate subtle campaigns of censorship, often without revealing their hand. In 2020, an academic publisher abruptly canceled the publication of a book that showed how Canadian mining companies benefited from the genocide in Guatemala, moving in to stake their claims sometimes even before the death squads had left. The publishers expressed fears of lawsuits for defamation, though they refused to point out what part of the book, which received favorable peer reviews, might be considered defamation.[^116] And in Canada, the RCMP spied on the release event of a book against mining.[^117]

The new media environment is also particularly hostile for people trying to defend the land. Facebook is largely responsible for the rapid growth in the extreme Right around the world, encouraging racist conspiracy theories and climate denialism. Beyond the algorithms, when it comes time for administrators to block content, they rarely ban far-right groups, even after such groups carry out shootings and stabbings, but are very quick to block the anarchists and other antifascists who carry out the research and reporting necessary to protect our communities from neo-Nazis. When Facebook finally agreed to tamp down on misinformation related to climate change denial, they actually gave the boot to Indigenous and environmentalist pages that were fighting climate change.[^118]

Direct police interventions also make the internet an unequal terrain for movements fighting for liberation. Articles I used in my research, particularly two texts by Indigenous anarchist Tawinikay that I rely on extensively in Chapter 5]], became unavailable after Dutch police raided and seized computer servers for several anticapitalist news sites.[^119] For us, this is a common occurrence, almost completely erased from the mainstream, where right-wing pundits and transphobic authors, all of them millionaires with enormous platforms, control the debate around free speech and complain of being “canceled.”

Even progressive media lend their support to policing operations against environmental movements. In a typical article, the _Guardian_ accuses anarchists of trying to “hijack” a climate march, the classical maneuver of dividing the resistance into “good protesters” and “bad protesters.”[^120] What their _outside agitator_ caricature leaves out is that anarchists have been a part of the struggle to save the planet since way before the _Guardian_ began dedicating ink to hijacking the movement to favor institutional perspectives.

The state deals with migrants with the same apparatus it brings to bear against social movements. Intelligence gathering, surveillance, demonization and scapegoating in the media, imprisonment, torture, targeted killings, and not least of which, depoliticization. Just as those fighting for clean water, a healthy relationship with the land, or a livable planet for future generations are deemed extremists, people who go through the trauma of leaving their homes behind are denied all reason and presented as criminals.

The economies of the US, Canada, and the European Union depend on immigrant labor. As Harsha Walia documents, the purpose of the border regime is not to stop immigration but to control and terrorize it.[^121] When Germany decided in 2015 to take in over a million refugees from the Syrian civil war, it was only because the largest association of German employers had just declared that the national economy faced a shortfall of millions of skilled laborers.[^122] But at no point did the German government allow direct flights from Turkey or Lebanon, where so many of the refugees were warehoused. Instead, they obligated refugees to make the expensive and perilous journey over the Aegean Sea, through the Balkans, under and over razor wire fences, through police truncheons and tear gas, past violent, xenophobic crowds, so that finally they would arrive with almost nothing, willing to accept any labor conditions and bureaucratic controls. It was a journey that cost on average several thousand euros, on top of the steep psychological price, effectively ensuring that primarily only members of the university-educated middle class would be able to make it.

Migrants from Africa are made to cross the open sea on flimsy rafts, left in the water or even deliberately rammed by the coast guards of the various Mediterranean states: between 2014 and early 2020, over 20,000 have died in the crossing.[^123] Once across, hundreds of thousands of migrants are either held in detention centers—sometimes for years—or left to live in crowded shanty towns, often without access to running water, heating, toilets, or medical facilities and at the mercy of arson attacks by fascists often connected to the police and operating with impunity, from Spain to Greece.[^124]

In the US, the border regime has been designed to force migrants to cross in the most dangerous regions of the Sonoran Desert. Between 1998 and 2019, Border Patrol recovered the bodies of 7,800 migrants who died while crossing.[^125] Many more have died on the Mexican side of the border, or crossing through Guatemala and southern Mexico, where the Mexican government has increased enforcement in line with US demands. Border control, one of the branches of police with the strongest far Right sympathies, often brutalize and occasionally kill those who are crossing, as do rightwing militias. They also destroy caches of water left in the desert by volunteers trying to decrease the number of deaths. In detention, people are held in cells or cages with temperatures near freezing. People are left to die of medical neglect, or denied attention in the case of pregnancies, leading to frequent miscarriages; hundreds and possibly thousands have been involuntarily sterilized, leading some prisoners to compare the centers to “an experimental concentration camp.”[^126] Torture is systematic and “inherent” in the US immigrant detention system, according to a new report, and many are brutalized and forced to sign their own deportation papers, even though it means going back to a country where their lives are at risk.[^127]

Australia is another terrible case of institutionalized racism that reveal borders to be an active measure of ongoing colonialism. The country legalized the buying and selling of enslaved Aboriginal laborers into the 1970s, and had an immigration policy explicitly designed to only allow white immigrants, also lasting until the 1970s. In 2018, the government was forced to pass a new law outlawing slavery again after finally acknowledging the tens of thousands of Pacific Islanders working in the agricultural sector, getting paid only $10 a week after deductions by their employers.[^128] Determined to keep out “unskilled” immigrants from nonwhite countries, the Australian government obliges its poorer neighbors like Papua New Guinea to imprison asylum seekers indefinitely in facilities that have been compared to concentration camps.[^129]

Meanwhile, solidarity with migrants is being increasingly criminalized. While humanitarian aid constitutes one of the mechanisms by which migrants are surveilled, controlled, and maintained in abject precarity and poverty, direct action and solidarity has helped migrants win housing and gain resources on their own terms, or pass clandestinely through strict border regimes. In Europe, people are increasingly being legally required to report on undocumented people and prohibited from giving them food or water; squats and autonomous spaces created for and by migrants are targeted for eviction; autonomous transportation infrastructure that provides mobility to undocumented people is criminalized and shut down; and those aiding migrants have been charged with trafficking, which carries a sentence of up to ten years imprisonment. Ironically, European governments and their private partners, who cynically paint migrants and border activists as traffickers, have funneled millions of euros to the Libyan militias that actually control both the imprisonment and the trafficking of refugees at a key point on the southern Mediterranean coast.[^130] In the US, people can be imprisoned for years for giving migrants a map or giving them a ride to the hospital, and Border Patrol has increasingly been raiding a first aid camp set up by volunteer group No More Deaths. Migrants who speak out about abuses frequently get targeted with speedy deportations.

In July 2019, as the Trump administration was gearing up to carry out major raids targeting undocumented people across the country, anarchist Willem Van Spronsen set fire to an ICE vehicle at the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, Washington. His action and other widespread acts of resistance succeeded in getting ICE to dramatically scale back the raids, but it came with a heavy price. Police discovered him in the parking lot lighting the fire, and they took advantage of the situation and executed him on the spot, similar to how federal marshals would execute Michael Reinoehl in September, 2020 in retaliation to Reinoehl killing a white supremacist who was threatening Black counterprotestors at a rally in Portland several days earlier.[^131]

Though the border regime is designed to brutalize racialized people and uphold the privileges of whiteness, these killings show that whiteness is less a question of skin color and more a question of alliances. Those who fight against the alliances represented by white supremacy and colonialism may face the very apparatus of annihilation designed to control racialized people.

Another major target of repression in the Global North are Indigenous communities, especially those resisting the profitable processes of ecocide that the reservation system was designed to enable. When Water Protectors tried to prevent the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline transporting shale oil through Lakota territory, local, state, and federal police mobilized a huge militarized force complemented by the private security firm TigerSwan, complete with helicopters, drones, tanks, infiltration, and surveillance, constituting “the largest mobilization of cops and military in the state’s history since 1890, when … the military was deployed to crush the horseless and starving Ghost Dancers at Standing Rock.”[^132] TigerSwan agents, coming out of counterinsurgency operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, called Indigenous Water Protectors “terrorists” engaging in a “jihadist insurgency.”[^133] Private and public police forces carried out brutal raids, beat, shot, and gassed Water Protectors, and soaked them with powerful water cannons in subzero temperatures miles from any facility where they might receive adequate care for hypothermia. They used attack dogs, rubber bullets, concussion grenades, tear gas, and sound cannons. No one was killed in any of the multiple acts of police repression only thanks to good luck and wellorganized medical support. However, a Native woman lost her sight after being shot in the face with a tear gas grenade at close range and a solidarity protester had her arm partially blown off by a concussion grenade.[^134] Many others received traumatic head wounds from police projectiles. In one single attack on November 20, 2016, two hundred people were injured.[^135] Multiple people were imprisoned with the aid of police infiltrators. Throughout the resistance, over eight hundred and thirty people were arrested and given state charges, while five people—all of them Indigenous—were given federal charges. One Indigenous and Chicano protester, Steve Martínez, is locked up at the time of this writing for refusing to testify before a grand jury.[^136] He could be kept in jail for up to 18 months to force him to give information against other people in the movement.

It has been pointed out time and again that when far Right groups carry out armed occupations, even when they shoot and murder political opponents in the course of white riots, the police stand back and let it happen. Often, they participate directly. Subsequently, prosecutors are always more lax in bringing charges. This is not, however, a plea for fairness from the judicial system, or for more arrests of fascists. Rather, it is evidence that the fascists in the street, extractivist profiteers in corporate board rooms, and the criminal justice system are all facets of a white supremacist, colonial system that is destroying the planet.

Because repression transcends formal exercises of state power, we should also consider the connection between pipeline construction, shale oil extraction, and Man Camps, the itinerant labor camps of often highly paid, mostly white male workers associated with increasing rates of drug and alcohol usage and violence against Indigenous women and Two Spirit people. Going back to mining incursions in the Black Hills gold rush at the end of the nineteenth century or the US Army Corps of Engineers damming rivers in Lakota territory in the middle of the twentieth, settler profiteering has always been connected to violence against Indigenous communities, whether or not the perpetrators wear a uniform.

What happened at Standing Rock is not exceptional. It is fully in line with the US government’s repressive practices against Indigenous resistance. In the early ’70s, the American Indian Movement aided traditionals on the Pine Ridge Oglala Lakota reservation, not far from Standing Rock, to regain their sovereignty and expose the corrupt tribal government that was closely connected to Washington and to regional business interests, for example turning reservation grazing lands over to white ranchers. The BIA and FBI helped the tribal government stay in power, in part by financing a heavily armed paramilitary force. In the years that culminated in the 1973 Wounded Knee stand-off, FBI agents, police, paramilitaries, and unknown assailants killed over 60 Oglala traditionals, AIM members, and sympathizers.[^137] Long-term prisoner Leonard Peltier is still locked up as a result of that repression.[^138]

In Canada, progressive prime minister Justin Trudeau came into office on pledges of taking climate action and improving relations with the dozens of Indigenous nations whose stolen lands the Canadian state is built on. In fact, Trudeau took advantage of his conservative predecessor having left the Kyoto accords to go all in for the exploitation of the Athabasca tar sands, a huge deposit of extremely dirty oil that takes an enormous amount of energy to extract and process, leaving an immense expanse of the Canadian interior denuded of all forests and topsoil in the process. To capitalize on the oil boom, Trudeau’s government sank billions of dollars into new pipeline construction despite fierce Indigenous resistance across the continent. When the Wet’sewet’en nation effectively blocked the construction of the Coastal GasLink pipeline on their own lands, the RCMP, Canada’s federal police created initially as a paramilitary force against First Nations, carried out several militarized raids on Wet’sewet’en encampments and were given permission to shoot to kill. In their raids, the RCMP used boats, helicopters, drones, and intensive physical and social media surveillance of land defenders, in addition to large numbers of agents with armored vehicles and military grade weaponry. They also considered the use of social services to take custody of any children arrested, fully in line with Canada’s long and violent history of using so-called residential schools targeting Indigenous children as a tool for genocide.[^139] Canada’s 2015 Anti-Terrorism Act “sanctions the criminalization of Indigenous environmentalists by enhancing surveillance and legal powers against any potential interference with Canada’s ‘critical infrastructure’ or ‘territorial integrity’” while RCMP surveillance documents identify land defenders as “aboriginal extremists.”[^140]

Again, recent Canadian history shows this is far from exceptional. In 1995, twenty First Nations recovered a part of the unceded Secwepemc territory at Ts’Peten, an important Sun Dance site. In response, the Canadian government sent in 400 police and military with helicopters and armored personnel carriers who fired 77,000 rounds at the warriors.[^141] These are just a few examples. It would take more than a single book to document all the incidents of police and military repression against Indigenous peoples in Australia, Canada, the United States, and other settler states.

Powerful governments not aligned with NATO are no better when it comes to repression. In Russia, anarchists met with some successes protecting the Khimki Forest from highway construction in 2010. In response, police arrested anyone they could find associated with the protests and looked the other way as armed thugs attacked encampments set up in the forest to halt logging. As repression mounted, dozens of anarchists and antifascists fled the country, seeking asylum in Europe. The government turned towards preemptive repression. In 2017 and 2018, in advance of contested elections and the FIFA World Cup, nine anarchists were arrested in the “Network” case and sentenced to between six and eighteen years in prison. They were tortured into signing confessions, including being hung upside down and beaten, or being shocked with electric currents until their teeth broke.[^142] Western media that usually enjoy publicizing Russian human rights abuses were largely silent on the case.

China has been the site of a growing number of “mass incidents” or riots, many of them against development projects, pollution, unsafe working conditions, and corruption between Party bosses and the new industrialists. A staggering 65 percent of the 180,000 annual “mass incidents” are rural conflicts triggered by land grabs, with government officials and private developers forcibly requisitioning village lands, sometimes without even offering compensation.[^143]

Communication between these different sites of resistance has become increasingly difficult over the last ten years as the Chinese government consolidates its control over the internet. Signs of the underlying tension still boil over despite the censorship, as when a dispossessed villager killed four with a homemade bomb at a government office near Guangzhou this past March, amidst a conflict with farmers being dispossessed with little or no compensation for a major development project.[^144]

The changing balance of power also means the overturning of earlier environmental victories, such as the defeat of a planned hydroelectric dam on the Yangtze River at Tiger Leaping Gorge. The dam, which would have displaced 100,000 people, was halted by locals in 2006, but now the government is resurrecting plans for the dam, reflecting a new balance of power, as well as the opportunities that “green energy” and “carbon neutral” policies afford governments for neutralizing environmental movements.[^145] In another example of the same dynamic, three conservationists in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region were arrested and accused of extortion, making threats and “provoking trouble” in September 2020 after filing whistleblower complaints regarding pollution from a paper mill and destruction of protected gazelle habitat for the construction of wind farms.[^146]

Both China and Cuba helped the US arrest Green Scare fugitives who were on the run. Furthermore, Chinese companies are fully invested in the fossil fuel industry and the destruction of Indigenous lands across the world, from tar sands extraction in Alberta to iron mining at sacred sites in Australia.

Green Scare prisoner Joseph Dibee, currently awaiting trial, wrote:

The cataclysm that is unfolding today can be laid at the doorstep of the law enforcement agencies that have paved the way for it by making it so difficult for ordinary people to defend themselves against ecological devastation. If we don’t stop them, they will frogmarch us directly into the apocalypse, profiting all the way—and when the last well is poisoned and the last forest burns up, they will be the last to die.[^147]

A focus on law enforcement and repression more broadly enables us to understand the ecological crisis in a new light. We don’t need the rich and powerful to save us from the destruction of the planet. In fact, we are the ones who are saving the planet every day. What we really need is for them to get the hell out of the way. But they won’t do that, in fact they will systematically silence, marginalize, imprison, brutalize, torture, and kill those who are most affected by the ecological crisis, those who have the most collective experience and the best ideas for how to save the planet.

In this light, there is little difference between a coal mine and a wind farm or a hydroelectric dam. The affinity of green capitalism for the very same death squads, torture techniques, antiterrorism operations, and smear campaigns should belie the pretensions that so-called renewable energy or sustainable commerce is an improvement. The involuntary, authoritarian character of fossil fuel capitalism and green capitalism is impossible to ignore, once you start looking.

In December 2011, global private security firm Stratfor was hacked. Stratfor maintains high level relations with intelligence, political, and military officials from the US to Israel and provides consulting and intelligence services to private companies and governments around the world to aid in public relations, counterinsurgency, disruption, and regime change efforts. They have described themselves as a “shadow CIA.”[^148] The resulting data dumps revealed widespread surveillance and illegal actions by government and private entities. We only have access to this information thanks to the hack carried out by Anonymous. The anarchist hacker Jeremy Hammond was sentenced to ten years in prison for the action. Similarly, we only know about the FBI’s bloody COINTELPRO program—which resulted in the aforementioned lethal campaign against AIM as well as the assassination of Fred Hampton and several other Black Panthers—because a group of revolutionaries broke into an FBI field office and stole the documents. In other words, the only way we ever know what our governments are actually doing is thanks to illegal direct action, leaving any discussion of government accountability rather hollow.

In the Statfor leaks, we learned how governments view social movements, and how they try to neutralize us. What is important to emphasize is that Stratfor, like governments all over the world, use the lens of counterinsurgency when dealing with the dissent of their subjects. With one exception, they do not make a distinction between the middle-class high school student going on strike on Fridays to raise awareness about climate change, the journalist researching the cancerous effects of widely used pesticides, the anarchist setting fire to construction equipment to save a forest from being bulldozed, and a Native elder leading a ceremony in an encampment seeking to regain treaty lands from a settler state. They view all these people as enemies. The only distinction they make is how to turn different kinds of dissidents against one another in order to buy out some and marginalize the rest. Remember that at the heart of counterinsurgency is the belief that all of a government’s subjects are potential enemies.

According to a framework used by Stratfor and other security consultants, there are four types of dissidents and a three-step method to neutralizing them. There are the radicals, who “want to change the system; have underlying socio/political motives; and see multinational corporations as ‘inherently evil.’”[^149]

These organizations do not trust the … federal, state and local governments to protect them and to safeguard the environment. They believe, rather, that individuals and local groups should have direct power over industry … I would categorize their principal aims … as social justice and political empowerment.[^150]

There are the idealists who “want a perfect world” but because of their “intrinsic altruism” can be made to sympathize with the interests of industry and shy away from conflictive positions, there are opportunists who will seize “the opportunity to side with the powerful for career gain” and there are the realists who are “willing to work within the system” and are “pragmatic. The realists should always receive the highest priority in any strategy dealing with a public policy issue.”

The three steps are rather simple:

First, isolate the radicals. Second, “cultivate” the idealists and “educate” them into becoming realists. And finally, co-opt the realists into agreeing with industry. “If your industry can successfully bring about these relationships, the credibility of the radicals will be lost and opportunists can be counted on to share in the final policy solution.”[^151]

It is more than a little ironic that those who consider themselves realists are considered the easiest to manipulate.

This is why it is neither sectarianism nor an excess of zeal when we declare that NGOs and humanitarian activists are part of the state’s counterinsurgency campaign. We can see this when we look back at resistance to the oil industry in Nigeria. When Ken Saro-Wiwa was led up to a scaffold and executed, his death was counted. He was a poet and a nonviolent protest leader, after all.

But what happened to his peers who learned the lesson, who valued their own lives, who took up arms or gave shelter to those who did, and _who actually hurt the profits and cut off the production of the oil industry_? When they were murdered by British or US munitions fired from helicopters dispatched by the Nigerian government or Shell Oil, those very well-meaning NGOs did not include them in their list of murdered land defenders. Their lives are neither counted nor valued.

The road to hell is paved with good intentions. To those with blood on their hands, counterinsurgency revolves around separating the resistance into good actors and bad actors, negotiating with or buying off the good actors so that the bad actors can be isolated, imprisoned, or massacred. Not so many people would trust Stratfor, Shell Oil, or the US military’s Africa Command telling us that Ijaw and Ogoni people fighting for their homelands are evil terrorists who deserve to be shot down. It is the very NGOs who evince a concern for human rights that are crucial to this counterinsurgency operation, celebrating the activists who use tactics deemed legitimate by the government. By not celebrating every bit as vociferously the lives and the resistance of those who make the hard choice to resist with illegal and revolutionary methods, these NGOs are signaling who is legitimate and who is subhuman, they are creating the division between good actors and bad actors that the militaries, death squads, and counterinsurgency experts rely on, and they are doing so in a way that most people who think they care about the environment or human rights will find credible. Likewise, they are signaling to the rest of society what kinds of tactics (legal, peaceful, less effective) will be honored, and what kinds of tactics (illegal, transformative) are associated with dangerous, frightening elements who seem to inevitably—in the moral arc of capitalism’s universe—end up in unmarked graves.

These NGOs also reject the learning process that happens in communities that, through direct experience, turn from methods that revolve around petitioning, protest, and lawsuit, to methods that revolve around occupation, sabotage, and directly creating the changes they need. As long as social movements have memory, they have access to a vast store of collective intelligence, and this intelligence favors self-defense and direct action because such methods are more effective.[^152] By rejecting such methods, the NGOs place themselves above the communities in struggle, claiming to know best how to achieve change. This is nothing other than a continuation of colonial dynamics.

In order to outmaneuver these counterinsurgency strategies, we need to start by becoming aware of them. There can be no effective struggle for healthy lives on a healthy planet unless we are aware of the systematic repression leveled against those who seek this most basic goal, and stand in solidarity with those who are most affected. Because when we support one another and fight back, we can win.


The Solutions Are Already Here




WE HAVE STOPPED PIPELINES, AIRPORTS, HIGHWAYS, AND MINES: THE VICTORIES THAT ADD UP

FOOD SOVEREIGNTY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALING: FINDING OUR PLACE IN A DAMAGED ECOLOGY

FIGHTING WHERE WE LIVE: FROM CITIES TO HABITATS

The urban-rural divide is a central dynamic of capitalist accumulation and the ecological crisis. There is a differentiated regime of extraction, accumulation, and social control between rural and urban space. Just as rural struggles are rediscovering their potential for blockades and sabotage, urban struggles are learning that they are not limited to protesting and destroying; they can also transform. In order to reclaim cities as habitats, ecological struggles in cities merit special attention.

As a first step, that means keeping cities from killing us. For poor people, urban life is often a death sentence, even as medical infrastructure under capitalism is concentrated in cities.

In the 1970s, New York City officials and business interests began planning to build a trash incinerator at the Brooklyn Navy Yards. The incinerator would have plagued local neighborhoods like Williamsburg with dioxin and other lethal forms of pollution, but Puerto Rican and Hasidic neighbors fought back using a “by any means necessary” approach, taking on the city government, the utility company, and major media that all supported the plan. They definitively blocked the incinerator in 1995.[^42]

What should not be elided is that subsequent to this neighborhood victory, Williamsburg and much of the rest of Brooklyn have been aggressively gentrified, with property values going through the roof, and many working-class residents and people of color pushed out in favor of disproportionately white young professionals. In other words, many of those who fought for a cleaner neighborhood were not allowed to stay around to reap the benefits. This kind of story is systematically typical, and a reminder of why the supposedly pragmatic position of partial reform is hopelessly naïve. As long as capitalism remains intact, whatever gains we happen to win by pressuring existing institutions will be enjoyed by economically privileged strata and those who are best able to assimilate to the racist codes and culture of a colonial society.

Another struggle that links environmental concerns with the economic needs of poor urban residents is the defense of public transportation. These can include Critical Mass bicycle protests from San Francisco to São Paulo that oppose car culture and in many cities have led to the creation of bicycle lanes and increased access for poor residents to bicycles and bicycle repair. More than a lifestyle question, cities designed for cars are lethal, especially for residents in denser neighborhoods. Cities that are organized in such a way that workers have to rely on automobiles are simply increasing indebtedness and funneling wages to corporations in two of the wealthiest sectors in the Global North: the automobile and petroleum industries.

The defense of public transportation has also sparked full blown revolts. In Barcelona and the San Francisco Bay Area, mass refusal to pay or public actions to neutralize ticket checkers and open up metro stations for free, whether organized by neighborhood assemblies or anarchist organizations, and sometimes in tandem with labor strikes by transport workers, have temporarily reduced financial strains faced by working class commuters and also generated tremendous pressure on municipal governments against further fare hikes.

In both Brazil and Chile, major insurrections grew out of movements that initially formed in response to fare hikes. Both the 2013 movement in Brazil and the 2019–2021 uprising in Chile counted on a decisive anarchist participation, defeated the proposed fare hikes, and were able to identify a much broader social horizon, expanding to address deeper issues of injustice including police repression, inequality and austerity, and the right to the city.[^43]

Urban movements often feel doomed to failure: those who live in a city rarely have any chance to resist changes to their own neighborhoods that are imposed from above. In part, that is because throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, cities have represented the concentration of capital accumulated on a global scale. Legally, houses and other buildings are not places for people to live or carry out their professional activities; they are essentially bank accounts where major interests can safely park the trillions of dollars they have made through currency speculation, private equity marauding, the underpaying of workers, the overcharging of tenants, and the stripping of complex ecosystems to sell for parts. It does not matter who lives there and what they need, or even if these buildings are left empty for decades.

So when we fight for our right to the city, we are going up against capitalism at the point where it is strongest. Furthermore, police departments in major cities today tend to be larger, better financed, and more heavily armed than national armies were a century or two ago. The fact that decentralized urban movements can rise up and force the state to back down (Soweto 1986, Hamburg 1987, Cochabamba 2000, El Alto 2003, Paris 2005 and 2006, Oaxaca City 2006, Athens 2008, Oakland 2009, Tunis and Cairo 2011, Istanbul 2013, São Paulo 2013, Barcelona 2014, Santiago 2019, Minneapolis 2020, Lagos 2020 …) is extremely significant, and should be a central consideration in any strategy for social change today. However, urban rebellions are frequently excluded from the official conversation. Sadly, cynically, this is a reflection of the disorder and sacrifice they entail—inimical to the culture and class interests of the experts who control the conversation—and a reflection of the difficulties around controlling these movements. Urban rebellions tend to move from single flashpoint issues to ever broader and more revolutionary horizons. Would-be politicians cannot control these movements while they remain active; on the contrary, their main form of influence is a partial ability to demobilize in exchange for short-term reformist gains or, failing that, to encourage internal conflicts in the movements.

By focusing on technological or administrative solutions rather than the decentralized and often combative responses social movements themselves keep offering up, most academics and writers from the Global North fail to tailor their technocratic proposals to the immediate need for survival, dignity, and direct control by people and communities over our own lives. Social justice and decolonization have become buzz words, but most of the people today who are getting paid to make proposals or write about the problem evince a practice that is deeply colonial. Fortunately, we don’t need them. Proposals for dignity, survival, and self-organization are popping up like mushrooms after the rain, originating in affected communities themselves.

Cecosesola is a network of cooperatives in Venezuela that took questions of survival and dignity as their point of departure. Cecosesola is currently made up of 50 communitarian organizations located in seven states in the center and west of the country. It began in 1967 as an initiative for cooperative funeral homes. At a moment of familial tragedy that also often implied financial hardship, working class families were being fleeced by private, for-profit funeral homes. The new cooperatives were intended to fulfill this need with dignity and respect, while also lowering costs so as to be affordable.

Following this desire to meet popular needs through cooperative structures, Cecosesola branched out in the mid-70s to provide public transportation. It was a period of massive mobilizations against transport fare hikes, so the network pooled its resources and they acquired a fleet of buses, soon providing the majority of the transportation in the city of Barquisimeto. The experience continued until 1980, when the government seized and destroyed their buses.

Cecosesola also confronted a slow but steady drift into bureaucratization, the same tendency that has turned most other cooperative ventures into little more than alternative businesses. I corresponded with a few members of Cecosesola and they told me how they completely changed their organizational practices to prevent bureaucratization, to remove the positions of supervisors and boards of directors from their legal statutes, and to continue meeting lower class needs in a worsening economic situation, while also expanding their scope to take on ecological considerations. Cecosesola is an important survival mechanism for hundreds of thousands of people amidst Venezuela’s major economic crisis. Their cooperative markets are the principal source of food and supplies for some 100,000 families, they link farmers with urban residents, build up communitarian production of pasta, coffee, cleaning supplies, and other goods, help finance harvests or the purchase of vehicles, and provide healthcare to 230,000 people a year. Throughout our conversation, the members I spoke with gave the most attention to questions of process and relationship-building, a clear difference from the dominant institutions’ focus on quantitative results.

Food insecurity is also a problem in the Global North, especially in racialized neighborhoods. Cooperation Jackson, in Jackson, Mississippi, arose in 2014 from the experiences of the Black liberation movement and mutual aid efforts in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. The organization establishes cooperatives to build a circular economy with an emphasis on gaining access to land within the impoverished, majority Black city, growing healthy food that can be prepared and distributed by other cooperatives, and collecting waste and producing compost and fertilizer by yet other cooperatives in a “reinforcing value chain” that expands to cover a growing body of vital needs. They also set up a manufacturing cooperative to “promote the arts and science of digital fabrication” and fulfill the goal of “owning and controlling the means of production.”[^44] This project, in turn, is part of the plan for building the Ewing Street Eco-Village, a permaculture-based communal housing project for cooperative participants, and a springboard for yet more cooperative enterprises.

Cooperation Jackson follows a strategic plan that seeks to “[build] autonomous power outside the state structure” while also “engaging in electoral politics on a limited scale” largely as a means to protect themselves from “the power of the state,” which, “as we learned through our own struggles,” can present a grave “peril” to movements.[^45] Their solidarity economy of worker cooperatives and “informal affinity-based neighbourhood bartering networks” is “grounded on the principles of social solidarity, mutual aid, reciprocity and generosity.”[^46] Following an ideal of ecosocialism, Cooperation Jackson prioritizes survival in its many dimensions, from gaining employment and economic self-sufficiency for members, increasing access to healthy food, reducing dependence on hydrocarbons, and transforming their neighborhoods to improve the quality of the air and water. In these efforts they have received support from local trade unions and progressive churches.

Cooperation Jackson has achieved considerable successes in a politically and economically hostile environment. Member Kali Akuno identifies two prime challenges or setbacks their model has faced, which parallel the experiences of related initiatives from the Mondragón cooperative complex of the Basque country to Plan Pueblo a Pueblo which we looked at in an earlier section. The first is the tendency of cooperatives to focus on profit margins and reintegrate with capitalist economies. Following this trend (which in a matter of decades has made the Mondragón complex indistinguishable from the rest of the capitalist landscape), one of the original Cooperation Jackson cooperatives broke away from the group, as they were not “prepared to make the required sacrifices necessary to promote ecosocialism through the development of a non-exploitative and regenerative system at the community level.” The second is all the work that remains to be done “getting people to understand the severity of the crisis _and_ our collective ability to do something about it.”[^47]

This in turn relates to the difficulty of convincing the government “to implement the policy proposals” that are needed, that will only materialize, Akuno argues, if “consciously driven by the people.”[^48] An ally and veteran of the movement for racial justice, Chokwe Lumumba, won the mayoral elections for the city of Jackson in 2013, and it seemed the grassroots would receive official support for their projects and urban transformation plans. But Lumumba died prematurely after just a few months in office and subsequent politicians have not been supportive. This turn of events underscores the importance of Cooperation Jackson’s emphasis on building autonomous power and not waiting on electoral cycles.

Given the statist differentiation between city and countryside, control over food and artificial scarcity have been frequent methods for controlling urban populations. As the counterpoint, urban gardening is often a way for people to assert neighborhood control in the face of real estate developers and racist urban planning experts, to improve quality of life, and increase community bonds.

In North Lawndale, Chicago, there are some 20 garden spaces. Many, like the MLK garden on 16th Street, have a long history of significance in local antiracist movements. These gardens, which often start with neighbors directly taking over plots, organize skillshares, hold community events, improve air quality, and distribute food throughout a neighborhood that experiences real food scarcity. Several gardens donate medicinal herbs to a historic Black pharmacy and support formerly incarcerated people. In Lawndale, Little Village, and other neighborhoods, the urban gardens are connected to a network of associations arising from Black, Puerto Rican, Indigenous, and migrant communities. One such organization, Reclaiming Our Roots, “is an initiative of Southwest Chicago that reclaims public spaces for healing and gathering using indigenous knowledge. Reclaiming Our Roots creates opportunities for youth to engage with a community garden while connecting and caring for the land.”[^49]

The “Special Period,” in which Cuba faced sudden food shortages when they lost access to petroleum due to the collapse of the Soviet Union and a US embargo, shows how quickly urban populations can transition in order to feed themselves, in this case through the explosion of urban and suburban gardens that ordinary people planted and tended to using hand tools and small-scale techniques. Although the Cuban state encouraged the phenomenon, it was decentralized in nature, and some who lived through that moment tell me the main thing the government did was to get out of the way and allow communities to self-organize. Indeed, there is little evidence to suggest a government would even be capable of organizing such a profound transformation in such a short time frame.

Urban reforestation is also an important line of action to consider. Whereas government-led programs tends to focus on ornamental species and to actively avoid creating a free commons of edibles, neighborhood-initiated efforts can carry out planting in a way that simultaneously removes carbon, decreases pollution and urban warming, autonomously provides food security, and turns cities into habitats that can be healthy for humans and other species.

_Small City Forest Gardens, Somewhere in the US_

I spoke with one person involved in anticapitalist initiatives in the United States, including an informal effort that has resulted in the planting of over 10,000 fruit-bearing, native trees and shrubs in a couple of neighboring small cities. Because their circles have been targeted multiple times by police and FBI for their anticapitalist and ecological politics, they have wished to use a pseudonym and keep their location anonymous.

Victor explained how they take advantage of a government subsidized program meant to help commercial farmers, using it to buy native, fruit-bearing trees in bulk and distribute them in different communities:

It’s worth noting that the entire agricultural industry is structured around state subsidies. What the USDA [US Department of Agriculture] funds or guarantees thrives, most else withers. The state decides, among growers, which farms are made to live and which are left to die, and this apparatus and resource monopoly is something that we have to slowly break while also extracting resources from it.

This is why it is so decisive that Black farmers have been historically excluded from USDA loan programs. In bad crop years, they have to pay the real cost of their wages, while white farmers stay insulated, and thus Black farmers have lost a huge portion of the land they held 100 years ago. So it’s important that the USDA recognizes “five agroforestry practices.” These are magic words and mean that these practices open the sluice gates for cash and subsidies, in the same way that other recognized farming practices do. So farmers get paid to plant in windbreaks, and they get the trees cheap too. They mostly go for big hardwoods that they plant as investments for logging, but it creates a leverage point for us to pull resources out of this system and create our own reservoirs for cooperative growing and future plant breeding and distribution.

Our species list includes pawpaw, American plum, hazelnut, American persimmon, elderberry, aronia, and chokecherry. These are all made available via subsidies but are rarely intended to be planted with enough density for human food or medicinal production and instead are commonly planted to meet one of the other 5 recognized agroforestry practices such as riparian plantings. We also order hardy berries like currants and gooseberries in bulk from commercial suppliers, and select trees like serviceberry from friendly nurseries. We solicit donations from these friendly nurseries as well—which is a way that people who have already made the move back-to-the-land can express an organized complicity—and this year we’ve received mulberry, blueberry, blackberry, hardy fig, and chestnut as donations.

We have slowly spread out and included more neighborhoods in town as they’ve requested participation, but we organize it each year within core neighborhoods that we do other autonomous organizing in. I think that the project has been successful in producing collective spirit in certain neighborhoods and not others. We give people the choice to take trees to plant on their own or to receive help, or to use trees to plan neighborhood plantings. All of the neighborhoods have held at least one of these collective plantings. Two of the neighborhoods did seem to really draw inspiration from planting in trees together. One is a neighborhood with housing projects and the other is a neighborhood of mostly Latin American immigrants who are used to growing their own food and mixing residential and agricultural spaces.

As we’ve spread the plantings to more neighborhoods, we’ve also been confronted with class differences—and even relatively minor difference in income—between areas. These have posed problems in terms of resource distribution that can’t always be easily solved from an autonomous perspective, especially regarding trees which are in short supply or most apt for particular places.

So far, mostly only the berry bushes have produced fruit, but once the fruit trees mature it will be a game changer in terms of creating a commons and many working class people will have free access to a huge amount of fresh fruit and nuts. One of the challenges we face is redeveloping familiarity with some of the native plants that were never appropriated by the colonizers for commercial food production. Some of these non-commercial fruit are delicious raw, like pawpaw, but cannot be sold because they are too fragile to ship to stores, and thus perfect for neighborhood consumption. Others, however, are best enjoyed with processing, like the so-called chokecherry. First Nations peoples have many ways to process fruits like these, and so we have researched and discussed the appropriate ways to draw on these methods.

Such an initiative can “scale up” by filling out, with just a few active people in any region or small city adopting the model. Spread throughout an entire country, this practice can plant an atmospherically significant number of trees. Unlike with state-led initiatives, there is a solid guarantee that the trees will be taken care of and will actually survive to maturity, accelerating processes of community building and commoning that will be necessary for lower class people to confront the ecological crisis with resilience. It improves quality of life for lower class people and creates stronger relationships to place that can serve as an effective pole for resistance against the notion of private property wielded by real estate developers and speculators, enabling a huge part of the map—small cities or less dense large cities—to play a significant role in carbon removal. This is a preemptive mutiny against the imminent plans of the technocrats to turn a huge chunk of rural space into sacrifice zones for carbon removals so that life in the cities can continue with minimal transformation.

Grassroots, autonomous efforts to vitalize the urban habitat can also be a source of powerful resistance against municipal attempts to restructure a neighborhood in the interests of capitalist profit and top-down urban planning.

Vallcarca is a peripheral neighborhood in Barcelona, formerly an independent village, that has become the site of a particularly complex resistance bringing together _assemblees llibertàries_ (anarchist assemblies), neighborhood entities, and self-organized communal spaces. In 2002, city planners slated Vallcarca as a sacrifice zone for a motorway expansion that was to destroy the entire old town center. Speculators bought up, emptied out, and demolished properties throughout the center of the neighborhood. Anarchists and others began squatting many of these properties to prevent their demolition, while neighborhood associations protested the devastation. More recently, neighbors of all kinds have come together to occupy the vacant lots left behind by the demolitions and plant urban gardens filled with vegetable plots, activity spaces for important traditions like _petanca_ and _calçotades_, and hundreds of fruit and nut trees. The network of gardens brings neighbors together and encourages many more people to participate in the defense of the neighborhood, as well as providing a space for cultural events, socialization, and play; taking a first step towards food autonomy; and improving the quality of the neighborhood in terms of health, carbon footprint, beauty, and enjoyment, for the benefit of the lower class people who live there rather than for the higher income demographics the real estate speculators will attempt to bring in.

With weekly blockades shutting down traffic, occupations of evicted and demolished spaces, the unmediated creation of plazas and gardens, and other forms of protest and direct action, the neighbors forced a change to the official urban planning document for the neighborhood in 2018,[^50] and far more importantly, they created real changes on the ground and took important steps towards recovering the power to make decisions and organize their own lives.

In the nearby neighborhood of La Salut, a group of neighbors have taken over a vacant lot to create a garden with a global focus. The garden itself is organized in large part by people who have had to traverse continents and cross borders fleeing the effects of a mercenary capitalism, giving birth to one initiative within the garden space, La Enredadera, a _semillero diaspórico_ or nursery garden for people of the diaspora. In the words of one participant:

Many of the people who have migrated to Barcelona have been displaced by climatic and agricultural pressures, direct and indirect, although only loosely categorized. Under a wider ecosystemic lens, our migration can be considered as an adaptive climate strategy, of survival and resistance, with benefits for our territories of origin as well our territories of arrival. …

The climate migrant leaves behind profound relations to their territory and generally passes through a painful mourning while struggling to start again from scratch, but they also hold onto to valuable knowledge about modes of life in transition, resilience, and adaptability.

In sum, La Enredadera responds to the question, “how do we root the concept of global climate justice at the local scale?” using “the tools of documentary films, cultural geography, and agroecological design” in collaboration with the rest of the garden project.

Though from the beginning, the gardeners took a more conciliatory approach towards the city government, emphasizing dialogue, in the end the progressive administration evicted them from their original plot without availing a second location they had promised. In order to acquire a second home and continue their project, the group had to occupy a high value developing property to force the government to honor their promises. It might be noted that this was a left-wing administration happy to take photo ops to file away in their resume under the headings of “multiculturalism” or “green urbanism.”

La Enredadera makes clear the connections between migration, colonialism, the ecological crisis, and urban resistance and occupation. As migration and ecological crisis become increasingly enmeshed, initiatives focusing on winning housing for and by undocumented people also deserve a central focus. Once again, this is a field in which anticapitalist movements using direct action lead the way.

Throughout Catalunya, there are numerous initiatives by undocumented people and their accomplices to squat abandoned warehouses to provide housing for large groups. Numerous squatted social centers linked to the anarchist movement also house migrants. And there are several initiatives for self-employment by undocumented people, from making and selling handicraft bags to cooking for events, that form a part of anticapitalist networks and movements.

Such initiatives take on a greater scale in Gran Canaria, an island in the West African archipelago occupied by Spain, and with the highest rates of poverty in the whole Spanish state. The Canary Islands are also one of the main points of entry into the European Union for African migrants. The Anarchist Federation of Gran Canaria (FAGC) has occupied several housing blocks and set up entire autonomous neighborhoods, organizing for basic survival among lower class people, both documented and undocumented. Working with the offshoot organization, the Sindicato de Inquilinos (Tenants’ Union of Gran Canaria), they stop hundreds of evictions every year, and they have occupied numerous properties to provide “socialized” housing, meaning free and self-organized, liberated from both exploitation by landlords and humiliation by government bureaucrats. At the time of this writing, a thousand people live in housing socialized by these two organizations, and thousands more retain access to capitalist housing thanks to the blocked evictions. Some of these socialized housing units are collective or communal, from a squatted hotel to “La Esperanza,” a self-organized community with 76 families, more than 200 people. Two other projects, “Las Masías” and “El Refugio II,” provide housing to around 100 and 150 migrants, respectively, who face legal persecution, while “El Nido,” a squatted school, serves as a shelter for women fleeing domestic violence. The FAGC has also squatted four large agricultural plots for autonomous food production on the island, and they provide a consultation service for workers facing labor conflicts. Most of those who use this service are informal workers, including sex workers who have experienced sexist and transphobic violence.

Their methods have been so effective that government social workers on the island have often advised unemployed and low-income people looking for housing, food assistance, or other resources to “go to the anarchists.”[^51] Already, these activities surpass the scale, and certainly the quality, of government alleviation measures. The main limitation to spreading even further is not any internal defect of this kind of organization. On the contrary, we can identify two external factors. The first is state repression. One of the most active organizers with the FAGC was arrested and tortured by police, and then in a typical move in such cases, falsely accused by police of assaulting them. He is currently facing trial.

The other limitation is that such a practice requires organizing from below, which means a loss of control for professional activists. Similar initiatives organized by and for those in need of housing, using protest, blockades, and occupations, with migrant women frequently taking a leading role, are active throughout the Spanish state, including the Plataforma de Afectadas por la Hipoteca (PAH), which has been featured in numerous articles in English-language media. However, at key moments, middle class activists have proven their ability to flex within the housing movement and prevent an evolution towards stronger, more generalized tactics like rent strikes that would put into question the property relations at the foundation of capitalism and achieve the ideal that _houses belong to those who live in them_. The tendency of reformist activism towards a single-issue focus also keeps such movements from spreading out of control, which they need to do to actually and effectively challenge globally interlinked systems of exploitation and oppression.

In Greece, the other main entry point for migrants into Fortress Europe, there have also been inspiring initiatives providing housing and the means of survival. Tens of thousands of refugees from Syria, Afghanistan, and dozens of other countries, working closely with the anarchist and autonomous movements, squatted entire hotels and other abandoned buildings in Athens, Thessaloniki, and other cities in order to attain dignified housing.[^52] The squats are self-organized by their inhabitants, and many of them reject NGO workers as well as direct representatives of the state. They also run cafeterias, language classes, clinics, childcare services, and other activities. Some of the squats have waiting lists, with thousands of people hoping for a place. In contrast, the camps run by the government and managed by NGOs are literal concentration camps, with people living in unhygienic conditions in tents or barracks, with no services, eating disgusting food sometimes infested with maggots, freezing to death in the winter, and suffering countless abuses.[^53]

The progressive Syriza government had little sympathy for radical movements that put the party’s complicity with business as usual in sharp relief. They evicted several migrant squats and tried to repress the movement more generally.[^54]

In the face of the 2017 wave of repression, the movements rose to the challenge, demonstrating that principles like solidarity, mutual aid, and self-organization are not just feel-good ideas, and that in moments of crisis they scale up effectively, in contrast to the NGOs and the progressive political parties, who very literally _became the problem_, and in contrast to the chorus of Global North academics who enjoy the old game of infantilizing anarchistic political action but in fact have little to show when it comes to the housing and border crises. Anarchists and others occupied ruling party headquarters, worker-run factory Vio. Me opened “a warehouse for the collection, storage and transportation of basic items like clothes, sanitary items and baby food that had been gathered by solidarity collectives from all over Greece and Europe, prior to shipment to the Eidomeni border to be handed out to refugees,” thousands of people invited the most vulnerable among the refugees into their homes, and side by side, migrants and Greek radicals opened the next generation of squats.[^55]

As usually happens, the failure of the institutional Left to either satisfy social demands or to restore _order_ opened the way for conservative parties to go ever further to the right. When the New Democracy government came back into power in 2019, they declared an open war on self-organizing migrants and the anarchist movement more broadly, evicting numerous squats with heavily armed police and kicking undocumented people out to sleep on the streets or sending them into the system of state-run gulags.

In a sense, poor people are not allowed to be at home anywhere, papers or not, and across the world the struggle for a right to the city is raging. In poorer countries in the Global South, the outcome of that fight can often determine whether people have to migrate in the first place, or whether they can build the collective power to make a home.

Abahlali baseMjondolo, whose name in Zulu means “people who stay in shacks,” is “a radically democratic, grassroots and entirely non-professionalised movement of shack dwellers” in Durban, Pinetown, Pietermaritzburg, and other parts of Western Cape, South Africa. The movement began in 2005, arising out of a practice of road blockades and land occupations carried out by poor shack dwellers in Durban. They reject participation “in party politics or any NGO style professionalization or individualization of struggle.”

Since the 2005 road blockade the movement’s membership has grown from the entire population of the 6000 strong Kennedy Road settlement to the point where 13 entire settlements have voted to collectively affiliate to Abahlali and govern themselves autonomously from state politics. There are also a further 23 branches in other settlements that are not collectively affiliated to Abahlali but which do allow independent political activity.

This means that around 30,000 people have a direct and formal affiliation with the movement but many more have been inspired by it.

… The movement now also works with street traders and has a further 3 branches of street traders, all of which are in the city of Pinetown. It also has members in two areas in Pinetown in which people live in poor quality houses rather than shacks and who joined because they became familiar with the movement as their communities are adjacent to Abahlali shack settlements. The movement is multi-ethnic, multi-racial and multi-national and operates on the principle that everyone living in a settlement is from that settlement and has full rights to participate in the political life of that settlement irrespective of their origins.[^56]

Abahlali has fought for access to housing and land, education and childcare, water and sanitation, electrification, they have “held quarterly all-night music, poetry and drama evenings; run a 16 team football league; provided HIV/AIDS care;” and they have also built relationships of international solidarity “in support of shack dwellers in Zimbabwe and Haiti.” One of their main goals is “to win popular control over decision making that affects poor communities.” Doing so has directly pitted them against “authoritarianism from government, business and some left NGOs with vanguardist delusions.” Due to their activities and also their independence from the dominant institutions, their members and activities have been repeatedly attacked by police, sometimes with tacit support from poverty-focused NGOs.

Urban gardens are common in the settlements of South Africa, as they are in informal cities throughout the Global South in which one billion people live. Due to the framework of development, such gardens face a particular set of problems linked to ongoing colonial dynamics. Many residents of these impoverished, self-constructed, and largely self-regulating urban areas are recent evictees or transplants from the countryside, where a combination of capitalist and governmental pressures make life ever less tenable and desirable. However, urban agriculture is not exactly a continuation of rural agriculture, given the huge differences in the necessary techniques, as well as the world-crushing pressure that identifies small-scale agriculture with rural places and therefore as something backwards that needs to be left behind. In the Global North as in the Global South, urban agriculture is practiced as a survival strategy when food insecurity grows, and one that often persists and spreads when people realize its many social and environmental benefits.

“[M]any national and local governments in sub-Saharan Africa have resisted [urban agriculture] and urban farmers often face harassment by officials and the police.” People trying to feed themselves, improve their quality of life, and adapt traditional food cultures to their new surroundings are confronted with militarized discourses of hygiene that signal what forms of life should be emulated and what forms of life are an obstacle or a threat. “Urban agriculture presents an impression to local elites and to international observers that the city remains ‘unmodern’, ‘uncivilized’, ‘uncontrolled’, and ‘under-developed’ … Within this rhetoric, it is possible to detect a form of anti-Africanism.”[^57]

The need to transform cities into environments where food is abundant, ending their existence as barren sites of accumulation that despoil the countryside and where the poorer classes are especially vulnerable to malnutrition, and where there are few niches for other species, runs into a wall. Yet the limitations are not material. One of the primary obstacles is the very notion of progress, which is inextricably colonial and Eurocentric. Drawing inspiration from Frantz Fanon,[^58] Faranak Miraftab draws attention to the colonial imagination of urban planners and challenges:

the assumption that every plan and policy must insist on modernization. This mental decolonization requires recognizing how the ideal of the Western city has been deployed historically in the colonial era and is now being deployed in the neoliberal era to advance a certain paradigm of development and capital accumulation. A collective of developers, planners, architects, and politicians and a powerful industry of marketing and image-making have promoted the Western city as an object of desire.[^59]

Given more space or a two-volume book, I would showcase autonomous technologies developed directly by urban residents, like the rainwater filtration and greywater bioremediation developed in the anarchist social center, Casa de Lagartixa Preta in Santo André, Brazil, or bee habitats and rooftop gardens cultivated from Den Haag to Detroit. Instead I have chosen to focus not on the particular technologies that will accompany the transformation of our cities, but on contests over who controls the space. I have no doubt we can deploy all the amazing innovations that have been developed across the world the moment our neighborhoods belong to us.

The point is, the technologies to transform cities into healthy habitats already exist. We are not lacking inventors, we are lacking control over our own lives and vital spaces. Until we can directly organize and transform our neighborhoods to meet our own needs, and break the monopolies that control the world’s resources—including intellectual property—new technologies will be of two varieties: bootlegged, autonomous ingenuities developed _in situ_ that make the most out of scarce materials; or engineered technologies developed by professionals, well-meaning or otherwise, that will only increase global inequalities.


The Solutions Are Already Here




A THOUSAND WORLDS STRUGGLING TO BE BORN: ECOSYSTEMS OF REVOLT

FALSE PRAGMATISMS: STRATEGIES OF DESPERATION

ECOLOGICAL REVOLUTION: THE BEST STRATEGY IN SUCCESS OR FAILURE

Transforming the solutions we project also means transforming our understanding of the kind of methods that will get us there.

“Today all belong to the ruling class who look at their own lives from above.” The anarchist essay _23 Theses Concerning Revolt_ elaborates this idea of an embodied strategy:

All military strategy is to impose an ideal plan on the map that represents reality. … If we do not intend to make a military campaign, we must refuse to see the revolution as something organized according to a unified plan, as if it were a game of Risk. We are not looking down from above, giving orders. We are here, in the midst of a beautiful chaos that our enemies always try to organize. We will be stronger than ever if we learn to triumph in this chaos, to move in the network of our own relationships, to communicate horizontally or circularly, to use only what really is ours and to influence others, to understand that not everyone is going to act as we act; that is the beauty of rebellion, and our effectiveness in it does not lie in making the whole world equal, but in devising the best way to relate in a complementary way to those who are different and follow different paths.[^30]

The paradigm shift in our concept of revolution dovetails with the paradigm shift in our relationship with the planet and its inhabitants. We need to perceive “an ecosystem of revolt” in which, instead of trying to control what everyone is doing, promote the right ideas and suppress the wrong ideas, we understand our niche and create relationships of reciprocity with those around us, making us all stronger and healthier rather than making us all the same. It is such an ecosystem that is most able to combine collective knowledge and local, situated knowledge, allowing the decentralization of intelligence rather than continued reliance on the experts and leaders who have brought us into this crisis.

A part of this approach means accepting that we will never convince everyone. Others will continue to fight in legal channels seeking limited reform or government funding. There can still be instances of synergy, even with those who remain in such a diametrically opposed paradigm. On the one hand, we can take advantage of resources intended for other uses, such as the people in the small town in the US planting thousands of trees subsidized by the state. In other cases, we might get to know sympathetic bureaucrats or academics who are able to pass resources to our projects and support our struggles, as with a couple of academics who supported this book, or the radical academic from Borneo who uses their research to support Indigenous communities in struggle.

Each alliance should be evaluated on whether it helps us or hinders us from building the kind of decentralized, communal power that we need. Rejecting technocratic unity or Party dogmatism in our movements does not mean embracing an acritical relativism in which all ideas are equally valid. It is not an ecosystem of revolt if there is no revolt. One of the most important tasks today, which we must spread as energetically as we can, is to develop revolutionary horizons with as many people and communities as possible, precisely because the state, with all its appendages, has spent so many decades extinguishing even the thought of revolution.

Revolutionary movements come with several key advantages. Only by fighting for revolutionary transformations that present an existential threat to the existing order—for example, a world without rich people, without police, without governors, without corporations—have we ever achieved important concessions. All of the labor laws, paid vacations, limited working days, rent controls, public healthcare, unemployment benefits, and safety regulations that are being chipped away year by year are the vestiges of reforms won by revolutionary movements of anarchists and communists in the first part of the twentieth century, or since then by the organizations arising from those movements and institutionalized as a way to pacify them.

In other words, when we fight for revolution, we win even when we lose.

We cannot, however, view revolutionary movements as simply a bargaining chip. As long as the power to organize our lives is alienated from us and concentrated in the institutions that rule us, any improvement we are granted will be steadily worn away starting the moment we no longer present a threat.

Revolutionary movements taking direct action to “destroy what destroys us” raise consciousness and force all of society to talk about problems the media and government had caused us to ignore. When we meet in the streets in the heat of rebellion, we place all our isolated problems in common and realize how much we share.

Whether you are looking at fracking rigs in Pennsylvania or wind parks in Oaxaca, big businesses and the governments that support them operate in a cloak of secrecy, isolating people and getting them to sign away their lands one by one. When people fight back, such as when they built a barricade to stop armed detachments from erecting wind turbines in Bíi Hioxo, Oaxaca, they “created space to question these projects” and even though that particular wind project was constructed thanks to a complex counterinsurgency campaign that deployed all kinds of mercenaries, from paid assassins and neighborhood snitches to marketing strategists, NGO workers, and academics, battle lines were drawn that continue to facilitate resistance in the rest of the region, while the people who nominally lost this conflict were able to negotiate better conditions.[^31]

In the United States, for over forty years, the dominant narrative was that the Civil Rights movement of the ’50s and ’60s had ended systemic racism. It was only when multiracial, Black-led crowds fought police and smashed wealthy businesses in Oakland after the police murder of Oscar Grant in 2009, and when they did the same on a much larger scale after the police murder of Mike Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, that white supremacy became the subject of public conversation. This was thanks to a completely acephalous movement that came alive through many other revolts of varying size across the country, and that blended spaces of conversation, spaces of healing, spaces of occupation and transformation, and spaces of counterattack, vengeance, and wealth redistribution. Significantly, most of the mainstream media that kept systemic racism going strong by serving as the propaganda arm for the War on Drugs and avoiding serious reporting on any of the facets of white supremacy, by 2014, were forced to acknowledge that racism was still a problem.

And as uncomfortable as it is for those who would turn the movement into a lucrative NGO that refuses to support its prisoners, or into a Democratic voting machine, in 2020 that movement manifested again in a huge way and forced all of society, at least for several months, to consider a very radical idea that just a few years earlier would have been inconceivable at that scale: abolishing the police entirely. And the most eloquent opening gesture to that debate was to manifest the idea of abolishing the police by burning the Third Precinct police station of Minneapolis down to the ground. Similar to the Arab Spring of 2011, the revolt in Minneapolis sent shock waves across the world, advancing conversations about racism and spreading tactics of collective self-defense against the police in the UK, France, Brazil, and beyond.

The ability of movements with revolutionary horizons to raise consciousness and shift the limits of the debate is beyond question, but it is also fully wrapped up with another important concern: shifting the balance of power. In the US especially, the police are a central institution. Abolishing them means abolishing the US in its entirety as a capitalist settler state. It was unavoidable that anyone unable to conceive of such a revolutionary horizon would gradually replace abolishing the police with defunding the police, and from there many of them would move on to support increased police funding in order to pay for the cameras or improved sensitivity training that would supposedly put an end to hundreds of years of history.

If we do not have the power to abolish such a huge, ugly machine as the US and replace it with something better, healthier, very few of us have the power to imagine abolishing its component parts. Likewise, if we do not have the power to take over our territory, feed ourselves through ecocentric relations, and abolish ecocidal industries, few of us will have the power to imagine any solution that does not involve the government coming in and waving a magic wand.

Having a revolutionary horizon requires us to build power; a revolutionary kind of power that corresponds to our own needs and ways of living. Fortunately, revolutionary movements are uniquely suited to building decentralized power. In contrast, reformist movements only strengthen centralized power, both by solidifying the authorities’ role as arbiter and by funneling massive amounts of resources away from social movements for the purpose of lobbying.

Envisioning revolutionary horizons and building power out of our own activity and the collective satisfaction of our own needs and desires—the kind of power that cannot prop up a new oppressive system—inevitably reveals all the intersecting lines of oppression and resistance. This is the terrain in which we see how climate change, industrial pollution, patriarchy, borders, white supremacy, mass extinction, accumulation by dispossession, and colonialism are inextricable. By definition, this kind of revolution means changing the paradigm. In a society in which even environmentalism has become a tool for ravaging the Earth and its inhabitants, smashing the dominant paradigm is a necessity we can no longer elide.

That is why we need to fight for a revolution, and try our hardest to win. Putting an end to a system that by its very nature produces misery would be the best future for all of us. If we fight in a way that is consistent with the world we want to defend, then every step we take, even if we don’t make it all the way, leaves the world a better place and could make the difference between life and death for a person, a community, an ecosystem, that right now is under threat. Recognizing that we live only thanks to a beautiful web of relationships with countless other beings, nurturing those relationships, is the best possible way to live. It is a revolution that transforms our present, honors our past, and offers the best hope for ending an apocalypse that has been going on for too long, moving towards a future where we can all, finally, begin to heal.


The Solutions Are Already Here




ECOLOGICAL IMAGINATIONS: PLOTTING A TOTAL TRANSFORMATION OF HUMAN EXISTENCE

JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION: MAKING SURE MASS MURDER DOESN’T PAY

APOCALYPTIC UTOPIAS NOW: PRESENT STEPS IN THE NETWORKING OF LOCAL AND GLOBAL SPACES

The alternative to ecocide is not a simplistic plan for carbon reduction on a schedule that will not be met, and even if it were could not avert a catastrophe that is already upon us.

The alternative is the networking of thousands of empowered territories, each one approaching the horizon of a complex imagined future that prioritizes the health and happiness of that territory and its inhabitants. To achieve that, we do not have to await the timetables of economists and engineers advising us how to incentivize powerful, murderous institutions to make the needed changes at their own pace, without rocking the boat too much.

What we need to do instead is to find the seeds of those empowered territories all around us, nurture them, cultivate them, and link them in a rhizomatic web that will become stronger than any institution of the ecocidal system that is already falling to ruin, strong enough so that as many of our living communities as possible—human and non-human, all enmeshed—will survive the upheavals and disturbances as our planet tries to heal from centuries of abuse.

Finding those seeds, cultivating them, will look different in every territory. But after talking with friends across the world, I think we can trace an outline for action that will be useful in different contexts by asking ourselves four simple questions. These questions, in conversation with those around us, can be an important step in creating empowered communities.

• _Who is already fighting?_

• _What seedlings do we have?_

• _What risks do we face?_

• _Who can we help?_

When we look around us to see who is already fighting, we are looking for accomplices and also breaking with the mentality of passively awaiting solutions. And by _fighting_ I mean struggling for survival, in the broadest sense of the term. Survival is never individual, it is communal, it is physical, emotional, and intergenerational. It includes people trying to stop a pipeline that would poison their water supply, to stop an airport that would bring in floods of tourists and destroy their traditional relation with their territory; people trying to preserve their language or their heirloom crops against pressures to modernize; people fighting against evictions or trash incinerators, trying to create a more livable city; people crossing borders in search of a better life. Fighting for survival does not include people launching careers off their activism. It does not include people developing and patenting technologies that, taken out of context, might seem to make a small part of the problem better but in the current context will just concentrate more wealth into fewer hands.

Taking inventory of our seedlings means identifying sources of strength that have shown to be viable right now, and that with more support might grow exponentially, serving as inspirations or starting points for a new way of living, like the weed that breaks the pavement or the first-generation tree that makes way for a thriving forest. Maybe we take part in a labor organization that might be able to launch infrastructures of international solidarity in a moment of deepening crisis. Maybe we live in a territory that has remained relatively fertile, with a good number of projects that point the way to local food sovereignty; or maybe we live in a desertifying area but take part in projects that help the local ecosystem and human communities to adapt and mitigate the damage. Maybe we run a hacking collective or open technology initiative capable of sharing useful tools and designs on a global scale. Maybe our region has a combative street movement capable of wrecking capitalist infrastructure projects or blocking government policies that threaten us. What links can we establish between projects and what conversations can we have within these projects in order to let more people know they serve as a model for a better world, and to be ready when they need to grow rapidly and pull more weight?

We also need to be aware of what specific risks we face in our territory. Do we live in a food desert? How far away are food and fuel supplies, should the gas stations and supermarkets go empty? What infrastructures do we lack for growing and processing our own food? What repressive strategies and capabilities is the local government likely to use against us, and what kind of organized paramilitary forces exist in our territory? Are we at acute risk of desertification, wildfires, sea level rise, or tropical diseases? Do we have access to the seeds that we will need for next year’s planting, or are they all warehoused by agribusiness? How do the people around us react to crisis? When the pandemic hit, did they rush to empty out the stores, or did they think of ways to protect one another?

Finally, who can we help? What living communities—human and non-human—in our territory are most at risk, most in need of additional resources in order to adapt and protect themselves? What infrastructures and resources do we have—especially considering those given to us by global capitalism—that people in other territories lack? How can we build bonds of communication and solidarity with those other territories so we can help them get what they need to survive?

Where we live and who we are will result in very different answers to these questions. No institution on the planet is capable of assimilating all those knowledges in an intelligent way. It is up to us to answer these questions and create our own plans.

It might help to suggest a few lines of inquiry relating to the most basic, broad differences. People from colonized territories have different historical and present examples to look to for deciding how to take charge of their calls for solidarity, the way they build support, and the way they understand reparations. The Zapatistas and the Kurdish liberation movement both put out calls for international solidarity and received important material and moral support. Key elements of their campaigns included inviting supporters to their territories to learn firsthand about their struggles; defining how people from outside could support them and thus eliminating one of the most central and oppressive characteristics of charity; asking those supporters to bring their experiences back to a significantly larger group of people in their home territories and to build support there; and challenging and influencing the ideologies of liberation movements in colonizing countries. Especially in the case of the Zapatistas, there was also an important element of asking people in wealthier countries to raise money and help the local communities achieve the material basis for autonomy in contradiction to the forced dependence of global capitalism.

Other examples include the solidarity campaign that targeted companies doing business with the South African apartheid regime with boycott or sabotage (including an extensive firebombing campaign in Germany and the Netherlands that forced multiple companies to divest), or international solidarity with Palestine focusing on boycotts, divestment, and sanctions. On a smaller scale, but very recently, there was the call put out by First Nations fighting against land grabs in territories occupied by the Canadian state to help blockade transportation infrastructure in the midst of a powerful wave of protests that shut down highways, ports, and rail lines across the country.

To simplify, salient questions include how to communicate the needs of the colonized territory, how to build international relationships strong enough to provide a framework for real solidarity, and how to self-define the struggle and break the habits of paternalism and charity that people from colonizing societies are trained in.

A series of articles by John Severino, all available on theanarchistlibrary.org]], detail one model for creating international solidarity based on creating and collectivizing personal relationships between communities in struggle, in this case between anarchists and Indigenous communities within the United States, Bolivia, and Chile.

For our part, people from colonizing countries might want to consider recent critiques of allyship, such as “Accomplices Not Allies” by Indigenous Action Media or “Critique of Ally Politics.”[^20] Breaking with paternalistic charity models is fundamental; if we are not learning from the people we are supporting, it isn’t solidarity. But there are other pitfalls as well.

Tawinikay speaks to one of them:

Saying you support Indigenous sovereignty doesn’t mean backing every Indigenous person on every project. There are plenty of Indigenous misogynists and ladder-climbing politicians out there, and you don’t do me any favours by helping them gain power. Fight for liberatory ideas, not for nations or bloodlines.

We do this all the time. There are Indigenous people out there who oppose pipelines and those who support them, but we align ourselves with the resistance, so we are making choices already. Own it. It’s okay. It’s good to fight for the land and for freedom.

… Understand what struggles are about and know who is participating in them. Get to know those people. Build relationships. Build meaningful relationships outside of the occupation, as friends. It can’t start from a place of white guilt. Don’t get swept up in your own settler redemption story.[^21]

As for the imperative of rooting ourselves in a territory, this can be extremely difficult if we have no such roots to start with, if we come from a culture that has been completely modernized, and especially if we are settlers in a settler state. Unless they are well thought out in historical perspective and with great sensitivity to all the other living communities around us, attempts to “reconnect with our roots” will only end up reproducing alienation.

Knowing the Land is Resistance ([https://knowingtheland.com](https://knowingtheland.com\)) provides an interesting model for an initiative by settlers living “between Lake Ontario and the Niagara Escarpment” to learn from and connect with local woodlands; to spread ecological skills and awareness with plant walks, seed harvesting, zines, and workshops; to develop an “anarchist ecology” that critiques “the ecology of management from a distance, and of remote expertise, that sees itself as fundamentally separate from the land, inhabiting a present without a past or future” and instead offers “starting points for an anti-colonial, anti-authoritarian way of connecting with the land [that is] rooted in relationships, deep listening, urban ecology, re-enchanting, and unexpertness”; and to build active solidarity with ongoing Indigenous struggles to defend and recover their land and their ways of life.

Because of a history we did not create but must nonetheless situate ourselves within, settlers need to make clear that it is more important for us to defend the land than to own it. This means sabotaging destructive infrastructure and helping block ecocidal megaprojects without the expectation that doing so will win us ownership or some other claim to the land.

Plenty of past projects that arose from European socialism and focused on reclaiming a connection with the land became complicit with colonialism when carried out in a settler context, including Zionist kibbutzim such as Degania or Sointula, a commune set up by Finnish socialists on the territory of the ‘Namgis First Nation, usurped within the confines of British Columbia.[^22]

As for specific considerations for Indigenous and racialized people moving forward, of course I’m not qualified to offer any, but I hope that the revolutionaries, communities, organizations, and initiatives that have also spoken in these pages can provide inspiration relevant to many different contexts.

One thing that I think is true wherever we are is that we can get to know the earth beneath our feet, the history that towers behind us, the overlapping communities that surround us. Wherever we live, there we can find life, and with life, struggle. Let us connect on that basis, and fight for a world fit for living things, not for the ossified institutions begging us to save them, to rejuvenate them again with one more round of life-sapping reforms.

Capitalism is dying. It has been dying for a very long time, and still it keeps growing. Colonialism has already changed its masks. The state has stood on the precipice of collapse before. Why keep pretending? Why bite our tongues? Let us put them out of their misery, before it is too late for all of us. We don’t need them. There is another world right here. It has been with us the whole time.

22.]] Naomi Klein (_On Fire_) has the right rhetoric but is remarkably short on details. Cooperation Jackson (Akuno, “Tales from the Frontlines,”) provides a solid social and racial justice focus, but they go far beyond Representative Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Markey’s GND proposal, itself rejected as far too left-wing by the Democratic Party. They do not seem to explain how to bridge this gap and pressure the Democratic Party into accepting a program it is inimical to. Noam Chomsky and Robert Pollin offer a fully technocratic proposal, very sensitive to financial interests, without bothering to grasp the human dimensions, pay attention to social movements, or perceive the many criticisms relating to racism, coloniality, gender, and all the other interconnected oppressions and catastrophes (_Climate Crisis and the Global Green New Deal: The Political Economy of Saving the Planet_, London: Verso, 2020).
