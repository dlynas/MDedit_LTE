The problems of the Turkish Empire also existed in Persia, India, and China. India and Pakistan temporarily delayed disintegration through the federal system left behind by the British. Otherwise, India is likely to face the danger of disintegration at the same time as its independence. But even if the conflict is eased through the federal system and the unity is strengthened through the pressure of China and Pakistan, its internal differences are still considerable. Southern Indian states have always harbored suspicions about North India. They have always worried that the excessively strong central government of Delhi will destroy their unique culture. After the British left, they are more insistent that they use English than the North, and are more insistent on the policy of opening to the West, and produced their unique small nationalism. There are more than a dozen Indian official languages, including Tamil and several other languages. Each of the southern states has its native language. Religious groups like the Sikhs also want to establish their special state based on the general principle of nation-building. They are always in conflict with the central government of India and eventually led to the assassination of Indira Gandhi (1917~1984). In the end, the areas inhabited by Sikhs were marked out as the independent Punjab state. Fortunately, India is a federal state, so this method of division can also be solved peacefully without significantly affecting the constitutional structure of India. But even so, you can imagine that this kind of local identity will still cause tremendous tension in the future.

   

No significant problems are happening now. Thanks mainly to Pakistan and China. The Sikhs did not break away from India; it is not so much that the central government of India is too powerful, or that the constitution of India is stable enough then it is because of the existence of Pakistan. Sikhs and Muslims were hereditary enemies. There have been long-term conflicts. If the Sikhs were to leave India and build their own country, they would face the Pakistani pressure alone. In doing so, it would be better to stay in India. India has played a protective role against the threat of Pakistan. To avoid the threats of Pakistan and China, the small states in India are more or less willing to maintain the Indian Federation, a form of imperial heritage that they do not like. If one day the Pakistani and Chinese threats were lifted, due to the pressure of the international situation and the removal of the centripetal force, then it is entirely possible that what was worried about India’s independence plan during the discussion in 1945 may still be repeated. India may still be like the Balkan Peninsula where a series of new nation-states are established through language communities.

   

The Iranian issue is very similar to that of India, except that Iran has not undergone any formal colonial rule. It has adopted more of its original imperial structure and is therefore embodied as a Shiite minority in Tehran and Tabriz enforce its laws to Azerbaijani, Baluchi, Turkmen, and other surrounding ethnic minorities. This kind of compelling rule is reflected not only in clashes between clans but also in that between languages, religions, and sects. If Iran loses its Azerbaijan, Kurdish, Arab, Balochistan, and Turkmen region, it will lose 60 percent of its land and population, and most of its oil revenue. Therefore, relying solely on this point, Iran’s political structure reform will be tough. Any attempt to democratize will release regional separatism. Transnational ethnic groups such as Baluchi that are present in both Pakistan and Iran are likely to take advantage of this opportunity to repeat the experience of nation-building in Eastern Europe and establish their nation-state. Therefore, because of the existence of such an imperial legacy in the Middle East, its political system is still in a highly unstable state.

   

However, the most unstable potential problem is still in China. China inherited the system of the Qing Empire and therefore it is like Ottoman Turkey and the German Empire. The legacy of the Empire gave it three choices. It can build a pan-Chinese community based on the Chinese language and the ancient Chinese culture. This kind of imaginative community was already produced in the late Qing Dynasty. When Sun Yat-sen and Zhang Taiyan discussed the future state-building plan, they once addressed that the North Koreans and the Vietnamese are apparently closer to the Chinese culture, and the Mongolians and the Manchus are farther away from the same culture. In the future, when they overthrew the Qing Dynasty, they could consider expelling the ethnic groups north of the Great Wall who bears the mark of the Central Asian nomadic peoples and integrate countries that shared the Confucian tradition and the Chinese culture, like Korea and Vietnam, into a pan-China community. In fact, such a scheme is, regarding its nature, very similar to pan-Germanism, pan-Slavism, and pan-Turkism. It calls for breaking the borders of the Qing Empire, and integrate all areas that do not legally belong to the Qing territory, that is, the areas where the Qing Empire couldn't rule but are culturally closely related to the ancient Chinese civilization.

   

The second solution is Liang Qichao's concept of the Chinese nation. The idea of the Chinese nation was proposed based on the Chinese Empire. It is equivalent to Ottomanism, great-Russianism, and great-Germanism. To reduce the pain of transformation, it wants to retain the existing borders of the Qing Empire. But there is a problem: the Russian Empire, the Turkish Empire, and the Qing Empire, on the one hand, left certain Slavs, Ottomans, and Chinese descendants outside the jurisdiction of the Russian emperor, the Ottoman Sultan, and the Qing emperor. For example, North Koreans, Serbians and Turkmen are not within the rule of the empire, but are culturally and linguistically very close to the Empire; on the other hand, the empire retains many culturally and linguistically distant territories, for historical reasons, these regions have indeed been ruled by the empire, such as Mongolia, Manchuria, or areas like Poland and Armenia. In the sense of international law, they belong to the undisputed territory of the Qing, Great Russia, and the Turkish Empire. However, from a cultural point of view, it is very different from the mainstream of the empire and is more exotic than friendly neighboring countries like North Korea or Turkmen.

   

There is also a third solution, namely small China, which means to exclude these heterogeneous ethnic groups as much as possible to reduce the difficulties of the founding of the nation and to interpret Chinese in the purest sense. The ethnic groups that were "contaminated" by barbarian invasions, such as the Shandong scholars who had been invaded by the Central Asian nomadic people during the Qing and Yuan dynasties, are considered not qualified to be called Chinese. According to the narrow understanding of China’s culture, they only took, for example, Wuyue scholar-bureaucrats or Cantonese Triad Society & Chinese Freemasons who resisted the Qing invasion, as the seeds of the Chinese civilization, and through weeding out the fake seeds, a small community can be established. This small community, free from the burden of the empire, will be easier to construct. This kind of regional Han imperialism with Canton or Wuyue characteristics is a feature of the ideological world in the late Qing and early Republic of China period. People like Cai E or Yang Du, to resolve the contradictions, propose to use a federal-federation program to reconcile the construction of the local community with the construction of the imperial community. This construction method is very close to Lenin's concept of the Soviet Union, or the United States of Greater Austria concept proposed by Adler (Victor Adler, 1852~1918).

   

They require that, like Hunan, for example, it can regard China as a great Germany and Hunan a notably superior state, such as Prussia, and demand citizens of the future Hunan community to show dual patriotism. On the one hand, they are patriots of Hunan. It must be emphasized that Hunan has played a unique role in the Chinese civilization and great China since the philosopher Wang Fuzhi, the Xiang Army, and the revolutionary restoration. A proud Hunanese should be able to see that it is their armed forces that have saved Jiangsu and Zhejiang from the Taiping Rebellion. They are more entitled than other Chinese nations and are more qualified to practice militarism. On the other hand, according to the commonality of the Chinese culture, they still have to carry other states and establish a more extensive federal state, the Republic of China, or the Republic of United Provinces. This dual ideal eventually produced the Republic of China, the Republic of the five main nationalities, as stipulated in the 1912 Constitution.

   

However, like Turkey or Russia, it did not solve the ethnic identity issue. Later, the debates in China, Japan, and Russia centered on the status of Manchuria, Outer Mongolia, Xinjiang, Tibet, and other special communities was based on this point. During the Holy Roman Empire era, the Bohemians had no problem with being ruled by the Holy Roman Emperor, because the rule of the universal empire was superficial and not exclusive. Various sub-power entities are allowed under the universal empire. Therefore, Bohemia can still have its aristocrats, principalities or something. Places like Outer Mongolia or Tibet enjoy similar rights under the rule of the Qing Empire. Although Qing is unified in form, it does not rule out the fact that the various political entities that form the Qing Empire retain their own special ways of governance: Outer Mongolia can have different forms of governance than Inner Mongolia; Inner Mongolia can have differences from the Eighteen Provinces; Inside the Eighteen Provinces, chieftains and hereditary feudal territories may have different forms of governance; the types of governance in regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Grand Canal can still be different from that in Northern China. The Empire can guarantee internal pluralism, so the existence of these multiple entities can be allowed without significant conflicts.

   

However, the construction of nation-states requires much higher homogeneity. Bohemians can maintain a highly autonomous or semi-autonomous statehood within the Holy Roman Empire for a long time, but a united German nation would not allow such a state. They can either abandon their national characteristics, blend in with the German nation, and transform their language into a dialect of the German language; or merely lose the form of the German Empire and create their unique Czech nationality. In the midst of the dissolution and reorganization of the Holy Roman Empire, these fringes of Germanic culture faced such a painful choice. You have to choose. Your original status of self-government and semi-autonomy cannot be maintained. You must either be wholly independent and establish a new nation or abandon the characteristics of your ethnicity and simply join the German nation.

   

The same problem also appeared in the border areas of Turkey and the Russian Empire. It is not a problem for highly Europeanized Estonians; they can claim that they have always been European. For a group like the Ukrainians, it is hard to say whether it is closer to Russia or Europe. For the Greeks, it may be said that they are relatively close to Europe; but for the Bulgarians or the Syrians, it is difficult to tell if they are closer to Europe or Turkey. For the Chinese, you can also say that small China's core area is in Wuyue or Eastern Canton, and Huguang or Sichuan is apparently closer to the Chinese tradition, But for Tibet and Mongolia, are they closer to China's culture, or is it closer to the tradition of Inner Asia? This is also very hard to say. These fringe groups will face long-term hesitation, tossing and struggling between various conflicting national ideals.

   

In this process, it is difficult to say who's the patriot and who's the traitor. It's very hard to say, for example, the Mongols, should they follow Chiang Kai-shek and become a clan of the great Chinese nation, or should they follow Demchugdongrub and insist on establishing an independent great Mongolian state, or should they follow the Soviets and the Japanese and turn Mongolia into a member of the Soviet Union or the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere? Each route has its advantages and weaknesses. The great Mongolia scheme advocated by Demchugdongrub could maximally preserve the heritage of Genghis Khan and integrate all ethnic groups that speak the Mongolian language and live nomadic lifestyles, this looks fine, but for the scheme to work, it must step over Chinese, Russian and Japanese borders and inevitably cause a major war. On the surface, it looks good for the Mongolian people, but in the course of the war, the Mongolian people will undoubtedly suffer severe losses. Therefore, it is very likely that it has harmed the Mongolian people.

   

If you follow the ideals of the Eastern Mongolian monarchs of Hulunbuir, then you can integrate into the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere hosted by the Japanese. Since Japan is the most economically developed and politically civilized entity in the region, so if you follow the Japanese instead of the Chinese or the Soviets, then you will: on the one hand, you will have better economic treatment and more opportunities, you can benefit from the Japanese investment and industrial development and quickly enter modern society; on the other hand, Japan’s politics are also relatively loose, although it is not entirely without repression, the degree of repression and discrimination is much lighter than the Chinese national government and the Soviet Union. The Mongolian aristocracy will be able to maintain more of its traditional privileges, while ordinary Mongolians will suffer fewer revolutions and repeated tosses. The political and economic interests are apparent. But if you choose this path, it's very likely that a completely independent Mongolian country would not be able to exist. At most, you can have several autonomous regions with Mongolian characteristics.

   

If you construct according to the Soviets, that is, you establish a pure Mongolian country in the small border region of Mongolia, and leave Mongolian-Han-inhabited Inner Mongolia entirely to China, and completely give up Mongolian-North Korean-Japanese-inhabited Eastern Mongolia to Japan. The advantage of this scheme is that the community you create is more homogenous, and the primary condition for nation-state construction is homogenization. The higher the degree of homogeneity, the smoother the construction of nation-states. But there will be a hefty price. Most Mongolians live in Inner Mongolia and Eastern Mongolia where the Mongolian and the Chinese live together. Only about a quarter of Mongolians live in Outer Mongolia. Outer Mongolian is more ethnically pure, but if you choose such a path, you will be leaving many Mongolians abroad. The Russians and the Turks, after accepting the concepts of small Turkey and small Russia, will inevitably face the same pain. The complaints continued. Many Russians stayed in the independent Estonia and Latvia, and they complained that these countries adopted various discriminatory measures against the Russian language. Many Russians remained in Crimea, and some in Kazakhstan. They always complained that they wanted to return to the homeland.

   

Why was Hitler able to gain power? It is because there are many ethnic Germans, not German nationals, who stayed outside the border. Hitler's move cannot be described merely as aggression, because in the Middle Ages, according to the political ethics of the Holy Roman Empire, the ethnic group and the ruling power were initially separated. However, in the process of establishing a nation-state, the national community requires the unity of ethnic culture, language, and nation-building. So what will become of the Polish Germans? If the German nationals do not care for them, they will be forced by the Polish authorities to learn Polish and eventually forget that they are descendants of the Germans and become Poles themselves. Should Germans tolerate such a thing? Should the Sudeten Germans learn Czech and regard themselves as Slavs in the future?

   

If the Poles and the Czechs are historically more powerful and prosperous than the Germans, such assimilation would be justified because there are already many Germans immigrating to the United States and being assimilated into Americans without causing major controversy, because everyone feels that after entering the United States, on the one hand, you are a free and equal citizen of the United States, on the other side, you are entering a place that is more developed, prosperous, free and equal, which means that you promoted yourself. No one complains about upward assimilation, but many will oppose downward assimilation. For the Germans assimilation by America is perfectly acceptable, for the Alsace and Lorraine, assimilation by France is somewhat acceptable, but assimilation by Poland or Czech will be unbearable. Because historically speaking, the Poles and the Czechs have always been less prosperous and less potent than the Germanic people; such assimilation will undoubtedly be very painful. So Hitler had to wage war, and with a good reason.

   

The war, as a solution, is ruthless. All peoples are compelled to be redistributed based on their actual borders. The Germans who formerly lived in the Eastern European countries must be forcibly relocated to their home countries, with their ancestors in Sudeten, Silesia, and East Prussia completely wiped out. Even in non-Germanic places, such as those in Poland and Ukraine, large-scale border adjustments must be carried out: Poles living on the east side of the border have to leave their homeland to return to the west of Poland; Ukrainians living in the west of the border They must also leave their hometowns and return to the Soviet Union in the east. The Greeks and the Turks solved their long-term issues by ethnic cleansing. Through warfare, the Greeks of Asia Minor fled to Greece, and the Turks living in Epirus had to escape back to Turkey. Kemal himself and most of the core military officers of the Young Turks party weren't born in Anatolia, but rather in places like Thrace and Adrianople, Most of these areas have been assigned to Greece, and they are exiles. And Greece accepted Izmir and the other regions which traditionally belonged to Greek city-states. After the pattern of the nation-state was approved, every assimilation fringe group would face similar tragedies. The most recent is that of Bosnia. Bosnia must be disintegrated into Republika Srpska, Muslim Republic, and the Croatian Republic, and the residents who live on the wrong side of the border must be subjected to forced cleansing or active immigration to create a relatively pure community. This is a by-product of the creation of a national community.

   

For example, China has faced such cruel and painful choices since the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China period. On its borders and its areas of mixed habitation, like a mosaic art piece, it embeds ethnic minorities among the local mainstream peoples. The mosaic pattern could be very subtle: for example, some Mongolians in Inner Mongolia may be surrounded by the Han majority; but within the Mongolian settlement, there may be Muslim minorities among them. How should such a layered nested structure be handled in the future? Any carelessness, it will result in a bloodbath. But to muddle through would likely to only leave the worry to the future, that is to say, you still won't be able to find a way to build a nation-state model which is in a mainstream position in modern society. Regardless what you do, there will more or less be imperial traces in the thing that have been established, which means it would at least inherit some of the universal legacies of the Qing Empire. Therefore, you must create the concept of dual nationalism, and try to disperse and remix local, ethnic, cultural and political loyalty into a very vague statement. And this state would lead to a blurring of rights and obligations, and the community's constitution and boundaries would not be able to complete.

   

We must understand that the so-called democracy is implemented after the establishment of a Nation-State because the core of state-building is the issue of a sovereign. What is a democracy? Democracy is a concept attached to a nation of people. If the form of governance is an Empire, then the ruling elite is a transnational minority group, and it is impossible and impractical to practice democracy. How can the Qing Empire exercise democracy? Is this democracy Mongolian, Manchu, or of Jiangnan scholar-bureaucrats, or of the Shanyue/Miao-Yao ethnic groups? How can a collective will be formed? Heterogeneous residents will inevitably produce their agents, and these agents or elites will not be able to maintain an internationalist integration after such a referendum consolidation. For the Holy Roman Empire to exist, we must say that we do not emphasize the differences between languages and customs at all. By the Latin language and the Christian faith, we organize a transcendental community based on these two transnational elements. If the Qing Empire or the Chinese Empire were to exist, then we must transcend the identity of dialects and languages and use the internationalist Confucianism or the Chinese characters to organize us into an international elite class of scholar-bureaucrats. The elite class of the scholar-bureaucrats does not particularly identify with a particular place, but abstractly loyal to a universal emperor and the common Confucius thoughts, and uses this method to integrate all localities.

   

Such integration, as I just said, is imperial. The precondition for it to be able to maintain is that the elite implements horizontal integration while cutting off the vertical integration channels and keeping the grassroots in the grassroots forever. Once the grassroots began to participate in politics, this kind of integration could not be maintained. Because the timetable for the grassroots to rise and participate in politics is uneven. For example, the Bohemian awakening is much earlier than that of the Bulgarians and Slovaks. Those areas that are awakened first will inevitably find their particularities, and that they are unwilling to associate or assimilate with the more backward communities. Upward assimilation will work, but downward assimilation will be very difficult. Specifically, if a Shanghai people arrived in the United States, it would be as if a German were migrating to the United States. He could easily assimilate into the United States because for him it was only a relocation. However, if the Shanghai people were forced to move to Xinjiang, and you want him to convert to Islam and turn himself into a Kazakh or Uighur, then he will think that this is a severe insult to him and will violate his rights. He would act like an Educated Youth after the Cultural Revolution. He will either try desperately to return to Shanghai or at the very least adhere to his special cultural identity while stuck in Xinjiang and refuse will all his might to speak the ethnic minorities' language or identify himself with them. In fact, for the same reason, the Germans in Danzig are entirely unwilling to integrate into Poland, and the Germans in New York are very willing to integrate into the United States. This is almost a universal law of nature. No matter how you give or adjust the preferential policy; you cannot change the ethnic identity that is associated with a class structure.

   

Once the ethnic identity is linked to economic and political interests and class structures, it will be tough to break down. If you want the Shanghainese or even the Suzhou people to develop a collective identity with the migrants from Henan or Anhui, this is already extremely difficult; now if you go further and ask them to identify with the Mongolians, Muslims or Tibetans, it will be even more difficult. If a country’s territory is too broad, like Germany, Turkey, or Russia, with some advanced regions in Europe and some backward areas of Inner Asia, then the mere fact that different ethnic groups have different economic and social development timetables will be enough to stimulate distinct consciousnesses.

   

Why do Bohemians forget that they are Slavs and do not admit that they are Germans? Because Bohemia is the earliest industrialized region in Central Europe, it is more abundant than Austria's and Hungary's agricultural regions. It is inevitable for it to feel that even if Bohemian residents were once Slavs or part of the Austrian Empire, it is a fact that Bohemia is the factory of Central Europe. After independence, it is entirely possible for it to establish a Western European industrialized nation-state, while other countries have not yet process such conditions, even after independence, at most, they will possibly develop military dictatorships, conservative monarchies, or other relatively backward political forms. This alone is enough to make the Bohemian elite invent the concept of the Czech nation, went into exile in Paris, and draw Bohemia from the Habsburg Empire, the Slavic and the Germanic peoples and established their independent group with the support of Britain and France. When the economic and social development further fluctuates and deepen internally, the Hungarians must feel that they are more advanced than the Bulgarians and the Romanians; and the Bulgarians and the Romanians must think that they should be way more advanced than the Greeks and the Turks.

   

An important reason for the disintegration of Yugoslavia is that the more Germanized and Europeanized Slovenes and Croats feel that it is difficult for them to unite with the Asianized Orthodox Serbs. They think that these people are Asians and they are a relatively advanced European group, and very much hope that they can merge into Europe and leave those relatively backward groups outside. The Ukrainian split ultimately boils down to the fact that people in western Ukraine think that they are very close to Poland and Europe and that if they could follow their path, they could follow the Poles’ footsteps into Europe; while the people in eastern Ukraine are close to the Russians and the Asians and is more affected by the imperialist traditions of the former Soviet Union, its burden is relatively heavy, and so it will be impossible for it to join Europe. The final result is that everyone is divided up and the region that can join Europe choose to participate on their own, and the region that is not able to do so will have to make do with the Russians.

   

But we must not forget that Russia’s imperial structure is not so sturdy as well. For example, St. Petersburg or Leningrad is always unconvinced to Moscow and Inner Asia. Residents of St. Petersburg, like Estonians and Latvians, feel that they are Europeans, and staying in Russia means only sacrificing their future for the Russians. However, Novosibirsk and Kazan indeed do not hold such a belief. The pro-European Russians, pro-Asian Russians, and pro-Muslim Russians have developed different self-identities: a place that is relatively pro-European is likely to be more liberal; whereas more pro-Asian areas with a lot of Muslim immigrants tend to lean more towards Eurasianism; and the central place may be where the Orthodox Church and the original great-Russianism prevail.

   

Even after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the same three paths still exist in current Russia, and the Putin government faces great difficulties in its integration. For example, the people around Medvedev are mostly the political descendants of Russia’s pro-European faction from the Yeltsin era. They can at least hold hope that under Medvedev’s protection when Putin’s gone, they can re-introduce Russia to Europe. For people like Solzhenitsyn, he clearly belongs to the Orthodox Church and the great-Russian faction: on the one hand, he advocated resolutely driving out the Islamic region and allowed the Europeanized Estonia and Poland to go out on their own; but he was equally determined that Ukraine and Belarus, which are considered part of the Slavic Orthodox tradition, should stay in Russia. As for Putin himself and his current advisors, they are mainly Eurasians, and they demanded that Russia be both European and Asian, and in this way they can retain a large number of imperial heritage in Chechnya, the Caucasus, and Central Asia. If we do not consider the factors of Eurasianism, it is hard to say that if Russia could maintain its territory as a European-Asian superstate.

   

If we understand this ideological background and then come back to consider the issue of China’s modern history, we must realize that the so-called "imperialist aggression," or what the "national shame" education has set up for you, has a severe problem with its historical framework. In fact, not only the Chinese, but also various ethnic groups and residents from South Korea, Japan, Mongolia, Vietnam, and Southeast Asia have faced a common background since the 20th century, that is, with the West as the center, the great wave of national community construction that has been spreading to most regions of the world, has now came to the Far East. How the residents and ethnic groups of the Far East should choose their own identity and how they should create their political community forms are the main problems at hand.

   

For the simple small countries, it is relatively easy, let's use South Korea as an example. South Korea has taken advantage of itself is a small country. It does not have the burden of the empire. Once it breaks away from the intervention of the Qing Empire and Japan, it can just say that the Joseon Dynasty, Goryeo, and even Goguryeo, which is not generally considered the ancestor of today's Korea, are all its forbears, and go on to create its own national myth, Dangun Wanggeom and such, and then declare that it was a unitary national community. This is not true regarding race, history, and culture. Because Gojoseon (northern part of the peninsula) had a robust Tungusian lineage and was somewhat intimate with the Chinese Central Plains dynasties, but Samhan (southern part of the peninsula) was closer to Japan. Their ancestry was also very different. If you want to look at it from a genetic point of view, then you can also say that South Korea is not a single ethnic country. However, although South Korea is not a mono-ethnic country, it is a single-nationality state. The race is a naturally occurring factor, but ethnicity is a product of human construction. As long as all South Koreans identify strongly with South Korean, turn the suppression of China and Japan into the foundation of identity, unite through common education & culture, compose a shared history, and make them believe, or at least pretending to think that they have a common ancestor and a shared history, Then the problem of inventing the South Korea nation was solved. Although the residents of the northern and southern parts of the Korean peninsula are still very different, but because of its rather small population, limited geographical area, and relatively simple situation in the international community, the process of nation invention will be straightforward, at least much more natural than China, which inherited the giant imperial heritage from the Qing Empire.

   

The problem with Japan is also relatively simple. Japan was very problematic when it still has a finger on the Asian continent and attempted to establish a pan-Asian international system. Japan’s deed to the Asian continent, as claimed by China and South Korea, is an imperialist invasion. But according to Japan, it is like this: in the face of the dominant Western culture, Asian countries have fallen one by one, Japan is the only country still left standing, and out of idealism, Japan reach out to its little Asian brothers, and spread the experience of Japan’s successful Meiji Restoration to the Asian continent, so that under the leadership and protection of Japan, the Asian continent could find a new road other than Western imperialism, and finally liberate the peoples of Asia. The Japanese are playing a leading role as a big brother, or we can say it is an international system of pan-Asianism. They hope that in addition to the Western-led international system, they can establish a different East Asian international system. This is the fundamental reason why Japan has reached deep into the Asian continent. From Japan's point of view, Manchuria and Mongolia are more in line with the Japanese ideals, they are willing to support the Japanese and the Meiji Restoration path, and fight against the West alongside Japan; but the Chiang Kai-shek’s Republic of China was terrible. It had betrayed the common ideal of the yellow people, followed the Western countries to fight against Japan, and ended up ruining the last chance for Asians to be liberated from the Western international system.

   

By the way, this is precisely how Russians are looking at the Poles. Pushkin himself was among such people when the War of Independence in Poland broke out; he scolded that the Poles were traitors to the Slavs. Because apparently, the European culture was in the position of strength. The Easterners and the Germans have completely surrendered to the European culture; the Russians are the only nation left standing. The Slavs rely on Russians. And the Poles, who are Slavs, have chosen to accept the European culture and became enforcers of the Europeans and traitors to the Slavs, they fought against the Russians, isn't is obvious that they are traitors? This is also how the Germans regard the Bohemians, and the Turks the Armenians.

   

So who's right? You can say that the poles are traitors to the Slavs. It is like saying that Demchugdongrub and Yoshiko Kawashima are traitors to the Han people. But the Poles can say that their leaders of those independent movements are their true national heroes, and the elite who followed the Russians are traitors to Polish nationalism. Who is right? If you are a Martian, I don't think you can conclude that who's right or wrong. The only thing you can say is that both sides have their reasons. If the independent people of Poland were finally victorious, then you can be confident that Piłsudski and Kościuszko are national heroes and that they opposed Russia and supported Poland; and the Polish elite, including the Polish king himself, who advocated the assimilation of Poland into Russia and the establishment of a Slavic community, are traitors to Poland. But what if Poland failed, and was conquered by Russia and the Soviet Union? Then the rights and wrongs have to be reversed. Just like current Chinese history textbooks, Polish history books will read that Piłsudski and Romuald Traugutt, just as Demchugdongrub and Yoshiko Kawashima, are traitors and to the great Slavic nation, and they sold the Slav people to the West. At this point, it's impossible to judge. If you make some judgment, it means that you already have an identity and that you have chosen a position, and your position determines your judgment. But if you do not belong to any party of the conflict, it is impossible to reach a completely accurate and fair conclusion.

   

The national construction in East Asia continued throughout the 20th century through bloody conflicts and had not yet been completely resolved. The reasons why is similar to that of Russia, Germany, and Turkey. In Germany and Turkey, small Germanism and small Turkishism have already prevailed: Overseas Germans and Turks are virtually non-existent; those whose identities are blurred, like Bohemia, has established a new identity. But in places like Russia, Iran, and China, national identities are still unclear. Some fringe places of the ancient Chinese civilization, like Korea and Japan, have defined their own independent identity. We can say that in the Han Dynasty, Japan was undoubtedly included in the Chinese civilization. The kings or chiefs of Japan, such as the pro-Whiyuga kings, by the standards of the Han Dynasty, the Wei & Jin Dynasties, the Six Dynasties, and Song, Qi, Liang and Chen Dynasties, were all tribute states of the Central Plains dynasties, namely the Luoyang or Jiankang dynasties. There is no significant difference between them and the borders of these dynasties. Places like North Korea and South Korea, if we use Tang Dynasty's standards, are undoubtedly members of the Chinese civilization. Although Turk and Central Asia may be part of Inner Asia or India, South Korea, and Siam are undoubtedly part of the Chinese culture. Until the Ming Dynasty, we can still say that Joseon is part of the Chinese civilization. But now, Japan and South Korea are inventing their history and reconstruct their national community. The same situation, through colonialism, happened in Vietnam. However, the border of the Qing Empire is still unclear.

   

Liang Qichao's ideas are embodied in a very paradoxical manner. Liang Qichao’s ideal was designed for the Qing Empire, the KMT once firmly opposed it during the revolutionary era and demanded that all ethnic groups in the north of the Great Wall be driven out. The Communist Party also firmly fought it during the revolution and firmly requested that all ethnic groups should be brought by the Soviet Union and establish independent states or Union Republics. Mao Zedong himself was the pioneer of the local independence movement with the enormous sympathy in Chinese history. When he was still young, he repeatedly supported the autonomy of Shanghai and Hunan and supported Taiwanese, Tibetans, Outer Mongolians in establishing their nations, republics and independent governments. Most of the inclinations for independence that appeared in China at the time had received his support. But after he took office, he also accepted the concept of Chinese nation that Liang Qichao had designed for the transformation of the Qing Empire and implemented construction of the Chinese nation that was very similar to Ottomanism.

   

This construction has been extended to the present and is reflected in the "national shame" education and the "Chinese patriotism" education in Chinese textbooks. Where is the problem with this kind of patriotic education? Like great-Russianism, great-Germanism, and Ottomanism, it will make it difficult for China to integrate into the international order in the future. Because this system contains too many heterogeneous groups, and it's difficult for it to establish a homogenized national group. Without the homogenized national group, there is no way for it to achieve democratization through the construction of national groups. What is the most significant flaw of great-Russianism? Once you reach democratization, before you could come up with a liberal and the democratic Great Republic of Russia, you would have created Estonian Independence Movement, Georgia Independence Movement, or the like. What's even worse is that you would find out that an independent Estonia would have a better democratic system than yours, because they are closer to European culture. If democracy is to be implemented in the Ottoman Empire, then it would surely find out an embarrassing truth that the residents of Croatia or Transylvania, if they could join Europe, would establish a better democratic system. If China is faced with the problem of democratization, no, before China is faced with the problem of democratization, you can already see that Hong Kong and Taiwan has performed better than you. However, at the same time of democratization, the reasons for the establishment of the national community was automatically created. As residents fight for democracy, they automatically form the concept of a secret community and demand the establishment of special national groups in Hong Kong and Taiwan. And this national group they want to re-invent cannot co-exist with Liang Qichao's Chinese nation. If you're going to achieve national democracy, then the same situation will undoubtedly appear in Xinjiang, Tibet, and may even appear in places like Guangdong and Northeastern China.

   

Even though these places do not have a clear local identity, once they are democratized, as long as the speed of political and economic evolution is uneven, this difference in interest will quickly turn into the gap in identity. For example, if you have poor democratic performance in Henan, but better performance in Taiwan, then the already established governments of Taiwan and Hong Kong would naturally act the same as Bohemia and Estonia's governments and feel that rather than staying in Moscow's or Vienna's empire and be held back by all the underdeveloped regions, it is better to establish a small independent state and build an alliance with the United States and Japan directly. If democracy is to be implemented in the future, the government of Shanghai or Ningbo will find that their government will, like Singapore and Hong Kong, be able to lead a quality life close to European standards with their fiscal revenue; but if they are to be united with Henan or Sichuan provinces, they would have to use large sums of money to support these poor provinces in the Mainland, to God knows when. If Estonians remain in the Soviet Union, they might not even be able to join the European Union until today. They are likely to be dragged down by Novosibirsk or Kazakhstan. But once they are separated from the Soviet Union, they can quickly enter Europe and pull themselves up to the level of Germany or Finland. The advantages and disadvantages of these two paths are undeniable.

   

As long as you still maintain a trans-ethnic imperial system, this contradiction can continue to subside; but once you implement democracy, then you will have to deal with the issue of the construction of a national community. The core issue of democracy is the construction of sovereigns. You need to find "the people" to implement democracy. But who are the people? Only a handful of countries, such as the United States, are blessed with a natural advantage. Its national construction was due to exceptional historical reasons and is therefore very easy. But even in the United States, it also has its African American and Indian issues. It is only that this issue is too marginal to affect the construction of their mainstream political tradition. But for areas like Ottoman, Persia, and China, this contradiction will too violent to overcome. Once you implement democracy, different regions would perform differently in the levels of development and the ability to self-govern. For the areas with substantial autonomy and a relatively developed economy, it is unavoidable that with the passage of time, one or two generations typically, special self-identities will be cultivated. Then, will you insist on maintaining the old imperial structure?

   

If you want to maintain the old system coercively, you will definitely damage the development of these advanced areas; if you do not preserve coercively, you will face a Putin-style embarrassing situation: Those who are willing to stay on your side are mainly less developed areas of the empire, and the relatively advanced areas all tend to leave. Let them, and you wouldn't be able to maintain the less developed regions. It is impossible for these small states that have split up to realize the dream of a unified Empire. They will undoubtedly join the existing Western international system as Westernized small states. Then, the entire vision that you set up in the era of Zhang Zhidong and Liang Qichao in the late Qing Dynasty, through the age of Chiang Kai-shek and Dai Jitao, which claims that the temporarily frustrated Oriental civilization that is under Western invasion will eventually revive, would be doomed to be lost entirely. If you promote democracy by conventional procedures, such an outcome would be inevitable. And if you want to lock in the historical path and avoid this kind of outcome, then you have to face a very embarrassing situation, that is, you will have to use the power of backward areas to drag advanced areas, and level everyone to a relatively backward position. In doing so, you can stop the developed areas from leaving the empire, but because you use the backward cultural norms to discipline the advanced areas, your overall culture will inevitably be dragged down.

   

This situation has historical precedents. In the past, when the Netherlands was a semi-independent state under an empire, Antwerp was more developed than Amsterdam. However, in the case of the Spanish regime strengthening its centralization, the semi-independent and semi-autonomous states of the lowland countries will face choices: either, you will remain in the imperial system and lose your original autonomy, and inevitably lose your bud of capitalism and economic advancement. In the end, you are dragged down to a level similar to that of the Spanish mainland; if you want to avoid this, you can act like the Netherlands, and simply become independent and turn semi-independence into complete independence. In this way, you become Amsterdam, and continue to develop your capitalism, and become an economically and politically advanced small state. Northern and southern Netherlands have made their choices respectively - saying that they "made choices" is wrong because a large part of their decision was due to the geopolitical and international situations and was mostly passive. It's not that you can always choose what you want. Anyway, the result was that since Antwerp in the south finally fell into the hands of a centralized absolute monarchy, it's initial sprouting of capitalism and the autonomy of the city-state was slowly eliminated. Antwerp was the economic center of Europe during the semi-independence period, but after being finally integrated by the Habsburg dynasty, it gradually degrades and eventually became a backward Catholic region; while Amsterdam was not initially an advanced region, but after independence, it attracted the outflow of capital, refugees, and talents from Antwerp, turned itself into an autonomous city-state, and eventually established the Republic of the Netherlands and became a capitalist country that we know now.

   

Which of these two options is more advantageous? It depends mainly on your values. I think that if your values are similar to the mainstream values promoted by the modern Chinese world, also known as the values instilled in the Huang Feihong and Huo Yuanjia martial arts films, that is, the Chinese nation is one, and the Chinese nation is to rise, you should choose Antwerp’s path, combined with the empire of the European continent, establish a mighty empire that would be enough to resist the capitalist-imperialist maritime civilization built by Britain and the Netherlands. Of course, in doing so, you have chosen the backward path. Or, you choose Amsterdam's path, which means that you will completely abandon the idea of the rising Chinese nation, the concept of Chiang Kai-shek and Liang Qichao, and reexamine Demchugdongrub, Manchukuo, Li Denghui and Chen Shui-bian, and see their effort as a kind of Dutch or Estonian endeavor to establish a new capitalist state system in East Asia. In this way, you are likely to develop a series of city-states similar to Singapore and Hong Kong along the coast of East Asia or establish a set of small capitalist national communities similar to the Netherlands and Estonia. But in doing so, you also have to face the choice. If you do this, you will inevitably destroy the legacy of the Qing Empire and the last opportunity for the resurrection of this imperial legacy, and turn the once possible Chinese nation, which can resemble the great Russian nation and the great Ottoman nation, into a shattered dream forever in history. The newly established nations, no matter how developed, advanced or democratic in their internal fairs, can be nothing more but an appendage in the Western international system. Poland will never replace the United States as the center of the international system. But if it becomes a part of the Slavonic empire, the overall Slavonic Empire, including Poland and Russia, may well become the match of the United States.

   

It's hard to say how should one make choices on this matter. But whatever path you choose, you need to lose some of the favorable factors in exchange for others. There is no path in the world that will allow you to take all the advantages: it cannot make you enjoy the free government and capitalist prosperity like in the Netherlands and Singapore and at the same time appreciate the vast amount of subjects and universal imperialism like the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire. You have to choose between the two. If you dream to be like Britain and the United States, both a super powerful empire and a free state, then I can safely say that this path does not exist. Even if it used to exist, this niche appeared at the dawn of history, and the English speaking people already occupied it during the crucial time window of capitalism. Therefore, the English-speaking people can establish a free system in their own country and implement imperial power overseas. And the challenger states that came later cannot have both: either you imitate Britain and the United States, build a small capitalist country, and become a part of the international system established by Britain and the United States; or if you want to challenge and develop a competitive international system, then you must create a continental system and an integrated framework based on transnationalism, transcendentalism, and bureaucratic authoritarianism. This kind of system will inevitably make it impossible for all its residents to enjoy autonomy and freedom in the capitalist sense.

   

Judging from the development of capitalism, the development of the national community and nationalities revolves around the different levels of development and extension of the capitalist system with the core of the United Kingdom and the United States. The means used to distinguish residents at various levels will be relied on in building small communities, and the small communities constructed by it can accurately reflect the different levels of these residents from the core of capitalism. But a vast empire can break through these levels through its despotic equality to break down the differences in these levels in a downward manner and reintegrate these small communities that have already been established into an empire. But this empire must also pay its prices. There is no such thing as a free lunch. The key is that after you've spent your price, you can't walk on one road and at the same time reap the benefits of another route.

   

Specifically speaking, the people in Shanghai cannot watch the grand military parade, enjoy the dream of a reviving great nation, and think that the Shanghai people should keep the money to themselves like the Singaporeans or Hong Kongers, and drive out all the refugees from Anhui and Henan provinces. You can't drive out refugees from Shandong, Henan, and Anhui. This is the price you must pay for enjoying the parade and the great Chinese nation. If Hong Kong chooses Singapore's path, you can indeed drive these unwanted people out, just as the Singaporeans drive out Malaysians or Indonesian Muslims, but you can now forget about the imperial dream. In any case, Hong Kongers should also feel fortunate because they still have the choice. Many places, I think, like Zhumadian or Lanzhou, had lost such option a long time ago.
