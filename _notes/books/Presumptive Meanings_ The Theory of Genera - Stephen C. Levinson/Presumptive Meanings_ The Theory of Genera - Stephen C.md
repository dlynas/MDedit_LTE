Atlas (in press) presents discussion of many outstanding issues. Although Horn 1989 is a difficult, if not always unhumorous, work dedicated to negation, it contains so many important observations on generalized implicature that it is a "must" for the dedicated pragmaticist: it is a goldmine, but be prepared to use your pick and shovel (and the excellent index).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The approach developed here is sketched in Levinson 1995a, which may be a useful introduction to this book (I have drawn on parts of that paper for chap. 1). Further applications of this particular system of interacting principles have been offered by Levinson (1987b, 1991) (which I have in part drawn on for chap. 4) and especially Hawkins (1991) and Huang (1991, 1994). I have tried to lay out a wide range of data because I feel the range of application of pragmatic principles has been underappreciatedindeed the generality of the neo-Gricean account is precisely what recommends it. (Much further grist for the pragmatic mill can be found in work on linguistic typology, especially Haiman's (1985a, 1985b) pioneering studies of iconicity in language.) The danger, on the other hand, is that many of the examples will be found to be underanalyzed, but I felt it was better to point (possibly with a wobbly finger) in the direction of many future dissertations than to withhold such directions in the interest of more scholarly reticence. My inadequacies, dear student, are your opportunities!\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Any intellectual program is often best understood by glancing at the rival accounts. An alternative approach with much, if not more, currency is given by Sperber and Wilson (1986), perhaps best approached though the _Behavioral and Brain Sciences_ article with attendant commentary (Sperber and Wilson 1987; see also Blakemore 1992). Sperber and Wilson attempt to capture all implicatural phenomena with a single dualistic principle but are especially interested in particularized conversational implicatures. The second edition of _Relevance_ (Sperber and Wilson 1995) contains a very useful bibliographical update keyed to the new "postface."

However, work by Kempson (1986), Carston (1988), and others attempts to reduce generalized conversational implicatures to particularized ones using this principle of Relevance. A direct attack from this angle on my approach (of an earlier vintage) may be found in Carston 1995; my own criticisms of Relevance Theory can be found in Levinson 1989, which I have not repeated here. Another direct attack, partly from a Relevance Theory perspective, is directed at my treatment of anaphora (here enlarged in chap. 4) by Ariel (1994), although I believe she's mistaken the target. Another approach, never fully developed but still much presupposed in formal semantics, involves Lewis's concept of accommodation (see Thomason 1990). Situation semantics (Barwise and Perry 1983) at one time looked set to swallow within semantics many of the phenomena discussed here, but again, no explicit account has been published. A more recent kind of reductionist approach, based on extended versions of discourse semantics, has been proposed by van Kuppevelt (1996) and Scharten (1997). There is a fresh interest in implicature in computational and artificial intelligence circles; a good idea of what is going on can be got from glancing at the proceedings of the 1996 AAAI symposium on implicature (see also Hobbs, Stickel, Appelt, and Martin 1990).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Finally, there are a number of interesting recent dissertations on implicature to which the interested reader should refer.

Further bibliographical leads have been given throughout on the various topics covered.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

As an undergraduate I was trained by an ardent structuralist anthropologist, Edmund Leach, and it was at Berkeley as a graduate student that, in reaction to structuralism, I found Paul Grice's ideas about the derivative nature of conventional meaning quite revolutionary. His central idea, that "every artificial or non-iconic system is founded upon an antecedent iconic system" of representation and communication (Grice 1989: 358), is still too radical for most current thinking in linguistics and philosophy. This book explores one intriguing margin between the noniconic and the iconic systems, and it tries to establish in detail one way in which the noniconic systems trade on the iconic background. Those who share Grice's vision think that language will never be understood solely from the inside: linguistic communication is not explained by a direct form-meaning mapping but only by taking into account the intentional and inferential and indeed interactional umbrella (see, e.g., Sperber and Wilson 1986; Clark 1996).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|At Berkeley in the early 1970s, Grice's ideas were being explored all around me: in sociolinguistics by John Gumperz, in grammar and meaning by George and Robin Lakoff, in philosophy by John Searle and Stephen Schiffer, and of course, there was Grice himself. Subsequently, Larry Horn, Jerrold Sadock and others in the States, and Gerald Gazdar, Ruth Kempson, and Deirdre Wilson in the U.K. rescued the crucial ideas from the collapse of Generative Semantics. Gerald Gazdar's ideas of that vintage (later published as Gazdar 1979) play a rather special role in this work, and I learned a great deal from him, reflected in my textbook of pragmatics (1983). After diversions in anthropological linguistics, a paper by Larry Horn (1984) brought the whole subject back to life for me and made me rethink the typology of implicatures, and this led to the paper (1987a, given at Viareggio, 1985) where I first explored the tripartite\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Meanwhile, work by Dan Sperber, Deirdre Wilson, Ruth Kempson, and associates has spurred and goaded me into some response; while at about the same time the opportunity to teach with Larry Horn at the Linguistics Institute at Stanford in 1987 greatly increased both my confidence and competence in this area, and it was there that I first adumbrated all the themes to be found in this book. That opportunity was arranged by Ivan Sag, with whom I have discussed at length on the issues in chapter 3 (we had indeed hoped to pursue some of these issues together). A year at Stanford followed, where the Linguistics Department and CSLI provided ideal conditions for discussion of many pertinent themes, and I taught a graduate course on the material in this book, where I received much helpful feedback. Herb Clark, Ray Perrault, Jerry Hobbs, and other participants in the CSLI implicature group forced me to clarify my ideas by describing their own alternative ones. Also at CSLI, conversations with Ivan Sag, Stan Peters, Craige Roberts, Nirit Kadmon, and David Perlmutter were important; and a seminar on abduction organized by Jerry Hobbs and Doug Edwards at SRI helped me understand work on the theory of inference in AI. Back in Cambridge, Yan Huang once again made me rethink my pragmatic reduction of the Binding Conditions (I had already been unsettled by discussions with Ivan Sag and K. Mohanan at Stanford, and thus recalled an earlier conversation with Ann Farmer and Robert Harnsh on the Viareggio beach). An invitation to give the Nijmegen Lectures in December 1988 gave me the opportunity to condense a meandering manuscript and gave me some valuable audience response; a workshop led by Rob van der Sandt was also most helpful. At that point, the book still lacked the survey in chapter 2, but I was given the unrefusable opportunity by the Max Planck Society to pursue a quite different line of work (see, e.g., Levinson 1996), which has proved allconsuming for many years. In the meantime, I had expected others to fill the gap. This didn't happen. The need for a book of this kind remained. Encouraged by Max Planck colleagues and fellow pragmaticists, I determined at last to recast the manuscript in line with current developments. I hope that I have succeeded in acknowledging most of the recent important contributions, but the canvas is large.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Throughout all these wanderings through the thickets of meaning, Jay Atlas has been a constant guide over 15 years; chapter 3 finds me following him in a direction I managed to resist for 10 yearssomehow I had to\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Utterance-type meanings are matters of preferred interpretationsthe presumptive meanings of the title of this bookwhich are carried by the structure of utterances, given the structure of the language, and not by virtue of the particular contexts of utterance. In certain ways, the ideas in this book are conservative, and the majority of them are not new (the debt to early work by Atlas, Harnish, Horn, and Gazdar will be particularly evident). But these ideas are in danger of being eclipsed and forgotten before their promise has been properly appreciated, so in the repetition of old information I remain unapologetic. Part of the motive of the book is therefore to collect these previous ideas and data together in one place, so that the systematicity of the observations can be directly judged and their implications properly appreciated. In other respects, however, the ideas presented here extend the old ideas just far enough for us to see that they are potentially quite explosive: they threaten many of the orthodoxies about meaning and form in the language sciences.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|I have tried to avoid technicalities. In part, this is because half a dozen years interposed between the first and second drafts of this manuscript, and this time revealed to me the passing nature of many of the formalisms and formal theories to which the material in this book could be related.2 The observations in this book seem to have a genuine independence from such passing clouds, and so it seems worthwhile to detach them from the technicalities. Nevertheless, I suppose it is inevitable that there will be passages that are rather hard going.

We interpret this sketch instantly and effortlessly as a gathering of people before a structure, probably a gateway; the people are listening to a single declaiming figure in the center. You and I may see slightly different details adumbrated: for me, the declaiming character has a beard, and the man in the foreground to the left a hat, and the sitting figures seem female, but you may have your own interpretations. Knowing something about Rembrandt's times and the subjects he was fond of, we can be fairly sure this is Christ telling parables to a crowd before a city gate. But all this is a miracle, for there is little detailed information in the lines or the shading (such as there is). Every line is a mere suggestion; some lines seem to make no sense except as flourishes of the pen, but yet we struggle to find some sense within them (see for example, the three little flourishes by Christ's right "hand," which suggest perhaps the heads of further listeners). So here's the miracle: from a merest, sketchiest squiggle of lines, you and I converge to find the adumbration of a coherent scene (that we may diverge, according to fantasy and our knowledge of art history, is of course less miraculous).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|How is it possible? Although the theory of vision is considerably more advanced than the theory of the language capacity, current knowledge cannot really explain our understanding of visual information as "degraded" or physically impoverished as this (but see Changeux 1994). What we do know is that there is tremendous visual sensitivity to outlines and shading and that we can use these (although normally reinforced by multiple further sources of information like parallax, stereopsis, color, texture, and reflection) to extract three-dimensional models out of two-dimensional retinal arrays. Somehow, then, Rembrandt is exploiting the fact that we are "built" to see three-dimensional scenes in squiggles on a plane surface. He is also relying of course on cultural conventions about how to represent scenes in drawings, using the post-Renaissance preference for temporal instantaneousness and correct perspective, as opposed to, for example, the Central Australian cultural conventions in drawing a bird's-eye view from above, which represents entire episodes over time. Another important ingredient is that the sketch is presented as a representation, not, say, as scratch marks on linoleum, and as a result, there is some kind of compact between sketcher and viewer that warrants the\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

An utterance is not, as it were, a veridical model or "snapshot" of the scene it describes, although much talk of truth conditions might lead one to suppose the contrary (the work of the early Wittgenstein explored this initially attractive idea, which has never been quite washed out of our thinking since). Rather, an utterance is just as sketchy as the Rembrandt drawing. Given the way we are built and the cultural conventions that specify a particular language and its appropriate deployment, we are inexorably led, at least in most cases, to a common understanding (and, as in the Rembrandt sketch, we even have a clear sense of where we may diverge). It is the apparently deterministic nature of this process that underlines the miracle. A sentence like "It will be ready soon" is indeed sketchy like the Rembrandt drawing: _it_ may refer to anything under the sun as long as it is not a human adult, _will be_ specifies an infinite series of future temporal spans, and _ready_ might be interpreted as 'cooked' (as when the utterance is a response to the question "When is supper?") or 'surfaced' (as in response to "When will the motorway be open?") or 'refuelled' (in response to "When does the flight leave?"). And clearly, _soon_ can take on quite different values in the context of serving a meal or finishing a doctoral dissertation. But in each of these different contexts, "It will be ready soon" has its appropriate and apparently determinate interpretation effortlessly delivered to us.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|How? That is the question that a theory of utterance comprehension has to answer. As with the visual processes behind the interpretation of the Rembrandt sketch, let us confess that we don't really have the faintest idea how it works. First principles even seem to suggest that the recovery of a speaker's intentions on the basis of what he has said is in principle impossible (Levinson 1995b). 3 Books like those by Sperber and Wilson (1986) or Atlas (1989) or Horn (1989), or the present effort, which attempt to spell out some of the pragmatic processes involved, are pretty much stabs in the dark. What I have tried to do in this book is detach a little part of this problem and argue that there must be powerful heuristics that give us preferred interpretations without too much calculation of such matters as speakers' intentions, encyclopedic knowledge of the domain being talked about, or calculations of others' mental processes. Such preferred interpretations may be overridden by, and are certainly supplemented with, calculations of just this complex kind.

Somehow this must have some general correlation with the speaker's communicative intention. I do not think that the Sperber and Wilson framework can offer an account of the phenomena discussed in this book, precisely because the inferences in question are relatively invariant over changes in context and background assumptions, despite being defeasible (i.e., they do not go through in the presence of contrary assumptions). It is this relative invariance that gives these inferences their _linguistic_ importance, as systematic feeders to semantic processes and language change, and I think the rich observations that have been collected by Horn (1972, 1989) and others need to be preserved. Explicit processing considerations do not enter the framework offered here, but they do form part of the background, for the character of the inferences in question as default inferences can, I think, be understood best against the background of cognitive processing. The evidence, so far as it goes, from the psycholinguistic literature is that hypotheses about meaning are entertained by the hearer incrementallyas the words come in, as it were. It seems unlikely that this could be achieved without rich heuristics, because there will be early moments in utterance processing where propositional or clausal information for inferencing is simply not yet available. For this reason, the Sperber and Wilson framework is not psycholinguistically plausible, or at least it is not plausible for early moments in utterance processing. In contrast, some of the heuristics to be offered here can proceed on a word-by-word basisfor example, a scalar quantifier like _some_ will, as I will show, already invoke default enrichments before the predicate is available.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Close observers of this line of thinking have noticed that it constitutes a renaissance of information-theoretic ideas:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|These notions went out of fashion in theoretical linguisticsand I think this is the right way to put itwhen Chomsky (1956, 1959, etc.) criticized (correctly) their association with radical, _tabula rasa,_ behaviourism and finite-state models of language acquisition and of grammaticality.

The central background fact, an information-theoretic observation, is that human speech encoding is relatively very slow: the actual process of phonetic articulation is a bottleneck in a system that can otherwise run about four times faster (a point taken up in chap. 1). The pressures that this exerts on language are easy to seefor example, the pressure for frequent words to be reduced, as has been long documented (e.g., by Zipf 1949). Zipf (and, more recently, Horn 1984, 1989) saw the resulting pattern as a balance between two forces: a speaker's desire for economy and an auditor's need for sufficient information. This tension, real enough, is not the focus of the current work. Instead, I assume a kind of coincidence of interests, treating linguistic communication as a "game of pure coordination" in the game-theoretic sense of Schelling (1960), a picture I think presupposed by Grice (1957): the speaker is trying to find an economical means of invoking specific ideas in the hearer, knowing that the hearer has exactly this expectation. Now, the solution to the encoding bottleneck, I suggest, is just this: let not only the content but also the metalinguistic properties of the utterance (e.g., its form) carry the message. Or, find a way to piggyback meaning on top of the meaning.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|How can this be piggybacking be achieved? Only by utilizing the form, the structure, and the pattern of choices within the utterance to signal the extra information beyond the meanings of its constituents. So, here I propose just three simple heuristics, which will serve to amplify utterance content:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|1.

In the body of the book, especially in chapter 2, many examples will be given that indicate the more precise directions in which these constraints on interpretation must be formulated. The essential point here is that no special, exotic, hermeneutic principles are being proposed: metalinguistic scrutiny by the addressee of utterance form, including the consideration of salient alternates, will be sufficient to amplify the content of utterances and ease the pressure on the encoding bottleneck; knowing which, the speaker is bound to conform to the same heuristics.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Approaches to meaning are so diverse and fractionated that it may help the reader to know where the writer stands on a wider range of issues than are directly addressed in this book.

The distinction between semantics and pragmatics is one of a number of essential distinctions in the study of meaning; it may be that in the long run the distinction will dissolve into a larger set of distinctions, but nothing is gained by lumping in our attempt to understand human communication.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|2. Semantics is not to be confused with "conceptual structure" or the "language of thought"; the semantics of a language is a language-specific phenomenon, and the mapping into a "language of thought," a nontrivial relation between nonisomorphic structures (Levinson 1997).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|3. Aspects of semantic content (usually only when enriched by pragmatic specifications) can be specified by the apparatus of a recursive truth definition, but this is unlikely to have a direct cognitive counterpart. Consider the analogy to vision: we can objectively specify the relation between the world that is viewed and the signals reaching the visual cortex, and compare the subjective visual experience. But this psychophysical mapping is not always truth-preserving: there are numerous conditions under which we see things that do not exist, fail to see things that do, and so onthe stock of illusions that psychophysicists take as a central part of their job to explain. Similarly, truth-conditional semantics viewed in the realist wayas a direct veridical mapping of semantic structures onto states of affairs (bypassing the head as it were)is useful as a yardstick of human performance. Something _like_ this is what the cognitive processes must do, but as in the case of visual illusions, they may fail to do so, and _how_ they generally do so will be unrelated to the machinery of truth-\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

So we can have our cake and eat it, too: we can use the insights of truth-conditional semantics without buying Realism, and without caring that it obviously fails to meet any criteria for adequacy as a cognitive model. It is a bit like buying a pair of shoes: we are glad that the salesperson can measure our feet and get the size roughly right, but in the end, it's a subjective question whether the shoes fit.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|4. There is no algorithm that, given a syntactic string in a language, cranks out its unique logical form or semantic structure. The view that there _is_ such an algorithm forms the basis of much linguistic theorizing, from Montague to Chomsky's most recent views. But it is patently absurd to hold such a view. First, there is the enormous range of ambiguities in natural language (requiring at least a one-to-many correspondence). Second, syntactic structures may actually be indeterminate in certain respects (Matthews 1981: 1721). Third, pragmatic resolution is crucial before semantic interpretation or the assignment of semantic structure: nobody disputes the role of deixis here, but there are many other aspects of pragmatic resolution from the determination of anaphoric reference to the assignment of scope. The overall picture sketched by Sadock (1991) or Jackendoff (1997) is here at least correct: phonology, syntax, and semantics are areas each with their own generative capacities, and there are significant mismatches between the structural strings in each representation that, in the end, come to be associated with one another. What puts them into association with one another are correspondence rules or processes, which are not deterministic in character. Jackendoff suggests that the picture with lexical items is not in principle different: they are correspondences across phonological, syntactic, and semantic representations, but the correspondences may be partial and not one to one (compare idioms, or the mismatch between phonological and syntactic words).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|5. Insofar as we can get from syntactic structures and lexical material directly to a semantic representation (which in the most part, I argue, we cannot), then such semantic representations are only partially specified; templates of partial information far too unspecified to determine truth conditions.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|6. The overall role that pragmatics plays in such a picture is fundamentally different from that sketched in the textbooks (including mine of 1983). There is no scheme of the kind that syntactic structures are mapped onto semantic structures which themselves represent full-fledged propositions, these semantic structures being the input into pragmatics, which yields additional inferences or restrictions on meaning. Rather, pragmatic\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

The distinction between semantics and pragmatics was construed in the standard theory as the distinction between sentence-meaning and utterance-meaning, with the output of the semantics being the input to the pragmatics. For reasons detailed at length in chapter 3, this cannot be right. Instead, I argue, we should stop thinking of the distinction in terms of levels of representation. Instead, we should think about both semantics and pragmatics as being component processes that offer their own distinctive contributions to a single level of representation. The processes remain distinct in kind, and thus the distinction between semantics and pragmatics must be retained.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|This new view of the architecture of a theory of meaning is one of the explosive consequences, mentioned at the beginning, of careful observations about the apparently minor phenomena of preferred interpretations.

Chapter 2 offers a catalog of these phenomena in terms of three simple neo-Gricean principles, and sketches their interaction. The reader will find many familiar facts here assembled in perhaps unfamiliar ways. A catalog may make tedious reading, but I think there is no other place where the student can find all these phenomena laid out, and it is important for the thesis of this book that the theory of preferred interpretations is seen to have perfectly general application.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|This then is the structure of the book: a chapter that introduces the idea of presumptive meanings, a chapter that lays out many diverse examples and a scheme that organizes them, a chapter that explores the consequences for theories of semantics, and a fourth that explores the implications for syntax.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

A generalized implicature is, in effect, a default inference, one that captures our intuitions about a preferred or normal interpretation. The notion of a preferred interpretation is not one that has any special currency in the theory of language at the present time. Indeed, it is a notion that is currently either ignored or subject to virulent attack by some pragmaticists, psycholinguists, and workers in artificial intelligence. In defense of this notion, I develop a number of arguments both positive and negative.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|First, looking back at Grice's program, we see that such a notion (contrary to some recent commentary) was central to his concerns; and those concerns, whatever the differences in modern implementation, seem perfectly current today. Second, I diagnose that one source of the current theoretical resistance to GCIs is a simplistic overall scheme for a theory of communication, within which there is no place for a theory of preferred interpretation. I argue that there is overwhelming evidence for the need for such a theory, evidence much broader than that for GCIs themselves, and consequently that our overall scheme must provide a niche of an appropriate sort in any case. When this is appreciated, much of the resistance to GCIs should wither away.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Next, I produce an argument from design, to the effect that a system of preferred interpretation would be much too effective a device in communication for any naturally evolved system of communication to fail to have developed such a thing. At this point, I digress to introduce the typology of GCIs that will be central to the book.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

I argue that we need to address this question in the context of the different kinds of nonmonotonic reasoning systems that have recently been developed. Although significant puzzles remain, these recent developments do offer some reassurance that formal models of default reasoning are not beyond our reach and thus that some light can be thrown from that direction on the notion of a preferred or default interpretation. (Whether these systems are essential to a proper account of default intepretations in language use is another matter, because default inferences in language may arise because of the very nature of communication.)\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|I turn next to some recent accounts of implicature that leave no room for a notion of a generalized implicature: Sperber and Wilson's (1986, 1995) Relevance theory, and the theories of implicature based on Lewis's (1979) notion of "accommodation" that have been developed by Hobbs (1987) and Thomason (1990). According to these theories, all implicatures are a matter of nonce (i.e., once-off) inference to the best interpretation (however that is defined), given the full richness of background presumptions. These theories, I argue, simply cannot handle the phenomena that are focal to a theory of GCIs.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|As a final argument in favor of the concept of the GCI, I repeat Horn's observations that certain kinds of GCI systematically block lexicalization of certain concepts.

First, a theory of communication has as its target the full scope of Grice's (1957) _nonnatural meaning_ (meaningnn), where this constitutes communicational effects that fall under a special kind of complex reflexive intention.

But here, the point is that Grice argued that conversational implicatures come about on the basis of the assumption that the maxims are being preserved, at least at some fundamental level. He assumed that we can distinguish between what a speaker has said by virtue of the conventional meaning of the words or sentence (Grice 1989: 25, 8788, 120121) and what a speaker conversationally implicates by saying those words.

I also use the symbol +> to signify "conversationally implicates"; more precisely, I use the convention: "S" +> 'p' to signify 'the utterance of the sentence S would (normally, or in the context sketched) conversationally implicate that the speaker knows (or believes or thinks likely) the proposition p.'\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Grice (1975: 56f) provides only the following characterization of the distinction between particularized and generalized conversational implicatures (or PCIs vs. GCIs): a PCI from saying _p_ would "leave no room for the idea that an implicature of this sort is NORMALLY carried by saying that _p_"; whereas in the case of a GCI "one can say that the use of a certain form of words in an utterance would normally (in the ABSENCE of special circumstances) carry such & such an implicature" (emphasis in the original). 3 Grice's intention here is clear enough although his own discussion lacks detail; the following informal formulation captures, I think, the intention:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(3) _The distinction between PCIs and GCIs_\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|a.

These PCIs may be attributed to the maxim of Relevance (or Relation), construed as a principle of attending to interlocutors' goals or plans (Holdcroft 1987, Levinson 1987a, Thomason 1990). 4 But in both contexts there is also a shared inferencenamely, that not all of the guests are in the process of leaving. This inference has an entirely general currency: any statement of the form "Some x are G" will, other things being equal, have the default interpretation 'Not all x are G'. One might be tempted to think about this as part of the meaning of _some,_ but the semantic compatibility of _Some, but not all, x are G_ seems to rule out such an explanation. It is this sort of inference that, by virtue of its prevalence and its lack of salience, has the closest connection to linguistic analysis and misanalysis and that is the focus of this book.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Grice's own treatment of the distinction between generalized and particularized implicatures is unfortunately not extended. In the immediate context of a discussion of the distinction, Grice provides only one, none too clear, example (1975: 56, 1989: 37), viz. the inference from the indefinite article to the assumption that the speaker is not in a position to be specific.

Grice notes than an expression of the form _an X_ may sometimes carry the reverse implicature in certain cases: for example, "I cut a finger" implicates 'I cut my finger' because it would require rather special assumptions to make plausible an interpretation where S cut someone else's finger but the identity of the victim was unknown or irrelevant (perhaps two manicurists might so talk!).

Grice was interested in the whole phenomenon of implicature largely because it promised an account of the generally associated but defeasible inferences that rise from the use of the logical connectives.6 And he was particularly interested in the generalized implicatures, just because they are hard to distinguish from semantical or conventional content: "noncontroversial examples are perhaps hard to find, since it is all too easy to treat a generalized conversational implicature as if it were a conventional implicature" (1989: 37). Elsewhere, he explained:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|I also distinguished . . . particular conversational implicatures that depended on particular contextual features . . . and ones that I thought of as relatively general which I called GENERALIZED IMPLICATURES. These are the ones that seem to me to be more controversial and at the same time more valuable for philosophical purposes, because they will be the implicatures that would be carried (other things being equal) by any utterance of a certain form, though, as with all implicatures, they are not to be represented as part of the conventional meaning of the words or forms in question. And I thought that this notion of a GENERALIZED conversational implicature might be used to deal with a variety of problems, particularly in philosophical logic, but also in other areas. In these areas there seemed to me to be quite good grounds for suspecting that some people have made the mistake of taking as part of the conventional meaning of some form of expression what was really not part of its conventional meaning, but was rather a nonconventional implication which would normally be carried, except in special circumstances. It is difficult to find noncontroversial cases just because, if this mistake has been committed, it has been committed on such a wide scale.

Thus it may be possible to maintain a relatively simple logical analysis of the meaning of the connectives, explaining the systematic divergence in ordinary usage as due to _generalized_ conversational implicatures. It is the fact that the inferences _normally_ accompany the connectives that gives rise to the temptation to view them as part of the coded content, with all the analytical mistakes that would follow. It is this normal, general, default tendency of interpretation that makes it nonobvious that what we are dealing with here is mere pragmatic inference. Thus the whole line of argument only has force if sense can be made of the notion of a generalized conversational implicature. Grice saw this kind of analysis as having general application to lexical meaning: he proposed (1989: 4748) a modified Occam's razor to the effect that "senses are not to be muliplied beyond necessity" and suggested instead that we should always prefer an analysis where a word has "a less restrictive rather than a more restrictive meaning," where the more restrictive interpretations can be achieved by "a superimposed implicature."\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|In modern GCI theory, the connectives are treated rather differently (I sketch this later); in particular, the maxims of Quantity are utilized rather than the second maxim of Quality.

In trying to understand the place of GCIs in a theory of communication, it is essential to make these issues explicit.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|I believe that Grice was essentially correct in thinking of meaning as a composite notion; that is to say, he correctly considered that the full import of an utterance could only be captured by distinguishing many different kinds of contenteven the coded content was divided between "the said" and "the conventionally implicated" (and later he added "the presupposed"), whereas the inferred content was divisible between particularized and generalized implicatures and perhaps other kinds of inference altogether. I believe that this recognition of the heterogeneous nature of meaning marked a fundamental advance in the theory of meaningbut others of a holistic temperament (e.g., as in so-called cognitive linguistics) consider the very variety of proposed mechanisms a sign of premature failure. We can happily concede the favoring of parsimonious explanatory principles where they seem potentially sufficient, but meaning (conceived broadly as the full scope of meaningnn) is quite clearly not a unitary field but rather one involving cognitive principles, knowledge factors, and interactional principles, and no doubt much besides. At a time when we are happy to consider that some apparently unitary field like the heart of grammar is best treated as the outcome of distinct modules of grammatical principles, we ought surely to be willing to consider that pragmatic inference is the outcome of a set of rather different kinds of pragmatic principles.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|In the composite theory of meaning, the theory of GCIs plays just a small role in a general theory of communication.

Instead it attempts to account for one relatively small area of pragmatic inference. The theoretical importance of that area derives from the generalized, stable nature of such inferences that consequently have much closer interactions with the stable body of rules of formation and construal that form a grammatical system. The point being emphasized is that a theory of GCIs has to be supplemented with a theory of PCIs that will have at least as much, and possibly considerably more, importance to a general theory of communication. It is just to _linguistic_ theory that GCIs have an unparalleled import.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The overall picture of a general theory of communication that emerges is rather different from the standard picture. Although at the present time there could hardly be said to be a general theory of communication, there is nevertheless a prevailing assumption. According to the standard line (more often presupposed than justified), there are just two levels to a theory of communication: a level of sentence-meaning (to be explicated by the theory of grammar in the large sense) and a level of speaker-meaning (to be explicated by a theory of pragmatics, perhaps centrally employing Grice's notion of meaningnn). 10 (I use the term "layer" or "level" only to indicate distinct categories of phenomena; whether these indicate distinct levels of representation or successive stages of processing is a theory-dependent matter, which as I show in chap. 3 is by no means simple.) Speaker-meaning, or utterance-token-meaning, will be a matter of the actual nonce or once-off inferences made in actual contexts by actual recipients with all of their rich particularities. This view, although parsimonious, is surely inadequate, indeed potentially pernicious, because it underestimates the regularity, recurrence, and systematicity of many kinds of pragmatic inferences.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|What it omits is a third layer, what we may call the level of _statement_-or _utterance-meaning_ (see Atlas 1989: 34), or, as I will prefer below, _utterance-type-meaning._ This third layer is a level of systematic pragmatic inference based _not_ on direct computations about speaker-intentions but rather on general expectations about how language is normally used. These expectations give rise to presumptions, default inferences, about both content and force; and it is at this level (if at all) that we can sensibly\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

It is also at this level, naturally, that we can expect the systematicity of inference that might be deeply interconnected to linguistic structure and meaning, to the extent that it can become problematical to decide which phenomena should be rendered unto semantic theory and which unto pragmatics (q.v. the long-standing disputes about the semantic or pragmatic status of illocutionary force and presupposition).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The supposition of this third, intermediate layer in a theory of communication is nothing new. Austin (1962: 100ff), for example, clearly had something of this kind in mind when he proposed the three-way distinction between locutionary, illocutionary, and perlocutionary acts. The locutionary level corresponds to the level of sentence-meaning, the illocutionary to our intermediate layer formed of conventions or habits of use, and the perlocutionary (partly) to the level of speaker-meaning (i.e., the speaker's intentions to get the addressee to believe or do something as consequences of the utterance). 11 Other theorists have energetically tried to defend the notion of a _convention of use_ to be distinguished from a _convention of language;_ for example, such a distinction seems essential if we are to retain the idea that indirect speech acts are both partially conventional and inferentially motivated (Searle 1975; see also Bach and Harnish 1979: 192202 on _standardization_ as opposed to _conventionalization_ of a nonliteral use). Without admitting the existence of such an intermediate layer, how are we to explain the use of routine formulae (like _Good luck, Bless you, See you later_) which although meaning what they literally mean simultaneously perform habitual everyday rituals (Morgan 1978)? Why is it that I can introduce myself with _My name is Steve,_ but not _I was given the name Steve;_ that I can express sympathy with you with _I am sorry_ but not conventionally with _That saddens me;_ that I express outrage with _Really!_ but not with _In truth!;_ that I can say _I am delighted to meet you_ but not idiomatically _I am gratified to meet you;_ that I can choose a pastry by saying _I'd like that one_ but not _I'd admire that one,_ and so on. And to every specification of proper usage there tends to be a corresponding restriction on interpretation (Levinson 1979). There is a great body of language lore here, beyond knowledge of grammar and semantics, extensively studied of course by traditional rhetoric, the ethnography of speaking, and students of translation and second language learning.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

GCI theory offers a systematic account of why, for example, saying "See you on Tuesday" when tomorrow is Tuesday would suggest not seeing you tomorrow, or why saying "Some of my colleagues are competent" would suggest that not all of them are, and so on, matching a way of putting things with a favored interpretation in each case. The theory thus belongs to the intermediate level of a theory of communication, the layer of utterance(-type)-meaning.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|One question that arises is whether GCIs are just the same things as other kinds of pragmatic inference that might belong to this level. First, there are perhaps more general kinds of inference that might subsume the GCIs and that also lie between the conventions of language on the one hand and the full-blown nonce inference to speaker-meaning on the other. For example, Bach has proposed the idea of a standardized inference which "shortcircuits the steps of the inferences, both as intended by the speaker and as carried through by the listener" (Bach 1975: 235, 1995). 12 Such inferences go through by default, without full calculation. But Bach's notion relies on compression by precedent (1995: 685), and GCIs, on my conception at least, are generative, driven by general heuristics and and not dependent on routinization. Second, there are more specific notions which at first blush one might want to equate with GCIs but shouldn't. One of these, the notion of short-circuited implicature (Brown and Levinson 1987 [1978]: 290, n. 35; Morgan 1978; Horn and Bayer 1984), has been developed to handle a very specific phenomenon, also arising from routinization, whereby utterances acquire morphosyntactic markers of their implicated content (examples are indirect speech acts and Neg-raising constructions; see chap. 2). Finally, various theorists have argued that not every kind of inference driven by Gricean reasoning is an implicature proper: it is variously an explicature (Sperber and Wilson 1986) or an impliciture (Bach 1994), and it may be thought that GCIs belong to one of these categories. These are essentially conceived of as a fleshing out of what was expressed (thus utterances only have one of them, but they may have many GCIs). I argue against this equation in\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Nevertheless, that layer is constantly under attack by reductionists seeking to assimilate it either to the level of sentence-meaning or to the level of speaker-meaning; thus, for example, in the case of GCIs, Kamp, Peters, Kempson, van Kuppevelt, and others have all suggested that they should be in effect semanticized, whereas Sperber and Wilson and artificial intelligence local-pragmatics theorists have presumed that on the contrary they should be assimilated to matters of nonce inference at the level of speaker-intention. But GCIs are not going to reduce so easily in either direction, for they sit midway, systematically influencing grammar and semantics on the one hand and speaker-meaning on the other.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|There is another way of course to make these distinctions, by invoking the type/token distinction. 13 On the two-leveled theory of communication we have a theory of sentence-meaning, which is a theory of the meaning of sentence-types rather than sentence-tokens,14 on the one hand, and a theory of speaker- or utterance-meaning, which is a theory of utterancetoken rather than utterance-type meaning, on the other. The theory of utterance-meaning is a theory of utterance-token meaning because theorists of this ilk conceive of speaker-meaning as a matter of nonce inference to the best interpretation taking all the particularities of the context into account. Now, from the point of view of a three-leveled theory of meaning, we need an additional distinction between utterance-token meaning and utterance-type meaning: the intermediate level is the level at which generalizations about whole classes of utterances (utterance-types) must reside. Thus GCI theory is one kind of theory about utterance-type meaning.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Reductionists, if they are willing to countenance the idea of a preferred interpretation or an utterance-type meaning at all, might propose that the phenomena can in fact be explained in terms of the structure of contexts. Faced for example with the tendency to read _John has three children_ as 'John has exactly three children', an explanation might be offered in terms of nonce speaker-meaning together with a general preponderance of contexts in which absolute cardinality is relevant (Kempson (1986) perhaps\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Thus we could hold onto the idea that all inferences are constructed _de novo_ without reference to a default rule or a preferred interpretation, by hypothesizing that the background premises remain sufficiently constant to yield the observable bias in interpretations. It may not be easy to distinguish between this view and a theory of default interpretations, especially because such a contextual bias might itself be sufficient to engender a mental counterpart, a default rule of inference. The material difference would be that instead of having two different kinds of inference and one kind of context (as in GCI theory, where we must distinguish default GCIs from nonce PCIs), we will have one kind of inference and two kinds of context, the default context and the fully particular nonce context (amounting to a reduction of GCIs to PCIs).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|My own view is that a theory of preferred interpretations is at least as plausible and much more workable; I am simply not sanguine about the possibilities of a theory of contexts able to predict the bias in interpretations in the same straightforward way. Moreover, on the theory that is advanced in this book, it is the choice of utterance-form and content, in line with perfectly general principles, that triggers the inferences in question. Such general patterns, in which, for example, marked forms suggest marked extensions, can't come out of a theory of contextual biases alone. A theory of favored contexts would have to be married to a theory of the correlation of utterance-form to kinds of contexts (some suggestions can be found in Zipf 1949). The present theory presumes such a rough correlation but goes beyond it, in that it proposes that speakers exploit such correlations for semiotic purposes.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Now it may be thought that for quite different reasons the notion of utterance-type meaning would force us into a theory of context-types. The argument would be that if an utterance is construed, as it is classically, as a sentence-context pair, the only way to abstract a type out of such a token would be to generalize over context-types. 15 But we may need to change the classical analysis of the utterance anyway. The need for such a change emerges fairly clearly from recent work in semantics; for example, in both DRT and Situation Semantics, sentence-meaning is already a matter of the relation between context and content, so we can no longer make the distinction between sentence-meaning and utterance-meaning by dragging in the context. We need to reconstruct all these concepts. One way may be to split the notion of context into different constitutive components and abstract over each of these. Thus to obtain the semantic content of "We are here" we may abstract over speakers and places,\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

For that, we'll need to know who are the speaker's companions and how the place including the speaker is to be effectively delimited, and so on. If we are playing hide-and-seek, then the speaker-meaning may be intentionally less specific. Another way to make the relevant distinctions might be to make speaker-meaning a three-way relation between speaker, context, and the proposition intended, whereas utterance-type meaning is just a relation between context and classes of proposition (those that the context circumscribes as possible speaker-meanings). But these are difficult issues and the precise moves we make will depend on the nature of the semantic theory we are utilizing. In any case, it is clear that we need more distinctions than the simple opposition between sentence and utterance provides, and it is likely that in talking about sentence-meaning we will already be generalizing over classes of contexts. And it is quite clear (as, e.g., demonstrated by Situation Semantics) that generalizing over classes of contexts does not amount to having a theory of default or preferred or statistically normal contextsthat should be a rather more empirical matter.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|To return to the central issue, it would seem incontrovertible that any theory of utterance interpretation would have to admit the contribution of a level at which sentences are systematically paired with preferred interpretations. I will therefore presume that we need such a three-tiered theory of communication. This presumption does not presuppose that the distinctions between the middle layer of utterance-meaning and the upper and lower levels is in any way cut and dried. Indeed, there is every reason to suppose that matters of utterance-meaning will shade into speaker-meaning at the one end and sentence-meaning at the other. This is in part because there is plenty of evidence that language use is the source for grammaticalized patterns and that there is a diachronic path from speaker-meanings to utterance-meanings to sentence-meanings. Thus gray areas at the boundaries do not constitute evidence against the tripartite view, and evidence for it is the existence of preferred interpretations, default presumptions of the kind I illustrate in detail in section 1.4.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|1.3  <br>The Argument from Design: The Maxims as Heuristics\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The apparently effortless speed of daily communication through language is built on much specialized and highly evolved machinery.

The bottleneck is constituted by the remarkably slow transmission rate of human speech (conceived of as the rate at which phonetic representations can be encoded as discriminable acoustic signals), with a limit in the range of seven syllables or 18 segments per second.18 It is instructive (if in various ways misleading) to compare the transmission rate of human speech to the rates of information transmission that we are familiar with between relatively simple electronic devices like personal computers. As users of such devices will know, this rate is measured in bits of information transferred per second (bps), and transmission rates of 300 bps used to be the absolute and frustrating minimum at which information was transferred (the information will reflect on a screen, for example, at a much slower rate than one can read it); 2400 bps or higher is now the standard minimum and directly linked devices may communicate at 115,200 bps or higher. If we now compare human speech encoding rates we find that, making various rather optimistic assumptions, the maximal sort of data-transfer rate for normal human speech is under 100 bps.19 That is brutally slow.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|In contrast, the psycholinguistic evidence suggests that all other aspects of speech production and comprehension can run at a much higher rate. For example, prearticulation processes in speech production seem to run at a speed three to four times faster than the actual articulation rate (Wheeldon and Levelt 1995), and rates at which speech can be parsed and comprehended show the same kind of advantage over articulation rates (Calvert 1986: 178; Mehler et al. 1993).20 It is this mismatch between articulation rates on the one hand, and the rates of mental preparation for speech production or the speed of speech comprehension on the other hand, which points to a single fundamental bottleneck in the efficiency of human communication, occasioned no doubt by absolute physiological constraints on the articulators.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

He would imagine artificial life-forms, which he dubbed _pirots,_ and ask how they would have to be minimally endowed in order to display the particular aspect of human behavior he was interested in. 21 Now it is quite clear that pirots, conceived of as intelligent agents with the asymmetrical abilities in thinking and speaking I have just elucidated, would find a way around the articulatory bottleneck (just as, as a matter of fact, evolution has). The essential asymmetry is: inference is cheap, articulation expensive, and thus the design requirements are for a system that maximizes inference.22 (Hence the perspective outlined in the introductionlinguistic coding is to be thought of less like definitive content and more like interpretive clue.)\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|From a Gricean perspective, communication involves the inferential recovery of speakers' intentions: it is the recognition by the addressee of the speaker's intention to get the addressee to think such-and-such that essentially constitutes communication. The question has been just _how_ this recognition of others' intentions is possible. Skeptics have assumed that all accounts will simply smuggle in the notion of a conventional signal (Ziff 1975; Chomsky 1975: 6277). Griceans have put forward various accounts that trade for the most part on a notion of mutual salience. Mutual salience was shown to have quite dramatic effects on the possibility of tacit coordination, or joint action in the absence of communication, by Schelling (1960: 55), a student of strategy in economics and politics. He showed that if, for example, two subjects are told they will win a prize only if they both choose either heads or tails without communicating, nearly 90% will coordinate on heads. The trick rests on our ability to double-guess what the other party is likely to think the obvious solution, which in turn rests on what he thinks we think he will think prominentthat is, on some notion of what is mutually salient. This rather astonishing ability (utilized further below) was seized on by Griceans (Lewis 1969; Schiffer 1972), because it suggests how it may be possible to produce a communicative action that suggests the m-intention that underlies it, even in the absence of any communicative convention or signal. For example, a communicator may produce an utterance or action (say, waving an umbrella) knowing that his behavior will suggest one salient idea (say, that it may rain), and that the addressee will be looking for just such a salient suggestion. (Note that a coordination problem can involve each party doing different things, e.g., one finding the correct signal, and the other its intended interpretation; see Lewis 1969, Clark 1996.) How tacit coordination really works is admittedly a mystery,\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

But it is clear that any mutual expectations can serve to drastically limit the search-space for coordination solutions (see Clark 1996: chap. 3).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|There is a further, related problem that has received less attention, what might be called the _logical problem_ of reconstructing speaker's intentions (Levinson 1995b). Let us (following Aristotle) assume that we reason from goals to actions utilizing a logic of action, or a _practical reasoning._ Now, some theorists have assumed that intention-recognition is simply a matter of running that reasoning backwards ("turned upside down" as von Wright (1971: 96) puts it): we observe the behavior and figure out the underlying intention by the same rules that we convert intentions into the actions that will effectuate them. The logical problem is that this cannot work, for the simple reason that for all inference systems one cannot work backwards from a conclusion to the premises from which it was deducedthere is always an infinite set of premises which might yield the same conclusion (consider, e.g., the conclusion _q_ from the sets {p, p ® q}, {p & q}, {p Ú q, ~p}, etc.). Given that we do indeed recognize others' intentions (not only communicative of course), there have to be further constraints that limit the search space of sets of premises. Let us call such constraints heuristics. They may be various in kind: I may take your intentions to be circumscribed because you are a shop attendant and I am a customer, or because I just asked you a question, or because I happen to know your predilections, or because we have tacitly agreed to maximize the chances of successful communication by following some specific heuristics (e.g., on this radio channel we'll only talk about air-traffic control).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Now we have two particular design requirements for our communicating pirots. First, they must find a way around the articulatory bottleneck and use inferential enrichment to bypass this physiological limitation, given that the rest of the linguistic apparatus seems to be able to outstrip the articulation rate many times over. Second, the inferential enrichment must be circumscribed in such a way that communicators can indeed zero-in or coordinate (in the Schelling sense) on the correct communicative forms and intentions. What our pirots clearly need is a set of heuristics, mutually assumed by sender and receiver, that can serve to multiply the coded information by a factor of, say, three, by licensing inferential enrichment of what is actually encoded by choice of a specific signal. These heuristics must at the same time constrain that enrichment in such a way that the overall message can still be correctly recovered, by\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

It may be useful to sketch a little world about which our pirots may talk to one another. But first, recollect the idea, independently developed in slightly different ways by Popper (1959) and Bar-Hillel and Carnap (1952), that the semantic information content of a message can be measured in proportion to the number of states of affairs that the message effectively rules out, given a domain of discourse. For example, in a domain consisting of Bill and Ben, and considering just the states of affairs characterized by two predicates, say 'married' and 'middle-aged', the assertion "Bill is married" will rule out just 8 out of 16 possible states of affairs (e.g., a state where Ben is married and middle-aged and where Bill is not middle-aged and not married). But the assertion "Bill is married and middle-aged" will rule out twice as many states of affairs and, by this measure, will be twice as informative. Clearly, there are limits to the utility of such a characterization of informativeness (e.g., rather a lot depends on what properties we are actually interested in). 23 But, it is useful as a first approximationand besides, it is just about the only measure of semantic information available (for a critique, see, e.g., Cohen 1971: 135ff).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Thus, to increase the informativeness of a coded message which itself rules out some number _n_ of states of affairs, and thus to overcome the limit on the rate of encoding, all we need are some heuristics that will serve to rule out some further possible states, yielding an incremented content _n + m._ To illustrate this graphically, imagine a simple "blocks world" of the sort made familiar by Winograd's (1972) program for understanding natural language. Let us assume that in this blocks world there are a set of cubes, cones, and pyramids of different colors.

If the heuristic is unrestricted, then of course whatever one did _not_ specify would not be the case, and that would be such a powerful heuristic it would inhibit one from saying anything (for fear of having to list everything that is the case)! Thus this heuristic depends crucially on clearly established salient contrasts.

Thus the definition of _on_ will allow things to intervene between _x_ and _y_ (as when we say "the mug is on the table" even though there's a book underneath it) and it will certainly allow _x_ and _y_ to be in a momentary or precarious support relation. But the heuristic will license more restrictive assumptions, specifically for (11) that the pyramid is _directly on_ the red block, and that it is not teetering on the edge of the red block, or in the process of falling off. Instead, we assume, because of the lack of warning to the contrary, that the pyramid is firmly, directly, and indeed centrally placed on the block. Similarly, the heuristic licenses the inference that the pyramid is resting on its base, the most stable way in which it could be supported.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Such a heuristic is extremely powerfulit allows an interpreter to bring all sorts of background knowledge about a domain to bear on a rich interpretation of a minimal description. 26\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|This heuristic, because of its very power, carries with it the need for another complementary one that would allow the communicator to cancel the assumptions that would otherwise follow from a heuristic specifying "normal description betokens normal situation."

Each amplifies the communicative content of what is said by the measure suggested by Bar-Hillel and Carnap (1952): for each heuristic allows the recipient of a message to rule out a great many states of affairs that are in fact compatible with the content of the coded message. Taken together, the set of three heuristics serves to multiply the informational content of any message by a factor of perhaps a score, transforming the slow coding rate of human speech into something approximating the perceived speed of human communication. All that is required for such a system to work is a tacit agreement between communicators that such heuristics can be assumed to be operative unless there are indications otherwise. At the same time, because the heuristics effectively narrow the range of intended extensions of expressions, they will significantly constrain the search space for speakers' intentions and thus help to resolve the logical problem of intention-recovery.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

It seems highly unlikely. And if that is so, one of the central preoccupations of pragmatic theory should be to discover and elucidate the particular heuristics that are actually employed. And although the force of this argument does not depend on any particular proposed heuristics, the three I have sketched here seem to have both intuitive and empirical support, which I now turn to show.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|1.4  <br>A Typology of GCIs\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|There is in fact a fairly transparent relationship between the three heuristics introduced in the previous section and three of Grice's maxims of conversation. All that is necessary to see the connection is to introduce a different way of thinking about the maxims. Instead of thinking about them as rules (or rules of thumb) or behavioral norms, it is useful to think of them as primarily _inferential heuristics_ which then motivate the behavioral norms. That some of the maxims and not others have a special status as inducers of GCIs more or less follows from the nature of generalized inference, as will become clear. By assimilating the new perspective to the old, we can benefit from the many observations made under more classical Gricean assumptions.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|But the purpose here is to show that the three heuristics sketched in the prior section do indeed seem to be good candidates for such background inferential principles, and this can be done by taking them one by one, showing how they relate to Grice's scheme and how they collect prior observations into a tripartite typology of GCIs. At this stage, I simply wish to enlist intuitive support for the three proposed heuristics, and I shall make various rather drastic simplifications that will be modified later (see especially chap. 2).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|1.4.1  <br>The First (Q-) Heuristic\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The first heuristic ("What isn't said, isn't") is more or less transparently related to Grice's first Maxim of Quantity, QI: Make your contribution as informative as is required.

As a rough gloss, I offer "minimal specifications get maximally informative or stereotypical interpretations." Brief and simple expressions thus encourage, by this heuristic, a tendency to select the best interpretation to the most stereotypical, most explanatory exemplification. This rubric allows us to subsume under this heuristic a great number of well-known interpretive tendencies. Hence from the use of semantically general expressions we obtain the generality-narrowing in (17ac), the strengthening of conditionals to biconditionals in (17d) (i.e., _conditional perfection_) and the strengthening of negations from contradictories to contraries in (17e), the enrichment of conjunctions by the assumption of temporal sequence and causality as in (17f) (i.e., _conjunction buttressing_), the assumption that conjoined subjects acted together as in (17g) (i.e., _together-implications_), a preference for local coreference as in (17h), and for the finding of local antecedents as in the _bridging inference_ in (17i).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(17) a.

The underlying idea here is that there is an implicit opposition or parasitic relationship between our second and third heuristics: what is said simply, briefly, in an unmarked way picks up the stereotypical interpretation; if in contrast a marked expression is used, it is suggested that the stereotypical interpretation should be avoided. Thus we have complementary interpretations: marked expressions pick up the complement of the stereotypical extensions that would have been suggested by the use of the corresponding unmarked forms, had they been used (Horn 1984; all this developed in chap. 2 of this book).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Again, there seems plenty of intuitive support for the existence of such a heuristic. Prototype examples are the pragmatic effects of double negatives; thus the simple positive in (18a) suggests that the plane may be late as planes often are, but the double negative in (18b) suggests that there's a rather more remote possibility.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

There is no complete explanation at present, but here is perhaps part of the answer. First, there is a distinction between the Q- and M-inferences based primarily on linguistic alternates on the one hand, and the I-inferences based primarily on stereotypical presumptions about the world on the other. It would be essential to be able to utilize the resources of the language in order to indicate that the normal, stereotypical, rich presumptions about the world do not hold; and that is what ordering Q and M before I achieves. Both Q-and M-heuristics essentially induce a metalinguistic mode of inference, in contrast to the I-heuristic. They differ though in the kind of metalinguistic contrast that they rely onQ relies on sets of alternates of essentially similar form with contrastive semantic content, whereas M relies on sets of alternates that contrast in form but not in inherent semantic content.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|These properties provide a set of simple diagnostics for the three main genera of GCI, which I represent in a simplified way in table 1.1. 29 A few remarks on the table are in order. First, although there is some terminological confusion and some differences between lumpers and splitters, on the whole neo-Griceans are agreed about how the phenomena divide. For example, the reasons that Horn subsumes both (what are called in this book) Q and M inferences under one label should already be clear from the tablethey share many properties, even though they are distinct at a finer level of granularity. In this book, I make no direct argument for the tripartite scheme here employed (for which see Levinson 1987a) but rather exemplify with how such a scheme handles the data, and so let the scheme argue for itself. Now a word on the listed properties of each type of implicature. First, by _negative inference_ I have in mind that Q and M inferences are _essentially_ negative, not incidentally so, because what is implicated is that the speaker is avoiding some stronger (Q) or some simpler (M) expression, and thus indicating that he or she is not in a position to use those other expressions. Making further psychological assumptions, the recipient may thus be led to believe that the speaker does not know whether the relevant sentence with those alternate expressions would be true, or even knows that those expressions if employed would express a falsehood. For this reason, both Q and M implicatures are\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

In particular, there is metalinguistic reference to salient sets of linguistic alternates but of different kinds in the two cases: informationally ordered sets in the case of Q; sets of synonyms differing in markedness in the case of M. This last feature is what distinguishes between Q and M implicatures. Their shared metalinguistic character, however, makes it possible to deny the relevant implicature using metalinguistic negation with special stress, as in _You didn't eat SOME of the cookies, you ate ALL of them._ All these properties contrast with I implicatures, which do not have a metalinguistic basis in speaker avoidance of other expressions but are direct inferences from unmarked expressions without stronger contrastive alternates to informationally rich, often stereotypical interpretations. Finally, the three kinds of inference differ in strength, and consequently they interact in a specific way: Q inferences take priority over inconsistent inferences of other kinds, and M inferences over I inferences.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

The underlying purpose is to show that there are a number of proposed kinds of reasoning to which the inference of GCIs might be usefully assimilated.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|A reasoning system is said to be _defeasible_ (or when instantiated in an argument _nonmonotonic_) if an inference or argument in that system may be defeated by the addition of further premises. 30 Deductive systems, of course, are monotonic or nondefeasible.

This captures the essence of the informed guess, the presumption that if a fact fits with a known law, it is an instantiation of it. It may be objected here that this is a poor characterization of abduction, at least as originally conceived by Peircefor even though he provides the simple syllogistic account in (25) above,33 he seems to have intended that the term "abduction" should refer to the creative hypothesis of the major premise or scientific law itself and not the hypothesis of a mere fact that would make applicable a preexisting law. However, we can trivially manipulate the abductive syllogism to make the major premise the conclusion:34\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|![C0068-01.gif](../Images/615157cbac112340040e12da11b51243.gif)\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Clearly, what is fallacious in deductive reasoning (affirming the consequent) may be legitimate in hypothesis formation only under strict constraints on the antecedents one may hypothesize; otherwise any antecedent whatsoever may be posited. The strict constraints must capture, in some way, our sense of the best available explanation for the factuality of the consequent. At the same time, these constraints must suggest some heuristics that would allow the selection of reasonable hypotheses, given that, in general, there will be indefinitely many antecedents that may be hypothesized. The best explanation or hypothesis should be that one, it has been suggested (Thagard 1978), that gives us maximal predictions for minimal assumptions. In short, hypothesis formation is conservative as regards the modification of existing theory or assumptions but expansionist as regards the data that may be covered.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Theories of "inference to the best explanation" in philosophy of science may seem far afield from theories of utterance interpretation; utterance interpretation is not leisurely, ratiocinative, and globally ambitious like scientific theory.

AI work in diagnostic systems requires some kind of abductive inference and there has been much experimentation here. 35 But more directly pertinent is the abductive approach to implicature being developed by Hobbs and co-workers, which I review in the next section.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Practical-reasoning systems, closely allied to AI planning systems, aim to capture the reasoning from ends to means that will achieve those ends, or, if one likes, from goal to plan. They are also clearly nonmonotonic; for example, instantiating in (26), given that if one takes the 10:00 train from Cambridge one arrives in London at 11:15, and given that one wants to be in London at 11:15, then one should want to catch the 10:00 train. But suppose that one hates traveling by train; well, then, the plan is not adopted, at least if there's some alternative. Developed first in philosophical theories of action (see, e.g., Kenny 1966; von Wright 1971) and applied specifically to implicature by Atlas and Levinson (1973; see also the sketch in Brown and Levinson 1987: 6465, 8790), such modes of reasoning have since been explored in artificial intelligence (see, e.g., Allen 1983; Charniak and McDermott 1987: chap. 9).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Default logics aim to capture a rather different mode of reasoningnamely, the notion of a reasonable presumption, a _ceteris paribus_ assumption. There are a great many different formalisms under investigation (see Ginsberg 1987), but the kind of inference that these are designed to capture can again best be indicated by instantiation in the syllogism in (28). Suppose we are told "The noise of the gun frightened off the birds." It is a natural presumption that the birds flew away; but of course the presumption is unwarrantedthere are birds like penguins that do not fly at all, and others like quail that may run off along the ground or swans that may swim away. The inference from _'x_ is a bird' to _'x_ can/will fly' is an inference we seem to make _unless_ there is some inconsistent assumption already made (e.g., the birds in question are penguins). So we can set up a syllogism that says, in effect, if _x_ is a bird and _x'_s flying is consistent with what is known, presume _x_ flies. The inference will be defeasible given any fact that is inconsistent with it.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|1.5.2  <br>Nonmonotonic Inference and Implicature\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Reviewing these forms of nonmonotonic inference, it is clear that each of them gives, by design, an account of defeasibility, the essential property for modeling inferences like implicatures.

A number of attempts have thus been made to model implicature in these terms (Atlas and Levinson 1973; Brown and Levinson 1978; McCafferty 1987; Thomason 1987, 1990; Welker 1994). But there is a striking problem that has never been properly addressednamely, the fact that planning systems (like all logical systems) are asymmetrical, in the sense that plan recognition is not simply plan construction run backwards (Levinson 1995b). Just as a conclusion p might be reached from an infinite set of distinct premises (e.g., _p_ & _q;_ or _q_ & (_q_ _® p_); or (_p_ v _q_) & _~q_) so indefinitely many plans might converge on a single utterance. Thus even if we had an account of how a speaker plans an utterance complete with its implicatures (and see Levelt 1989 for a glimpse of the complexities), this would not directly give us an account of how the implicatures were recovered in comprehension.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Finally, only default logics clearly have the two properties that generalized implicatures (GCIs) clearly exhibit: defeasibility and default or preferred presumption. On the face of it, though, they may seem to have little to offer to a general theory of implicature because they provide a restricted set of limited inference rules, incapable of modeling the open-ended, creative, and indefinite set of inferences that come under Grice's theory. However, as an account of the inference of GCIs, just those implicatures that seem to have the default property, they may indeed have something to offer. There are a great many rather different models of default reasoning (Ginsberg 1987), but I will sketch (simplistically) how\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Turning now to GCIs, we might treat the scalar implicature from the use of the weaker existential quantifier in a precisely similar way (where a is a simplex arbitrary sentence frame):\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|![C0071-03.gif](../Images/60fb48611850e4a7528b1fe1d4c46757.gif)\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Then an utterance like "Some of them came" will implicate 'Not all of them came' wherever this further assumption is consistent with the data base. If we interpret the data base as the common ground (i.e., what is publicly taken for granted in the conversation so far), then a rule of this sort serves to augment the common ground in just the sort of way generally envisaged in pragmatic theory. Of course, the rule as stated loses all the generality that is the signal virtue of the pragmatic analysiswe want the inference to follow just from the fact that _some_ is a weaker element in a Horn scale of the schematic kind <STRONG, WEAK>. We can capture that generality, perhaps, by setting up a meta-rule of the sort in (32), which will apply to any simplex sentence frame a that contains a weak item paired with a strong item in a predetermined set of scales.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|![C0071-04.gif](../Images/69e675afc448bab5b51a85b26f4a0039.gif)\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Thus in Moore's (1985) _autoepistemic logic,_ we can recast our paradigm scalar inference as a modal inference:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(33) ![C0072-01.gif](../Images/49ddd4014122bc4a8c62d3535dceafd8.gif)\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|which is read 'if it is believed that a (some), and it is not believed that it is not the case that a (not all), then a (not all)'. The operator here is just the strong L operator in a standard modal logic (weak S5), so the properties of such systems are well known. The intuition behind these systems is that of a rational agent inspecting his own beliefs and making the strong assumption that what he does not know is not the case (Levesque 1990). Wainer (1991) explores in detail the application of these ideas directly to the modeling of GCIs. He notes that the inference from 'John is in the attic or in the garden' to 'the speaker does not know which' (i.e., Gazdar's (1979) clausal implicatures) falls out as a consequence in such a system. But unfortunately the system also over-generates, predicting many pseudoimplicatures too.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Wainer (1991) also considers, for the purposes of modeling GCIs, another class of nonmonotonic reasoning systems based on circumscription (McCarthy 1980). Circumscription involves restricting the entities that satisfy predicates, or restricting entities in a domain to those known to exist. McCarthy (1986) notes that communication conventions rely on such circumscription, on the assumption that things are normal unless otherwise stated. This suggests that inferences due to the I heuristic (Grice's Q2) may be quite generally modeled in such systems. Wainer (1991: chap. 4) also points out that scalar GCIs might be directly generated in such systems: if one says "Two boys came," then it can be assumed that no more than two came. He notes, however, a number of problems, and in the end he outlines a model in which GCIs are generated with the semantic structure, and then such nonmonotonic reasoning systems are used to model defeasibility rather precisely under complex conditions (Wainer 1991: chap. 5).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|There are a number of difficulties in the direct application of such systems to the modeling of GCIs: apart from the need to capture the generalizations inherent in GCI theory, we also need to handle many such rules that may potentially yield inconsistent inferences (although again see Wainer 1991: 175). Responding to earlier suggestions of mine, Carston (1995) draws attention to further difficulties: I implicatures, for instance,\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

As well, there are patterns of defeasibility that do not seem to match this format, which I detail immediately below. Although anyone interested in formalizing GCIs should clearly investigate the potentials of this whole family of nonmonotonic logics, there are reasons to think that perhaps we should invert the argument: rather than seek understanding of implicature in theories of default inference, perhaps we should instead think of generalized implicatures as the prototype of default inferences. Meanwhile, we can look carefully at the core phenomenon itselfthe defeasibility of implicaturesto discern the exact properties that such a formal theory would have to cope with.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|1.5.3  <br>Investigating the Defeasibility of Scalar Implicatures\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The mechanism I call _Gazdar's bucket_ gives a good first approximation to the conditions under which GCIs evaporate or are defeated. Gazdar (1979), following Hamblin (1971), Stalnaker (1972), and others, proposed that the communicative content of an utterance should be considered an ordered _n_-tuple of entailments, implicatures of various kinds, presuppositions, and so forth. The process of updating the common ground with the communicative content of a new utterance can then be treated as the ordered incrementation of that background with the entailments, implicatures, and presuppositions of the utterance. 36 Such an incremental model of dialogue has a number of virtues. For example, it allows us to capture the way in which utterances can presume background assumptions and the way in which their communicative force consists in changes to the context. Thus a permission both presumes a background prohibition and changes that background by removing the prohibition. Presupposition, illocutionary force, and anaphora all have natural accounts in this kind of model, now widely presumed. But an additional interest is how the incremental model might be used to handle the defeasibility of pragmatic inferences.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Informally and metaphorically, we can think of the common ground as a bucket, holding all the facts mutually assumed, either because they're common knowledge or because they have been asserted and accepted. Then, assuming that implicature generation is accounted for by other means, we can capture many aspects of the defeasibility of implicatures (GCIs in particular) in the following way: a new assertion will have its\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

The context-increment model explains this in terms of the priority of different kinds of implicatures: a clausal GCI of epistemic uncertainty arising from conditionals has a higher priority than a scalar implicature from the consequent. Because clausal implicatures are thrown in the bucket before scalar ones, when we come to add the scalar inference, we will find the addition prevented by the consistency rule, correctly predicting the suspension of the scalar implicature only.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Thus the simple device of an ordered incrementation together with a consistency check suffices to account for many aspects of the defeasibility of implicatures.

And again, the explanation would seem to be that satisfying the very specific goal here (i.e., knowing that we can get into the cinema) can be presumed to exhaust the communicational load of the utterance.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|In these cases, we can think of the situation as setting up a restricted goal: the question investigates a potential obstacle to the goal, and the reply indicates that the obstacle is not actual (see Allen 1983). I attribute this business of plan recognition and the inferences that follow from it to a maxim of Relevance, construed much as Grice intended and not at all as Sperber and Wilson (1986) reconstruct (for similar presumptions, see Holdcroft 1987, McCafferty 1987, and Thomason 1990). It seems then that Relevance implicatures, or inferences about speaker's goals, can limit the amount of further inference that is warranted. Thus even where these further inferences are entirely consistent with all that is known, they do not go through.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|These sorts of examples suffice to show that consistency with an incremental common ground is not the only constraint on the addition of default implicatures to what is taken for granted. This may cast some doubt on whether default logics are the right formalism for modeling GCIs, or it might show that they simply need to be bounded by a yet to be described maxim of Relevance. But because the inferences are defeated by recognition of a goal, and because _that_ kind of defeasibility is precisely what practical reasoning systems are set up to capture, perhaps these examples are indications that the plan-generation and plan-recognition types of nonmonotonic inference are what are really involved in implica-\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Plan generation and plan recognition are, after all, what must be involved if meaning in general has the character of Grice's meaningnn. Clearly, though, much closer work is required on _the exact nature of conditions under which inferences are abandoned._ For these are the facts that are likely to adjudicate between the different potential models of defeasible reasoning.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Two final speculations. First, one may wonder whether the intuitions that lie behind the attempts to create default logics are not in fact direct intuitions about how humans reason, but rather are primarily intuitions about communicational inferencesin fact, intuitions about the very default pragmatic inferences we are concerned with. GCIs would indeed seem to be the prototype default inferences; the root intuition is not, one may argue, that thinking of birds one assumes _ceteris paribus_ that they fly. It is rather that, anyone _saying_ "I scared away the birds" would have misled his audience if he did not intend to suggest (by I-inference to the stereotype) that the birds flew away. This suggestion is due of course in part to the way the world is (most kinds of birds fly); but that would only warrant a probabilistic inference. The default nature of the inference, to the surety that the birds flew away, relies on the presumption that _otherwise we would have been told!_ That is, given a mutual presumption about how we use stereotypes to augment the communicational load of utterances (recollect the I-heuristic: 'what is stereotypical may be presumed'), the effect will be to convert Bayesian probabilities or hazardous assumptions into the certainties of communicational presumptions.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|There is some empirical support for the rather extraordinary effect that the mutual assumption of a common heuristic can have on the probabilities of co-ordinated action. As mentioned above, Schelling (1960) showed, in some well known informal experiments, that if, for example, two people are asked to guess the same number without communicating to one another, they can do so with much greater reliability than chancethey search for a salient number that each thinks the other will also find the most salient (e.g., 1 or 100). Or, if two persons are lost in a department store they can guess where each would guess the other would go, so fixing on a single meeting place. If we think of communication as a coordination problem of the same sort (the speaker finding the signal that the recipient will interpret just as the speaker intended), a heuristic of the sort I have been describing would play the same sort of rolenarrowing down the solutions to the coordination problem. Thus a mere probability that the speaker meantnn such and such can become converted, against\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

And arguably this is just what default logics model: presumptions about interpretation based on the fact that an interpreter may assume a certain heuristic (e.g., the inference to the stereotype) and thus a particular interpretation (e.g., restricting the extension of _birds_ to 'flying birds') on the basis that the speaker will have coded the message assuming the operation of the very same heuristic. Or to put it another way: when I _think_ "the dog chased away the birds," I will remember the particularities of the event (whether the quail ran or flew away); it is only when I _say_ it that default presumptions come into action (on the mismatch between thought and speech, see Levinson 1997). 38\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|And this brings us to the second and final speculation: perhaps this account of pragmatic inference as based on stable heuristics is all we need to give an account of this species of defeasible inference. There is no need for a nonmonotonic logic to model GCIs, it might be claimed, because GCIs are simply instantiations of communicational heuristics and indeed the prototype default inferences. Just as Johnson-Laird (1983) argues that we do not need formal deduction to model deductive properties of human reasoning, relying instead on the reasoning based on instantiated mental models, so perhaps we do not need formal models of nonmonotonic argument to capture the processes of default interpretation. Some philosophers think that much of the effort expended on defeasible logics or inference systems is futile, stemming from a confusion between reasoning and rule-based inferencereasoning is always subject to revision, but deduction as least is strictly cumulative (see Harman 1986). If this category mistake has been made, it is because in the context of strong communicational assumptionsof tacit coordination and m-intentionsdefault inferences come to have the normative certainty that we associate with rule-based inference systems.39\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|1.6  <br>Against Reduction of GCIs to Nonce Speaker-Meaning\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|We have mentioned the current tendency to reduce utterance-meaning to speaker-meaning, or, in other words, utterance-type meaning to utterance-token meaning.40 Thus a theory of communication is left, on these accounts, with only the level of sentence-meaning on the one hand and speaker-meaning on the other, with no provision being made for the notions of conventions of use, idiomatic use, partially conventionalized meaning, preferred interpretation, default interpretation, and so on.

Thus the body of this book attempts to justify the notion of a GCI by ostension as it were in chapter 2, and then by showing how generalizations only available to a theory of utterance-types can contribute significantly to other areas of linguistic theory (chap. 3 and 4). However, here we pause to argue directly but briefly against two rival accounts that would reduce GCIs to nonce inferences.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|1.6.1  <br>Sperber-Wilson Relevance\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The most prominent of the reductionist views is the theory of Relevance promoted by Sperber and Wilson (1986). This is not the place to review that theory (see Levinson 1989 for my own response and the general peer commentary in _Behavioral & Brain Sciences_ 10:4, 1987), but it suffices to say that the theory holds that implicature is a side effect, as it were, of a mental automatism, a tendency to extract the maximal inferences for the minimal psychic effort.42 There are no maxims, no heuristics, no special modes of reasoning involved in implicature derivation. Thus the fact that the GCI phenomena do not seem properly attributed to a maxim of Relevance is, on this view, beside the point; Sperber-Wilson Relevance (henceforth SW-R) is intended to replace the whole Gricean apparatus. Nor is it pertinent, apparently, that SW-R appears to be a very inadequate characterization of what pretheoretically would generally be considered the nature of relevance (as already mentioned, this seems best captured in terms of the local goals of participants at a particular locus in a conversation). SW-R is in effect a proportional measure balancing informational richness (corresponding, perhaps, approximately to my I principle or Grice's Q2) with processing effort (capturing, arguably, some aspects of my M). And the central claim is that low-cost inferences (deductive in character) will be invariably preferred.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

So if the theory is to be of any use, we must have some rough and ready concept of a low-cost inference such that it would be just the sort of inference favored by SW-R. Following the examples used in Sperber and Wilson (1986), I was led to think that the schema in (44) would constitute just the right kind of example.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

But, SW-R (on my construction of it) predicts the contrary reading, that the spy may yet escape. Thus I concluded (Levinson 1987c) that GCI theory makes the right predictions just where SW-R makes the wrong ones and, more generally, that a theory of preferred interpretations can never be superseded by a theory of nonce inference.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|However, in their response, Sperber and Wilson (1987: 748) contend that their theory makes no such predictions and specifically it "does not predict that the most relevant interpretation conceivable is the right one." Rather, in this case, everything will depend on the details of the contextual assumptions and specifically on whether the interlocutors take B to be an authority on the cardinality of the spy's passports. Thus, without such further details, the authors claim that SW-R simply makes _no predictions_ whatever. But this response would hardly seem to help the theory wriggle out of examples of this kind, presented here as interlocutors often experience them, without mutually assumed background assumptions of the sort SW-R calls for. There is, intuitively, a clear preference for the reading predicted by GCI theory, and it is a preference that GCI theory holds would be expected in the absence of any further specificities about the context.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Thus, either SW-R seems to make the wrong predictions about the phenomena generally considered GCIs (my claim), or it makes no general predictions about them (Sperber and Wilson's claim), and both alternatives seem equally damaging. No doubt there is plenty of room for maneuver in the application of a theory as general as SW-R to specific examples; and perhaps I continue (as alleged) to misunderstand SW-R. But certainly the two theories ought to make rather different predictions in a whole range of cases, and as far as I can see, GCI theory is bound to make the right sort and SW-R the wrong sort as far as the inferences central to GCI theory are concerned. Regardless of the success or failure of present versions of GCI theory, these rather complex examples only serve to reinforce a simple enough, indeed almost self-evident, point: expression-types do tend to have preferred interpretations (or more exactly, there are default restrictions on their extensions), interpretations that tend to go through in the absence of information to the contrary.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

These theories have in common the use of Lewis' (1979) concept of _accommodation,_ which had earlier been used to account for certain properties of presupposition (Heim 1982: 370384). Let us consider two rather different theories (Thomason 1987, Hobbs 1987) that claim that the concept of accommodation coupled with a nonmonotonic inference system may be all we need for a theory of implicature. Thomason (1987) suggests we need accommodation plus a plan-recognition inference system, 46 whereas Hobbs (1987) suggests accommodation plus his abduction system (a weighted backward-chaining, based on a constrained use of the logical fallacy of affirming the consequent). The basic idea behind accommodation is that there are reasonably well-defined felicity conditions or usage constraints on the use of particular expressionsfor example, _the X_ is felicitously used (it might be claimed) only where the common ground provides a uniquely salient X. Against this background of expected usage, deviant uses can then be _accommodated_ by a cooperative interlocutor. Suppose I say "My car broke down. The diesel froze," in a context in which a unique mass of diesel has not been previously introduced into the discourse; well, it will take no great imagination to construct the assumption that the speaker's car runs on diesel and that the mass in question is the diesel in the fuel tank of that car.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|There are thus two essential ingredients in the proposed mechanism whereby utterance U implicates proposition _p:_\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|1. _U_ must contain a trigger _T,_ some expression whose felicity conditions require that a proposition of the class _P_ must be an element of the common ground if T is to be felicitously used;\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|2. if _U_ is uttered and there is no proposition of the class _P_ presumed in the context, then the recipient should _accommodate T_ by inferring _p_ such that _p_ Î P, and by adding _p_ to the common ground.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The essential difference between Hobbs's account and Thomason's comes down, then, as mentioned, to the mode of inference envisaged (abduction or practical reasoning).47\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Clearly, these accounts work only where there are appropriate trigger expressions, expressions that require certain contextual assumptions that have not already been met.

But Thomason provides little reason to believe this, and Hobbs's extensions are interesting but remain within the class of presupposition-like triggers (e.g., he extends the account to noun-noun compounds like _oil alarm,_ which require the inference of some unique relation between the extensions of the two nouns).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Without conceding that the account is persuasive even in these cases, we can nevertheless easily show that it offers little hope of reducing GCIs. The essential reason for this is that GCIs are not inferences that have to be made in order to maintain some particular felicity condition; the expressions that give rise to GCIs do not _require_ any inferenceotherwise cancellation would not be possible. Rather, GCIs are inferences that are, from the point of view of accommodation theory, essentially _gratuitous._ Another way of putting it is that accommodation theory is an account of how rule-breaking behavior is brought back into line with expectations. For example, I use a presuppositional trigger where no such presupposition is actually presumed; my interlocutor accommodates the usage by accepting the presumption. But in the case of the use of a GCI-inducing expression like scalar _some,_ no rule has been broken; yet the inference to 'not all' is gratuitously made. And the very nature of GCI defeasibilitynamely, cancellation in the face of inconsistent or unsupportive assumptionsmakes it impossible for a GCI-inducing expression to force a presumption into the common ground.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Just to make this concrete, compare the kinds of case favorable to an accommodation account, like (48a), to the classic GCIs like scalar implicatures in (48b).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(48) a.

In an abductive system of inference like Hobbs's, an attempt would be made to unify the discourse referents by linking both expressions to the antecedent _Jerry Rich,_ thereby satisfying the definiteness conditions. Indeed, both the pronoun and the definite description would be predicted to be interpreted in the same way. But that, of course, is contrary to intuition: the pronoun invites such linkage to _Jerry Rich,_ but the description _the man_ resists it. GCI theory gives a concise account of this: pronouns are minimal expressions that invite maximal interpretations by the I principle discussed above, whereas the use of a marked definite description where a pronoun could have been used suggests by the M-principle that the speaker did not intend such local coreference (see chap. 4).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|We can press the critique further. Consider the possible analysis of the indefinite article in accommodation theory. If the definite article requires a previously existing discourse referent, the indefinite may be claimed to require the setting up of a new discourse referent (Heim 1982; Kamp 1981). On this account, the sequence of sentences in (50a) would seem to presume distinct discourse referents; this seems correct. But now examine (50b). Here we seem happy to co-identify _the ship_ and _a fine galleon,_ contrary to the theory.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(50) a.

We should reject the analysis of the indefinite article as requiring the setting up of a new discourse referent fnbsp; la Heim (1982), while accepting that definiteness does involve conditions on usage (like uniqueness). 49 We can then can set up a scalar opposition (more details in chap. 2) as in (50c), where an indefinite expression is weaker because it simply lacks the uniqueness and "givenness" conditions associated with the more specific and informative definite expression. Given a scalar opposition of this kind, a speaker using an indefinite will Q-implicate that the use of the definite would be misleading in at least one way. Thus in (50b), a speaker who said _The fine galleon of the Spanish fleet_ might be thought to be communicating that there was only one fine galleon in the Spanish fleet and, wishing to avoid this inference, would use the indefinite even though it is to be coidentified with the immediately preceding discourse referent. So again, accommodation-plus-abduction gives the wrong account here, at least without rescue by GCI theory.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|In sum then, whatever the success of accommodation theory in the presuppositional domain, it will not supersede GCI theory as Thomason and Hobbs have both independently suggested. On the one hand, accommodation theory simply fails to extend to the gratuitous inferences that are the focus of GCI theory, and on the other hand, without GCI theory it make the wrong predictions, over-unifying discourse referents in some cases (where M-implicatures warn otherwise) and failing to unify them in others (where, for example, a Q-inference from the use of an indefinite explains the use of the indefinite as a coreferential expression).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|We may conclude this discussion of SW-R and Accommodation Theory by noting the inadequacy of such reductionist approaches in the face of the clear evidence in favor of a level of utterance-type meaning. These are not the kinds of problems that might be addressed by tinkering with the reductionist theories in limited ways. It is just because these theories are theories of speaker-meaning, or nonce inference, that they are unable in principle to capture aspects of meaning associated with the general, normal use of expressions.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

This argument concerns one such rich generalization which has much empirical support, and which defies explanation in any other terms. The argument is based on work by Larry Horn over 15 years, summarized in Horn 1989.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Recollect that we have described Q-implicatures as involving contrastive expression-alternatives, often arranged in scales of semantic strength, like the prototype _<all, some>_ scale, where the use of the semantically weaker _some_ will ceteris paribus Q-implicate the inapplicability of the stronger expression _all._ Recollect, too, that for each positive scale of the form <S, W>, there will be a corresponding negative scale of the form <~W, ~S>, such that asserting (in a suitable sentence frame) ~S will Q-implicate ~ ~W (i.e., W). So, instantiating, given a positive scale _<all, some>_, we have the negative scale <_not-some_ (_none_), _not all>_, such that asserting "Not all the boys came" will implicate 'not-none of them came', (i.e., 'some of them came').\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Now, the relationship between positive and negative scales is important for a number of reasons. First, the relationship has not been understood by most commentators (despite the explanation in Atlas and Levinson 1981). Thus Gazdar (1979), Hirschberg (1985: 73), and Kadmon (1987) all claim that negation blocks implicature projection instead of seeing that negation in the case of scales simply inverts the scale, so that negative scales induce implicatures that just happen to be different from the implicatures induced by positive scales. But a second reason why the relationship between positive and negative scales is important is that it yields real insight into the nature of logical operators and in particular into the traditional _square of opposition._\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The square of opposition, that device conceived by Boethius out of Aristotle to plague monks and schoolchildren for two millennia, has the prototype instantiation shown in figure 1.1. 50\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|I remind the reader of the following definitions:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|_p_ and _q_ are _contraries_ if _p_ and _q_ can't both be True,  <br>but they can both be False ("John is happy/sad")\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

The question has been whether the relation should be thought of as a logical one, with the I vertex implying the O one, or whether on the contrary it should be understood as a nonlogical suggestion. Horn (1972, 1989) documents the many inconsistent positions that theorists have taken over the ages, showing how, for example, Aristotle held that in the case of the modals the I/O relation was logical but in the case of the quantifiers it was a nonlogical suggestion. Hamilton and Jespersen held the relation is logical for all the squares, De Morgan and J. S. Mill that it is nonlogical for all the squares, and so on.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The theory of GCIs helps to explain the confusion. The I (_some_) corner of the square carries a generalized scalar implicature to the effect that the O (_not all_) corner also holds. It is the generalized nature of the inference that explains the confusion even among these eminent scholars thinking deep and hard about the problem. "Some" strongly suggests 'not all', and "Not all" strongly suggests 'some', but we can say without contradiction "Some in fact all" or "Not all, indeed none," indicating that the suggestion cannot be a logical relationship. The correct answer to this perennial puzzle is given by the nature of scalar implicatures and the way in which negation reverses scales: the vertices always form scales of the form <A, I> and <E, O>; so the assertion of "I" will implicate ' ~A', which is of course the contradictory of A, and therefore equivalent to O:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(52) a. <All, some>; <None, not all>\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|b.

Thus there will always be a pragmatic inference from the assertion of the I (_some_) corner to the inference of the O (_not all_) corner, or from the assertion of the O (_not all_) corner to the inference of the I (_some_) corner. Despite the fact that this relation is only a defeasible pragmatic suggestion, its occurrence is so regular and predictable that theorists were misled into believing it was a semantic relation.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

But if these inferences were nonce inferences, sometimes going one way, sometimes another, the pragmatic nature of the I/O relation would be self-evident. It is not self-evident precisely because there is a strong default inference, a strongly preferred interpretation that arises from the assertion of either corner to the conclusion that the other corner holds.

In other words, the O corner of the square hardly ever lexicalizes; it is nearly always expressed by complex phrases of the form exemplified by English _not all, possibly not, not both,_ and so on. This is in contrast to the strong negative apex E, where the forms routinely lexicalize, as in English _none, impossible, neither,_ and so forth. In this context, the absence of _*nall_ (meaning 'not all'), _*nalways_ (meaning 'not always') or _*noth_ (meaning 'not both') is certainly noteworthy; and the fact that this generalization (the O corner of the square hardly ever lexicalizes) appears to hold widely across languages, indeed universally as far as we now know, is certainly remarkable.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(53) _English exemplifications of the universal lexicalization constraint on the O corner  <br>not all_ has no lexicalization _*nall_ (cf. _none_)  <br>_permit not_ has no form _*permitn't_ (cf. _forbid_)  <br>_not always_ has no form _*nalways_ (cf. _never_)  <br>_not._ . . _and_ . . . has no form _*nand_ (cf. _nor_)  <br>_not both_ . . . _and_ . . . has no form _*noth_ (cf. _neither_)\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The patterns in English in (52) are thus typical of other languages as well. The details are telling, too: thus _Priests can not marry_ is ambiguous in English between the E-reading 'are forbidden to' and the O-reading 'are permitted not to', but as soon as it is contracted and thus lexicalized (_Priests can't marry_) only the E-reading is available (Horn 1989: 259). The uncontracted form already has a preferred E-reading, and this is also a crosslinguistic, diachronic tendency, which Horn (1989: 262263) dubs\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Note that _mustn't_ lexicalizes 'must not', but _mayn't_ (which might be expected to lexicalize the O corner 'may not') can only mean 'must not', too. The generalization is that we expect no lexicalization of a necessity modal that incorporates a negation outside its scope (e.g., 'not must'), or a lexicalization of a possibility modal with a negation inside its scope (e.g., 'may not')both kinds of lexicalization would be at the O corner. 51\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|GCI theory provides an account of this lexicalization constraint along the following lines. First, as we have just established, I and O are related by implicature: asserting I will carry a generalized Quantity scalar implicature that O. Second, it seems that what is conveyed by a GCI is generally not lexicalized; that is to say, there is a redundancy constraint on lexicalization, roughly as follows:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(54) _Redundancy constraint_\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|For any lexical item W that carries a generalized Quantity implicature P, there will be no fully lexicalized counterpart W¢ that lexicalizes the content of P. Because I items on a Square will always implicate O items, there will be no lexicalized O items.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Another way of putting this is: if the I item entails _p_ and implicates _q,_ then the corresponding O item will entail _q_ and implicate _p._ Thus in an appropriate sentence frame the assertion of "some" will entail 'at least one', and implicate 'not all', whereas the assertion of "not all" will entail 'not all' and implicate 'some'. Thus the I and O items have the same overall communicational load, simply reversing the distribution of the load between what is entailed and what is implicated.52\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|We need one more ingredient in the explanation. Given that the assertion of the I (_some_) or the O (_not all_) corner will carry the same communicational load, why should I (_some_) be lexicalized but not O (_not all_)? The answer is provided by the relatively complex nature of negation (as shown by much psycholinguistic work). Given a choice between a positive term and a negative term carrying the same load, the positive term will be chosen as the basis from which to apply the redundancy constraint against lexicalization of the negative expressions. One should note that there is no general ban against lexicalization of negatives; that is shown by the tendency for the E terms to incorporate negation.53 But given a choice between choosing the I (_some_) expressions or the O (_not all_) expressions as the basic ones and excluding the other corner from lexi-\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

The nonce-implicature theorist cannot explain itaccording to any such theory, there are no general tendencies to be found, or if there are they have the status of mere behavioral tendencies, playing no role in the systematic generation of implicatures. On such a theory, there is no more reason for _not all_ to resist lexicalization than for _not some_ to undergo it (_none_).

The nonce-implicature theorist cannot in principle, it seems, explain how there could be such a strong, reliable preference for interpretation in one direction that (a) generations of theorists themselves could be confused about whether inferences from one logical operator to another were to be explained by semantic or by pragmatic content and that (b) the language itself is adapted (by the provision of lexical gaps) to the prevailing pragmatic winds, as it were.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|1.8  <br>Conclusions\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|In this chapter, my prime objective has been to try and defend the notion of a generalized conversational implicature. Throughout, I have argued against the dominant current line that a theory of communication should allow only a level of speaker-meaning (or utterance-token meaning). Instead, I have argued for a third level or layer in a theory of communication, the level of utterance-type meaning interposed between the level of speaker-meaning and the level of expression-meaning. This level is to capture the suggestions that the use of an expression of a certain type generally or normally carries, by default. We may concede that the concept of a preferred, default interpretation is not an easy one to explicate and it lacks the kind of theoretical underpinning we may perhaps have for other concepts in the theory of meaning, without conceding that there is any doubt at all about the need for such a notion in a theory of communication. 54\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

In contrast, GCI theory seems to make the necessary generalizations in a straightforward way.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|6. Finally, I have argued that if there were no such things as GCIs or preferred default interpretations, it would be impossible to account for the strength and generality of the pragmatic inferences associated with the natural language logical operators. In particular, we would have no account at all of the reliable crosslinguistic tendency to ban lexicalization of the O corner of the traditional square of oppositions.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|These arguments will be at least sufficient, I hope, for the reader to entertain the idea of a generalized conversational implicature without prejudice.

It amounts to the claim that there is a special species of pragmatic mechanism that yields inferences that are both defeasible and default in character. At least some of the properties of such inferences can be captured within a number of currently available default, nonmonotonic reasoning systems. But these inferences, generated under the mutual assumption of tacit coordination through specific heuristics, have the force of strong presumptions. They belong to a broad third category or layer of meaning, midway between sentence-meaning and speaker-meaning (or utterance-token-meaning), namely utterance-type meaning, in which types of linguistic form come to have preferred, idiomatic readings. Despite many attempts to reduce this third layer away, either to aspects of sentence-meaning or aspects of speaker-meaning, it remains a robust, irreducible category of meaning, as shown by Horn's generalization of universal patterns of constraints on lexicalization that can be directly attributed to the omnipresent operation of inference patterns of this default sort.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The three main species of GCI (according to my typology) were introduced in the last chapter in a cursory way. The purpose of this chapter is to lay out the kind of phenomena that motivate the theory of GCIs. These data are the crucial observations that reductionist theories of utterance meaning have never come to terms with, and indeed cannot, as far as I can see. The phenomena are of course much more important and robust than the theory I am advocating; indeed I will not hide the fact that they are not all adequately accounted for.

So at the same time I will attempt to clarify these principles and show how the relevant examples fall under their respective predictive power. Various critiques and alternative treatments will be dealt with _en passant,_ with the consequence that my assessments of them will be more cursory than some of these proposals deserve (for which I apologize in advance).

As explanatory principles, we want as few as will do the job, while recognizing essential distinct genera and respecting evidence from conversation that specific principles are being oriented to (again, see Levinson 1987a). Some discussion will occur throughout this book, but a few pointers may assuage irritation at this point. Readers will note that the three principles are derived partly by elimination from Grice's original four maxims (with a total of nine submaxims). The maxim of Quality ("try to make your contribution one that is true") plays only a background role in the generation of GCIs. (There has been a tendency to assume that the Quality maxim generates implicatures of belief or commitment, despite Grice's explicit warnings against this.) 1 The maxim of Relation or Relevance (which Grice (1989: 2627) stated simply as "Be relevant" within the overall Cooperative Principle, "Make your contribution such as is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged") has pertinence only to the immediate, ever variable, conversational goals: it generates PCIs, not GCIs. This leaves two important subprinciples of Quantity,\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Still, it may be objected that this shows much too much reverence for Grice's ramshackle scheme, a sort of joke calqued on Kant. 2 Reverence is indeed beside the point (especially for such a delightfully irreverent intellect as H. P. Grice), but the fact is each of these three principles seem to capture a large range of phenomena (as has been noted by a number of different scholars under various rubrics). The three principles are in various ways incommensurable and even antagonistic, and therefore successful reduction looks unlikely. But for the purposes of this chapter, I ask the reader to suspend these questions and just see how the recommended scheme seems to fit the facts.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|2.2  <br>The Q Principle\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|2.2.1  <br>Q Inferences\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|In chapter 1, I introduced the Q principle as a heuristic based on Grice's first maxim of Quantity, and sketched the way in which it induces inferences from the use of one expression to the assumption that the speaker did not intend a contrasting, usually informationally stronger, one. Consequently, implicatures from this principle have two essential characteristics: they are metalinguistic (and paradigmatic) in the sense that what is implicated makes essential reference to what might have been said but wasn't (i.e., to a set of linguistic alternates in paradigmatic opposition), and they are negative propositions, what is implicated being a presumption that such and such is not the case.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Now this species of inference has been more extensively explored in the literature than any other kind of implicature, and I will not repeat here the whole history of observations and commentaries (see, e.g., Levinson 1983: chap. 3). Suffice it to say that Grice (1967, 1978) employed the first maxim of Quantity to account for the implicatures from the use of the disjunction and conditional to the unknown truth value of the constituent sentences, but that it was Horn's (1972) treatment, and the subsequent formalization by Gazdar (1979), that established what we may call the standard doctrine (as reviewed in Levinson 1983: chap. 3). Since then, a number of critiques and elaborations have appeared, which I will refer to later.

Further kinds of Q inferences are introduced below.

A first issue concerns the differential strength of implicatures from the same scale. Horn (1972: 90) originally suggested that not all scalar implicatures have the same epistemic force: in general, for scales with more than two members, for example, a scale of the form <a,b,c,d>, and an arbitrary sentence frame S, assertion of "S(d)" implicates that the recipient _must_ infer K ~ S(a) but only that the recipient _may_ infer K ~ S(b), K ~ S(c). Thus, for example, saying "Some came" implicates that the speaker knows that not all came, and possibly that not many or not most came (given the scale _<all, most, many, some>_). Gazdar's formulation has equally strong epistemic commitment by the speaker for all items on the scale above the asserted one, and one may complain that this neglects Horn's correct intuitionnamely, that the most salient implicature is the denial of the head of the scale. Gazdar's formulation was in fact designed to handle the projection problem; he wanted to capture the observation (see section 2.5.1) that clausal implicatures would cancel scalar ones where they were inconsistent, and he achieved this by assuring that the epistemic modification did not mask inconsistency and by stipulating that clausal implicatures take precedence. Because clausal inferences are of the form {Pp, P ~ p}, they are inconsistent with a scalar implicature of the form K ~ p. Atlas (1993a: 209ff) finds the clausal inference Pp implausible but will then need to reconstruct a projection solution (see section 2.5.1 and Kay 1992 for a defense of Gazdar's approach to the projection problem).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|A second issue is that many authors feel that the epistemic commitments on the part of the speaker proposed by Gazdar are just much too strong (see, e.g., van der Sandt 1988: 126ff). Soames (1982, 1998: 115120) suggests that the epistemic force of scalar implicatures is the external negation of the Hintikka operator _K,_ so that asserting, "Some came" will carry the generalized implicature that the speaker doesn't know whether all came or _~K_(all came) or _P_(all came), which may be strengthened by the contextual assumption that the speaker would know whether or not\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

He provides both telling examples and a Gricean argument to that effect. Horn (1989: 214, 233234, 543 n. 5) essentially concurs and suggests that scalar implications are of the form ~ _Kp_ ('the speaker doesn't know that _p'_, rather than Gazdar's K ~ p, 'the speaker knows that not _p'_), unless they are strengthened by an additional assumption that _S_ is an expert on the subject _p._ 7 Soames (1998) goes on to show that if this tack is taken, scalar implicatures are not after all (at least in the classic cases) inconsistent with clausal implicatures, and Gazdar's special rule that scalars cancel clausal implicatures where they are mutually inconsistent can be dispensed with.8\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Both more elaborate and simpler solutions are possible. Hirschberg (1985: 75ff) argues that it would be desirable to distinguish between the strong epistemic commitment associated (by the maxim of Quality) with the asserted content of utterances, and the weaker commitment, perhaps in terms of belief rather than knowledge, associated with implicatures. She therefore claims that scalars actually implicate a disjunction itself: asserting "Some came" implicates that _S_ believes that not all came or that _S_ doesn't know whether all came.9 Additionally, one might wish that the relative defeasibility of different species of pragmatic implication (e.g., of scalar vs. clausal Q-implicatures) was also reflected in variable strengths of speaker commitment. On the other hand, Atlas (1993a) holds that the whole issue betrays a deep confusion (promoted by Grice's reductionist program) between utterance-meaning on the one hand and psychological states of speakers on the other: when one utters _U_ implicating _p, p_ is conveyed whether one believes it or not. Even if a speaker's mental states are involved in the computation that _U_ implicated _p,_ they are not part of the _content_ of _U._10 On this account, the entire debate is beside the point: implicatures come naked, without epistemic commitments.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|One central point needs to be preserved in this debate, and that is the intuitive difference between scalar implicatures, which do come with a strong presumption, arguably something close to epistemic certainty, and clausal implicatures where what is conveyed is precisely epistemic uncertainty. It is for this reason that, in what follows, I simply presume, following the Gricean tradition, that implicatures do come with some form of epistemic modification that will retain this distinction. None of the proffered solutions seem quite right,11 and although a correct solution would be required for any formalization, I will offer none here and will remain agnostic about the directions in which such a solution may be\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Henceforth, I shall not in general mark the epistemic modification on implicatures: thus when I write "Some came" Q +> 'Not all came', this may be understood as a shorthand for 'the uttering of "Some came" will, _ceteris paribus,_ implicate that the speaker judges that not all came' (where "judge" can be cashed out in various ways). 12 Where the distinction between the the scalars and the clausal implicatures needs to be highlighted, I revert to Gazdar's (1979) notation, using _K_ and _P,_ but with a weaker "belief" rather than "know" interpretation (where the implicated suggestion seems especially weak, I indicate this in the gloss), so that scalars will generate implicatures of the _Kp_ form and clausal implicatures will have the form _Pp, P ~ p,_ as I will explain.13\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|2.2.2  <br>Entailment Scales\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|We may loosely define a Horn scale (or entailment scale, to differentiate such from non-entailment scales to be mentioned below) as an ordered _n_-tuple of expression alternates <x1, x2, . . . ,xn such that, where _S_ is an arbitrary simplex sentence-frame and _x__i_ > _x__j, S_(_x__i_) unilaterally entails _S_(_x__j_).14 Classic scales of this kind come from many grammatical classes and include the quantifiers _<all, most, many, some>_, connectives like _<and, or>_, modals <_necessarily, possibly>, <must, should, may>_, adverbs like _<always, often, sometimes>_, degree adjectives like <_hot, warm>_, and even verbs like <_know, believe>, <love, like>._ They all induce Q-implicatures in the way that should already be familiar: assertion of a lower ranking (rightwards) alternate implicates that the speaker is not in a position to assert a higher ranking onefor if the speaker was in that position, he or she should, by the Q-principle, have asserted the stronger sentence. The one-way semantic entailment that orders these sets guarantees of course that leftmost items are informationally richer than rightwards ones.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Further conditions have to be put on Horn scales, lest they overgenerate (Gazdar 1979: 57f; Atlas and Levinson 1981: 44). Clearly we do not implicate the negation of every proposition that entails what we say. First, items in the same scale must be in salient opposition: of the same form class, in the same dialect or register, and lexicalized to the same degree. These considerations exclude for example a Horn scale <_iff, if>_, for _iff_ (_if and only if_) belongs to a specialized register and is not monolexemic like _if_ This lexicalization constraint holds especially for the stronger items in scales, and for good Gricean reasons: if the hearer suspects that the speaker may have avoided a stronger statement simply because it would have been clumsy and prolix (and thus contrary to Manner\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Hence there is no scale _<regret, know>_ because _regret_ introduces semantic parameters additional to those involved in _know._16 Similarly, in conjunction with the requirements for sameness of word class, semantic issues rule out a scale (_p because q, p and q>._ The same multiple constraints rule out the putative scale _<necessarily-p, p>_, thought by Burton-Roberts (1984) to be a serious anomaly in the Gricean account (because the plain assertion of, e.g., "Two and two is four" would then imply that it is not necessarily so).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|There is one apparent systematic exception to these constraints, which has to do with negative scalar items. Gazdar (1979: 5657) blocks implicatures arising in negative contexts: otherwise, he claims, the assertion of "It is not the case that Paul ate some of the eggs" would implicate 'It is not the case that Paul ate not all of the eggs' (i.e., that Paul ate all of the eggs). The same blocking constraint is imposed by Hirschberg (1985: 73), who correctly notes, however, that Gazdar's blocking of other logical functors is unnecessary. Even Horn (1989: 234) subscribes to a blocking function that includes both overt and covert negatives (and indeed all downward-entailing operators). Now, in fact, this move arises from a misunderstanding of negative scales. The correct generalization, as pointed out by Atlas and Levinson (1981), is that negation reverses scales: for example, if _<all, some>_ form a Horn scale, so do <_none_ (i.e., _not some_), _not all>._17 Hence "It is not the case that Paul ate some of the eggs" (or more simply "Paul didn't eat some of the eggs") asserts an item at the strongest end of a scale (_not some = none_), from which as always no implicature follows. The process is entirely general, and no special projection apparatus is required. However, given the generalization noted by Horn (1973, 1989) described in chapter 1, that the (_not all_) O corner of the traditional square of oppositions regularly fails to lexicalize, whereas the (_none_) E corner does, this arguably constitutes a regular exception to a constraint that items in Horn scales must be of equal lexicalized status.

Still, there is a special pattern here to the nature of negative expressions, given the systematic O-corner resistance to lexicalization. This special pattern may be recognized by introducing negative scales by meta-rule: for any scale of the form <x1, x2, . . . , xn>, there will be a corresponding scale of the form < ~ xn, . . . , ~x2, x1>. The psychological counterpart to this move is the claim that we process such negative scale items as _none_ by reference to the equivalent expressions containing the relevant positive scalar items, like 'not some', a decompositional claim that is consistent with the known processing difficulties associated with negatives. 18\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|There are some well-known diagnostics for scalar implicature.

For nonentailment scales where we cannot order expressions on simple entailment grounds, Horn suggested we could use "suspenders" to establish that items belong to a single scale and their ordering within it. Gazdar (1979) assumed that the mechanism in these suspending _if_-clauses was simply implicature cancellation by a general projection mechanism (whereby\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Following Jespersen (1917), Sapir (1930), and generations of philosophical and logical thought (all nicely summarized in Horn 1989), we may put into correspondence on the square the sets of notions given in table 2.1. The placement of scalar items on the square requires in the first instance a distinction between the positive (A-I dimension) scales and the negative (E-O dimension) scales. This may be established partly by reference to the well-known duals (repeated here from chapter 1):\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(5) _The duals_\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|<br>\\|<br>\\|\\\|   \\\|   \\\|<br>\\\|---\\\|---\\\|<br>\\\|\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|A . . . = ~I . . . ~\\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|(e.g., _all_ . . . implies _not some_ . . . _not_ . . .)\\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\|\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|I . . . = ~A . . . ~\\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|(e.g., _some_ . . . implies _not all_ . . . _not_ . . .)\\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\|\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|~A . . . = I ~ . . .\\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|(e.g., _not all_ . . . implies _some_ . . . _not_ . . .)\\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\|\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|~I = A . . . ~\\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|(e.g., _not some_ . . . implies _all_ . . . _not_ . . .)\\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br><br>  <br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|It may partly also be established by reference to Horn's "suspender" tests (1989: 235236):\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(6) _Using suspending clauses to_\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|a.

Using tests to be discussed, Horn (1989: 237) gives figure 2.2 as the square for English quantifiers. The halfway 0.5 position marks the line above which positive items have negative items as _contraries_ (e.g., "all came" entails 'not none came'); below that line, positive items have negative items as _subcontraries_ (i.e., the relationship is implicatural; e.g., "some came" implicates but does not entail 'not all came'). How do we establish that, for example, _most_ is above the line and _many_ below it? First, we can show that _most_ is higher on the positive scale than _many_ by Horn's "suspender" tests: one can say "Many if not most of them came", but not ??"Most if not many of them\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Second, we can use Löbner's (1987) test for tolerant versus intolerant logical operators: logical contraries are intolerant of conjunction with their internal negations (i.e., an intolerant quantifier Q does not combine in an acceptable sentence of the form "Q(x) P(x) and Q(x) ~ P(x)"), whereas implicated subcontraries are tolerant of such a conjunction. 21\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(7) _Löbner's tolerance test_\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|a.

Items aligned horizontally on the positive and negative scales are taken to be directly opposed as contraries (if above the midline) or subcontraries (if below it).22 Using these methods, we can obtain the kind of model illustrated in figure 2.2, with the two scales (positive and negative) systematically related. Then we can predict not only the intrascalar GCIs (e.g., _Several x__j'd_ will implicate 'Not many j'd'), but the crossscalar inferences between the expressions near the I and O corners (e.g., _A few_ _j'd_ will implicate 'Many didn't j' and vice versa). The same procedures of course can be employed over various sets of logical operators. Readers may like to play with quantificational frequency adverbs of the type exemplified by _seldom, often,_ and _rarely_ and see if they can construct the positive and negative scales, the contrary versus subcontrary and contradictory relationships.23\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|2.2.2.2  <br>Entailment Scales over Nonlogical Predicates\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|2.2.2.2.1  <br>General Vocabulary\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|There are many entailment scales that cannot be arranged in a square of oppositions even though they come as paired positive and negative scales.

For example, one can say _It's warm, in fact quite hot,_ but not _?It's cool, in fact quite warm,_ because _warm_ and _cool_ belong to different scales. Moreover, the comparative _warmer_ means 'further towards hot' (not, on analogy to, e.g., _redder,_ 'more towards warm'), whereas _cooler_ means 'further towards cold'that is, the scales are headed in different directions (Horn 1989: 239240). But the two scales form no square because such predicates allow no inner negations, and thus _hot_ and _cold_ are not related like _all_ and _none_ as A to E corners of the square (Horn 1989: p. 245, 548549). The full scales in this case seem to be <_boiling, hot, warm>_ and <_freezing, cold, cool, lukewarm>._ Similar paired scales abound; for example, <_excellent, good, all right>_ and <_awful, bad, mediocre>._ Further examples are given in (62).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(8) a. i.

The normal suspension tests apply as in (9d), showing that the content of (9c) cannot be entailed.

First, mathematics would be in danger: when we assert that the square root of 9 is 3 we do not mean that the square root of at least 9 is _at least three,_ otherwise we could as well say the square root of 9 is 2 (Sadock 1984)special conventions are in force of course, and we may want to distinguish sharply between natural language numerical expressions and cardinal numbers (Atlas 1993: chap. 2). Second, Horn (1972) himself drew attention to the fact that in certain specific circumstances the scales could be inverted, for example in tallying golf scores where the higher score is the lesser number one might felicitously say "He can do the round in seventy two, if not seventy." This possibility of scale-reversal does not appear to arise with other quantifiers (Sadock 1984: 143) and indeed otherwise seems restricted to pragmatically defined scales; this raises the general issue of the extent to which all scales are in the last resort pragmatic in nature, an issue addressed in section 2.2.4.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|But this possibility of scale reversal, coupled with the fact that the implicature can evaporate in contexts like (9e), has led some analysts to abandon the scalar approach to numerical expressions. One position is to claim that the number words are just ambiguous between an 'exactly' and an 'at least' interpretation, perhaps disambiguated in specific linguistic contextsfor example, as 'exactly _n'_ when acting as determiners (see Kempson 1975; this is Kamp's position as reported in Kadmon 1984).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Another approach is to assume that the meaning of, say, _three_ is simply indeterminate at the semantic level between 'at least three' and 'exactly three' and is then further specified by a particularized conversational implicature in context as appropriate, or perhaps restricted by semantic constraints in particular constructions (thus Atlas (1983) suggests that collective NPs have the 'exactly' interpretation). Kempson (1986) and Atlas (1993b) take this approach but for different reasons: Kempson because she wishes to reduce GCIs to PCIs compatible with Relevance theory, 25 and Atlas because he wishes to assimilate the unspecified nature of cardinal semantics to his account of _not,_ which has a similar property. Carston (1985) took a similar line, arguing that _three_ is semantically unspecified between three readings, 'at least three', 'at most three' (as in the reverse-scale cases), and 'exactly three', particular contexts being responsible for our understanding in each case.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The trouble with much of this argumentation is that it confounds general problems of the very existence of GCIs as a species of inference, pragmatic intrusion into truth conditions, the general nature of semantic representations before pragmatic enrichment, so-called metalinguistic negation, and the projection problem for implicatureswith the rather specific difficulties associated with the English number words. The specific difficulties boil down to the following facts.26 First, in math-literate cultures, there will be possible confusion between English _three_ and the numeral '3', with a consequent bias towards an 'exactly three' interpretation. Second, this may be associated with the fact that in some cases the number words are associated with upper-bounding specifications that are not easily defeasible (Kadmon 1984: 30ff; Horn 1989: 251). For example, compare "He has one child", which seems to stipulate only one, with "He has a child", where the upper-bounding implicature is more easily lifted. This may well be due however precisely to an M-implicature associated with that opposition. Similarly, "I have two hundred and three dollars" more strongly suggests an upper bound than "I have two hundred dollars", which can again perhaps be attributed to a Manner implicature: to bother to say "two hundred _and three_" where the shorter "two hundred" alone might be sufficient suggests that there is reason to be precise, and the speaker is acting in accordance with that reason.

Horn (1992b: 172175) indeed abandons the classic scalar approach to just the number words, pointing out a number of additional special properties. Still, when due allowance is made for the special role of number words in math-literate cultures, and consequent possible conventionalization of the 'exactly' readings, there are a number of reasons to hang on to a scalar interpretation of ordinary language numeral expressions in general. One central piece of evidence is provided by those languages that have a finite series of numerals. Many Australian languages, for example, have just three number words, which are glossed as 'one', 'two' and often 'three'. The scalar prediction is clear in these cases: we have a finite scale <'three', 'two', 'one'>, where 'one' or 'two' will implicate _ceteris paribus_ an upper bound; but because there is no stronger item 'four', the cardinal 'three' should lack this clear upper bounding by GCI. And this is clearly the case in, for example, Guugu Yimithirr: _nubuun_ can be glossed 'one', _gudhirra_ 'two', but _guunduu_ must be glossed 'three or more, a few'. 27 And this is the general report (see Dixon 1980: 108). None of the other theories make this correct prediction. Finally, Cruse (1986: 6970) points out that by certain tests for the better establishment of one sense over another, the 'exactly' interpretations of the English number words are psychologically more salient than the 'at least' interpretations, and by the same tests it can be seen that this corresponds with the favored interpretations of the quantifiers (those with doubts about the very existence of GCIs may find this bias interesting).28\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|2.2.2.2.3  <br>Closed-Class Morphemes, Function Words\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Entailment scales can be found among any restricted set of lexemes with semantic asym-\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Grice noted the conundrum that "I went into a house" suggests that the speaker went into someone else's house, whereas "I cut a finger" suggests I cut my own finger. There is in fact no scale <_my, a>_ because possession and indefiniteness are not "about" the same semantic relations; consequently, there is no GCI from "a NP" to 'not my NP', and nonscalar inferences of various kinds would seem to be involved. However, there is an inference from indefinite reference to the inappropriateness of definite reference, for the articles form a Horn scale <_the, a>_ by the usual criteria:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

On the other hand, when I say "I cut a finger" I merely implicate that it was no unique, otherwise salient finger (say, the one I cut before) that suffered, and that interpretation is compatible with the assumption that it was my own finger (which in turn is a more stereotypical reading than one that involves the chopping of other peoples' fingers).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Hawkins (1991) has argued that if this analysis is adopted, many puzzles in the analysis of definiteness seem more tractable. He holds on to an essentially Russellian analysis of the definite article, thereby explaining the entailment relationship between _the X_ and _an X_ (the representation of _the_ contains the representation of _a_ as a conjunct), supplemented with a conventional implicature associated with _the_ that specifies the kind of mutually accessible set in which the referent must be unique. The semantic representation of _a_ is simply the existential quantifier, and the baffling range of uses that are associated with it follow in large part from the Q-implicatures that derive from the contrast with _the._ In general, an indefinite phrase _an X_ seems to be associated with the presumption of nonuniqueness (as in _A senator resigned_), but there are plenty of circumstances in which this presumption is defeated by background knowledge or a constructional meaning, as in existential statements like _Nine has a positive square root,_ or _France has a capital._ The explanation would be that _an X_ picks up its nonuniqueness presumption by contrast to the stronger definite article, in the normal scalar way, except where this is overridden by background knowledge or semantic conditions.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|In those circumstances where the indefinite is read as referring to a unique entity, a definite article is also grammatical, but it tends to force the assumption of a different contextual set in which the referent is unique. Consider (11), where one might expect only a definite article to be possible, given the unique nature of the offices in question, but in fact both the definite and indefinite article can be used.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

In contrast, we read (11b) in a different way: the definite forces us to find some further contextual set in which the referent is unique (e.g., England is hosting the prime minister of France, whereas America is hosting France's president). The explanation seems to be that existential statements tend to take an indefinite object (whose uniqueness may be given by background knowledge), so that a definite NP encourages us to find another construal. These kind of complexities seem consistent with the pragmatic account but not with some more restrictive semantics for the indefinite article (e.g., specifying lack of uniqueness). Note that on this account, the anaphoric potential of the definite, as opposed to the indefinite, follows from the meaning (contrast discourse semantic accounts like Heim 1982). The range of data that can thus be explained by this approach far exceeds other existing accounts of the nature of the definite/indefinite contrast. Before we can fully appreciate this, I need to introduce some further types of implicature, and further observations about the articles are given later in this chapter (see, e.g., remarks on bridging inferences in section 2.3 and on the opposition between article and zero-article in section 2.4.1).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Lyons (1977) advances the view, well supported by diachronic evidence, that the definite article may in some respects be treated as a deictic determiner unmarked for the proximal/distal distinction expressed by _this_ and _that._ Hawkins (1991: 415) suggests that the contrast is essentially that the demonstratives presume accessibility to perception or via discourse, whereas the definite article is neutral (although both presume uniqueness in some set). If this were correct, one might expect a scale < {_this, that_}, _the>_, such that by saying "Could you lend me the book?" one would suggest that the book is not perceptually available in the situation of speech (for then _this book_ or _that book_ would be more informative). Notice that there is indeed a contrast between (12a) and (12b), the first being sayable with my hand in my pocket, or on the telephone, whereas the second requires a demonstration or exhibit of the finger (ignoring for a moment the anaphoric uses of the determiners). 29\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(12) a.

For example, there may well be a Q-contrast between <_this, that>_, where _this_ has more precise criteria of application than _that:_ the proximal deictic is marked for proximity, the so-called distal deictic presumes accessibility (in space or discourse) but is unmarked for proximity, and thus picks up the complementary interpretation. This predicts that _that_ has a wide distribution, potentially overlapping with _this,_ as indeed seems to be the case. Thus for the same spatial arrangement of a book on a table I can say both _I wrote this book_ and _I wrote that book,_ but if there are two books, _that book_ will suggest the one I would not describe as _this book._ This kind of opposition between deictically specified and unspecified has already been suggested by Wilkins and Hill (1995) for 'come' and 'go' verbs in various languages, and may carry over to other sets like _<here, there>._\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|I turn now to anaphoric uses of these determiners. Prince (1981) argues that there is a hierarchy of anaphoric expressions in English, according to the degree to which their referents are mentally activated, as it were. She argues that "the use of an NP representing a certain point on the scale implicates that the speaker could not have felicitously referred to the same entity by another NP higher on the scale" (1981: 245). Developing these ideas further, Gundel, Hedberg, and Zacharski (1989, 1993) outline a Givenness Hierarchy (see figure 2.3) along the following lines, where the stronger requirements are leftwards and the weaker ones rightwards, because any referent that is "in focus" (in central attention in the discourse) is also "activated" (previously referred to, etc.), "familiar," and so on. On the basis of quantitative textual evidence, they claim that the English anaphoric expressions pattern as shown in figure 2.3. But the use of a rightwards expression only _implicates_ that a leftwards one does not\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|<br>\\|<br>\\|\\\|   \\\|   \\\|   \\\|   \\\|   \\\|<br>\\\|---\\\|---\\\|---\\\|---\\\|---\\\|<br>\\\|in-focus >\\\|activated >\\\|familiar >\\\|uniquely identifiable >\\\|type-identifiable\\\|<br>\\\|it\\\|that, this\\\|that NP\\\|the NP\\\|a NP\\\|<br>\\\|zero\\\|this NP\\\|indefinite _this NP_\\\|<br>\\\|unstressed\\\|<br>\\\|pronouns\\\|<br><br>  <br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Figure 2.3  <br>Givenness Hierarchy (after Gundel, Hedberg, and Zacharski 1993)\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Consider tense in English. 30 Harnish (1976, 1991: 354) notes "the use of the past tense often carries the implication that the activity or state indicated by the verb no longer is present"; thus the pattern in (14ab) (see also Comrie 1985: 24). Harnish might have gone on to suggest a scale as in (14c), where it is more informative to know if the event still holds rather than just that the event held at some previous time (because knowing the current situation gives us a unique known instance in time where the event is known to hold, whereas a past tense only assures us that there was some instant at which the event occurred).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(14) a.

Given the linear nature of time, it is also the case that any present event becomes a past event: the past is more event-populated than the present! These considerations, together with the tendency for present relevance of present events, suffice to ensure an informational asymmetry between the tenses even where no entailment relationship holds (strictly, of course, it does not follow from the uttering of _John is sleeping_ at _t_j that John _was_ sleeping\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Bohnemeyer (1998) shows for example that speakers of Yucatec, a language without tense or temporal conjunctions, can systematically communicate temporal information through two kinds of generalized implicature: from aspectual unboundedness one can infer temporal overlap (as in "John came in. Mary was sleeping"), and from aspectual boundedness one can infer temporal nonoverlap (as in "John came in. Mary got up", with order then indicated iconically).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Another area that would be worth reexamining from an implicatural point of view are spatial expressions in closed sets, whether local cases, prepositions or post-positions. Here we can expect all our three pragmatic principles to be involved. For example, <_at, near>_ form an entailment scale, such that _X is at the station_ entails _X is near the station;_ if one then asserts the weaker item, as in "John is near the station" one implicates 'not at the station' (Levinson 1995b: 192194). To understand the full range of pragmatic oppositions between different spatial prepositions, one will need to bring in our other pragmatic principles. Thus, for example, {_on, on top of_} form an M-opposition, such that "on top of the desk" suggests a noncanonical placement (e.g., the object is not in contact with the desk, resting instead on other objects which are themselves directly on the desk) or a noncanonical viewing angle (e.g., the speaker is under the desk).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

The partitive in conjunction with a durative verb like 'read' is specifically noncommittal about whether the event is bounded or not, whereas the accusative is specific that the event is indeed bounded. We then have in effect a meta-scale of the from <BOUNDED, ±BOUNDED>, instantiated by the accusative and partitive cases respectively, such that the use of the unspecified partitive form suggests that a bounded event is not being referred to. The specific interpretations from boundedness to 'read all the book', and from unboundedness to 'read part of the book', can be attributed to the I-principle, which induces stereotypical interpretations; these can also be canceled as indicated in (17c), where the 'read all the book' inference is canceled\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

There may for example be lexical sets or semantic fields giving rise to similar inferences where however the criteria for Horn scales, for example, are not met. To the extent that such inferences are based directly on the structure of the lexicon, rather than ancillary knowledge about the specific context, one might expect them to have a generalized character. In this section, a number of putative kinds of such inference are discussed, but it should be borne in mind here that the phenomena are hardly explored and definitely not fully understood.

It is not presuppositional, as it is nondetachablethat is to say, the inference is attached to the semantical content not the lexical form, and thus the same inference appears from the more or less synonymous pair _<manage, attempt>._ Tentatively, then we shall adopt the view that there are nonentailment scales, which nevertheless carry generalized conversational implicatures.32\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|We may be tempted by other putative scales, where the phenomena are actually rather different:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(19) _Pseudo-scale: <mountain, hill>  <br>_"John can climb hills."  <br>_Implicature:_ 'John can not climb mountains.'\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Here there is not only no entailment relation between the items on the pseudo-scale (the one term excludes the other), there is no intrinsic informational asymmetry.

In a similar way, _you_ preempts the name of the addressee, _here_ preempts the name of the place, and so on. One analysis is that whereas, in our way of reckoning, Tuesdays are multiple (this week's and next week's, for example), during this diurnal span there is only one today. Thus _today_ is informationally richerit uniquely refers, whereas _Tuesday_ does not: there is a scale of referential determinateness with a genuine informational asymmetry, where asserting the weaker item implicates that the stronger does not apply:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(20) _Scale: <today_ = Tuesday, _Tuesday>  <br>_"Let's meet on Tuesday."  <br>_Implicature:_ 'Let's not meet today, _this_ Tuesday, but rather _next_ Tuesday.'\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|I believe that this kind of referential asymmetry is crucial to the understanding of anaphora, as will be spelled out in chapter 4: determinate\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

One way of looking at this is to claim that nonranked alternates, in addition to the ranked scalar alternates, give rise to systematic implicatures: assertion of the one alternate will _ceteris paribus_ imply the inapplicability of others unmentioned, otherwise by the Q-principle the speaker should have mentioned them.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Harnish (1976, 1991: 320) notes that, unlike the case where "the flag is white" implicates 'the flag is white all over', there is no corresponding 'all over' inference associated with such other adjectives as _spotted, stained, torn, dented,_ and so on. On the other hand, it can be noted that there is indeed a corresponding inference with _smooth, rough, warm, cold, shiny, wooden, iron,_ and so forth. One stain is sufficient to warrant the description _stained,_ whereas one spot of white is not sufficient to warrant the description _white_ (without further specification). It is notable that the adjectives without the 'all over' inference seem to lack underived alternates or contrastive terms: the best we can do are the contradictories like _unspotted, unstained, untorn_ (_whole?_), _undented._ And that perhaps is the root of the difference: _white_ belongs to a salient lexical set of alternates that are at most contraries 33 and may simultaneously apply to a single referentthe use of the one term then implicates that the use of the others, which could equally apply, are not applicable in this case.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|These different kinds of example raise the possibility that there is a whole set of distinct but related types of Q-implicature, each bearing a family resemblance to one another, and each deriving from different kinds of contrast set provided by the structure of the lexicon.

In what follows, I make special use of the work by Cruse (1986) and confine myself to different kinds of contrast set (e.g., taxonomies, metonymies, chains, helices). Such an exercise does not appear to reveal simple generalizations, and indeed the remarks below are extremely tentative. The generalized character of these inferences is in general dubious. Nevertheless, looking through these types one can see some general tendency for implicature production of two types (similar, independent observations can be found in Hirschberg 1985: 6061, 65, 108113):\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(22) a. _Type I:_ use of a superordinate (more general) expression, (especially above the "basic level" of Rosch 1977), suggests that the speaker is not in a position to use a (more specific, more informative, "basic level") subordinate expression, or deems it irrelevant:  <br>"I just saw a horrid animal in the larder."  <br>+> 'speaker is not sure whether it was a rat, a shrew, a mouse, or what.'\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|b. _Type II:_ use of an alternate from a contrast set suggests the inapplicability of another alternate, even when both could apply:  <br>"He lectures on Wednesdays."  <br>+> 'As far the speaker knows, he does not lecture on Thursdays.'\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|c. _Type IIb:_ the denial of an alternate in a contrast set suggests that the other alternates may apply:  <br>"He doesn't lecture on Wednesdays."  <br>+> 'For all the speaker knows, he lectures on another day of the week.'\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Note, however, that it is based on an informational asymmetry, and this suggests a parallel to Q-inferences. The Type II implicatures, like those associated with the color terms, are more theoretically puzzling and indeed less systematic but are nevertheless regular in at least some cases. They seem to arise especially in connection with two kinds of lexical sets: sets of compatibles, like the color terms, where an expectation of exhaustivity is raised by the use of one term; and sets that exhibit some kind of intrinsic order (like the days of the week). The inferences in other cases may require special contexts (e.g., following a question: "Does he have pets?", "He has cats" implicates clearly that he has no dogs; see Hirschberg 1985), or special intonation (Ladd 1980; Horn 1989: 230f, 410; Ward and Hirschberg 1985), and thus lie beyond a theory of GCIs. They seem to have a secondary type (labeled Type IIb above), as suggested by Hirschberg (1985), where the denial of an alternate implicates the possible applicability of another. Type II inferences still seem to fall under the rubric of the Q-principle, or Grice's first maxim of Quantity, because they are based on the absence of specified information that one would expect to be provided if applicable.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The generalized nature of most of these inferences must be in doubt. Type I implicatures may lack a generalized status in part because of the potential depth of taxonomic structure in the vocabulary and thus an unclarity of opposition. Matsumoto (1995) suggests that it is choice of a term above the "basic level" terms that gives rise to the inference that the speaker cannot be more specific. He illustrates with kinship terms in Japanese, where, for example, the basic-level terms are more specific than English, so that use of the 'brother' term implicates that the speaker cannot specify 'younger-' or 'older-brother', which are the basic-level terms in Japanese. It is noteworthy that such inferences seem on occasion to have been sufficiently persistent to be a major source for diachronic shifts in lexical meaning. Thus where there are pairs of terms where one (the hyponym) is semantically marked for some feature, say +F, and the other (the superordinate) is unmarked, then the use of the unmarked term can come to implicate the alternative value for the feature (i.e., F), the superordinate thus coming to function as its own hyponym, an "autohyponym" (Horn 1984: 32ff; Lyons 1977: 308311). A thumb is a kind of finger, hence we have five fingers. But normally _finger_ will denote 'digit other than thumb'. Similarly, _dog_ can come to denote 'male dog' in con-\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Note that we can think of these inferences in a similar way to scalar implicatures: <_thumb, finger>_ and <_bitch, dog>_ form ordered pairs where the first member entails the second in a suitable sentence frame, and the use of the second member thus implicates that the speaker is not in a position to assert that the stronger expression holds (hence "I cut my finger" suggests the speaker knows he did not cut a thumb). Diachronically, implicated autohyponymy leads to systematic polysemy (Horn 1984; Kempson 1980).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Type II inferences seem, as mentioned, to have a generalized status in only a few cases, usually over sets of _compatibles_ (i.e., sets of alternate, contrasting, terms that may be predicated of the same individual without inconsistency). The color terms are the prototype case here, as described above. In just the same way, if one asserts "The marble is smooth", one implicates that it is not also rough in some places (i.e., that it is smooth all over), although there is clearly no incompatibility between being smooth in some places and rough in others. The negative Type IIb inferences seem to arise rather reliably from the negation of one alternate to the suggestion that another applies. Here of course one needs to distinguish between the cases where such an inference is more or less necessary (as from "The flag is not white" to the conclusion that it must be another color), as opposed to cases where it is freely invited (as from "He doesn't lecture on Wednesdays" to the inference that he does lecture on other days).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|It is clear that considerably more work is required before such inferences will be fully understood. They depend in part on the structure of the particular semantic fields. Thus "It will be ready on Wednesday" suggests 'it will not be ready on the prior Tuesday', due to the helical structure of the set of names for days of the week. Research is thus required into the distinct kinds of semantic fields (e.g., taxonomies, meronomies; see Cruse 1986) and the way in which they may set up a basis for specific kinds of inference. Many of the inferences that arise in connection with semantic fields are weak suggestions, which are only clearly attributable to the speaker as implicatures in particular contexts; for example, in the context of an answer to a question, as illustrated in (23) below. They thus lie at the borderline between GCIs and PCIs, because on the one hand they rely on the structure of the vocabulary, and on the other hand, they depend on specific contexts to emerge. This prompts a review of this borderline.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

For example, the quantificational scalar implicatures have the systematic properties they have just because the set of, for example, English quantifiers have the logical relations between themselves that are captured in the traditional square of oppositions. The implicatures are parasitic on that structure. It is for this reason that they have the default character they have: they are generalized conversational implicatures because they depend on invariant salient properties of language structure rather than variable contexts.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|But, from the outset of the development of the theory of scalar implicature, it was recognized that in various ways scales may be said to be pragmatically defined. It has already been noted that the cardinal scale can be inverted in special pragmatic contexts, although it appears to be unique for vocabulary-defined scales in this respect. Fauconnier (1975) pointed out that many scalar implicatures seem to be derived from scales that depend on a structure of assumptions beyond the lexicon. To provide a fresh example, the pattern in (24) suggests a scale of driving differentsized trucks, but clearly this is not an entailment scale, nor one based on lexical patterning of another sort, but on general assumptions about the world (permits, or abilities, to drive large trucks normally permit driving small ones, but not vice versa; but clearly the world could be otherwise).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(24) "He can drive small trucks."  <br>_Implicature:_ 'He can't drive big ones.'  <br><Driving big trucks, driving small trucks>  <br>"He can drive small trucks, and indeed/if not big ones too."\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Hirschberg (1985) offers a systematic generalization of these pragmatically given scales and the inferences they allow, but in so doing she\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Hirschberg denies that there is any principled distinction between GCIs and PCIs (1985: 42) and offers instead a theory ranging both over scales given by the lexicon and those given by real-world or pragmatic factors.

A set of expressions may act as a Hirschberg scale, providing there is _any partial ordering relation defined over them in a contextually salient way._ A partially ordered set, _orposet,_ is any set of values V (items ranked) 34 associated with such a partial ordering O; a particular poset is defined by the set of values V and the specific ordering relationship O.35 Because the ordering relation O might consist of an _is-a-kind-of relation,_ we could get a partial ordering <{oak, maple} tree> or if O is the ordering relation _has-parts,_ then <book, {chapter 1, chapter 2, . . .}>. We can accommodate the classical Horn scales as just the special case where O is the entailment relation.36 Alternates (like {_black, white, red,_ . . .} are therefore distinctive by virtue of _not_ being ordered by the ordering relation. The rules for implicature derivation are then:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

But there are a number of problems. 37 The most serious is that the theory will overgenerate implicatures because it offers no constraints on scalehood. One might try to limit the ordering-relations structuring posets in some way, but that is not in the spirit of the theory and it will not be sufficient any way. As we have seen, even the entailment relation will overgenerate if not restricted by our constraints on Horn scales: we do not implicate the negation of everything that entails what we said (if we did, then by saying "two plus two equals four" I would implicate 'It is not necessarily the case that two plus two equals four').38 Hirschberg (1985: chap. 6) suggests that the relevant poset must be salient to both speaker and addressee, but the question then is how this comes about. Although she points to discourse context, prosody, and the like, it is clear that there is no general solution here.39 All implicatures are made dependent on the contextually salient ordering relation, so we have no account of implicature generation without an account of how this is arrived at.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Hirschberg thus sketches a theory under which scalar GCIs and scalar PCIs can be seen to be ultimately related: there are scalar implicatures based on the lexicon (GCIs) and ones based on salient-contrast-in-theworld (PCIs).

Among those he wished to account for are inferences of epistemic uncertainty that arise from both disjunctions and conditionals (see, e.g., Grice 1989: 810). For example, if I say "Sue is either in the attic or in the garden", I implicate that I do not know which. In such a case, the inference cannot be due to the scalar opposition between _<and, or>_, because Sue can clearly not be in both places at once. In any case, the scalar inference would be to 'not both _p_ & _q_', and the inference we are interested in here is to 'the speaker does not know whether _p_, or whether _q_'. The inference is general, but defeasible (as shown by "I hid the prize either in the attic or the garden, but I am not telling you which"), and thus has all the hallmarks of a GCI. Grice's explanation was that, if one knew _p_ or knew that _q_, it would be uncooperative to utter "_p_ or _q_", and therefore that the speaker must have some chain of reasoning in mind that concludes with _p_ Ú _q_ and yet which does not involve as premises plain _p_ or plain _q._\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Gazdar (1979: 5962) has influentially advanced a different way of obtaining the inferences of epistemic uncertainty. He suggests that just as with the scalar implicatures, the inference rests on opposing alternative expressions but, in this case, of a constructional kind. Wherever there is a construction _X_-f, such that _X_-f entails f, and an alternative of roughly equal brevity _Y_-f which is otherwise semantically identical to _X_-f but fails to entail f, then asserting the weaker _Y_-f will Q-implicate that the speaker does not know whether f obtains or not. The Gricean reasoning is, of course, that if the speaker was in the position to utter the stronger _X_-f he or she should do so by the first maxim of Quantity (my Q principle), and if the speaker utters instead the weaker _Y_-f, he or she can be presumed to\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Gazdar (1979) proposed that the implicature from the weaker expression _Y_-f should have the form {_P_f, _P_ ~ f} (i.e., 'for all the speaker knows f, for all the speaker knows ~ '), but I gloss the implicatures informally with _perhaps_ or epistemic _may._\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|In the case of the connectives, neither _If p then q_ nor _p or q_ entail their constituent sentences.

But they are distinct. For example, from "John believes Sue came" we have, via the scale _<know, believe>_, the scalar inference '(The speaker knows that) it is not the case that John knows that Sue came'. That implicature is compatible with the speaker knowing that Sue did not come. But the clausal implicature from "John believes Sue came" is 'For all the speaker knows, Sue came, or Sue did not come'. Thus the clausal implicatures indicate epistemic uncertainty about the truth of the embedded sentences, not the speaker's knowledge of (or belief about) the negation of the matrix clause as in scalar implicatures from the same construction.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The class of relevant verbs giving rise to clausal implicatures includes most of the verbs of propositional attitude (unless like _know_ or _realize_ they entail the truth or falsity of their complements) and most of the verbs of saying (again, unless like _disclose, divulge, admit_ they entail the truth or falsity of their complements) (Gazdar 1979: 61).

Most researchers have acknowledged that these are a distinct subspecies of inference and that, by the Gricean argument sketched, they should fall under the first maxim of Quantity or, as here, the Q-principle (but see Atlas 1993b for doubts). Some though consider there is no reason at all to group them together with their scalar cousins (see Frederking 1996).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|One issue I have left aside here is the relation of these implicatures to presuppositions. Most analysts hold that presuppositions cannot be reduced to matters of implicature and that presuppositions are attached to their lexical or syntactic triggers (and are thus not detachable in Grice's sense; see Levinson 1983: chap. 3 for review). On Gazdar's (1979: 5960) theory whereby clausal implicatures cancel inconsistent presuppositions, it was therefore necessary to exclude the possibility that some expression of the form _X_-f both presupposes and clausally implicates f, otherwise f would be inevitably canceled. This was achieved by stipulation in that theory (by blocking the troublesome clausal implicatures), but the relationship clearly requires further research.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

However it might be answered that such overinformativeness may be confusing in that it is liable to raise side issues; and there may also be an indirect effect, in that hearers may be misled as a result of thinking that there is some particular POINT in the provision of the excess information.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Perhaps the maxims of Relevance or Manner would handle these "indirect effects."

Thus he found no trouble imagining the correlate of such a principle in a nonverbal activity such as passing too many screws when one was required (1975: 47). Zipf (1949) has provided statistical data from many kinds of human activity, including language, that seem to support it. Two observations seem to have worried Grice. One was that Relevance might secure the same effects because too much information would surely be irrelevant (indeed, an infringement of the second maxim of Quantity may also constitute an infringement of the maxim of Manner). The other was that the principle did not, it seemed to him, yield the rich set of inferences one would expect in the category of flouted or exploited maxims (only one clear example being provided in Grice 1975: 52). But that, as it turns out, is the wrong place to look. 41 It is in the observance of the maxim that its effects are most apparent, for there is indeed strong evidence in favor of its interpretive corollary, which as a first approximation might be phrased "Don't provide unnecessary information, specifically don't say what would be obvious anyway" (for much crosslinguistic evidence in favor of such a heuristic, see Haiman 1985a).

As Haiman (1985a: 150) puts it, "there is a powerful tendency in languages . . . to give reduced expression to the familiar and the predictable," a correlation that is "one of the most well-attested in human language." But a tendency of this Zipfian sort could have sources other than the speaker's orientation to some maxim or heuristic.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|There is in fact a great deal of evidence for the existence of a speaker's preference for minimal specifications, and its interpretive corollary, to be found in the extensive literature on the empirical properties of conversation (reviewed in Levinson 1987a: 7998). I will cite just one general observation here. Researchers have noted that there is a decided preference for reference to persons to be achieved by the shortest expression, with the least descriptive content, that will do the job. That this has the status of a maxim, or expected procedure, is shown by the fact that when a speaker is in doubt about whether a brief form will do, the form is often produced with a distinctive rising intonation, and only when lack of response indicates that the recipient has not understood, is a fuller specification given, also with rising intonation; and so on recursively, until recognition is achieved. For example (from Sacks and Schegloff 1979: 19, where the question mark indicates the rising intonation):\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(38) A: . . . well I was the only one other than that that the uhm tch Fords?  <br>uh Mrs. Holmes Ford?  <br>You know uh the the cellist.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif]]\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|B: Oh yes.

Note that a parallel pattern can be observed in self-identifications on the telephone (Schegloff 1979), where (a) intimates expect their identity to be conveyed just by the sample of voice quality in their first "Hello", only escalating step by step, when overt recognition is withheld, with further examples of voice quality, then nicknames or firstnames: "Hello (.) It's me (.) Steve (.) Levinson"; 42 (b) persons less intimate may escalate to self-descriptive phrases: "Hello. It's Les (.) Garston (.) the man who called about the plumbing." Those who doubt the existence of some maxim of minimization (e.g., Carston 1995: 223) must therefore find not only an account of the general tendencies for minimization but also an account of this apparent orientation of speakers to just such a principle.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|I offer the following (after Levinson 1987b) as a first approximation to a characterization of the maxim involved (more elaborate formulations and discussions can be found in Atlas and Levinson 1981, Levinson 1987a,b).

On Putnam's view, meanings are stereotypes that may fail to determine correct extensions; on my view, stereotypes are connotations associated with meanings, but not part of them, which nevertheless play a role in interpretation. 44\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|3. _Informativeness: p_ is _more informative than q_ if the set of states of affairs that q rules out is a proper subset of the set that _p_ rules out (BarHillel and Carnap 1952; Popper 1959).

Zipf (1949) argues that these tend to conflate (e.g., a pronoun is both semantically general and brief). This follows from the conjunction of his Law of Abbreviation ('the more use, the shorter the expression') and his Principle of Economic Versatility ('the more semantically general, the more use'). Equally in the Prague School theory of markedness, the unmarked expression in an opposition is both formally less complex and semantically general, whereas the marked expression is formally more complex and semantically more specific (Jakobson 1939; see also discussion in Horn 1989: chap. 3).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|This characterization is compatible with the original proposal in Atlas and Levinson (1981).

The principles generating the set of competing interpretations were left open in that account, but clearly they should delimit the set of possible interpretations. In the sketch just given, the relevant principles are given a bit more flesh: they include the search for maximal cohesion, or temporal, spatial, causal, and referential connectedness, and the presumption of stereotypical relations and the actuality of referents.

'What is communicated' is MORE PRECISE than 'what is said'." In contrast, Q-inferences were held "to _shrink_ the range of possible states of affairs . . .

I have tried to capture this notion by building into the concept of more specificity (replacing the earlier concept of more precision) the requirement that although the interpretation is (partially) isomorphic with the content of what is said, each constituent may have a more restricted sense and denotation. Thus the phrase _a spoon in the cup_ may have the interpretation 'a metal spoon partially inside the ceramic teacup', _went and bought_ may have the interpretation 'went and then bought', _took a drink_ the interpretation 'imbibed an alcoholic drink', _she bit her nails_ the interpretation 'she bit her own finger nails', and so on. The isomorphism holds of course not at the level of English phrases and glosses but at the abstract level of propositional representation: what is implicated is a specialization of one or more of each of the intensions of what is said. 45 It corresponds to the fact, noted below, that it is usually difficult to express an I-implicature as an unrelated proposition conjoined to 'what is said'.46\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Now, under the I-Principle rubric, I want to collect a whole range of inferences that appear to go in just the reverse direction to that in which Q-implicatures tend. To emphasize the tension, we may say that I-implicatures are inferences from _the lack of further specification to the lack of need for it, whereas Q-implicatures are inferences from the lack of informational richness to the speaker's inability to provide it._47 Under the\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

The claim therefore is not that the same mental algorithms compute this range of inferences but rather that there is a single overarching principle that _licenses_ them, legitimating the application of any of the subprocesses involved, and that this by virtue of its overall relation to the Q- and M-Principles regulates the conditions under which the particular inferences are blocked or canceled. To belabor the point: the I-principle here operates as an instruction to find an interpretation that meets certain requirements (positive, stereotypical, highly specific interpretations).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Now a question that immediately arises is: in what sense are these I-inferences _generalized?_ Most of these inferences interact with shared background presumptions, which might in principle vary, and thus the inferences might have none of the cross-context, even crosslinguistic, invariance that are the hallmarks of GCIs. But at a sufficient level of abstraction, it is quite clear that the kinds of inferences here collectedfor example, conjunction-buttressing, negative-strengthening, preferred patterns of coreferencedo hold as preferred interpretations across contexts and indeed across languages. And at a slightly higher level of abstraction, the different types collected can be seen to share the property of maximizing the informational load by narrowing the interpretation to a specific subcase of what has been said.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

This is just a different theory of Q-type inferences, and I shall leave it to the reader to adjudicate (the theory seems interestingly allied to Hirschberg's PCI account of scalar implicature, which might subsume it). Carston (1995: 221222) notes that the conditional perfection implicature is actually generalized to the point that it may run against stereotypical assumptions: "If you don't mow the lawn, I'll give you five dollars" now suggests that _not_ mowing the lawn is a necessary condition for the speaker's gift. In fact, it is noteworthy that any form of words that suggests a _sufficient_ condition is liable to enrichment to a _necessary_ condition: "Mow the lawn and I'll give you five dollars", "Go on: earn five dollars and mow the lawn", and so on.50 Thus the nature of the inference licensed by the I-principle must be to the necessary condition, provided that is consistent with what is taken for granted (in "If the door is locked, I have a key", the inference does not go through).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Second, some commentators have pointed out a failure of precision, at least in earlier formulations. Carston (1995) for example points out that whereas I have represented Q-implicatures as just the content implicated, not the conjunction of implicature with what is said, I have represented I-inferences in terms of the total signification of what is said plus what is implicated (Levinson 1987a). Correcting this, the conditional-perfection implicature from "If you mow the lawn, I'll give you five dollars" should read 'If you don't mow the lawn, I won't give you five dollars', with the total communicated content 'Iff you mow the lawn, will I give you five dollars'. Carston goes on to note that the implicature alone does not entail the content of what is said, as she thought I claimed, and moreover that as a result my distinction between Q- and I-inferences collapses.51 The failure of precision was regrettable, and occasionally where it matters I use the symbol +> (and the term _implicate_) for the pure implicated content, and ++> (and the barbaric _*implicate_) for the total communicated or conveyed content (or at least for the sum of what is said and the relevant implicatures being discussed). But there is in fact a reason for the lapse: it is difficult, in probably most cases of I-implicature, to represent the implicature alone without that implicature entailing the content of\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

This is not an accident: it follows from the nature of I-implicatures that they are enrichments of what is said, whereas Q-implicatures merely exclude something else that might have been said but wasn't. Thus we can often represent the Q-implicature as a conjunct which does not itself include the content of what is said, whereas I-implicatures are not so satisfactorily represented in this way. For this reason, I will normally cite I-*implicatures in their inclusive form without special typographical conventions.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|However, the lapse has none of the dire theoretical consequences that Carston (1995: 220) hopes for. As stated (apparently not clearly enough) in Levinson 1987a and three paragraphs above, in the case of both Q- and I-inferences (and indeed in all implicatures other than flouts, exploitations, or tropes), the communicated content will entail what is said (otherwise, what would be the value-added content of implicatures?). The difference lies in the character of the value added to what is said: in the case of I-implicatures the inferences are positive strengthenings towards the stereotypical, which make no metalinguistic reference; in the case of Qinferences they are inferences to the negation of statements employing stronger alternative linguistic expressions. I-inferences import rich assumptions about the world; Q-implicatures circumscribe what has been said by what else might have been said but wasn't.

As mentioned, they appear to generate implicatures in opposite directions: informally the Q-principle specifies "What you haven't said you do not mean (otherwise you should have said so)", whereas the I-principle can be glossed "What you haven't bothered to say, you expect me, the recipient, to supply." Thus, if we permit a scale <_since, and>_, which in fact is barred by the constraint that scalar items must be "about" the same semantic relations, then we would obtain implicatures that are not only inconsistent but actually contradictories:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(51) "John turned the key and the engine started."  <br>I ++> 'Since John turned the key, the engine started.'  <br>_Pseudo-scale: <since, and>  <br>no_ Q +> 'It is not the case that: Since John turned the key, the engine started.'\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

But there are cases where genuine clashes occurthat is, where the potential implicatures from Q- and I-principles are inconsistent. In these cases, it appears, as a matter of observation, that Q-inferences always take precedence (or cancel) I-implicatures. It will transpire that single sentences will often engender multiple implicatures. For example, in (52) the disjunction gives rise to a clausal Q-implicature that defeats the I-inference to conditional perfection.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(52) "If you come, he'll forgive you, or even if you don't come he may forgive you anyway."  <br>Q-implicature: 'It's possible that even if you don't come he may forgive you anyway.'

I have noted that conjunction is ripe for I-enrichment: when events are conjoined, they tend to be read as temporally successive and, if at all plausible, as causally linked. 52 There are many rival accounts of this phenomenon (see Lang 1984 for an attempt to embed this problem in the larger range of possible conjunction interpretations). Partee (1984) has suggested that the temporal succession reading works a bit like anaphora: a past-tense event description establishes a reference interval R (intuitively just after the event) that is picked up by the next past tense; if the succeeding clause describes an event, R includes the event; if it describes a state, the duration of the state includes R.53 Similarly, Kamp and Reyle (1993: 521ff) note a presumption of temporal vicinity, which in the case of descriptions of states will be read as temporal inclusion and in the case of events as temporal succession. They observe that this seems not to depend solely on world knowledge and appear to conclude that the matter is semantic or that it at least must be captured in the semantic representation or DRS. The pragmaticist has in fact no quarrel with the representational ideas here but insists on the pragmatic character of the inference, with important implications for the role of pragmatics in the construction of semantic representations, an issue taken up in chapter 3. The formal-semantics tradition, incidentally, says nothing about the causal and teleological\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Nonce-implicature theorists may want to insist that it all depends on content and context and that there is no such default interpretation, but Carston (1995: 232) points out that even when our knowledge of the world would suggest 'q before _p'_, still we attempt to read "_p_ and _q_" as _'p_ before _q':_\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(56) He opened the door and she handed him the key.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Although _He researched the subject and gave some lectures_ carries the normal implicature, there are no sequential implicatures associated with _He is researching the subject and he is giving some lectures, He was researching the subject and giving some lectures, He researches the subject and he gives some lectures,_ or _He used to research the subject and he used to give some lectures,_ which encode overlapping, ongoing activities. If the Aktionsarten of the verbs are mismatched, one suggesting a state the other a dynamic event, we tend to get an inclusion reading as in _He knew he was wrong and apologized,_ or _He slept and fell off the chair,_ or we may force an habitual simultaneous reading out of the dynamic verb as in _He lived in Cambridge and traveled to London._ As well, some sentences with _and_ simply do not have an underlying conjunction semantics: _She went and spoiled her dress_ or _I've got to try andfind it_ involve complex idiomatic expressions of the form _gol try and VP_ (Schmerling 1975). In fact, conjunction reduction in English seems often to grammaticalize specific interpretations (as Schmerling documents). All of these factors are well known, if not well understood, and I mention them simply to emphasize that the I-implicature can only go through when not blocked by this web of semantic factors. 54\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Now these same interpretive tendencies are observable in parataxis or the unmarked adjunction of clauses, which is as predicted: there is no possible Horn scale between nothing (i.e., sheer adjunction) and other linguistic expressions that might give rise to Q-implicatures that would block the I-inference to maximal connectedness (however, I will show that the possibility of a Manner contrast between explicit conjunction and parataxis does arise).

But the range of possible invited inferences is much wider with parataxis as shown by (57c) with the assumed temporal order reversed from the clauses, an interpretation not available to the same sentence with an explicit conjunction as in (57d) (Gazdar 1979: 44). In fact, sheer adjunction of clauses is often sufficient to invoke a diversity of complex interclausal relations, as in Bloomfield's "It's 10 o'clock, I have to go home" (see Matthews 1981: 32ff; Hobbs 1979). Indeed, many languages make do without the complex set of intersentential connectives available in English, using parataxis instead. For example, the Australian language Guugu Yimithirr lacks sentential disjunctions, indicative conditionals, and sentential conjunctions, which are all signaled paratactially (in the case of disjunctions and conditionals, with the addition of dubitative or emphatic particles). The following examples indicate how one would translate English sentences with connectives: 55\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(_58_) _English target:_ 'Either he died or he didn't.'  <br>Nyulu biinii    nguba, nguba   gaari.  <br>he      died perhaps, perhaps not  <br>'Perhaps he died, perhaps he didn't.'\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(59) _English target:_ 'If you go, you'll get meat.'  <br>Nyundu budhu dhadaa, nyundu minha maanaa bira.  <br>You      maybe go         you      meat   get        for sure  <br>'Maybe you will go, (then) you will certainly get meat.'\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(60) _English target:_ 'I came and he left.'  <br>Ngayu gaday; nyulu dhaday.  <br>I         came   he      left  <br>'I came. He left.'\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Although it may be unusual for the _main_ way of expressing conditionals to be parataxis (plus or minus emphatic particles), many languages can optionally express conditionals through parataxis.

In some languages, there is a clear opposition between explicit conjunction and sheer parataxis, with parataxis suggesting a closer more integrated sequence of events, and sentences explicitly conjoined suggesting that the events either took place at a different time, or were not connected, or involved different protagonists, and so forth (Haiman 1985a: 111115). An account of this can be given in terms of the I- and M-principles, in a pattern that will shortly become familiar: minimal forms invite maximally rich interpretations, maximal forms defeat them.58 Haiman goes on to suggest that there is a clinc of the form _conjunction > parataxis > gapping/reduction_ where the more reduced the form, the greater the suggestion that the two events are actually a single complex one.59\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The classic cases of "bridging inferences" (Clark and Haviland 1977) occur in paratactic (asyndetic) constructions (but the inferences go through in explicit conjunctions too), and they seem to be forced by the attempt to find coherence across the two conjoined or adjoined clauses.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Double-negatives, litotes (like _a not insignificant achievement_), and their implicatures fall under my third maxim, the M-principle.

This amounts to the following (potentially confusing) conclusion: the negative of a gradable, which is in fact a weak contradictory including the middle ground, implicates the contrary, its antonym, excluding the middle ground. Figure 2.4 may help to clarify and show how this implicature informationally restricts, and thus strengthens, the negative predicate exemplified in (63).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(63) "It was not a good thing to do."  <br>I ++> 'It was a bad thing to do.'\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The implicature appears to be restricted to the denial of the unmarked antonym (_good, tall, large_ etc., as shown by the neutral question form, e.g., _How tall is he?_ which does not presume that he is tall). The process is fairly, if not entirely, general. It may be partly motivated by the polite avoidance of disparaging antonyms or by euphemism. Thus Greenberg (1966b, cited in Horn 1989: 336) notes that many languages have no word for 'bad' because it is so routinely implicated by 'not good'. Note that, as discussed above under the Q-principle, gradable predicates of these sorts sometimes form scales, with associated implicatures from the assertion of the weaker expressions and from the denial of the stronger ones. One might therefore expect complex interactions between Q- and I-implicatures here, but on the whole they do not occur. This is because (a) the scales are split and never encompass both antonyms (there is no scale _*<good, bad>_ as there is <_excellent, good>_) and (b) the unmarked pair of the gradable predicate (e.g., _good_) is usually the weaker item in a scale with an extreme value as the stronger (e.g., <_excellent, good>_ with negative scale <_not_-\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

The remarks in this section are based on Horn's excellent account. In the period of transformational grammar when it was assumed that there should be a direct relation between meaning and deep structure, it was proposed that this interpretation, whereby the sentence is read as if the negation occurred in the lower clause, should be explained by supposing that the negative was downstairs in deep structure and derivationally raised (hence the epithet Neg-raising [NR], which the modern reader may prefer to think about in terms of interpretive Neg-lowering). In that case, it was noted, the negative could be moved from arbitrarily low down in the sentence, providing the predicates over which it jumped were of a certain type (see (65b)). The relevant predicates governing this phenomenon appear to be verbs of mental activity or desire (_think, believe, want_) or impersonal verbs embedding sentences like _It doesn't seem likely_ or _It is not to be expected that he'll come._ But why?\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The syntactic analysis no longer fits with today's syntactic theories, and in any case it runs into trouble with the fact that allegedly raised negatives can be lexicalized as in "Nobody believes he'll do it", which implicates 'Everyone believes he won't do it' (Horn 1978). This leaves the possibilities of explanation in terms of semantic ambiguity or pragmatic enrichment. The essential semantic observations are as follows:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

The NR-reading (or interpretation) entails the literal L-reading, 62 but not vice versa; the NR-reading is thus more informative than the L-reading. Or to put it another way, the NR-reading is the stronger contrary, whereas the L-reading is the weaker contradictory (see figure 2.5):\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(67) "It's not probable that the Dow Jones will recover"  <br>++ > 'It's probable it won't recover.'\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|3. Only some verbs permit the NR-reading; many verbs of propositional attitude, or other verbs allowing internal negations of subordinate clauses, like _know, realize, be certain_ do not (e.g., "I don't know that he came" cannot be read 'I know he didn't come'). In general, the class of verbs permitting NR seems to be a subset, in any language, of verbs of opinion, volition, obligation, probability, and perception (Horn 1978, 1989: 322323).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(68) a.

Second, there are generalizations to be captured by taking the alternative, pragmatic approach that are unavailable to the idiom/ambiguity approach.

The categories of predicates responsible have resisted any simple semantic generalizations (indeed have baffled generations of linguists), and the processes are indeed not entirely predictable. But there is a good, if not exceptionless, overall generalization about which predicates allow the NR-reading, which can best be stated in Horn's arithmetic scalar model. Take the set of predicates indicating epistemic states, states of knowledge, opinion, and the like: in English, these include _know, realize, be certain, be evident/clear/sure, be odd/significant, believe, suppose, think, be likely/probable, seem, appear,_ and so on. Let us extract as a coherent set that form a pair of positive and negative scales the epistemic adjectives <_certain, likely, possible>_ with corresponding negative metascale <_impossible, not likely, not certain>._ Then we can map these onto the arithmetic square of oppositions as shown in figure 2.6 (from Horn 1989: 325), with the strong items in a contrary relation, the weak items in a pragmatic subcontrary relation, and the diagonal lines across the square (e.g., from _certain_ to _not certain_) constituting contradictories.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|By Löbner's test, _likely_ and _not likely_ are intolerant: _*It's likely she'll go and likely she won't,_ so are placed above the 0.5 midline, whereas _possible_ and _not certain_ are tolerant (_It's possible but not certain she'll go_) and therefore belong below the midline. By the suspension tests _likely_ is below _certain_ (_It's likely, and indeed certain_ . . . but _??It's certain, and indeed likely_ . . .) and so should be placed just above the midline. Now it turns out that it is predicates in this position, just above the midline like _likely,_ that permit NR-interpretations: thus "It's not likely that she'll come" suggests 'It's likely that she'll not come'. Stronger intolerant predicates generally do not ("It is not certain that she'll come" fails to implicate 'It is certain she will not come' 63). And weak, tolerant ones like _possible_ likewise do not have NR-readings ("It's not possible she'll come" fails to implicate 'It's possible she will not come').\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Horn's generalization is that NR-readings can only occur with (a relatively weak) intolerant predicate _P_ if both the contrary _P~_ and the\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Because only tolerant predicates can have contraries (intolerant ones below the 0.5 line will have only subcontraries), it follows that only intolerant predicates (scalar items above the 0.5 line) yield NR-readings. Besides, the contradictory of a weak scalar like _possible_ (namely, _impossible_) is informationally stronger than its subcontrary (_possible not_), so there can be no implicature to a stronger subcontrary. But why should strong intolerant predicates (e.g., _know, be certain_) be barred from NR-interpretations? The answer that Horn gives (1989: 326ff) is that the NR- interpretations are only possible when the difference between them and the literal L-interpretations carries minimal functional load: "a lower-clause understanding for higher-clause negation tends to be possible only when the two readings for the outer-neg\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Clearly this condition is not met in the case of a strongly intolerant, strong scalar item like _know:_ there is an enormous informational gulf between the contradictory (_not knowing that p_) and the contrary (_knowing that not p_): NR-interpretation here would magically convert our ignorance into knowledge (would it were so easy)!\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|I return now to the question: what type of implicature is responsible for NR-understandings? It is immediately evident from the figure above that NR-interpretations cannot be due to the Q-principle. In fact, they work in exactly the reverse direction: they run _upwards_ along the negative scale (here <_know-not, not-believe>_). But this of course is just what the Q-principle in general disallows: if there is a stronger alternate expression on a scale, then the Q-principle enjoins you to use it if it is applicable. That is why there is no implicature from "I don't know that _p_" to 'I know that not _p':_ if you had meant the latter, you should have said it. Inferences that do work in the reverse direction are I-implicatures, and NR-inferences must be I-implicatures. They have the necessary hallmarks: (a) they are inferences to a more informative proposition that would entail what is said (the implicature as usual for I-inferences not being representable as an independent proposition from what is said); (b) they do not impose an additional negation on the already negative understanding of the utterance; (c) they are not metalinguistic (there is no necessary reference to other linguistic itemsthe inference is from a contradictory to a contrary); (d) as in many other kinds of I-inference that invite a stronger\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

One can find pairs of almost synonymous predicates where one allows NR-interpretations and the other doesn't: compare "I don't want to go" I ++> 'I want to not go' with "I don't hope to go" with no implicature 'I hope to not go'.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|b. NR-interpretations are often signaled by the inclusion of negative polarity items that occur _as if_ the negation was syntactically in the lower clause. Thus one can say _I don't think he knows anything at all,_ but not _*I think he knows anything at all._ Similarly _I don't want to go at all_ is fine, but _?*I don't hope to go at all_ is odd. These are the hallmarks of partial conventionalization or "short-circuited implicature" (Horn and Bayer 1984; Linebarger 1991).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|In short, the systematic crosslinguistic tendency for NR-interpretations can only be explained in terms of a general pragmatic process like I-implicature. 64 No theory of nonce implicature can explain the regular tendency. On the other hand, its domain of application is strictly bounded by the other informational maxim, the Q-principle: in fact, the very occurrence of NR is a leakage in the blocking mechanism whereby the Q-principle bounds the I-principle. We can be grateful for the leakage because it makes clearly visible the antinomic character of the two principles (which some like Carston (1995) have doubted), even if it is a bit of a theoretical embarrassment. The embarrassment is lessened by noting that NR-inferences are protected from extinction by partial conventionalization. The full path of conventionalization can also be noted, whereby _not likely_ becomes lexicalized as _unlikely,_ which can then only have the contrary, 'likely not' reading associated with NR.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

As far as the present account goes, in so far as the second submaxim ("avoid ambiguity") is interpreted to include semantic generality, it will be partially accounted for under the Q-principle (because it will in general be less informative to express a general interpretation where it could have been avoided by choice of another expression). Genuine ambiguity is otherwise rather hard to avoid: the simplest sentences tend towards multiple ambiguities, as work in natural language processing has demonstrated. The fourth submaxim, "be orderly," relates to the larger issue of iconicity in language: because speech is linear, the main dimension of iconicity is order. I take this to be a natural cognitive propensity, whose implications have been explored elsewhere (Haiman 1985a,b), and I have some doubts that it has maxim status, because its effects may be largely achieved by the I-principle. 65 The third submaxim, "be brief," has both an informational and a formal aspect. The informational aspect is subsumed under the I-principle (maxim of Minimization), whereby semantically general expressions pick up specific reference, and I noted that by Zipfian principles, semantically general expressions also tend to be more frequent and thus briefer in form. Nevertheless, the formal aspects of "avoid unnecessary prolixity" (M3) and the first submaxim (M1), "avoid obscurity of expression," survive in my scheme as a single Manner principle. Manner elements survive in rival schemes, too, but not as independent principles.

Horn thus conflates informational minimality and expression brevity within R, and informational maximality with expression markedness within Q. The underlying reason to resist this conflation in my scheme is that the three principles Q, I, and M are here considered heuristics, which are invoked by the kinds of linguistic expressions employed: just as the use of an item from a contrast set suggests that the contrastive items would be inappropriate, or the use of a minimal expression invokes a maximal interpretation, so the use of a marked expression signals an opposing interpretation to the one that would have been induced by the use of an unmarked expression. Each heuristic has its mode of invocation, and in the case of the M-heuristic, it is the _form_ of the expression rather than its meaning that performs this service.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The version of Grice's Manner maxim that I favor is one that reduces it to a single simple principle that has been much commented on by analysts with other axes to grind, and in fact Haiman's (1985a: 147) formulation (grinding his own axe, the iconicity underlying much grammar) is quite similar to my (shamefully) independent formulation of the same era. He suggests, as a first approximation, that "Formal complexity corresponds to conceptual complexity." But a better rival formulation, "Morphological markedness corresponds to semantic markedness," he points out, is not quite a corollary because semantic markedness encompasses not only conceptual complexity but also unfamiliar, infrequent concepts.

On the formal side, marked forms, in comparison to corresponding unmarked forms, are more morphologically complex and less lexicalized, more prolix or periphrastic, less frequent or usual, and less neutral in register. On the meaning side, such forms suggest some additional meaning or connotation absent from the corresponding unmarked forms. The notion of _same sentence frame,_ which needs further explication along structuralist lines, is intended to restrict the substitute _U_ versus _M_ expressions, so that, for example, the opposition between actives and passives will not come under this principle, which is of restricted scope.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|2.4.1  <br>Horn's (1984) Division of Pragmatic Labor\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The M-principle as here stated builds in Horn's (1984, 1989: 197ff) "division of pragmatic labor," on which indeed the present idea is based (Horn in turn borrowing from McCawley 1978). For the record, Horn states the division of pragmatic labor in terms of his Q- and R-principles: his Q is pretty much equivalent to both my Q plus my M, whereas his R principle is roughly coextensive with my I-principle. Thus where the implicatures of unmarked alternates pick up the central, stereotypical subset of denotations by my I and his R, the marked expressions implicate the complementary extension by my M but his Q. (I hardly need to point out that the roots of these ideas are as old as structural linguistics: clear formulations of similar principles can be found in Bréal 1900, Saussure 1916, and Bloomfield 1933).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The central observation is that M-implicatures seem to be essentially parasitic on corresponding I-implicatures: whatever an _unmarked_ expression _U_ would I-implicate, the marked alternative (denotational synonym) _M_ will implicate the _complement_ of _U_'s denotation. The Gricean reasoning, of course, is that the speaker seems to have gone out of his way to avoid using the unmarked expression and so must be trying to avoid whatever the unmarked expression would suggest.

Horn (1984: 3237) makes further remarks on the relation of diachronic studies of lexicography to Gricean principles.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|A more interesting area for the synchronic study of the lexicon is derivational morphology. Often, there are two or more rival derivational routes, as from verb to noun: thus we have from _inform_ both _informant_ and _informer._ As Kiparsky (1982) points out, this can occur only if the two forms pick up different extensions, but otherwise an existing derivation preempts a new one: _to cook_ is the source of the noun _cook,_ 'one who cooks', and this blocks _cooker_ with that sense, but not with the sense 'thing that cooks'. (Often blocking is complete: there is no _braker_ 'thing that brakes' from _to brake_ given the preexisting blocking noun _brake,_ except in child language where it occurs; q.v. Clark 1993: 118.) Horn (1984: 26ff) relates this to his Q and R (here corresponding to my M and I) principles; the regular, unmarked formation picks up the stereotypical extension, often narrowed in the typical wayso _informer_ becomes not only 'one who informs' but also 'one who informs against his own'; _informant_ is the marked derivation and picks up an exclusive (if not complementary) denotation, as in the linguistics usage. (Historically, the _OED_ entries suggest that _informant_ may once indeed have picked up the complement, before itself becoming associated with betrayal, an association now lost.) By Kiparsky's generalization, "avoid synonymy," the outputs of derivational processes must be semantically contrastive, but they may be assigned rather different extensions: thus _sealer_ is one who seals (documents or woodwork), but it may also refer to a layer of\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

The gradual increase of lexical knowledge requires constant adjustment in the meanings of the already learned lexicon. If a learner doesn't know the verb _to row,_ then on the analogy with denominal verbs like _sail,_ he or she may coin the verb _to oar;_ later discovery of the verb _to row_ may not result in immediate blocking of _to oar._ Rather, the child may try to maintain the hypothesis of a contrast in meaning, by perhaps assigning the new verb _to row_ a superordinate meaning over _to oar, to paddle,_ or _to sail_ (Clark 1993: 94). Similarly, children produce regular inflections like _goed_ at the same age (or even after) they are correctly saying _went,_ because they appear to have assumed that _went_ is a different verb with a very similar, but contrastive, meaning, and this hypothesis may be maintained for years (Clark 1993: 103f). The prediction from Horn's division of pragmatic labor is that where the child has two words like _to oar_ and _to row_ not only will they be assigned distinct meanings by the Saussurean or Clarkian principle of contrast, but also that the more regular formation may initially (and often incorrectly) be assigned the more stereotypical, central denotation. 67\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|2.4.1.2  <br>Lexicalized Forms versus Periphrasis\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Often, an existing lexicalization may be in opposition to a periphrastic alternative. Take a simple example like _pink_ versus _pale red_ (McCawley 1978: 245246, after Householder). _Pink_ preempts the central values of that color; thus although one might well define _pink_ as 'pale red', an utterance "The dress is pale red" would suggest (by M-contrast with _pink_) that the dress is not prototypical pink but somewhere between _pink_ and _red._ Such observations have often been taken to be an argument against lexical decomposition, but of course they merely establish the existence of pragmatic contrasts. Note that _pale blue_ carries no such implicature to 'not the prototypical value of whitish blue', because there is no contrasting lexicalization. Modal verbs often allow periphrastic alternatives, and the distribution of interpretations is then often in the predicted direction:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(78) a.

Thus the unmarked interpretation is not definitively coded in the lexical causative; rather the inference to the stereotype is itself implicated. Thus in (83), although (83a) suggests the stereotype and (83b) suggests the complement, there is no anomaly in (83c) despite the fact that the _by_-phrase cancels the assumption in (83a).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(83) a.

Many languages have lexical causatives and regular causative derivational morphology: in this case, the longer derivational form is restricted to human (or animate) causes, presuming the indirect causation of a verbal command: one says in effect 'He stopped the ball' but 'He made them come to a stop' (Haiman 1985a: 109110).

We have already seen the pattern whereby "I don't like garlic" Iimplicates 'I dislike garlic'; that is, where the contradictory gets strengthened to the contrary. There are many lexical items incorporating affixal negatives in English, like _impossible, unhappy, inhuman,_ or _noncommunist._ The lexicographer's problem is to explain why these sometimes mean the contrary but sometimes the contradictory of the positive: _unhappy_ means\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

There are constraints on the I-implicature from the contradictory of lexeme _W_ to the contrary of _W._ Simplifying somewhat, the inference only goes through if:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|1. the base expression _W_ is a relatively weak positive scalar item, thus one notes the absence of _*dislove_ but the presence of _dislike,_ and\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|2. _W_ is affectively positive, so we have _unhappy_ implicating '(nearly) sad', but _??unsad_ if allowable at all, not implicating 'happy' (and so on for _impolite_ vs. _??unrude, unhealthy_ vs. _?unsick, unwise_ vs. _??unfoolish,_ etc.), 69 and\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|3. the negative form is relatively unproductive, i.e., not-W is relatively lexicalized. This is something of a gradient affair, along the scale from most productive to least productive: _non_- _> un_- _> in_- _> dis_- etc.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|These conditions predict that we will get pairs of affixally negative lexemes like the following, where only the first of each pair can have the strong contrary reading: _immoral_ vs. _non-moral, irrational_ vs. _non-rational, un-Christian vs. non-Christian, inhuman_ (or _unhuman_) _vs. non-human._\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The third constraint, the more lexicalized the more likely to have a contrary reading, is actually a side effect of the fact, described in chapter 1, that the O corner of the square of oppositions tends not to lexicalize but is instead typically instantiated as the contradictory negation of the A corner (thus we have _not all_ rather than the hypothetical _*nall,_ on the model of _none_). If the O-corner expressions do get their negatives fused, then they have to be interpreted as having moved up the negative scale towards the E corner.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|We are now in a position to tackle double negations. Not every negative of a negative is equivalent to a positive. In particular, if _W_ is a positive item, and ![C0167-01.gif](../Images/2313c84b4dba0ce6f9c3a2a26b043744.gif) is the contrary of _W, ~_ (![C0167-01.gif](../Images/2313c84b4dba0ce6f9c3a2a26b043744.gif)) will not be equivalent to _W,_ as figure 2.8 makes clear. Thus _not unhappy_ is logically compatible with both being happy and being neither happy nor sad, although it pragmatically suggests the latter. The two negatives in this case are not equivalent to the positive (_happy_) for logical reasons. On the other hand, saying "It's not true that he's not happy" is indeed logically equivalent to the statement that he is happy. For this reason, no pragmatic motivation is necessary for the use of negated contraries of the kind _not unhappy, not_\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

So, when someone asserts "It's not impossible" (i.e., it's not not-possible), logically he might as well have said "It's possible." Note that some of these negated contradictories have superficial similarity to the negations of contrariesfor example, _not unuseful_ is logically equivalent to _useful,_ while we have seen how _not unhappy_ is not equivalent to _happy_so the analyst must beware. This frequent figure of speech (the negation of the contradictory) needs a pragmatic motivation, and it is of course given by the Hornian division of pragmatic labor: if two expressions have the same denotation, the marked one will pick up the interpretation complementary to the unmarked expression's.

But the consensus (or at least that extracted by Horn) is that the inference may go either way: (a) it may suggest that the property described falls short of the positive or (b) that it exceeds the positive or that the positive needs emphasizing (as in "I was not unaware of the problem" suggesting that the speaker was indeed acutely aware). The learned commentary suggests indeed that the (b) use is parasitic on the (a) use: by asserting "I am not an ungenerous man" I might implicate that I am something less than fully generous, but because modesty would be reason for that, I may in fact implicate something less modest. Thus polite understatement may be a factor in the extreme value readings. The Hornian division of labor is of course neutral to the swing of interpretation one way or the other (which may well be conditioned by politeness or other factors; see Horn 1991a: 91), but it predicts that whatever is meant is complementary to what the plain positive would have meant.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Let us return now to the cases first raised, the negation of the contraries, which I set aside as justified in use by their logical properties. Now the pragmatic division of labor suggests that even when justified by the logic of a negated contrary, such cumbersome forms as _not unhappy,_ with all the compounded processing difficulties of negatives of (special) negatives, may also be justified by pragmatic specialization. Why not say the simple positive disjunction "He's happy or content"? It seems that "not unhappy" is used rather to suggest that something less than fully or extremely 'happy' holds: although not quite equivalent to 'content', it seems to exclude the extreme value of happy. For this reason, the rhetoricians seem to have swept these cases in with the denial of the contradictories: in many cases, they have a similar weakening force.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

The second strongly suggests that it depicts the child (otherwise why not say _the picture by the child_ or even, dialect permitting, _the picture of the child's?_). The _of_ construction of course doesn't encode 'depiction of': _the best picture of the Louvre_ clearly allows the possessive reading, and _the guns of the warship_ has nothing to do with pictures at all. The generalization is just that the briefer, morphologized suffix of possession suggests by I-implicature a closer, more intimate relation between the NPs, and the choice of the lexical _of_ construction discourages this by M-implicature. Note here a fact of some interest, which we can find elsewhere too: we sometimes find a double-marking, as in _the picture of the child's,_ and this can have the effect of returning us to the interpretation associated with the unmarked form. If expression "X" I-implicates restriction to denotation _D,_ and expression "Y" M-implicates restriction to the complement ![C0170-03.gif](../Images/8c7116f92011eec2e00be9c92a842a5b.gif), then expression "Z" which M-contrasts with "Y", suggests the complement of ![C0170-03.gif](../Images/8c7116f92011eec2e00be9c92a842a5b.gif), which of course is _D._\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Possessive constructions in many languages offer two forms, one associated with "inalienable" possessions (kin, body parts, etc.) and another associated with "alienable" possessions (houses, horses, etc.). Haiman (1985a: 130136) points out that the inalienable relation is almost invariably expressed with a less prolix form, so that there is an iconicity between the reduced bulk of the expression and the intimacy of the relation.

Thus _She went to the office_ I-implicates 'to do the associated activity (i.e., to work)' because there is no possibility of the shorter expression _*to office,_ and thus no M-implicature can arise from _the office_ to block the I-enrichment.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Nominal compounds in English, and in many languages, have an unmarked N-N form. Assuming that the semantic relation between the nouns is no more than an existentially quantified variable over relations, the exact relation must be inferred. Grammars of English give a dozen or more patterns, with relationships like N1 powers N2 (_windmill_) or N1 has N2, (_doorknob_), and so forth (see, e.g., Quirk, Greenbaum, Leech, and Svartvik, 1972: 10211026). Note that the interpretation is not fixed: a _wood container_ could be a container for wood or of wood. A glance at any technical manual shows that this is indeed a productive system, and the relationship must be inferred in such novel compounds as _ferrule ring, antenna coupler, standby memory, key protect indication, power lock,_ and so on. The I-induced interpretation, we have seen, is usually to a rich relationship between the nouns, as fits most plausibly with stereotypical assumptions. But if one tries to spell this out lexically, the resulting utterance often has distinct implicatures: compare _matchbox_ (the box), _box of matches_ (box containing matches), _box for matches_ (nonprototypical box specially made for containing matches), and so on. Intuitively, the N-N form suggests a dubbing or naming of a specific relation that the recipient should be able to infer; any spelling out of the relation suggests (by M-implicature) some other relationship between the nouns.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|In the discussion of the I-interpretations of conjunction and parataxis, we have seen that in English many of the same interpretations are available for sentences of the form "A and B" and "A.

He fell" I-implicates 'He broke his leg because he fell', an interpretation that is blocked by the insertion of _and_ in "He broke his leg and he fell." In English, the systematic opposition between _and_ and zero is perhaps undermined by two factors, (a) the often obligatory requirement for _and_ within a clause (_*He came _ went, *Sue _ Mary came_), (b) the tendency for the phonetic reduction of _and_ to a single assimilated nasal as in "He came'n' got it." In other languages, more systematic oppositions have been observed: in Turkish, Ono, Fe?fe? Bamileke, and other languages, the absence of the conjunction between two actions by a single actor carries the meaning that they constitute one single complex action: saying in effect "He went to the market _ he bought yams" implies that the yams came from the market, whereas "He went to the market and he bought yams" may imply that the yams came from elsewhere (i.e., there were two independent actions) (Haiman 1985a: 111115). In some languages, the effect is weak but discernible: in Sissala, for example, "When [the conjunction] _a_ is left out, . . . one would expect the event to happen exactly according to the stereotype or scenario. . . . The addition of _a_ . . . might alert the hearer to some minor departure from stereotypicality" (Blass 1990: 250).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|English conjunction reduction, though, fits the same pattern of interpretation. In this case, the gap is a grammatically conditioned reduction subject to constraints of various sorts, most obviously the identity of the subject across two clauses. Example (86a) strongly suggests a single complex action of store-going-in-order-to-whiskey-buy. 70 The sentence (86b) suggests some contrast with such a single-minded whiskey expedition; he may, weak soul, have gone to do the weekly shopping and been tempted by a bottle of whiskey. When the explicit conjunction is reinforced with _both_ as in (86c) or with _in addition_ as in (86d), we seem to be dealing with a list of actions and not a single expedition of any kind at all.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(86) a.

Under the I-principle, I have already briefly reviewed evidence from conversation analysis for a maxim of the sort "choose the minimal referring expression that will achieve identification" (after Sacks and Schegloff 1979; Schegloff 1972, 1979, 1996). In the same sort of way, many linguists have noted a scale of referring expressions _zero > pronoun > name > description,_ so that the more toward the left an item is, the more likely an anaphoric interpretation is preferred.

These issues, perennially controversial, will be covered in depth in chapter 4.

Any principle of contrast, however, will predict some meaning difference between the use of a form "X" and "X-X." The prediction from the division of pragmatic labor, however, is that where "X" I-implicates restriction to the subset of denoted entities _D,_ "X-X" will pick out the complement ![C0174-01.gif](../Images/17b05ed8ebbc68ead32d952253480282.gif); where "X" carries no clear I-induced restriction, or nonstereotypical exemplars are salient in the context, "X-X" should implicate a narrowing to, for example, an extreme or prototypical variant of _D._ Hence we have both _Oh we're just living-together living-together_ (roommates, not lovers), and _I want a salad-salad_ (a real lettuce salad, not a tuna salad, etc.) (Horn 1993: 4851).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Two preliminaries: First, not every instance of a repeated form "X-X" is to be understood as a repetition or reduplication for pragmatic effect; it can be determined by good structural principles. For example, the phrase _a rich, rich man_ is structurally ambiguous, as usually perhaps indicated in the prosody:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(88) a.

Second, the linguistic terminology is here confused, with one author's _duplication,_ another's _reduplication,_ and so on. I follow Naylor's (1986) recommendation to follow Sapir (1921: 76) on a wide notion of reduplication:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Nothing is more natural than the prevalence of reduplication, in other words, the repetition of all or part of the radical element. The process is generally employed, with self-evident symbolism, to indicate such concepts as distribution, plurality, repetition, customary activity, increase of size, added intensity, continuance.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The term reduplication can nevertheless be restricted to a morphological process of word formation, repetition thus denoting word and phraselevel duplication. As Sapir (1921: 77) noted, "it can hardly be said that the duplicative process is of a distinctively grammatical significance in English . . . we must turn to other languages for illustration" (cited in Naylor 1986: 177). However, before leaving English, it is worth noting the following patterns of repetition (partly from Quirk, Greenbaum, Leech, and Svartvik 1972: 618).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

It is possible, as Naylor (1986) suggests, that one could adopt an analysis where the sequence of forms introduces a sequence of reference points, giving us an aspect-like characterization of _he ran and ran_ or _he grew angrier and angrier_ or, alternatively, an interpretation as a sequence of reference points along a time-line as suggested by Partee (1984) for different cases. But this will not give us an analysis of _blue, blue sea,_ or _doctors and doctors,_ and so on. Because this is a highly productive process (unreduceable to a small list of idioms), I am inclined to a pragmatic interpretation. 71 Note that the interpretations are richer than, for example, Quirk et al.

In Tzeltal and Tzotzil, for example, whereas the use of nonreduplicated color terms picks out the prototypical, stereotypical hues, the reduplicated terms indicate that the color in question deviates from the relevant focal or prototypical hue (Berlin 1963: 216). In Australian languages (Dixon 1980), reduplicated verbs may have aspectual meanings (as in Dyirbal _gunbal-gunbal_ 'cut repeatedly'), but we also find clear M-inferences to the nonprototype extensions as in Western Desert _wati-wati_ 'kids pretending to be men' (vs. _wati_ 'men'), or _kintha-kintha-la_ 'little dog' (vs. _kintha_ 'dog') in Dyari. Perhaps the most extended study of this kind of reduplication is that by Botha (1988) for Afrikaans, where root reduplication is a highly productive kind of derivational morphology. The traditional grammarians of Afrikaans list about 13 distinct kinds of meanings that result (Botha 1988: 9295), many in opposed directions: thus _bakke-bakke_ 'lots of bowls', but _ruk-ruk_ 'a few times, occasionally'; or _dik-dik_ 'very thick', but _skop-skop_ 'tentatively kick'; or even _troppe-troppe_ 'scattered flocks' versus _tien-tien_ 'ten together'. Botha's valiant attempt to specify a single semantic rule of interpretation involving the notion of increased value is therefore less than fully convincing. Rather, some fairly complex pragmatic process of interpretation may be suspected, and the M-principle is certainly a candidate: if _dik snye brood_ means 'thick slice (of) bread' and I-implicates a stereotypical generous slab, then _dik-dik snye brood_ M-implicates something different from that\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

If _skop_ 'kick' tends to I-implicate 'kick hard', then _skop-skop_ will suggest 'less than hard'. Whether the inference goes in the intensity/increase direction or the attenuation/limited dimension seems to depend on the direction of I-inference from the unreduplicated form, the reduplication then picking up the complement.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|There is much literature on partial reduplication, too extensive for review here. But it is worth pointing out that even in this area, often deeply built in to morphological processes and subject to all the vagaries of meaning associated with derivational morphology, there are some cases worth the pragmaticist's attention. Many languages have a means of giving a word sheer extra bulk. In Tamil, for example, there is a kind of reduplication known as echo-word formation, where the first syllable of a multisyllabic word is repeated after the word with the initial consonant altered by rule. The interpretation is always to shift the interpretation away from the prototype extension of the word (cf.

The antinomic tendencies of these two principles are well brought out in Horn's (1984) version of the story. Q-implicatures thus appear to induce the negation of the very sort of stronger interpretation that the I-principle encourages. Atlas and Levinson (1981), on whose principles Horn drew, suggested that this clash is in part resolved by constraining the Q-principle appropriatelyin particular, by setting up two further constraints on scales: expressions can only form a ranked Horn-scale if they are (i) equally lexicalized and (ii) are "about" the same semantic relations, as reviewed above. Nevertheless, where genuine inconsistencies appear, it was suggested that Q-inferences have priority over I-inferences that are inconsistent with them.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Note, though, that I-inferences often come about through reduced forms, which are then outside the scope of the Q-principle. For example, I suggested that <_the, a>_ form a scale, such that use of the indefinite suggests that the speaker is not in a position to use the definite. There is also a zero-article form for certain places and institutions, which is associated with an (at least partially conventionalized) I-inference to stereotypical associated activities. But because this has a zero realization, it fails the lexicalization constraint on scales and can play no role in the definiteness scale, and has an independent existence:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(98) a.

But first let me illustrate how this resolution schema works.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|First, I want to illustrate the way in which Q-inferences seem to defeat I-inferences. 74 Consider a conjunction like "Bill entered the room and Harry left." As I have shown, we tend to interpret this, as licensed by the I-principle, along the lines 'Bill entered the room, and then, perhaps as a result, Harry left the room'.75 Now the disjunction "Bill entered the room or Harry left" carries no such temporal and causal inferences. That is because the use of the disjunction carries two Q-implicatures: the scalar inference 'It's not the case that both Bill entered the room and Harry left' and the clausal inference 'For all the speaker knows, Bill may or may not have entered the room, and Harry may or may not have left it'. These Q-inferences are clearly inconsistent with the I-inference, which requires the conjunction of events, and it is an observable matter of fact that the I-inference simply is not associated with the disjunction.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Conditionals give rise (according to the account in Gazdar 1979) to (potential) clausal Q-implicatures, and it is these Q-implicatures to the speaker's epistemic uncertainty about the embedded clauses that account for the very general tendency for pragmatic inferences of a consequent to be suspended by mention in an antecedent. This pattern holds for scalar implicatures (as in _If not all of the boys came, some of them did_) and even presuppositions (as in _If there is a king of France, he is probably bald_), as reviewed in Levinson 1983 (pp. 142145, 223225). It also holds for I-inferences, as illustrated by the following (note that I revert to the explicit epistemic modification of implicatures, with all but the clausal implicatures embedded under a belief operator _K,_ in order to bring out the inconsistencies):\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(101) "John drank three beers and drove home, if not in the reverse order."  <br>_Q-clausal inference from second clause:_ 'Possibly he did it in the reverse order', i.e., P(John first drove home then drank three beers)  <br>_Potential I-inference from first clause:_ 'John drank three beers and then drove home', i.e., K(John drank three beers and then drove home)\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

But why? It is fairly clear why both the Q- and the M-principles should have priority over the I-principle: they are both metalinguistic principles that work by reference to what the speaker migh otherwise have said but hasn't. In short, the speaker has gone out of his or her way to produce an utterance that suggests otherwise than the straigh inference to the stereotypical or canonical subcase. The relative priority of the Q-principle over the M-principle is presumably attributable to the relative importance of informational content over expression modulation This line of explanation is based on the idea that the I-principle legitimates the working assumption "enrich!" in the normal case, and the other principles serve to constrain that enrichment. Another way of looking at it is to compare the phenomena to blocking in morphology and syntax: the more specific rules block the application of more general rules. Thus inferences based on highly constrained sets of lexemes (Q-inferences) block those based on wider ranging contrasts in markedness (M-inferences) which in turn block those based on stereotypes about the world and the inference of maximal cohesion (I-inferences). The need for such blocking rules is clear in default reasoning systems: as Lascarides and Asher (1993: 444) note, "we want a defeasible logic to validate the inference in which the more specific rule is preferred."\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Let us now turn to the question of subspecies of inference types.

Indeed the whole issue of implicature projection has not been taken seriously hitherto, with the exception of Gazdar (1979). I have already noted Gazdar's (1979: 5659) claim that implicatures should be blocked by any logical operators whose scope they fall within, and Hirschberg's (1985: 73) restriction of this blocking rule to negation (accepted by Kadmon 1987 and Horn 1989: 234). I pointed out that in fact no such blocking under negation is necessary, once the systematicity of negative scales is appreciated: thus, an utterance of the form ". . . not . . . some . . ." invokes the scale _<not-some/none, not all>_, in which the offending expression is the strongest member and therefore generates no scalar implicatures. 78\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|In fact, I shall take Gazdar's (1979) projection mechanism as a first approximation to what is required.

The important concept of _defeasibility_ is thus modeled in terms of filtering by inconsistent, higher ordered assumptions. There would be other, more complex reconstructions of that concept, as discussed in chapter 1 under the rubric of nonmonotonic inference systems, and there are perhaps reasons to think one may have to escalate in that direction especially when we move outside the domain of GCIs (see, e.g., the fifth point in the next paragraph).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|In various other ways that hardly need to be spelled out, this filtering system is an idealization. First, Gazdar's (1979: 130) model is a model of speaker's commitment, not actually a model of mutually accepted propositions as appropriate to conversation (in this respect, it borrows from Hamblin's (1971) model of a speaker's commitment slate), although that modification looks feasible. Second, the model cannot handle retraction, and more importantly it cannot handle implicature cancellation at arbitrary distance. The notion of utterance in Gazdar's model follows the Bar-Hillel (1954) concept of a sentence-context pairing, but in fact it is clear that implicatures can be canceled from across sentences, as in "I ate some of the biscuits. In fact, I'm dreadfully sorry, they were so delicious, I ate them all." For this reason, I propose in chapter 3 that implicatures must be kept distinct from other assumptions so that they can be later canceled from theoretically arbitrary distance. 80 Third, in the case of tropes (e.g., ironies and metaphors), what is entailed may sometimes be canceled by what is implicated (e.g., "Chomsky is never inscrutable", said ironically, might implicate 'he is always inscrutable'). Fourth, there are probably constructional differences in the order in which clauses are incrementedfor example, in theories such as DRT the antecedents of conditionals contribute to the context before the consequent (Kamp and Reyle 1993: 147ff). Such construction-specific cumulative rules were employed in earlier models of presupposition projection (see Soames 1982 for a summary), and as I show in chapter 3, they may play a role in how GCIs are interpreted. Fifth, the central concept of addition under _consistency_ runs into trouble with particularized implicatures attributable to the maxim of Relevance, which I assume to be centrally concerned with the relation of utterances to the presumed goal-structure of the ongoing activity to which the discourse is contributing.81 Consider for example:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(109) A: "Well, what did you achieve today?"\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|B: "Oh I went downtown and dealt with some bills."  <br>_B's utterance potentially I-implicates:_ 'I went downtown and then dealt with some bills.' or 'I went downtown in order to deal with some bills.'\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Generalized implicatures can play a role in "fixing" the propositional content of statements and the entailments of that content. This of course threatens any such scheme as the one sketched above, where entailments cancel implicatures inconsistent with them, unless such pragmatic intrusion into truth conditions has a systematic basis (which, in fact, seems to be the case).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Despite these insufficiencies, the proposed model is a useful first approximation for the purposes of modeling just the kind of inferences we are concerned with herenamely, the generalized implicatures. And I shall presume that something along these lines is at least a productive research strategy to follow. Some theorists interested in GCIs seem to suggest a pessimism that any system of this kind will work. 82 Nonceimplicature theorists, who refuse to countenance the existence of GCIs, may look at these projection complications attending GCI theory as a giant _reductio ad absurdum,_ the last epicycles of a Ptolemaic system. Surely a theory with less maxims or principles, a Copernican alternative, is to be preferred? It may seem that the fewer the principles, the fewer the clashes between rival inferences there are likely to be. But that is not the case: there will simply be fewer ways to classify the rival inferences, and so fewer ways to specify traffic rules between them. Similarly, nonceimplicature theorists (those who only grant the existence of PCIs) fail to attend to the problems of inconsistent inferences arising from different clauses. It may indeed be a general assumption in our conscious phenomenology of communication that "it is the first interpretation to occur to the addressee that is the one the communicator intended to convey" (Sperber and Wilson 1986: 169), but this uniqueness can only be achieved by a massive pruning, a veritable massacre, of lexical and structural ambiguities, pragmatic resolutions of deixis and anaphora, and the myriads of pragmatic inferences that arise. GCI theory, by suggesting default heuristics, greatly restricts the dimensions of the task, at least in this corner of utterance-meaning.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Grice developed a theory of implicature not because he had any overriding interest in, for example, conversational understanding, but because he saw correctly that a theory of preferred interpretations would make possible a reassessment of what aspects of the meaning of particular linguistic expressions are really semantically specified and which aspects come about through a process of interpretive enrichment. This program, when pushed through in the sort of way we have explored in the previous chapters, renders problematic and "up for grabs" the correct division of labor between semantics and pragmatics in the explanation of many aspects of meaning. These possibilities have hardly been explored. We have already seen, for example, that GCIs may be responsible for the assignment of scopethat was the import of the discussion of the Neg-raising examples in chapter 2 (see also Bach 1982, 1994: 129130; Hobbs 1996). Similarly, GCIs seem to play a role in the fundamentals of reference, as noted in the discussion of the scalar implicatures associated with definite versus indefinite determiners; this is a theme further explored in this chapter, 1 but especially in the next. Many specific alleged ambiguities, of both a potentially structural and lexical kind, might succumb to an account in terms of monosemy (semantic generality) plus or minus implicatures (Ruhl 1989). There are perhaps specific historical reasons, but no good intellectual ones, for why the Gricean program in this direction has not been pushed further through.2\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

It turns out that GCIs have fundamental implications for the way in which we should construct an overall theory of meaningin particular, for what we may call (somewhat grandiosely) its _architecture._ I shall assume that "meaning" is essentially compositethat is, that we need to carve up the semiotic pie much in the way that Grice envisaged, into the component entailments, conventional implicatures, presuppositions, felicity conditions, GCIs, and PCIs associated with particular expressions on particular occasions of use. 3 To describe and analyze these different aspects of meaning, we will need distinct bodies of principles (each constituting a component in the overall theory); for example, semantic inference is based on monotonic principles, but many aspects of pragmatic meaning are defeasible and nonmonotonic in character. We then have to ask: How do these elements or components of meaning interact? That I take to be a question about the architecture of a theory of meaning. Chomsky (1965) introduced a highly influential way of thinking about this: he suggested that the traditional levels of linguistic analysis (syntax, phonology, semantics) should be thought of as independent _components_ or modules, with the interaction between components being conceived of in terms of _logical priority__that_ is, the interaction being determined by what kind of _input_ each module needs.4 He was thus able to finesse the central interesting question of the control and flow of information between components by building a solution into the components themselves (each component transforming a specific type of input into a specific kind of output appropriate as input to another component, such that the logical ordering of components does not need to be stipulated).5 In the theory of meaning, we seem to have inherited this thinking: semantics is normally held to be _logically prior_ to pragmatics, and thus semantics is _autonomous_ with respect to pragmatics in just the way that Chomsky imagines syntax to be autonomous with respect to semantics. This chapter attempts to demonstrate that this is simply not a tenable way of thinking in the theory of meaning.6\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The crucial fact that I will try to establish is that generalized conversational implicatures seem to play a role in the assignment of truth-conditional content.7 This may seem not only a distinctly odd idea but even definitionally impossible, because implicatures are often partially defined in opposition to truth-conditional content. Some scholars have therefore argued that any such inferences should be called something else (e.g.,\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

However, there are convergent strands of thinking that are heading toward the same general conclusionnamely, that a rethinking of the pragmatics/semantics interface is in orderso that my particular thesis (that generalized implicatures can contribute to truth-conditional content) is merely one of a number of contributory arguments. Other arguments heading in the same direction can be found, on the one hand, in new pragmatic theories like Sperber and Wilson's Relevance theory and the artificial-intelligence work that goes under the rubric of "local pragmatics" (e.g., Hobbs et al. 1987); and, on the other hand, in new semantic theories like Situation Semantics (Barwise and Perry 1983) and the context-change theories of semantic representation (as in the Discourse Representation Theory [DRT] of Kamp 1981 or the File Change Semantics of Heim 1982). These trends, together with the evidence adduced here, do indeed suggest that the entire theory of meaning requires a radical new architecture that will integrate old insights in new ways. My purpose is to be brash about the implications, to try and force them onto the agenda of those engaged in formal semantics.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Although the arguments here can be taken as contributory to these general trends, they are also intended to favor some of them against others. Thus I believe the results favor a DRT conceptualist approach to formal semantics, where there is a specific kind of level of mental representation for meanings (Kamp 1981) over the realist position favored in Situation Semantics (Barwise and Perry 1983). I also believe that the results argue against Sperber and Wilson's (1986) Relevance theory by showing that generalized implicatures exist and play a systematic role in truth-conditional content. The facts also argue against the AI work in local pragmatics where scalar implicatures, for example, play no role in embellishing logical forms. In this sort of way, I hope to advance the\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

To spill the beans: essentially, I argue that the theory of meaning has the components or levels we always thought it hadit is just that we have to reconstrue the kinds of relations that hold between them. Thus, semantics remains the familiar beastit consists of two rather separate processes: one that cranks out a level of semantic representation (albeit much more abstract and underdetermined than used to be thought) from surface structure, and another process of semantic interpretation that interprets a richer level of representation (where truth conditions, entailment relations, or sense relations can be captured). Both levels of representation are closely related to linguistic structure, and they are intimately connected because the first level of representation is functionally constrained by the role it has to play in semantic interpretation. Pragmatics too encompasses more than one process: on the one hand, default inferences can be calculated on the fly, given fragments of semantic representation; on the other hand, further pragmatic inferences (of both a specific and default character) can be calculated given the results of semantic interpretation. The novel suggestion here is that _semantic and pragmatic processes can interleave, in ways that are probably controlled by the constructional types in the semantic representation._ Where pragmatic inferences end up embedded in semantic representations or their interpretations, I shall talk about _intrusion;_ some kinds of intrusion are relatively uncontroversial, but the systematicity of GCI intrusion has not been properly appreciated, and it is this that requires a rethinking of the semantics/pragmatics interface.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Although this picture is relatively conservative, the interaction between pragmatic and semantic factors raises many terminological problems: what has happened to the distinctions between semantics and pragmatics, sentence-meaning and utterance-meaning, what is said and what is implicated? What do we mean by "semantic representation" when even the first level may involve pragmatic disambiguation and the second level is shot through with pragmatic contributions? I attempt no terminological reformation here, and this is largely because many of the old notions are good enough, _provided_ we focus on processes or operations on representations rather than on the representations themselves. The representations are going to become strange, hybrid semantico-pragmatic entitities, but the processes that construct them and interpret them are perhaps just\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

There are enough new varieties of semantic theory, each constantly evolving, to make it well nigh impossible to predict how each would maneuver around every pragmatic shoal. It will often be the case that some semantic reanalysis might be able to absorb the particular example of what I am arguing to be implicatural content. My strategy is thus to try and foresee and deal with the counterarguments as far as this is possible but also to simply flood the opposition by showing that there is a vast range of data that would be simply explained by general pragmatic processes, but that would require an insuperable amount of ad hoc semantic reanalysis (if that were possible at all).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Once again, I will concentrate on just one, very large set of pragmatic factsthe generalized conversational implicatures (GCIs) that are the subject of this book. In certain respects, this may amount to an artificial restriction because the general theme to be explored is the extent to which pragmatic inferences in general contribute propositional content. But there are particular reasons to concentrate on GCIs. One is that (under-explored though they are) they are well understood in comparison to any other kind of pragmatic inferencethere are clear predictions about what interpretations should arise in what conditions. Second, it is the default nature of GCIs that causes them to be deeply entangled in grammar and semanticsthey are both hard to distinguish from encoded content, and they exert functional pressure on syntax, lexicon, and semantics (we have already seen for example, that there is a redundancy constraint: certain kinds of GCIs block grammatical and lexical encodings; see Horn 1989). Third, it is not clear that particularized conversational implicatures play the same kind of role in fixing propositional content (but see section 3.5.1.1 and, e.g., Bach 1994).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Let me summarize the kind of theory of GCIs that has emerged in the preceding chapters:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|1.

However, as Atlas and Levinson (1981: 1ff) note, two utterances with the same truth conditions (e.g., _It's done_ and _It's done and if it's done, it's done_) can have quite distinct implicatures (see also the discussion in of litotes in section 2.4.1.3, and why, in particular, ~~ _p_ does not have the same import as _p_).

Here, there is a logical ordering of operations, so that the syntax provides strings with structural analyses, selected between by a disambiguation device of some sort (usually not directly addressed in linguistic theory). The disambiguated structure can then be associated with a semantic representation or logical form, which in turn can then be associated with a model-theoretic interpretation, but only after the "fixing" of indexicals with the aid of a highly restricted kind of pragmatic inputnamely, the values of the pragmatic indices obtaining in the speech situation. The interpretation is then taken to provide a proposition expressed by the utterance on an occasion of use. The output of the semantics is then the input to the pragmatics, where Gricean mechanisms provide augmented (and occasionally, as in "flouts," altered) interpretations.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|In this chapter, I examine two major kinds of problem for the received view. The first problem, covered in section 3.2.1, is that even if we accept Grice's rather restricted account of what is involved in fixing what is said, namely the factors already mentioned (reference identification, deixis, and disambiguation), implicatures can be seen paradoxically to play a role in the establishment of what is said. This leads to an interesting chicken-and-egg problem about the priority of what is said versus what is implicated. At this point, it will prove useful to pause to consider possible responses. The second problem, examined in section 3.3, is that the content of generalized conversational implicatures can fall within the scope of logical operators and other higher level processes of semantic composition. In section 3.4, I turn once again to reference fixing, now in detail, and show that GCIs interact with some of the crucial philosophical distinctions in reference. These three lines of evidence converge in requiring a rejection of the received view of the semantics/pragmatics interface and point in the direction of a new architecture for the theory of meaning.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|3.2.1  <br>Grice's Circle: Implicatural Contributions to "What Is Said"\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|An initial problem for the received view is just this: Grice gives three preconditions to determining what was said: (a) identifying the referents, (b) fixing the deictic parameters, and (c) disambiguating the linguistic string in question.

Suppose we take the last NP of the sentence to have the structure: [[some cats] and dogs]. Then _he likes some cats_ has the scalar (Q) GCI 'he doesn't like all cats'; this interpretation is compatible with the first clause, which implies that he likes all dogs. Now suppose instead that we take the NP to be structured this way: [some [cats and dogs]], with the interpretation 'he likes some cats and he likes some dogs'. Then there will be a GCI 'he likes some-but-not-all cats and some-but-not-all dogs'. But such an implicature is inconsistent with the first clause _He's an indiscriminate dog-lover;_ if we then reject the syntactic analysis that gives rise to the inconsistent implicature, we'll arrive at the right bracketing of the NP.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|This account has some plausibility and some generality.

The literal content of (6a), roughly glossed in (6d), does not predispose us one way or the other. But the GCI in (6e) biases us toward the (6b) reading, as in (6f), because otherwise it will take special circumstances (e.g., variable hearing loss, uneven quality of firecrackers) to explain why the protagonist only heard some but not all of the (presumably equally loud) firecrackers that went off in the kitchen.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|GCIs may participate in the disambiguation of lexical ambiguities, especially perhaps through the I-inference to stereotypical extensions. Thus the kind of disambiguations often attributed to brute encyclopedic knowledge may be mediated by Gricean procedures: the speaker must presume that the addressee will use the same salient stereotype (regardless of its factual probabilities) to resolve the ambiguity (as in _He took another drink,_ where _drink_ is interpreted as the alcoholic variety).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|If the observation that GCIs can select between ambiguities is correct and fully general, it is perhaps not self-evident why. GCIs are cancelable; thus given a context inconsistent with them, they quite routinely evaporate. The answer must be that the recipient works on the assumption that the speaker would so design his utterance that, other things being equal, the predictable GCIs would go through. 11 Thus given the option of preserving the implicatures, an interpreter generally chooses that interpretation that will do so.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|These examples are less than fully natural because they attempt to isolate just one kind of pragmatic inference at a timein many, more natural, examples, GCIs of many different kinds collaborate, as it were, to favor one reading among a set of ambiguous ones:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(7) a.

Thus the expression _these three glasses_ has the semantic content 'these glasses of cardinality no less than three'. It follows that, in the absence of gesture, the expression might equally designate either set of glasses. Yet the utterance would be perfectly felicitous in the circumstances sketched, because any interpreter would use the GCI 'at most three' to resolve the indexical reference. (Without such pragmatic resolution, the utterance ought to be anomalous; because it isn't, we must assume that GCIs play a role in fixing indexical reference.)\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Consider now example (8b). The expression _some of those apples_ is consistent with all of those apples but is delimited by a GCI to 'some but not all of those'. It is the pragmatically delimited set, a proper subset of the apples, that is introduced as a discourse referent by _some of those apples._ This is shown by the fact that the following demonstrative pronoun _those ones_ must refer to a subset of the apples (cf. similar observations for nonindexicals by Kadmon (1987)). If the phrase _those ones_ is both anaphoric and deictic, which I believe is the right analysis, then the truth conditions for _those ones are for you_ are dependent on the GCI that restricts the set of apples to less than all. The point may be sharpened by the subsequent contrastive referring phrase: without the pragmatic restriction on _those ones, the other ones_ has no clear denotation.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Example (8c) makes a simple but very general point. Indexical parameters are not alone sufficient, on the whole, to give one a reasonably circumscribed denotation (the one clear exception is the pronoun _I,_ which is individuated by the speaker parameter alone; but see (9a)). For example, _here_ denotes some region inclusive of some part of the speaker's immediate location; _bring it here_ might mean 'bring it to my fingertips' (imagine the surgeon, in need of a scalpel, to the nurse) or 'bring it to Los Angeles' (perhaps we are talking about something that needs no exact location, like an advertising blimp).

This, I have argued (Levinson 1987a,b) is a natural by-product of the I-principle (Grice's "Don't say more than necessary"). Thus if you intend coreference, you should make the referring expression short or semantically general. The recipient's corollary is: "From a semantically general, minimal reference form choose the interpretation that maximizes informative content," which will generally amount to a preference for local coreference. On this account, example (12a) has a preferred reading (more or less regardless of how many competing prior antecedents for _he_ there may be) in which _he_ is coidentified with _John._\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(12) a.

Thus in the right circumstances, the pronoun may be coidentified with the subject as indicated in (12d).

The inference is supported by the I-induced submaxim "Don't state what can be inferred" and is line with our stereotypical expectations of the kinds of materials bridges can be made of. (Some theorists [Heim 1982, Kadmon 1987] have supposed that the inference is motivated only by the "accommodation" of the definite referring expression (_the wood_) which requires a familiar or given antecedent; but the bridging inference in the indefinite version in (13b) shows that more global I-principle processes are involved.)\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The second kind of example in (13c) (due to Kempson 1986) is interesting because it shows that definite expressions acting as variables under explicit quantification may still require pragmatic bridging: the assumption must be made that each car has one battery.

Thus the content of (15f) might be little more than 'John has height'!

On the original Gricean or standard Radical Pragmatics view, the lexical content of such expressions is taken to be their weakest exhibited meaning, with the assumption that the pragmatics supplements the expressions to give their stronger interpretations. Thus, for example, one takes _or_ to have as lexical content the specific meaning of inclusive disjunction, strengthened to exclusive disjunction by the GCI based on the scale _<and, or>_, which yields a 'not both' implicature from the failure to use _and._ Let us call this the _weak univocality_ view. On another view, energetically purveyed by Atlas (1979, 1989), the lexical content of expressions may be indifferent, or semantically general over, both the weak and strong interpretations. On this view, the lexical content is also weak, but it is not specific. For example, Atlas (1993a) maintains that the semantic content of _three_ encompasses both the weak interpretation ('at least three') and the strong one ('exactly three'), and is specialized in context. He dubs this the _semantic generality_ view. However, because both views involve semantic generality (either based on the weak interpretation or on an overarching abstraction), I use the phrase to cover both kinds of analysis.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|GCIs play a systematic role in generality narrowing.

Intuitions about truth conditions are very much more specific: surely when we say _Larry's book is about negation_ the proposition expressed depends on the implicit pragmatic narrowing of the generality associated with the possessive. The possessive encodes that there is _some_ intimate relation between Larry and the book, but it is an inference guided by Gricean principles on the one hand and contextual information on the other that gives a specific content to that relation (see also Sperber and Wilson 1986), and thus plays a role here in reference determination. It is worth pointing out that all the oblique cases in Casemarking languages have this kind of semantic generality (as with Latin Ablative, which expresses source, cause, agency, instrument, deprivation, or direction from), so that no reasonably circumscribed proposition will be expressed without pragmatic resolution of the semantic content.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|3.2.7  <br>Some Interim Conclusions: Responses to Grice's Circle\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The argument so far is this. Grice's account makes implicature dependent on a prior determination of "the said." The said in turn depends on disambiguation, indexical resolution, reference fixing, not to mention ellipsis unpacking and generality narrowing. But each of these processes, which are prerequisites to determining the proposition expressed, may themselves depend crucially on processes that look indistinguishable from implicatures. Thus what is said seems both to determine and to be determined by implicature.

Then truth-conditional content depends on most, perhaps all, of the known species of pragmatic inference; or the theory of linguistic meaning is dependent on, not independent of, the theory of communication. Starkly: general pragmatic inference (not just thesupposedlylimited phenomenon of indexicality) is crucial input to semantic interpretation. Those who hope that a theory of linguistics will be a theory of a closed mental module (fnbsp; la Fodor) will have to yield up semantic interpretation to another module or mental process. These conclusions have already been reached and stoically accepted by Sperber and Wilson (1986, 1995: 257258) and their followers on the grounds of partially different but parallel arguments. 17\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Grice's circle seems to require at least two applications of Gricean pragmatics. Not only will we need the Gricean inferences to determine truth-conditional content, but we will also need the inferential mechanisms in just the way that Grice imagined, namely to give us postsemantic pragmatics. This is because we still need an account of the double-barreled flavor of ironies, indirections, and other tropes-two propositions are expressed: the so-called literal meaning and the full speaker-meaning. And the only way to get two levels is to have the literal proposition fixed prior to a second batch of pragmatic processing. Figure 3.2 makes the point graphically, with two layers of semantic processing interleaved with two layers of pragmatic processing. (Once again, such a diagram is not to be mistaken for a processing modelit just indicates which kinds of information are prequisites to which kind of assignment of meaning. The two boxes labeled "pragmatics" are here presumed to constitute one and the same component or kind of process.18). Grice's circle is the dilemma I wish to focus on here. Does it require a rethinking of the relations between semantics and pragmatics, perhaps even of the whole nature of modular interaction as currently envisaged in linguistics?

Implicatures of course have truth conditions too; and (it may be claimed) the intuitions about truth conditions of sentence-tokens are simply being mixed with the intuitions about truth conditions of utterance-tokens. Thus in the cases of generality narrowing and indexicality narrowing reviewed above (sections 3.2.6 and 3.2.3, respectively), the Obstinate Theorist can simply claim that the proposition expressed has indeed a near-vacuous semantic content, triggering pragmatic narrowing.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|In the case of disambiguation, OT can simply opt to resolve ambiguities postsemantically; that is, for each _n_-ways ambiguous string, the semantics must provide _n_ propositional contents, which can be selected between by a later pragmatic process. As for ellipsis, we need to distinguish two kinds of cases: (a) the cases that are rule-governed (as in VP deletion) and for which a semantic interpretation can be algorithmically provided; and (b) the cases that are pragmatically construed. For the latter, we need a theory of subsentential phrasal semantics that will give us satisfaction conditions for sentence fragments. The satisfaction conditions can then be the input to the pragmatic component, which will yield a full proposition, the one elliptically expressed.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|But the Obstinate Theorist has an Achilles heelnamely, the cases where reference is determined by implicature (these will include some of the I-narrowings, as in _Larry's book,_ and some of the indexical resolutions, as in _some of you,_ as well as the cases in section 3.2.4). For if the extensions of the parts are partially determined by implicature, the extension of the whole expression cannot be calculated without pragmatic input. Thus in these cases, insistence on postsemantic pragmatics will yield no propositional content at all, and thus no grist for the postsemantic pragmatic mill: without something to work on, the pragmatics cannot rescue the semantics (in the way that it may be held to in the cases of semantic generality approaching semantic vacuity).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The main purpose of this chapter is to show that the Obstinate Theorist's position is simply not tenable however attractive it may seem at first sight.

Thus Sperber and Wilson (1986) and Kempson (1986) make a distinction between _explicatures_ and _implicatures__explicatures_ explicate logical forms, which are then input to interpretation yielding propositional contents, which in turn are then input to the implicature-deriving process. This distinction will only be of interest if the range of explicatures is somehow of a special restricted kind, a disjoint type of inference or at least a distinct subset of the processes called implicature. For example, it would be an interesting (although, it will transpire, a probably false) claim that only GCIs, rather than particularized implicatures, can play a role in proposition determination.

It follows that semantics stops before any pragmatic processing begins. Thus linguistic semantics has nothing directly to do with propositions: it characterizes a level of logical form or semantic representation that is algorithmically derived from syntactic information. Semantic representations are syntactical objects; their _interpretation_ belongs to the Fodorean central processor, where a theory of communication belongs. 19 Let us call this move _semantic retreat._\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Notice that semantic setreat has characterized Chomsky's thought all along apart from a brief and uncharacteristic flirt with the feature-based semantics of Katz and Fodor in the mid 1960s. The level of LF is not only syntactical (uninterpreted) but actually just a slightly modified level of syntax. Curiously, even Katz's position is also a kind of semantic retreat because his markerese is an uninterpreted syntactical level of representation, supposedly algorithmically derived from syntactic input. The greater richness of Katzian Semantic Representation over Chomskyan LF, and the correlated claim that semantic inferences can be captured by markerese, is just an expression of the greater optimism on Katz's part that pragmatic intrusion is minimal!

Consequently, none of the traditional notions of semantics, like entailment relations, sense relations, or any other kind of necessary meaning relations, hold at this level at all. There can be no principled objection to the setting up of such a level of representation if it solves important problems (and in fact I assume a similar level below). But clearly, the burden is then on the theorist to complete the picture and reconstruct the notions of traditional semantics on another level.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|3.2.7.4  <br>Enlarged Indexicality\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|A fourth move we can make is to treat pragmatic intrusion of the type illustrated above as a kind of enlarged indexicality. For example, Sag (1981) outlines a way in which metonymic shifts of reference (e.g., from _Plato_ to 'Plato's works') may be captured using Kaplan's _character/content_ distinction. In essence, an expression has an intension only relative to context, which fixes the intension (and thus the extension) in that context. I discuss this proposal in more detail later, but I believe it cannot work in the cases presented here, given the defeasibility of implicatures.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|A similar strategy would seem to be the preferred move in Situation Semantics (Barwise and Perry 1983), although in this framework in addition to the utterance situation providing indexical parameters, there may also be resource situations (i.e., other contextually pertinent situations) that serve to fix contextual variables. In contrast to the Generality-plus-implicatures approach, this approach must assign to apparently general predicates some kind of implicit but built-in placeholders for indexical or contextual material. For example, just as _behind_ in "John is behind the tree" is, despite appearances, really a three-place predicate (BEHIND (John, tree, reference-point)) so _tall_ in "John is tall" is really a two-place predicate (TALL (John, reference-value)). Because meaning is, on the Situation Semantics view, a relation between the utterance-situation and the described-situation, the utterance-situation (along with resource-situations) provides the implicit reference values.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|On this view, many natural language expressions are covertly quasi-indexical or, to coin a term, are _contextuals._ They contain within their semantic representation variables requiring contextual identification.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

It is also clear that constructions that are often treated in terms of semantic-generality-plus-implicatures, like the genitive in _Larry's book,_ may be reanalyzed as encoding an indexical variable that has to be contextually specified (see Recanati 1993: 235ff). But the approach being discussed here, best represented by Situation Semantics, is to assume that _all_ cases of pragmatic intrusion are in fact kinds of indexical resolution in a broad sense. It is thus hoped that a proper treatment of semantics along these lines will accommodate pervasive context dependency while eradicating the threat of more disorderly kinds of pragmatic intrusion. It is important to see, though, that this framework has no place for other kinds of pragmatic determination of propositional content and therefore that the arguments developed in this chapterto the effect that implicatures help to fix propositional contentwould appear to undermine the Situation Semantics approach to context dependency.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|3.2.7.5  <br>"Pragmantics"\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|One response to pragmatic intrusion into semantic interpretation is to take it as evidence against the possibility of any principled distinction between semantics and pragmatics in the first place. Lakoff (1972, 1987) has been a consistent advocate of the abolition of the distinction, and others too (e.g., Baker and Hacker 1984, Jackendoff 1990: 18) have seen the semantics/pragmatics distinction as an unfortunate corollary of the tactic of treating natural languages with the mechanisms developed for the analysis of formal languages.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Here, we can only make a few elementary points against this response. First, in the perspective advocated here, pragmatic inference is fundamentally _nonmonotonic,_ semantic inference is _monotonic._ Thus it is simply not possible to conflate two fundamentally different kinds of reasoning without doing violence to the essential nature of one or the other of them. The "pragmantics" cocktail that results would lose the predictive power that the modular account provides (entailments will end up defeasible, or implicatures will end up nondefeasible, or both). Second, although the abolitionists may gain succor from the evidence for pragmatic intrusion, the intrusive phenomena discussed here do not directly support their position: all they show is that semantics and pragmatics must be more intimately related than had been thought. Our arguments will provide no evidence for "pragmantics" as long as there are alternate models that will\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Pragmatic intrusionism can be construed in different ways. Some theories of semantics already countenance it. In many ways, this is the route taken by Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp 1981) and its relatives (e.g., Heim's (1982) File Change semantics). For, despite talk of deriving discourse semantic representations (DRSs) by algorithm from syntactic input, DRSs in fact incorporate the results of pragmatic resolution (most obviously, anaphoric linkages). This is clearest in a series of works where it is explicitly proposed that implicated material is entered into DRSs or File cards (Landman 1986, Kadmon 1987, Roberts 1987). To adopt a metaphor, in these proposals there is a common slate, a level of propositional representation, upon which both semantics and pragmatics can writethe contributions may be distinguished, let's suppose, by the color of the ink: semantics in black, pragmatics in red. Semantics and pragmatics remain modular "pens" as it were: they are separate devices making distinctively different contributions to a common level of representation. The slate thus represents the semantic and pragmatic content of accumulated utterances, and it is this representation as a whole that is assigned a model-theoretic interpretation. We shall explore this model below (see especially section 3.5.4), and although it raises many questions it also appears to offer a simple, perfectly coherent way of conceiving of modularity with intrusion.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|3.2.7.7  <br>Taking Stock\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|In this chapter, I can only respond to some of these moves. First, I shall try to pile on the evidence for pragmatic intrusion to make the denial of the evidence as difficult as possible. Second, I argue briefly against the enlarged indexicality and restricted presemantic pragmatics positions. Third, I consider the different kinds of moves that are open to the Pragmatic Intrusionist and offer a proposal about how to think about the relation of between semantic representations, their pragmatic enrichments, and truth conditions (which incidentally is a constructive alternative to semantic retreat).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

It appears from the evidence (and more will be presented shortly) that semantic representations (i.e., semantic structures algorithmically decodable from syntactic structures) are indeed subpropositional: it takes pragmatic resolution of the full Gricean sort to fix the proposition expressed. The proposition expressed is the entity that participates in the normal semantic relations of entailment, sense relations with other expressions, and so on. But that proposition may then receive further pragmatic enrichments of the standard kind, including additional implicatures. This leaves us with terminological difficulties: what is semantics, what is pragmatics, what is said, what is implicated, and so on?\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Although recognition of the problem is relatively new, the difficulty has already been compounded by rival recommendations for terminology. Some want to retain Grice's label "what is said" with a narrow application, so that it corresponds to a semantic representation, disambiguated with indexicals resolved, but not necessarily yet expressing any determinate proposition (Bach 1994: 144). Others want to expand the notion to cover something much broader, closer to the everyday concept of "what is stated"; on this account, any kind of pragmatic resolution or implicatural strengthening up to a level corresponding to a conscious, commonsensical notion of what has been claimed counts as "what is said" (Recanati 1989). On this account, GCIs belong entirely to the domain of "what is said" (for response, see Horn 1992a,b). Some have tried to isolate out a middle ground between what is given by the semantic representation, perhaps after disambiguation and indexical resolution on the one hand, and full-blown Gricean implicatures on the other hand. Thus Sperber and Wilson (1986) call explicatures the informational enrichments of semantic representations necessary to achieve not only minimal propositions but also ones of sufficient informational content to count as conversational contributions (thus "Fixing your watch will take some time" expresses a proposition, but one too vacuous as it stands to count as the proposition expressed). On this account, GCIs are explicatures and lie outside the scope of a theory of implicature (which was I think the intention). Carston (1988) has tried to clarify this view, suggesting that the notion "implicature" should be reserved for propositions that are not in any way enrichments of what is said but rather "functionally unrelated" (see Recanati 1989 for critique). Bach (1994) offers the new term "impliciture" (with an _i_) for the middle ground but he views this in a different way, covering only completions and expansions of the semantic content that are in line with the structure of the sentence (and, as mentioned, prag-\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Table 3.1 attempts to display in a crude fashion the mismatching alignments of terms and concepts (it should be interpreted as showing the maximal extent of notions like "implicature" and "explicature" according to different authors).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Let us discuss the explicature/implicature distinction in a bit more detail. Both explicatures and implicatures are pragmatic inferences, derived by the same mechanisms, with the same context dependence and defeasibility (Carston 1988: 158). The idea is that there is a sharp distinction between the fleshed-out logical form attributed to an utterance (its explicature), and fully implicit, unrelated but pragmatically conveyed propositions (the implicatures; see Sperber and Wilson 1986: 181182). Carston (1988: 173) hopes that explicatures will correspond with the set of pragmatic inferences that fall within the scope of logical operators or intrude into the truth conditions of "what is said." The problem is then to identify by independent criteria what an explicature is (see Recanati 1989, 1993: chap. 1314 for helpful discussion). The following criteria have been suggested: (a) the representations of explicatures contain the semantic\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Criterion (a) is partly just a matter of how the analyst phrases the pragmatic inference: after all, any implicature can be added as a conjunct to "what is said." Take the utterance _John's three children came to the party_the corresponding scalar inference can be phrased as 'The totality of John's children of cardinality 3 came to the party' or as a separate proposition 'John has no more than three children', and so on. Criterion (b) is taken as a necessary but not sufficient criterion, and in particular the rather promising criterion (c) is rejected, so that an explicature is not just the minimal expansion of an utterance until it reaches propositional explicitness but rather an expansion until it reaches sufficient informational specificity to play a role in further pragmatic inference. (Criterion (c) would have left the bulk of GCIs as implicatures, whereas Recanati (1993: 249) and Carston (1995: 237) presume that these are essentially explicatures.) This leaves any distinction between explicatures and implicatures completely unresolved. Hence the suggestion of criterion (d), functional independence, which in effect requires that implicatures do not entail explicatures, or what is implicated does not entail what is said. But as we saw concerning criterion (a), this is essentially a matter of how the analyst phrases the implicature (see also Recanati 1989: 317 n 11). 20 Moreover, Recanati (1989: 318320) points out that this criterion cuts across the proposed distinction, because there are clear cases where an implicature entails what is said. There are also cases where what is explicated fails to entail the sentence meaning (as in "I haven't eaten breakfast" with the explicature 'I haven't eaten breakfast today'; see Bach 1994: 134). Recanati therefore proposes to shift the burden to two further criteria (e) and (f). The first states that implicatures cannot fall within the scope of negation or other logical operatorsany such pragmatic infer-\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

But Recanati (1993: 269274) came to recognize that there are substantial difficulties with such a scope testas we shall see in section 3.3.3, the very same scalar inference may or may not fall within the scope of negation (cf. "John doesn't have three children, he has two" vs. "John doesn't have three children, he has four"), and many other aspects of an utterance may be "metalinguistically" negated. He therefore places the burden on the pretheoretical intuition about what has been said (Recanati 1993: 246250), claiming that this is always consciously accessible. A consequence, he notes, is that GCIs will normally be explicatures, part of what is said (yet, as Horn (1992b: 176178) notes, the history of linguistic thought tends to demonstrate the contrary intuition). This is shaky ground indeed: as Bach (1994: 137139) points out, judgments are likely to depend on how one elicits the intuitions. Moreover, in noncooperative circumstances like cross-examination in a court of law, what would normally taken to be part of what the speaker is committed tobut has not literally saidis routinely queried, indicating that our pretheoretical notions of what has been said are dependent on the mode of talk (Levinson 1983: 121). Thus at the moment we have no reliable distinguishing criteria for the explicature/implicature distinction even for terminological purposes, and there is certainly no indication that any such distinction would substantially help us understand the nature of the inferences in question.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Bach (1994) offers us a different way to cut the pie: we should recognize a middle ground between "what is said" (including indexical resolution and reference fixing) on the one hand, and what is implicated on the other. In the middle stands "impliciture", what is implicit in what has been said. What is implicit involves both "completion" (getting us from "what is said" or proposition-radical to a minimal proposition) and "expansion" (which gets us from the minimal proposition to what is implicitly meant). An example of a completion would be the inference from "This suitcase is too heavy" to 'This suitcase is too heavy for cabin baggage', and an example of an expansion would be the inference from "I have nothing to wear" to 'I have nothing appropriate to wear to the wedding'. GCIs will, at least in many cases, be _implicitures_ (with an _i_) on this account (see Bach 1994: 135). 21 Although the distinctions seem clearer and perhaps more helpful than the Relevance theory distinctions, Bach (1994: 140) equally fails to give us a clear boundary between impliciture and implicature, saying only that "an implicatum is completely separate from what is said and is inferred from it."

None of the authors here consider that the processes involved in deriving explicatures or implicitures and so on are essentially different in kind from those used in deriving implicatures.23 Merely relabeling pragmatic inferences that play a role in fixing the intended proposition something other than "implicature" hardly alters the nature of the problem. Rather, I shall presume that we want to define the types of content by the _processes_ that yield them and the important semantical properties they have (e.g., default presumption, defeasability under distinct conditions).24 The search for "what is explicated" or "what is implicited" betrays a failure to grasp the dimensions of Grice's circle; nevertheless I will return to the issue of the middle ground between the "said" and the "implicated" at the end of the chapter.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|3.3  <br>Intrusive Constructions\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|We have established a prima facie case for the existence of Grice's circle, the idea that implicatures may play a role in fixing what is said. But we will need more evidence before we will be willing to reorganize our whole way of thinking about semantic theory. What we seek is some incontrovertible evidence that implicatures contribute essentially to truth conditions. One method would be to search for evidence that, in some cases, assignment of truth conditions without prior assessment of implicatures will give us the wrong truth conditions. In particular, I shall attempt here to find a set of constructions, dubbed _intrusive constructions,_ that have the following property: the truth conditions of the whole depend in part on the implicatures of the parts (for an early collection of such observations, see Gazdar 1979: 164168). Cohen (1971) was the first to pursue this strategy; however his goal was the reverse of ourshe sought to establish that Grice's arguments about the implicatural overlays on the logical connectives had to be wrong by showing that the consequence of accepting them was that pragmatics was intrusive. If we no longer take this as a _reductio ad absurdum,_ the arguments have a new interest.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

But if the inference to 'and then' is pragmatic (and the Gricean arguments seem perfectly sound), then our assessment of such comparatives involves pragmatic intrusion: the truth conditions of the whole construction are calculated taking into account the implicatures of the parts. The inference from _and_ to 'and then' is on Grice's scheme a Manner implicature, and on my scheme an I-implicature.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|But perhaps Cohen (1971) is right that this is just evidence for the semantic nature of temporal sequentiality. For example, given a sequence of tensed clauses like _John came in and sat down,_ Grice's position with respect to _and_ could be maintained, while the truth-conditional nature of the 'and then' inference could be attributed to the implicit indexical sequence of reference times in the two verbs. 25 This account is more difficult to maintain with untensed gerunds or other infinite verb forms as in example (17), but nevertheless it raises the possibility that some reanalysis along semantic lines (some semantic escape hatch, as it were) might be found for these cases of apparent pragmatic intrusion.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|So the critical question is: how general is the phenomenon? In particular, can other implicatures (perhaps less amenable to semantic reanalysis) intrude in the same way? It is at this point that our typology of implicatures (GCIs) comes back into play; what we can attempt to do is run the different types of GCI through each type of intrusive construction to see if there is a general tendency towards intrusion in these constructions.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Similarly for (18b): _two hundred_ has the semantic content 'at least two hundred' (two hundred and possibly more), but Q-implicates 'no more than two hundred'; only on the assumption of that implicature is (18b) other than contradictory. In the case of (18c), we have a scale _<enormous, large>_ such that use of _large_ implicates 'not enormous' but is semantically compatible with _enormous;_ again only if the implicature is used to strengthen the first clause is the sentence as a whole capable of being true. In (18d), there is a scale <_and, or>_ such that use of _p or q_\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

This is a point then to reconsider the structure of the argument and see whether it can be made more general. The case we are making is based on the assumption that to establish pragmatic intrusion in the construction "A is better than B" we must find two clauses A and B which are logically equivalent but pragmatically distinct, such that substitution in the construction yields an intuitive truth where a necessary falsehood would be predicted on purely semantic grounds. The reasoning is based on the assumption that, whatever the semantics of the comparative construction are exactly, the semantics must at least meet the following condition: the comparative relation f-_er_ is necessarily _irreflexive,_ thus\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Now, our examples are open to objection because it is a little hard to come up with cases where A and B are semantically equivalent but pragmatically distinct, and yet will still fit happily into the construction. But given the irreflexivity of the construction, I think weaker requirements can be met and still be sufficient to establish pragmatic intrusion. As far as I can see, the semantics of the comparative _A is_ _f_-_er than B_ requires that not only must the two clauses be semantically distinct, but also that the two clauses must not be related in such a way that B encompasses what A denotes (e.g., A and B should not be privative opposites). More exactly, if B entails A, and B is "about" the same semantic relations as A (e.g., B is not a conjunction of the form 'A and C'), then a comparative of the form "A is f-er than B" will be necessarily false, unless rescued by pragmatic intrusion. For example, "Having a child is better than having a son" seems false or nonsensical (unless we can somehow pragmatically intepret _child_ as excluding 'male child'). So if we can find examples of this kind where in fact the utterance is intuitively true or potentially true, we should be able to find that the acceptability is due to the implicatural strengthening of A so that it is no longer entailed by B. For example, if I assert "Eating some of the cake is better (for my health) than eating all of it", what I say is false unless _some_ is construed as 'some and not all' (i.e., is strengthened by the scalar implicature). 28 Without the pragmatic strengthening, I have asserted that one state of affairs (eating at least some) is better than another state of affairs (eating all) that guarantees the very state of affairs I claim is preferable. Moreover, the state of affairs I claim to be preferable is completely compatible, in no way precludes, and may indeed be embedded within the state of affairs I claim to be less preferable.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Thus if example (21a) has the semantic content in (21b), we can see that (21a) should (on semantic grounds alone) be nonsensical: any situation in which one has four children will also be one in which one has at least three children, so how could one prefer a situation (having at least three children) to another which guarantees that same situation? It is a bit like saying "It is better to be a woman than to be a queen" (which if it makes sense at all, requires forcing an unwomanly interpretation of _queen_).

Existing accounts (to the best of my knowledge) only deal with comparison of individuals, not propositions as in these cases. In the existing accounts, _a is taller than b_ is analyzed variously as follows: a sentence of this form asserts that there is some comparison class relative to which _a_ is tall and _b_ is not tall (Klein 1980); or the sentence asserts that there is some measure _m_ of tallness such that _a_ exhibits _m_ and _b_ does not (Seuren 1974); or there is some measure of tallness _m_ exhibited by individual _a_ that is greater than all the measures of tallness exhibited by _b_ (Atlas 1984b: 362ff; n. 11). By analogy, _A is better than B_ might be analyzed as asserting that there is some situation in which A is good and B is not good; or (on Atlas's account) that there is some degree of goodness that A has that is greater than all degrees of goodness that B has. 29 On that analogy, a comparative "A is f-er than B" where there is an entailment relation between A and B (specifically, where B ![C0011-01.gif](../Images/7822f7bb17d3015151c0c79400c1dd3f.gif) A and the representation of A explicitly encompasses the possibility of B) should self-destruct (be incapable of being true), because any situation in which B holds will contain the situation described by A.

For example, the literal content of (23a) amounts to (23a') but (23a') is indeed clearly anomalous, because any woman with at least four children will also be a woman with at least three children.

It is a separate question (one about which I am at present unclear) whether a sentence of the form _'a_ is f-er than _b'_ where every _b_ is an _a_ actually entails _'a_ is f-er than _a'_ and thus entails a necessary falsehood.33 But we cannot pursue these matters here.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The point of this digression is to try to establish that the argument for pragmatic intrusion into comparatives can be made on a much wider basis than on examples of the form "A is better than B" where A is semantically equivalent to B.

Otherwise, there are no grounds for acceding to the consequent. To see this, let us consider just (24a) in detail: if _three_ has the semantic content 'at least 3', then (24a) has the literal content glossed in (24a'). But given the rules of soccer, (24a') is clearly (contingently) false: there are ways of verifying the antecedent (e.g., one team got exactly three goals and the other got exactly four goals) that do not guarantee the truth of the consequent. If however the antecedent is strengthened by the scalar implicature so that the antecedent reads 'each side got 3 and at most 3 goals', then (given the rules of soccer) the whole will be predicted to be true.

In (26b) the spatial relation _in_ merely specifies at least partial inclusion; the interpretation of partial versus full inclusion is a matter of stereotypical knowledge and inference, as sketched in (26b) versus (26b') (see, e.g., Herskovits 1986). In (26c), the relation indicated by the possessive is semantically general; the semantics of _Bill's book_ presumably only specifies that there is some (more or less intimate) relation between Bill and a definite bookthe relation might be a relation of writing, reading, owning, borrowing, editing, and so forth as given by an I-inference in the context (see Kay and Zimmer 1976, Sperber and Wilson 1986). Without having previously talked about Bill's book, we can indicate the relation we have in mind, as in (26c) versus (26c'). But (26c) will only be true, let us suppose, if the book Bill wrote is good. (Clearly, the inference here involves a matter of reference determination; see section 3.4.)\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Finally, M-implicatures may also perhaps intrude in conditionals.

Similarly, the repetition in (27b) arguably adds no semantic content, in which case there will be ways of verifying the antecedent that do not verify the consequentso the conditional should be false, even though it is arguably true. In this case, as noted above, if past tenses are not treated as quantifications over past times but rather as enforcing a sequence of reference times (as in Partee 1984), then perhaps there is a semantic account of the possible truth of (27b). Where repetition suggests intensity, as in (27b') not repeated action as in (27b), then the case for semantic intrusion would be better, but perhaps (27b') is not too clear. In (27c) the double negative _not ignorant_ logically implies _knows_ (because ignorance and knowledge are contradictories) but suggests (M-implicates) something less than full cognizance. Thus what ought to be a contradiction comes out as an intuitive truth; we can account for this if the M-implicature is taken into account in the assessment of the whole conditional. Similarly for (27d). In (27e) the periphrastic causative _cause x's death_ suggests indirect or unintentional causation by reference to the complementary I-implicatures from the use of the less-prolix lexical causative _kill,_ which suggests direct or intentional causation. Assuming that manslaughter and murder are inconsistent charges, the two conditionals in (27e) should be contradictory with respect to one another, because the two antecedents with identical semantic conditions are paired with inconsistent consequents. But intuitively, that is not the case(27e) seems like a perfectly consistent and sensible assertion. Again, the problem evaporates if the M-implicature (of indirect causation) of the first antecedent and I-implicature (of direct causation) of the second antecedent play a role in the truth-conditional assessment of each conditional.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Unfortunately, as noted above, a good semantic analysis of conditionals still eludes us. So it may be possible to claim that somehow the semantics of conditionals makes special allowance for pragmatic factors. For example, Barwise (1986) argues (following Goodman) that conditionals have a built-in _ceteris paribus_ condition, such that if you say, for example, "If I strike this match it'll light" we want to maintain that the utterance is true even though various _ceteris paribus_ conditions (e.g., the matches are not damp) have not been spelled out. So it may be said that our intrusive implicatures are merely part of the _ceteris paribus_ con-\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

I do not think Barwise's account could as it stands handle this kind of intrusion, because such intrusions are systematic inferences that are conveyed by the utterance itself, not independently existing background assumptions (not, for example, antecedent "resource situations"). Nevertheless, we should attend to the possibility that some better account of the semantics of the conditional might eliminate these apparent pragmatic intrusions.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|To deal with this objection it is worth making a few further observations.

Plausibly the inconsistency is pragmatic rather than semantic, because it amounts to Moore's paradox: the speaker of (28a) is asserting "p or p and I don't know that p." 35 But the point is that we have no intuitions of any such oddity. The only way to account for the lack of such intuitions is to suppose that the I-implicature from _and_ to 'and then' has strengthened the disjuncts. The second example is similar except that here a contradiction rather than a pragmatic paradox would result if the semantics were not strengthened by the same pragmatic intrusion from _and._ In (28c), if _some_ has semantic content 'at least some' and only Q-implicates 'not all', then _some and possibly all_ is an approximate gloss of the semantic content. Again, we can only account for the intuitive absence of the pragmatic paradox if the\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Kempson (1986; see also Kempson and Cormack 1981, 1982) claims they provide evidence that truth conditions must be stated over explicated logical formsthat is, that these cases prove that some limited pragmatic intrusion (of explicatures) takes place. Thus Kempson's claim is that a sentence like (32a) can be thought of as negating two positive contentsthe implicated and the entailed, as detailed in (32b). Thus negation ranges over both the implicated and the entailed as in (32c), with the consequence that (32d) (where the positive implicature is false and the positive content true) is one set of conditions under which (32a) will be true.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(32) a.

Thus (32a) is shorthand, as it were, for "You can't appropriately describe John as having three children; you should describe him as having four." He provides persuasive evidence for the existence of a metalinguistic negationfor example, no logical analysis is possible of utterances like "It's not a ![C0235-01.gif](../Images/3546a79f0eaa18ab1efe712c2e805370.gif), it's a ![C0235-02.gif](../Images/cc6b10f9258e6be4ad57e04afa0120a6.gif)."

"John doesn't have three _or_ four children; he has four" vs. *"John has neither three nor four children; he has four.") However, most if not all of these properties follow from the fact that metalinguistic negations are retorts to prior utterances, and as we shall see, these implicature-denying negations must also be responses to prior positive assertions.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Horn's (1989: 384) motivation for defending the metalinguistic account of examples like (32a) is that (following Kempson) he thinks that otherwise scalar inferences would have to be part of the semantic content of the scalar expressions. By assimilating these cases to a nonlogical use of negation, the pragmatic account of the scalar inferences is preserved. Horn's position would be worth defending if these were the only otherwise convincing examples of pragmatic intrusion into truth-conditions. But if, as argued here, pragmatic intrusion can occur in many constructions, there may be little motivation to resist the intrusion account here too. Besides, Kempson (1986) provides some evidence that the negation in this kind of sentence doesn't have the properties associated with unequivocably metalinguistic negations.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|These cases are truly puzzling for a number of reasons. First, Kempson is right to insist that unlike some uses of metalinguistic negation (as in "It's not a [va:z] *, it's a [ve1z]*") where no proposition is being denied, these implicature-denying negations are logical in character: a proposition (the implicature) falls under the scope of a one-place truth-functional operator indistinguishable from the familiar one we call negation! On the other hand, Horn is right to insist that what is being denied is the assertability of the positive sentence that would have carried the implicature that is being explicitly canceled. But there is a further wrinkle to the problem that does not seem to have been noticed, because of the prevailing inadequate theory of implicature projection. This is simply that, under the prevailing theory, implicatures do not arise under negation (Gazdar 1979, Hirschberg 1985, Horn 1989). Thus, at least if the negation in question is the ordinary truth-functional operator, there could be no implicature to deny! This theory of the blocking of implicatures under negation is in fact not correct (as pointed out in chapter 2), but the correct theory yields equally odd results: the implicatures that will arise from negative sen-\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Thus, for example, "John doesn't have three children" cannot induce the implicature 'John has no more than three children', which is therefore not available for cancellation by the negation, metalinguistic or logical. Below we will see that if we adopt a general account of pragmatic intrusion, all these puzzles evaporate together, and this conceptual mopping-up itself recommends both the thesis of pragmatic intrusion in general and its role in these implicature-denying negations in particular.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Note that implicature-denying uses of negative expressions are not limited to explicit negations.

Perhaps the case is better made on some of these constructions than on others. There will always be doubts about whether a better semantic analysis of the relevant construction might not accommodate the apparent pragmatic intrusions in some other way. Further, there are unclarities in the data: for example, some of the comparative examples may seem marginally acceptable because of the unnatural repetition of the implicature-inducing expression. (More natural-sounding paraphrases would beg too many questions about the synonymy of the paraphrases; but if we shift the argument to cases where _A_ entails _B_ in utterances of the form "_A_ is better than _B_" we can get clearer examples, although we raise further queries about the semantics of the comparative.) Others examples, especially those based on Manner intrusions, may seem like metalinguistic or quotative uses that ought to be treated exceptionally. Nevertheless, despite these difficulties, the clearest caseslike the Q- and I-implicature intrusions in conditionalsseem close to knockdown cases for the intrusive role of pragmatic factors in truth-conditional content. It would seem quite counterintuitive to deny the truth of utterances like "If John ate some of the cookies but no one else ate any, there must still be some left."\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Yet the argument from these intrusive constructions (good as it has seemed to Cohen 1971, Wilson 1975, Gazdar 1979, and Levinson 1983) is in fact vulnerable to a simple alternativenamely, the traditional account in terms of a postsemantic Gricean pragmatics. Here is an example of how the alternative account might go. Suppose the speaker has said "Having to study and take an exam is better than taking an exam and having to study." What she has said is of the form _'A_ is better than _A'_, which is necessarily false, a contradiction. But to utter a contradiction is not only to flout the maxim of Quality, it is also to flout the first maxim of Quantity ('Provide sufficient information'). Therefore, on the assumption that the speaker is being cooperative at some underlying level, that is not what she means; for the utterance to have some informative content it must amount to _'A_ is better than _B'_ where _B_ is distinct from _A._ To obtain such an interpretation all that needs to be supposed is that the speaker means 'Having to study and then take an exam is better than having to take an exam and then belatedly do some studying'. So that is what the speaker intends the hearer to infer. 38 In a similar way, Bach (1987a: 7174, 78; 1994: 153154) takes the line that, taken literally, metalinguistic negations like "John doesn't like Mary; he loves her" are just contradictions, so cooperative interlocutors understand them charitably, as non-\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Yet this interpretation cannot be based on a flouting of the maxim of Quality, because no known falsehood has been stated. Thus there are serious problems for a flouting analysis of these intrusive cases. An account in terms of the intrusion of default GCIs, on the other hand, predicts that the implicaturally strengthened reading should be available even when it is not required or coerced in order to obtain a cooperative interpretation. 40 In contrast, the flouting analysis suggests that the implicaturally strengthened interpretations should only arise to rescue an utterance from absurdity, falsity, or some other uncooperative infelicity. It seems to me that the GCI account is correct in cases like (35d) and the flouting account makes incorrect predictions.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|But perhaps the main objection to the flouting account is that it is simply not in line with our intuitions. The comparative and conditional cases simply do not give rise to intuitions of exploitation in the way that, say, ironies or fresh metaphors do; there's no sense of violation and inferential repair. To refresh the intuitions, consider what is being claimed: comparatives like (36a) must be treated as overt flouts of Quality in the same way that obvious contradictions like (36b) are. Similarly, conditionals like (36c) must be treated as obvious contingent falsehoods exactly on a par with the ironic interpretation of (36d). But intuitively there is no such parallelism. Although we may have few intuitions about most linguistic processes, the mechanisms involved in processing flouts do seem capable of being made consciouswitness the great body of ancient learning on the tropes. Thus (36b) and (36d), but not (36a) and (36c), intuitively require double processing, as it were.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(36) a.

Nevertheless, the fiction that (Carnapian) intensions, given just a world and a time, _determine_ extensions has been quite largely maintained in formal semantics (and this despite Putnam's demonstration of the implausibility of the idea; see Putnam 1975: chap. 12).

There are certainly general implications for the theory of referencefor example, this claim, if substantiated, seems to me to be one of the best empirical arguments against the just-mentioned view that intensions determine extensions.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|However, we are only interested here in the theory of reference as it bears on the main task: showing that pragmatic factors are prerequisites to semantic interpretation. So here is what I am going to attempt to show. Suppose we can find those very Gricean inferences, which are supposed to operate only postsemantically, involved in the determination of the reference of canonical referring expressions. Then, given the principle of the compositionality of reference (as in, say, Martin 1987: 88), it follows that the extensions of the maximal expression cannot be determined without determining the extensions of each of its constituent expressions, which in turn may depend _ex hypothesi_ on implicature. Thus we can cannot obtain a truth value (a maximal extension) without _first_ doing the pragmatics. In short, if we can find cases of implicaturally determined reference, then we show that the whole semantic apparatus that recursively defines intensions and extensions is reliant on pragmatic input.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|It may be objected in advance that theories divide on what happens when reference is semantically ill-defined (as in cases where implicature determines reference). In Strawsonian theories (now in the ascendant, in the modern guises of Situation Semantics and DRT), without reference determination semantic interpretation cannot get off the ground (we get null interpretations). In Russellian theories, we can get an overall extension in such circumstances, namely a truth value False. Thus, on the first kind of theory, pragmatic determination of reference will be essential input to semantics; but on the second kind of theory, the ability to produce truth values for these cases will, I shall demonstrate, be more of an embarrassment than an asset. So the demonstration that implicatures play a role in the determination of reference is as near to a knockdown argument for intrusion that we are likely to find.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Here is a sample of the argument.

Thus on any theory of definite descriptions (from Russell 1905 to Kadmon 1987) that builds in a uniqueness condition, the expression will either fail to denote (Strawson), or render the utterance false (Russell).42 But, of course, in practice it would felicitously denote. The reason is that a Q-scalar-inference will, by perfectly regular process, amplify the content to 'the man with at least two children and no more than two children near him'.43 To belabor the point: what could be a more felicitous referring expression and a truer utterance than the use of sentence (37a) in the context (37b)?

In (38a) _the warm one_ [_tub_] won't single out a referent given its semantic content alone; there are two tubs, one hot and one warm, but the meaning of _warm_ is only 'at least warm (and possibly hot)'; but the use of the weaker expression scalar-implicates that the stronger expression (expressing the more extreme property, hotness) would have been inappropriate. Thus _the warm tub_ implicates 'the warm-and-not-hot tub'. In (38b), there are two students mentioned who would satisfy the condition _cheated on some of the exams,_ for someone who cheats on all certainly cheats on some. Again, only if _some_ is strengthened to 'some-and-not-all' will _the student who cheated on some of the exams_ pick out a unique referent. In (38c), the property of being the one _who tried to assassinate the President_ must equally apply to the one who succeeded (assassination is an intentional, effortful activity). But normally, when we use the expression _try_ we implicate lack of success; that this is only an implicature is clear from the noncontradictoriness of a sentence like 'He tried and finally succeeded'. Again, the inference is due to a scalar opposition between _try_ and _succeed;_ thus, _the man who tried to assassinate the President_ is uniquely described only if _tried_ is strengthened by Q-implicature to 'tried-and-didn't-succeed'. 44 In (38d), one who is certainly implicated in a scandal is also possibly implicated in a scandal; and one who is possibly implicated in a scandal may indeed be certainly\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Thus again the expression with the weaker scalar item, _the senator who is possibly implicated,_ will fail to uniquely denote unless it is strengthened by scalar implicature to 'the senator who is possibly-but-not-certainly implicated'. In (38e), the description _with a left or a right wing_ will apply equally to an entity with both wings; for the semantics of _or_ is inclusive, only strengthened to the exclusive interpretation by a scalar Q-implicature. So only when we have the implicature 'with a left or a right wing and not both' in place, as it were, will the description succeed in denoting. Finally, in (38f), the description _good finalist_ does not semantically preclude that the finalist is excellent; however, given the scale <_excellent, good>_, there is an upperbounding implicature that resolves the description to 'the good but not excellent finalist', thus establishing a unique description. In all of these cases, a default conversational implicature will arise by perfectly general mechanisms to render the referring expression felicitous, but the reference can only succeed with the help of such pragmatic strengthening (see the generalization in (39)).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|We can find similar examples from the other two major categories of GCI.

But by a perfectly general I-mechanism whereby contradictories are strengthened to contraries (Horn 1989), _the students who don't like math_ is interpreted as 'the students who positively dislike math' (cf. "He doesn't like garlic"). Only when strengthened in that way (to the set of dislikers) is the set of notliking students distinct from (not overlapping with) the set of students not-fond-of-but-not-minding math (the indifferent ones), as required by the inconsistent predicates _fail_ and _pass._ Figure 3.3 shows the overlapping nature of the sets as literally stated and may help to show how in interpretation the sets have to be pragmatically delimited. Note that if we change the example slightly so that the material in square brackets (_are not fond of it but_) is omitted, we then have a three-way nonoverlapping distinction set up by implicature: (a) the don't-likers are pragmatically restricted to the dislikers by I-strengthening from contradictory to contrary, as before; (b) the students who like math (stated); and (c) the students who don't mind math, which is strengthened by a Q-implicature to the students who don't-like-but-don't-mind (due to the scale-like opposition between the strong 'like' and the weak 'not mind' there's an inference from _not mind_ to 'not positively like' even though 'not minding' is consistent with 'liking'.) 45\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Examples (40de) are perhaps less clear, but they are candidate cases where I-inferences to the stereotype (see chapter 2 and Atlas and Levinson 1981) might play a role in referential determination.

Given this, the speaker ought to have used a different set of NP expressions if the speaker had intended otherwise, and this gives sufficient warrant for the inference (thus the inference is an implicature, warranted by cooperative assumptions, and not a mere probability about the world that aids one to understand a misleadingly ambiguous utterance). In (40e), the two descriptions _at the desk_ and _near the desk_ are almost truth-conditionally equivalent (that is, anything that satisfies the one, might be claimed to satisfy the other); but I shall assume that _at_ specifies a closer relation (i.e., a smaller boundary area) than _near._ But if the terms are distinct in this way, they are certainly overlapping in descriptive content: one who is at _x,_ is certainly near _x._ Thus the definite description _the woman near the desk_ will be equally satisfied by either woman (provided there are two women in the immediate vicinity of the desk). Yet if one woman is sitting down with knees under the desk and the other standing in front of it, even though either woman might be described truthfully as _near the desk_ or _at the desk,_ there is little doubt who, given pragmatic principles, should be so described. The reason is that _at_ (no doubt owing to its 'very immediate vicinity' meaning) tends to induce additional stereotypical assumptionssomeone who is _at a desk_ is typically sitting down and working on it, someone who is _at the church_ is typically worshipping in it, someone who is _at the door_ is typically waiting to be let in, and so on (see Herskovits 1986). Thus given these stereotypical I-enrichments, the definite descriptions in (40e) will be unambiguous and felicitous. Similarly in (40f), given the generally prevailing assumption that reading is more likely to be done for pleasure than profit, and given an opposition between _the man reading_ and _the man working_ which will only be resolved by assuming that the man reading is not thereby working, a speaker will I-implicate 'the manreading-&-not-working'. Finally, (40g) will be false unless _the book he's reading_ is distinct from _John's book_ (recall sentences of the kind 'The book John is reading is better than John's book'). Thus we tend to assume that the relation between John and the book in _John's book_ is the other stereotypical person-to-book relation, namely authorship.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Finally, we can construct (perhaps somewhat less clear) examples where a definite referring expression will only succeed in denoting if an M-implicature strengthens the descriptive content.

Clearly, the assumption here (justified in chapter 2) is that the kinds of repetition used in these examples is not semantic modification. Thus, on this assumption, the repetitive descriptions add no truth-conditional content, but the use of the more prolix expressions implicates a distinction from the unrepetitive descriptionsnamely, one in which the action or property is intensified (as suggested iconically). 46 In (41de) the reduplications clearly take on special meanings by M-implicature (as suggested to me by Larry Horn). In (41f), the opposition between the simple positive _the possible one_ and the double negative _the not impossible one_ suggests that one route is markedly more passable than the other, and thus again an M-implicature allows two referring expressions with identical semantic content to refer uniquely to different referents. In (41g), the use of the periphrastic causative (as before) suggests indirect causation by M-implicature calculated in contrast to the lexical causative _kill,_ which suggests direct causation by I-implicature; thus we can identify the indirect killer with the boss, the direct killer with the hit man. Similarly in (41h), the periphrastic _vehicular device_ suggests some very un-car-like vehicle.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|I have already mentioned further examples of M-determination of reference that are of a rather different kind and involve a preference for disjoint reference invoked by the use of a more prolix or informationally nonredundant NP (Levinson 1987a, b and chapter 4 of this book).

The theoretical implication is that Carnapian intensions (together with worlds and indices) do not alone determine extensions. Instead, there is crucial pragmatic input to semantic interpretation, and the pragmatic principles in question are identical to those thought to operate only as postsemantic principles of Gricean utterance interpretation.

Actually, this is just the identical distinction to Donnellan's (1966) _referential_ versus _attributive_ distinction. Quite respectable people (Donnellan (1978) himself, Barwise and Perry (1983)) think that this distinction is _semantic._ Other, even more respectable people (like Kripke (1977)) think that the distinction is one between semantic correctness on the one hand and pragmatic success with semantic error on the othermore precisely, that it's a distinction between a proper semantic use and an improper but occasionally successful use of referring expressions. Either way, there's a perfectly good account of the _referential uses_ (alias implicaturally determined references) that is quite compatible with the received view that all Gricean pragmatics is postsemantic.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Could the Obstinate theorist be right, that our distinction between pure reference and implicaturally fixed reference is the very same distinction as Donnellan's?

But again, just as in the Donnellan cases, reference may succeed nevertheless, and we'd be loath to call the sentence false in context (44b). So this suggests an immediate identification of implicaturally fixed reference and speaker reference (Donnellan's _referential_ uses). The other term of the correspondence would identify implicature-free reference determination with Donnellan's attributive uses.

That is, Donnellan's distinction is not a semantic one and we may distinguish between:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|1.

That is, the speaker is under no mistaken illusions about the relation between his words and the world; he knows perfectly well that his semantic reference will be inadequate or inapplicable without implicatural strengthening. When a speaker refers to the man as _the man with two children,_ even though there are two men who fit the semantic content by having at least two children and even though the addressee can see that the semantic content is not individuating, he does so with intention aforethought. And even though a Russellian analysis requires that what our speaker said was false, the speaker has no false impressions and by any reasonable account (I would think) is speaking truly (assuming the predication holds). That is what gives our cases interestthey are not odd quirks of odd circumstances. They are intentional and routine uses of expressions where the semantic conditions for use are not met. 47\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Kripke concedes that there's just one circumstance under which he might admit that Donnellan's distinction is semanticalnamely, if the successful (but condition-failing) reference was clearly intuitively true. Donnellan's cases arguably fail this test, but the implicaturally determined cases seem to pass it.48 Nevertheless, I am not advancing the distinction as a semantic ambiguity; it's a truth-conditional "ambiguity" only because semantic conditions are routinely enriched by pragmatic\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Nor is it accommodated by Kripke's semantic-reference versus speaker-reference, because of the mismatch between speaker-reference and implicaturally determined reference: (a) In speaker-reference there must be a (possibly erroneous) belief that the semantic conditions are met, but in implicaturally determined reference this is not so (uniqueness conditions for example may be obviously infringed); (b) In speaker-reference it is sufficient that the speaker believes that the semantic conditions are met; in implicaturally determined reference that is not necessary but in any case not sufficientthe implicated conditions must also be met; (c) Implicaturally determined reference meets at least the prima facie condition Kripke puts on a genuine semantic ambiguity, namely that one has the clear intuition that such a statement is true (even when, in our cases, _qua_ semantic-reference it is false)yet nevertheless it is obviously not a semantic ambiguity because it is introduced by Gricean mechanisms. The solution to that dilemma is simply to admit that implicatures contribute to truth conditions.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Kripke's (1977) tack is to treat the referential/attributive distinction as corresponding to a pragmatics/semantics distinction and thus to dismiss the cases where there is conflict as usable falsities. Another approach is to take the distinction as indeed a semantic distinction as Barwise and Perry (1983) do in Situation Semantics. Perhaps that treatment might be able to accommodate our distinction between (pure) semantic reference and implicaturally determined reference, and we should consider it briefly. In that theory, the meaning of an expression is a relation between various contextual factors and described situations. Therefore, the Donnellan distinction can be captured by letting the referential use of definite description _the F_(_x_) (to use an informal notation) only have the denoted _individual a_ in the described situation, whereas attributive uses have the _describing condition F_ itself (indirectly) in the described situation (Barwise and Perry 1983: 146ff). Thus in the referential use of, say, _the man drinking champagne,_ the describing condition is used to obtain the referent, but is thrown away as it were. It does its job by constraining another situation, the _resource situation,_ which is some accessible situation (e.g.,\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

The meaning of the referential use of definite NPs can then be thought of as a function that has as argument the 'resource situation' and as value the referent (here the salient apparent champagne drinker, let's call him Joe). Thus the interpretation of _The man drinking champagne is happy_ is a described situation in which Joe is happy.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Can we apply the same analysis to implicaturally determined references like _the man with two children_ (in the context of a man with exactly two and a man with exactly three children), and if so would it help? The answers are yes and no, respectively. The idea that the resource situation, once it has done its individual-selecting job, can be discarded has something right about it for these cases too. But the mechanisms of resource situations will not help us. That would only shift the problem to another situation (from the described to the resource situation), and in that other situation we still have the identical conundrum, namely that these definite descriptions fail to describe uniquely without implicatural strengthening. Thus, without that strengthening, the function taking us from resource situations to individuals will be ill-defined (it will have two valuesthe man with exactly two and the man with exactly three childrenfor one argument). A second reason for not looking to this analysis for succor is simply that if the same mechanism gives a good analysis of the Donnellan cases, then it cannot do so for this distinction because, as we have seen, it is orthogonal. Indeed, our cases of implicaturally determined reference can have both the attributive and the referential readingwhich shows that the resource situations simply can't be involved in our distinction (because they are invoked on one reading, gone on the other). In any case, although the general apparatus of Situation Semantics has many impressive ways of handling those aspects of contextual determination of interpretation that are indexical or quasi-indexical, there is no place for elaborate pragmatic reasoning of the Gricean kind.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|I conclude that implicaturally determined references are not some semantic distinction in disguise (as they might be on some analyses if they conflated with the Donnellan distinction).

We don't attempt contextual _disambiguation_ prior to semantics; we just give a single distinct semantic interpretation for each reading. Likewise, we don't do presemantic indexical resolution or any other generality narrowing; we just end up with extremely general truth-conditional content ("Bill was here" will be true just in case Bill was within some unspecified area, possibly of limitless extent, which includes the speaker!).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|2´.

In the cases where what is said is literally false according to the Obstinate Theorist (as on a Russellian analysis of our case of _the man with two children_) we can adopt a flouting analysis, which gets us a truth for the statement-plus-implicature (the speaker-meaning).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|b.

The wood was rotten._) Here the semantics gives us nothing (null interpretations); so the pragmatics can give us nothing. Here the Obstinate Theorist will have to gesture to some theory of _accommodation_ (cf. Lewis 1979) whereby the use of an undefined reference is reinterpreted _as if it had been the use of some other referring expression that would have been well defined_ had it been used. The important point here is that this invoking of _accommodation constitutes an admission of presemantic pragmatics in these cases._\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|c.

Well, one surprising consequence has been pointed out to me by Ivan Sag: namely, the result of having no presemantic pragmatics will be to have a _postpragmatic semantics!_ In which case, we come back to more or less the same picture: a semantic component with Gricean input.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Let us trace through Sag's argument. Our Obstinate Theorist will deny that the example (47a) below is truebecause without intrusion it is necessarily false. But the semantics will compute the pragmatics-free interpretation, namely the contradiction, by (say) treating _worse than_ as a two-place predicate which can be true only if the extensions of the two arguments are distinct. The semantics now sends the results to the pragmatics. 49 The pragmatics will now reject the interpretation as a cooperative assertion, and seek to patch it up, e.g., by computing the 'and subsequently' implicature of each _and_ in the schema '(event1) _and_ (event2)'. But now what? We need to compute the meaning and extension of the whole sentence over again, but this time with an alteration in the meaning and extension of two of its parts. To do that kind of recomputation for any arbitrary sentence we need the whole apparatus of compositional semantics. But by hypothesis, the semantics is free of pragmatic input: so this recomputation cannot be done by the "pure" semantics. Equally, the recomputation can't be done in the pragmatics: the pragmatics is part of a theory of communication, built on nonmonotonic principles quite different in character than those operative in semantics. So we will need a second semantics component, a _postpragmatic semantics,_ which, unlike the "pure" semantics does accept pragmatic input but is in all other ways identical!\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Cases include the definite reference examples on a Strawsonian analysis, the bridging examples and other cases of so-called accommodation; also perhaps examples of indexical resolution where without narrowing we can get no extension (perhaps, examples like _Some of you come here.

Then we need to recompute the semantics (in the postpragmatics semantics) with these new extensions. But now that we have the propositions expressed by the utterances, we find they are obviously false (given what we know about China and deification, and what we know about giving lectures on plenty of port). So we send them off again for pragmatic processing, to the pragmatics that follows the postpragmatic semantics!\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Thus the overall picture proposed by the Obstinate Theorist has the character that obstinacy unfortunately tends to have: unattractive repetition. His theory has two more or less identical components doing semantic interpretation, and he has at least two applications of Gricean pragmatics (three if he acknowledges the force of the accommodation examples mentioned above). We end up with a simpler picture with less exceptions on the view that allows a presemantic pragmaticsor more generally does not insist on a position where semantic interpretation accepts no pragmatic input. But above all, when we examine the consequences of the Obstinate Theorist's position, we see that he cannot avoid the very result that motivates his theoretical contortionsnamely, an interleaving of pragmatic and semantic processes. Thus in the critical respect, both our theory and the Obstinate Theorist's do not in the end differ!\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|3.5  <br>Some Implications\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|3.5.1  <br>Disposing of the Existing Responses\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|I outlined above a number of existing or potential responses to Grice's circle (see section 3.2.7).

This includes the role of knowledge in resolving metonymies, generality narrowing in nominal compounds, pronominal resolution, quantifier scoping, disambiguation, and so forth.

For example, we reviewed in chapter 2 Horn's (1978, 1989) argument that Neg-raising is actually an I-inference (R-implicature in his terms) whose availability is systematically determined by scalar strength of predicate (among other things); because the distribution and interpretation of negative polarity items depends on the availability of this inference, we have a systematic intrusion of pragmatics into semantics and grammar (although this clearly involves ongoing conventionalization). Also, work on nonce uses of nouns as verbs, and the like (as studied by Clark and Clark 1979) are directly pertinent (see Sag 1981). A renewal of interest in encoded subjectivity and point of view in language (Lyons 1981, Kuno 1987)whether in logophoric reflexives (Sells 1987, O'Connor 1987), free indirect style and metapragmatics (Lucy 1993), evidentials (Chafe and Nichols 1986), or more generally in the lexicon (Mitchell 1986)suggests that the signaling of point of view exploits generalized pragmatic inference (this is explored in chapter 4).

Thus, as mentioned, Relevance theorists propose that there is a special kind of implicature, an explicature, that embellishes logical forms in limited ways. We have reviewed the criteria for explicatures that have been suggested by Sperber and Wilson (1986), Carston (1988), and Recanati (1989, 1993), and we found that they remain unclear. The hypothesis is not well circumscribed, but the general idea is clear enough: contextual input should first be used to extract a sufficiently informative proposition. It is an idea shared with the AI community, who make much the same assumption and call the restricted amplifications of logical form "local pragmatics" (see, e.g., Hobbs et al. 1987).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|For the existence of explicatures to be more than a terminological issue, they must have some specific, identifying properties. The difficulty is to see how and why certain restricted kinds of pragmatic inference should alone have presemantic application and, if so, why they should be derived by the identical apparatus that derives postsemantic implicatures (the principle of Relevance in Relevance Theory). In fact, the best candidates for such presemantic inferences might be GCIs. By hypothesis, they are default inferences driven by (potentially fragmentary) semantic representations, but Relevance theory recognizes no such special class of default inferences.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|One way to test the hypothesis that explicatures are essentially different in kind from implicatures is to take those implicatures that look most postsemanticnamely, the tropes and flouts that seem to presuppose the prior establishment of a literal meaningand see whether they can intrude in semantic interpretation or play a role in reference determination. Unfortunately for the hypothesis in question, they do seem to have that ability. Let us just focus on the ability of such tropes to determine reference (because from that ability, it will follow that tropes will intrude in our intrusive constructions).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(51) _Metonymic particularized transfers:_\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|a.

Note that ironies, on the Sperber-Wilson theory of Relevance, are implicatures interpreted as "echoes" of what someone might have said: they are distinctly not explicatures. Yet they may play a role in determining the proposition expressed by the antecedent of a conditional, against which the consequent should be assessed.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The idea that some implicatures are essential to the determination of the propositional content of an utterance, whereas others are further embellishments or exploitations, may well be correct. But it does not follow that these two roles are necessarily occupied by pragmatic inferences of different natural classes. As we have seen, the evidence does not directly point in that direction. However, caution is in order. It could be, for example, that there are distinct types of intrusion: some, like those associated with our GCIs and perhaps the metonymic transfers above, may be genuinely presemantic (in the sense that they can be calculated without access to the full propositional content of the utterance), whereas others (like the cases of ironic reference) may require double processing\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

There is some intuitive support for this (see Horn 1992b: 184188). But single versus double processing would seem to be a dimension orthogonal to the explicature/implicature distinction: we may be forced to compute an irony by double processing to obtain a proposition (an explicature) relevant enough for the kind of processing envisaged in Relevance theory.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The position adopted here is therefore thatfor reasons spelled out belowGCIs constitute a genus of pragmatic inference especially able and likely to intrude into semantic representations, but whether they do so will depend in part at least on the position of GCI-inducing expressions in constructions.

As mentioned, a number of theorists who hold very different ideas about the nature of semantic representations may be tempted by such a position. For example, not only Relevance theorists (Sperber and Wilson 1995: 257258) may fit in here, but also those who hold that linguistic semantics is exhausted by the level of LF in Chomskyan theory (a level that consists of "those aspects of semantic structure which are expressed syntactically" (May 1987: 306)). Even those conceptualists like Katz, who think of semantics as essentially computations over an extremely rich syntax of "markerese" or the like, may wish to hand over matters of the interpretation of such representations to pragmatics.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|On such a strategy, we escape semantic intrusion by yielding up all aspects of utterance interpretation to pragmatics. Few theorists would, I think, deny that such an abstract, underspecified level of semantic content should play an important role in a semantic theory (see e.g., Ruhl 1989, Pustejovsky 1995, van Deemter and Peters 1996). The question is whether this is all there is to linguistic semantics. It is therefore important to see that what one is left with is an extremely impoverished level of representation.

That is because, if we are correct about pragmatic intrusion, the intuitive concept of entailment, in terms of which all the sense relations (synonymy, antonymy, converseness, etc.) are defined, cannot be stated over semantic representations alone. If one thinks of entailment in terms of truth conditions, the reason for this is obvious: truth is a property of utterances (complete with intrusive implicatures), and entailment is the concept of inference-while-preserving-truth. But equally, if one thinks of sense relations as primitive, such relations must still relate well-defined propositions, not underspecified propositional schema of the kind that we may be able to algorithmically extract from syntactic structures. (Given indexicality, Katz's position is already threatenedfor example, synonymy relations can't really be stated except by holding indices constantbut given pragmatic intrusion the position is overwhelmed. 51)\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Semantic retreat therefore has the consequence that semantics does not look like either of the familiar, conventional, rival enterprises: it is not about truth-conditional content on the one hand, nor about the relations of sense that hold between sentences on the other hand. Instead, it is exclusively about a new, strange level populated by semantic wraithsa level of fragmentary structures, underspecification and half-information, even archi-sememes (Atlas 1989: 146). The recognition of the existence of this level is one of the important sea changes in the history of semanticsit is real enough, but it is relative _terra incognita._\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|But one can recognize the actuality of this level of underspecified semantic representations without subscribing to semantic retreat. There are two reasons to resist such a limited scope for linguistic semantics. The first is conservative: what little we know about the properties of semantic representations is based on their abilities to support logical inferenceindeed without taking inferential properties into account, there are more or less no known constraints on semantic representations. Underspecified semantic representations do not constitute a level on which notions of semantic inference can be based. To retain the insights of the long tradition of research about semantic inference, we need to find another level at which these insights hold, and it will be a level to which pragmatic information has contributed. Second, the position of semantic retreat presumes\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

This view hugely underestimates the gap between linguistic and nonlinguistic cognition: linguistic representations (whether pragmatically enriched or not) have many special properties like linearity, generality, indexicality, and culture-specific lexicons which would seem to be quite remote from a "language of thought" (Levinson 1997). There is every reason then to try and reconstrue the interaction between semantics and pragmatics as the intimate interlocking of distinct processes, rather than, as traditionally, in terms of the output of the one being the input to the other.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|3.5.1.4  <br>Enlarged Indexicality\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|This approach, typified by Situation Semantics but attractive also to more conservative logical models of semantics, seeks to treat contextual dependence as limited to the resolution of preexisting variables, built in to the semantics of specific expressions ("contextuals" in the terminology suggested above). The radical pragmatics approach of generality-plus-implicatures (i.e., lexical or constructional weak univocality) is often in direct opposition to this indexical approach to the analysis of particular constructions and lexical items. Sophisticated tests are needed to distinguish between such implicit variables (fixed either by the utterance situation or resource situations) and generality (narrowed by implicatures). The study of indexicality by Enç (1981) provides some tools for this. For example, once indexicals are fixed, they are "rigid" under negation, intensional contexts, and anaphora; if the enlarged class of contextuals also must have this property (which I think it must), then we have a whole battery of tests for contextuals versus generality-plus-implicature. 52 With such tests, we can expect the phenomena to divide: we can expect some cases to be better analyzed one way and some the other. For example, it is conceivable that the narrowing of degree predicates or the asymmetric temporality of _and_ may ultimately be better analyzed in this way than as I-induced generality-narrowings (although the existing tests strongly suggest otherwise). But we can be assured, I think, that GCI intrusion as a whole and the intrusion of general background knowledge as explored in AI local pragmatics cannot be handled by this enlarged indexicality approach.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|There is another approach that might also come under the rubric of "enlarged indexicality"namely, Sag's (1981) proposal that we treat lexical and phrasal categories as generally capable of behaving quasi-\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

This is of course not the conclusion I wish to draw, and although such a view may seem consistent with the intrusion data, it doesn't follow from any of the evidence we have collected. What is lost on such a view is the crucial distinction between semantic entailment and pragmatic defeasible inference, which itself is part of the critical data.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Pragmantics can be avoided if we can find a way of accounting for pragmatic intrusion into truth conditions while maintaining the modularity of a distinct pragmatics (built on nonmonotonic principles) and semantics (built on monotonic principles). Conceptually this is not as difficult as it seems at first sight. But we might ask for morenamely, evidence that by maintaining modularity, and by defining exactly how the semantics and pragmatics interact, we can predict exactly how, when, and why pragmatic intrusions take place; and especially if we can show that intrusive constructions have the properties they do just because of a principled interaction between two distinct components. It is to this we must now turn.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|3.5.2  <br>Modularity and Control 53\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Linguistic theory has, through its presiding genius, come to have a particular architecture. A theory, in this tradition, consists in a set of components (A, B, C, etc.), each of which can be thought of as a function that relates an input to an output. Component A can thus be thought of as a function A that takes an _a_ and gives us a _b_ as value; component B as a function that takes a _b_ as argument and gives a _c_ as value; component C as a function that takes _c_ as an argument and gives us _d_ as value; and so on.

Then the overall structure of the theory is given to us by the nature of its parts: the output of A feeds B, whose output goes to C, and so forth. The components or modules (in a non-Fodorean sense) themselves define a logical order of the passing of "control" (to use programming parlance).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|This Chomskyan picture is not though in any way inevitable or intrinsic to the subject matter. It is elegant precisely because it frees us from the need to have a theory of "control"an independent theory that specifies how components may interact. But if pragmatic intrusion is indeed established, this picture cannot easily be maintained (at least for the relation between the components or modules that do semantic interpretation and pragmatic processing). The obvious proposal is to change the unidirectional monologue between components into a bidirectional dialogueto let the components talk more freely to one another. For example, semantic processing could proceed up to some point, pragmatic processing then be called in the way that a subroutine can be called in a program, and semantic processing can then proceed further. The result: the effects of pragmatic intrusion. This picture is decisively _not_ the same as the pragmantics cocktail rejected above. The reason is that each component continues to be built, exactly as on current assumptions, as a homogeneous system of rules or principles of an _essentially different kind_ from those in other components (that's what justifies the split into components). Thus semantics might continue to operate on the basis of logical principles, whereas pragmatics might operate on an system of abduction and default rules. (This methodological justification of "modularity" has nothing to do with the psychological justifications of Fodorean "vertical" modularity, or faculty psychology; it is a method of making a simpler theory by a policy of divide and conquer, in the ultimate hope of course that a simple theory of the mind is more likely to be correct than an unmotivatedly complex one.)\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|But once we have abandoned the Chomskyan architecture for a theory of meaning, now we do indeed have a new task: namely, a theory of modular control.

Suppose that each constituent of a sentence is processed from the bottom up. Suppose too that for each constituent we retain _semantic priority_that is, for each syntactic unit, the semantics is called first, the pragmatics second. Thus for the sentence _The man with two children is a rocket alarm specialist,_ we might start with the semantic interpretation of lexical items and begin to build them into the interpretation of phrases. Whenever we process a lexical item, we check in a semantic network or lexicon for possible stronger scalar items; if we find one, we call the pragmatics to calculate the scalar implicatures, which then get combined with the lexical content, which then contributes to the interpretation of the phrase. Similarly, whenever we hit a construction like nominal compounding as in _rocket alarm,_ the pragmatics will be called to calculate an I-implicature to the most probable inference. Thus on this account, the semantic processor or the control structure must locate triggers that invoke the pragmatics, and the semantics also has the overall responsibility, as it were, of constructing the framework for the overall interpretation, using the compositional mechanisms for building intensions and extensions as classically assumed in formal semantics. On this view, which I take it is close to, or at least consistent with, Sag 1981, the main change from classical assumptions is simply that intensions (and correspondingly extensions) may be partially determined by pragmatic information.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Let us briefly review Sag's original proposal.

As Enç (1981) points out, Kaplan's scheme gives us a typology as in Figure 3.4. Sag's point is that expressions used with Nunbergian metonymic shifts could have both variable character and variable content (a cell unused in Kaplan's scheme), so that context could fix the intension (from, e.g., _ham sandwich_ to 'ham sandwich orderer'), and the intension could then pick out the relevant denotation in the relevant world.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|That way we preserve the compositional effect, whereby having "coerced" (in the parlance of artificial intelligence) _ham sandwich_ into 'ham sandwich orderer' in example (55a), we get the normal compositional effects of preposing _the_ or _every_ (as in (55b)). The phrase _ham sandwich_ is just a normal N´ with a shifted denotation; and the shifted denotation behaves compositionally just as the denotation of any N'. It is hardly surprising that the classical machinery of formal semantics could absorb such changes in the meaning of constituentsafter all, it is largely indifferent to lexical content, from which indifference it derives the generality of the compositional mechanism.

The problem is that once expressions plus their implicatures have been converted into Kaplan contents (intensions) they would be just as monotonic (nondefeasible) as entailments. What we need instead is some model where we can keep a record of implicatural contribution so that, unlike entailed content, it can be annulled by later parts of the same sentence (or other parts of the discourse, or general background assumptions). This is an argument instead for the intermediate kind of semantic representation used in, for example, Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp and Reyle 1993); we may need to be able to get back to implicated conditions and erase them.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Another problem is the size of constituent that is processed at a time; if the pragmatic processing operated automatically and irrecoverably at the lexical level it would make the wrong predictions: a GCI cannot convert every occurrence of _two_ into 'two and no more' because immediate collocations may make the decision one way (as with _at least two_) or the other (_exactly two_); and indeed while _all_ is not an implicature inducing item, the collocation _not_ . . . _all_ is (where _all_ may be at arbitrary distance from _not_ but must be within its scope). But if we retreat to the next level up, say the two-bar constituent level, collocations at the _next_ level up may be immediately relevant (as in _a minimum sentence of two years_ vs. _costs two dollars_), and so on, all the way up to the clause, the sentence, and ultimately the discourse. If we hold off until we have all the information possibly required, we end up with a postsemantic pragmatics (which, we have argued, cannot alone handle intrusion and pragmatic resolution of reference failure).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Here suggestions within the Discourse Representation Theory framework by Kadmon and others are of special interest.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|3.5.4  <br>Kadmon's DRT Proposal and Possible Extensions\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|3.5.4.1  <br>Background\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp 1981, Kamp and Reyle 1993) is one of a family of recent semantic theories that build on the insight that utterances are interpreted incrementally in the context of prior utterances. Although its protagonists often talk as if there was an algorithm that converts syntactic strings into semantic representations of a discourse (Kamp and Reyle 1993: 85), in fact contextual parameters intervene in various ways, most obviously in resolving anaphora (p. 67) or specifying background information (p. 85). Thus DRT is in fact a hybrid pragmatico-semantics, where truth conditions are stated not directly on representations derived solely from syntactic structures but on a level of representation that is only partially determined by the syntactic structure of a single sentence. To start with, a DRS (discourse representation structure) is a representation of a sequence of assetoric sentences (a so-called discourse), so that prior sentences can offer antecedents for anaphoric items in a sentence whose representation is under construction as it were. Kamp's (1981) theory has nothing to say about how choices between competing antecedents are resolved: this is clearly a pragmatic matter except for gender constraints, or grammatical constraints like the Binding Conditions (Chomsky 1981; pragmatic versions of these are described, e.g., in Reinhart 1983 and explored in chapter 4). But a DRS records a choiceand in that way incorporates pragmatic resolution.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Heim (1982, 1983a) independently developed a similar system, File Change Semantics, which contains more explicit suggestions about the incorporation of pragmatic information. 54 Very sketchily, here are the central ideas. Each discourse referent introduced is assigned a new file card, upon which any predications of the discourse referent are added as conditions. A file is a set of file cards, and it represents the state of the discourse at any point; each file can be assigned truth conditions. The\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Definite NPs carry felicity conditions, namely that a file card for their referents already exists (this captures the existence presuppositions of definites). A corollary of the claim that a definite can only be used felicitously if it is familiar, is that definites licensed by common knowledge (_the President_) or by the visual field (_that cat over there_) must be admitted into the file (Heim 1982: 309ff). And to deal with the use of definites _not_ overtly licensed in any of these ways (as in _I am sorry I'm late; the car wouldn't start_), Heim has to appeal to accommodation: they are processed as if they had a preexisting file (1982: 370ff). These cases include "bridging" definites. Thus, pragmatic processes like bridging inferences (I-implicatures in our scheme) are incorporated in files, and it is upon files that truth conditions are stated. Thus pragmatic intrusion is explicitly accepted in this model. 55 Because definite-description felicity conditions behave like classical presuppositions with regards to presuppositional projection, Heim has to relativize the existence implications to particular constructions: in effect, temporary ("local") file cards are introduced in some cases to handle presuppositional denials (_The king of France didn't come; there isn't one;_ but see Heim 1983b). Both DRT and File Change Semantics thus have an explicit representation of "the common ground"; but unlike Stalnaker's (1972) original proposal, the common ground contains not only a set of propositions but also a set of designated variables, discourse referents.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|3.5.4.2  <br>Kadmon's Proposal\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Kadmon (1987) however takes the matter of pragmatic intrusion somewhat further. She takes the DRS to be a complete record of the common ground including all that is implicated. She assumes that implicatures are generated and canceled by a mechanism separate from DRS processing, but that the content of implicatures are recorded in just the same way as entailed content, but in a designated "color" as it were (my metaphor rather than hers), so that they are marked as cancelable.56\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Let us briefly review her suggestions about scalar implicatures. She suggests that indefinites with numeral determiners and common nouns (_n CNs_) like _three boys_ in _Three boys ran away_ should have the same form of semantic content as _a boy_ in the Heim/Kamp proposalsthat is, the phrase should introduce a new discourse referent with the conditions of\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

But because discourse referents in general only have to have their conditions satisfied by _some_ entity in the model, 57 it does not follow that there are no other boys.

Thus Kamp's (1981) scheme for the truth conditions of "If A then B" (where m(A) is the DRS for A and m(B) that for B) reads thus: the conditional _If A then B_ will be true iff every proper embedding of m(A) can be extended to a proper embedding for m(B). Thus A is assessed prior to B, and B is understood as a conditional assertion dependent on A: hence the intrusions of the implicatures of A into the conditions under which one can expect the consequent to hold.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Now, Heim (1983b) has already noted that this treatment of the conditional gives a natural account of presupposition projection: the sequential updating of the context, first by A, and then by B, predicts that where B has a presupposition entailed by A, the presupposition is itself conditional as it were. Because presupposition projection is intrinsically linked to negation, before turning to see how DRT might give a natural account of the metalinguistic negation cases (i.e., intrusion in negative sentences), it will be helpful to examine briefly the problem of _implicature projection._ Indeed the viability of the DRT approach to pragmatic intrusion is likely to depend on the projection properties of conversational implicatures, which have hardly been studied and about which there are currently erroneous assumptions (owing to under-critical acceptance of Gazdar 1979).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|A first point to note is that the projection properties of scalar Qimplicatures look surprisingly similar to those of classical presuppositions (e.g., factives, definite descriptions), as pointed out by Levinson (1983: 223225). Compare, for example, the lifting of a scalar implicature (here 'no more than three') to the suspension of the factive presupposition due to _regret_ (namely, that its complement is true) in the following contexts:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(60) a.

One way of construing this is that an assertion has been previously made in the discourse, viz. (61b), "John has three children". In that case, the scalar implicature 'at most three' would have been added distinctively 'in red ink' into the DRS. (As suggested before, let us imagine that semantic conditions are written into the DRS with black ink, but defeasible pragmatic conditions with red ink, so that they can be canceled at arbitrary distance.)\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Against this background, (61a) is construed as a _denial of the assertion_ of (61b). In the DRT framework there is a natural way to represent that denial, namely by treating example (61a) as quasi-anaphoric to the preceding positive assertion in (61b) so that all the semantic conditions of (61b) are copied over into the DR of (61a). 60 Thus (61a) and (61b) have identical representations except that (61a) has an external negation that ranges over both the entailed content (black ink) and the implicated (red ink) as informally represented in (61c) as italics. The overall DRS already contains entailed commitment to John having at least three children (due to the prior assertion of (61b)), so only the implicated commitment in (61c) (carried over from (61b)) is cancellable. Hence the metalinguistic negation interpretation of (61a) follows naturally, and there is no contradiction (at the level of entailments).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The elegance of the DRT analysis may not immediately strike the reader.

On Horn's account the negation in these cases is not logical (not reducible to a truth-functional one-place connective with the familiar truth table), but "voices an objection to a previous utterance (not proposition) on any grounds whatever." I take this to be a bad part of the analysis, because the negation is in fact in this case behaving exactly like the normal truth-functional operatorit simply ranges over different (nonentailed) content. The correct part of Horn's analysis is that these utterances do indeed "voice an objection to a previous _utterance_" (i.e., to the utterance-meaning, replete with implicatures), and not just to the sentence-meaning, of some previous utterance in the discourse. It is because of that quasi-anaphoric relation between the prior positive sentence (61b) and its later denial in (61 a) that these implicaturedenying negations share certain properties with nonlogical metalinguistic negations (as in "It's not a [va:z] *, it's a [ve1z]*"). As mentioned, metalinguistic negations in general do not permit negative polarity items nor the incorporation of negatives, because they echo the utterances to which they are retorts (Horn 1989: 392402; see also Carston 1996). Horn mistakenly assimilates implicature-denying negations to the nonlogical class of metalinguistic negations because of these shared properties, whereas in fact the properties follow from the shared function as retorts.61\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Turning now to Kempson's account, the good part is the insistence that these negations just are our familiar one-place truth function. The bad part is the assumption that negation could ordinarily range over explicatures. The only case in which implicatures come within the scope of negation is where the negative sentence is a denial of a prior assertion (as Horn insists). The reason that this must be so is that _the implicatures in question would never arise directly under negation:_ the implicatures being denied belong to the prior positive assertion.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Let us expound this point carefully (at the risk of redundancy with the exposition in chapter 2). According to the pragmatic theory developed here so far, for each and every positive Q-scale of the form <_S, W>_ where _S_ is a strong scalar item entailing (in an arbitrary simplex sentence frame) the weak scalar item _W_ (in the same sentence frame), there is a corresponding negative scale <_not-W, not-S>_ where _'not-S'_ (or _'not-W'_) is a shorthand for _S_ (or _W_) occurring within the scope of negation, and _not-W_ entails _not-S_ (in the same sentence frame).62 Thus for example, given the positive scale <_all, some>_, there is a corresponding negative scale _<not-some_ (i.e., _none_), _not-all>_, and the following kinds of implicature are therefore predictedwhere only the weak items induce scalar implicatures:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Indeed 'not four' is entailed by the assertion _not three_ (which means 'not three or more').

According to Horn (1972, 1985, 1989), Gazdar (1979), and Hirschberg (1985), scalar implicatures are simply blocked (i.e., do not arise) under negation. This is an erroneous assumption based on the correct observation that the _same_ implicatures are not shared by positive and negative counterparts of the same sentence (utterance-type). As we have seen, the apparent blockage is due to the fact that negatives reverse scales (because negation effects the strength of scalar items) and so we get different implicatures, which themselves survive negation just as presuppositions do. This opens the way for a fully general account of presupposition and implicature projectionand if Heim (1983b) is right that File Change/DRTtype semantics gives a natural treatment of the former, it should also give a natural treatment of the latter.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|To return to the claims about metalinguistic negation: the DRT treatment can now be appreciated as unifying prior accounts. The negation is ordinary negation (Kempson), the utterance is a denial of a previous positive assertion (Horn), and the implicature that is canceled by the negation is not an implicature of the negative sentence itself (contra\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

None of these models sketch any mechanism for pragmatic resolution; indeed they are often misleadingly phrased in terms of an algorithm deriving semantic representations from syntactic representations.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|But the new Gricean pragmatic theories appear to be in no better shape.

For these theories the essential problem, quite unacknowledged by the way, is this: a Gricean mechanism is supposed to get us from a level of semantic representation, now impoverished to a subpropositional schema of some sort, to a representation capable of specifying propositional content, a level of logical form as it were. But Gricean mechanisms are _reasoning_ mechanisms, and they presuppose propositional input as well as propositional output. In this respect, owing to its explicit commitment to deductive reasoning, Relevance Theory appears especially incoherent: "no assumption is simply decoded [from an utterance], and . . . the recovery of any assumption requires an element of inference" (Sperber and Wilson 1986: 182). But how are we to get from nonlogical forms to further contextual implications that will enrich them by a deductive process that can only handle logical forms? Theories that are abductive or inductive in character, or that are phrased in terms of an inference to the best explanation, may not face this theoretical incoherence, but of course that does not erase the _computational_ problem. Thus Atlas (1989: 146) states "Gricean inference is not restricted to mapping propositions ('what is said') into propositions ('what is implicated'). It also maps Lockean, 'abstract' sentence-meanings into propositions (utterance-meanings)." He goes on to point out that the intrusion phenomena cataloged here (or rather in Levinson 1988b) are evidence for precisely this claim.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|What kind of a computation is it that would take us from underspecified semantic representations to logical forms capable of expressing propositions? Much depends on the form of the input semantic representation, and here Radical Pragmaticists have offered us only the sketchiest of ideas. We might think in terms of logical formulae with unbound variables, or semantic representations with contextual parameters to be instantiated. But clearly, Radical Pragmaticists of all persuasions have in mind representations that are much further divorced from logical forms than this. Even Fodor (1983: 135 n. 29, cited in Atlas 1989: 148) concedes that scope may be indeterminate at this level and that "perhaps the specifically _linguistic_ processes in the production/perception of speech deploy representations that are _shallower_ than logical forms." Atlas (1989: 146) views the indeterminacy in terms of semantic generality and offers various analogies, including the archi-phoneme. Sperber and Wilson (1986: 181) talk of the "development" of a logical form "by using contextual information to complete and enrich this logical form into a propositional form."

First, we have presumed that an ampliative reasoning system must be involved (i.e., a kind of reasoning that, unlike deduction, expands the information given). Just as we may from a few shards guess the outlines of an ancient pot, so we seem to make the ampliative enrichment from a subpropositional to a propositional representation. Deduction can only map determinate logical forms into logical forms. But abduction and induction can map any data format into propositions (e.g., shards into the date they were made). Second, the theory of GCIs offers us a glimpse of how we may constrain this inference to the best interpretation (Atlas and Levinson 1981), namely by using heuristics to warrant _presumptive solutions._\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Let me develop this last point in a little more detail. It has long been noted that humans can coordinate on a single joint solution where the problem involved in fact offers no unique solution, and they can do this in the absence of communication. For example, two people told that they will each get $100 if they think of the same number will beat the infinite odds and think of the same number, often enough at least to make this an expensive experiment (Schelling 1960). Humans solve these problems by considering what each would think the other would think that each would think was the most salient solution. On the Gricean account of communication (Grice 1957), this is exactly the intentional context in which an utterance is offered for comprehensionas a clue to a salient solution to a coordination problem (see Clark 1996: chap. 3). The mutual knowledge that communicator and recipient are mutually oriented to heuristics of the kind proposed herethat is, the Q-, M-, and I-principlesprovide extra, highly salient constraints to the solution of the problem. The problem of course is: how should the speaker frame his utterance so that the proposition the recipient attributes to it has exactly the properties that the speaker intended it to have? Our heuristics recommend to the speaker the selection between forms that might invoke the relevant relations, so that, for example, minimal forms will pick up stereotypical or otherwise more specific interpretations, maximal forms will discourage this, and forms\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Now, the importance of GCIs is that they offer some partial solution for how to get from fragmentary semantic representations to fulsome, proposition-bearing representations or logical forms. Because they are presumptive, and because they depend in the first instance on the recovery of the meaning and form of the particular expressions that give rise to them, the inference can be made without complete access to the logical form of the whole utterance. This has both procedural and psychological aspects. Procedurally, the expression _some of the boys G'd_ can be immediately associated with the default assumption _some but not all of the boys G'd_ even when some indeterminate aspect of the predicate G has not yet been resolved. Psycholinguistically, in the stream of incoming speech during comprehension, the phrase _some of the boys_ can invoke the default assumption 'not all of the boys' even before the predicate has been heard. The default presumption must of course be held separately from the other recovered content because once the predicate is resolved it may be defeated by higher-ordered assumptions (e.g., entailments in the discourse or antecedent assumptions).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Thus the default properties of GCIs account for their intrusive abilities: such inferences can and will be made on the fly and, if not canceled by the mechanisms sketched in this book, will end up within the propositional content of complex sentences whose parts are semantically evaluated with respect to each other (as in comparatives and conditionals, and in the case of denials, evaluated with respect to the corresponding affirmative).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|3.6  <br>Conclusions\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|In this chapter, I have pursued an idea that at first seems nonsensicalnamely, the notion that implicatures could play a role in truth conditions.

He gives conditionals and negations as examples of such embedding locutions and goes on to add: "But where the limits of a license may lie which allows us to relate embedding operators to the standard implicata rather than to conventional meanings, I have to admit I do not know." Knowing the answer to that question will be to have a new and profoundly different understanding of the semantics/pragmatics interface.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

In this chapter, we shall explore another interaction, namely the relation between grammar and pragmatics, and ask how we may be forced to reconstrue this division of labor given the phenomena of GCIs. 1 In both cases, the underlying questions are the same: given the existence of preferred interpretations, and as a corollary, preferred ways of putting things (i.e., expression types associated with preferred interpretations), aspects of interpretation that we have in the past thought of as stipulated by the lexicon or the grammar may in fact be attributable to pragmatic principles of preferred interpretation. This chapter focuses on just one area, anaphora, where plausibly such misattributions have been made.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|It may seem that a theory of implicature or preferred interpretation would be remote from any theory of grammatical well-formedness. Indeed, the relation between syntax and pragmatics is of a fundamentally different kind than the semantics/pragmatics interface, for it is indirect. It is only through effects on meaning, broadly construed, that implicature can impose distributional or collocational constraints. But we should remind ourselves that distinctions between syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic phenomena are not given to us by direct intuition in advance of theoretical development: "On the contrary, the problem of delimitation will clearly remain open until these fields are much better understood than they are today" (Chomsky 1965: 159). With the development of a theory of generalized, default inference, these border discriminations become considerably harder. For example, we may think we are blessed with\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

The theoretical moves over such cases are not so easy, but they do suggest that verb agreement is after all determined by something more complex and contextual than the inheritance of syntactic features of plurality. 2 Thus we cannot accept, in lieu of argument, hunches and presumptions that such and such phenomena have an "unmistakable syntactic flavor."3\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|If we are willing to keep an open mind, it does seem fairly clear that there are intimate connections between distributional constraints and implicature or, more generally, between utterance-form and utterance-type meaning (i.e., the third level of meaning, concerned with favored means for expressing certain meanings, as discussed in chapter 1). There are connections both on the synchronic and diachronic axes. On a synchronic basis, the connections are in principle straightforward: a particular utterance-type or form has a range of semantic interpretations, which are in turn correlated with default implicatures of various types. Such implicatures then preempt alternative expressions, which would instead implicate something else by contrast (as in the familiar play between Iand M-implicating expressions, e.g., in the direct vs. indirect suggestions from _kill_ vs. _cause to die_).4 Implicatures thus restrict collocations of expressions _relative to interpretations,_ as many syntactic principles (e.g., the Binding Conditions) are also held to do. They are much less likely to yield impossible collocations on any interpretation (as other syntactic principles, e.g., movement constraints, may do) because of their defeasible nature (e.g., _immediately, intentionally, directly_ collocate better with _kill_ than _cause to die,_ but they can override the implicature of indirect causation associated with the periphrastic expression). Where such strong collocational constraints exist, they are probably due to an additional 'standardization' (Bach and Harnish 1979: 192195; Bach 1995) or 'short-circuited implicature' (Morgan 1978, Horn and Bayer 1984), as in the licensing by implicated Neg-Raising of negative polarity items in positive subordinate clauses (e.g., "I don't think he has _any_ money"; see Linebarger 1991).5\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Once we turn to a diachronic perspective, the relation between grammar and implicature can be shown to be rather fundamental.

For example, many modals and auxiliaries seem to have acquired their special grammatical status through the implicatures of their prior main-verb usages (Bybee, Pagliuca, and Perkins 1991). Thus the grammatical reanalysis of _be going to V,_ from a verb of motion together with a purposive clause to a future auxiliary, may plausibly be claimed to be based on the combined temporal implicatures of _go_ and the purposive construction (Hopper and Traugott 1993: 82ff). There is a main-verb reading of _go_ in (la) below, followed by a purposive clause, the whole glossable as in (1b). On this (the original) interpretation, implicatures arise that the subject will indeed reach the destination in the future, and that he will carry out the intended course of action. It is these strong future implications that have been grammaticalized into a new structural pattern with a fixed interpretationnamely, _be going to_ analyzed as an auxiliary constituent with future time reference, roughly with the gloss in (1d) (intentional implications perhaps persisting).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(1) a.

One major source for new grammatical constructions is what we have called I-implicatures; for example, the evolution of causal _since_ from an earlier purely temporal connective with the meaning 'after' is nicely documented by Traugott and Heine (1991). Similarly, M-implicatures seem to play a systematic role in deriving, and rederiving, emphatic reflexives (Langacker 1977, Faltz 1989), a point to which I will return.

In this chapter, this diachronic layering will play an important role in our attempt to understand crosslinguistic patterns of anaphora in implicatural terms. In short, the historical evidence points to systematic relations between grammar and implicature that ought to be more carefully explored as an interesting test ground for different theories of implicature.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|If we may take as granted that grammaticalization often involves the codification of a new construction out of an expression plus its generalized implicatures, then there are some general consequences for the analysis of grammar:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|1.

This choice is not fortuitous. Anaphora has been the focus of a tremendous amount of work over 30 years of the generative tradition, and especially within the Government and Binding (GB) or Principles and Parameters framework (Chomsky 1981, 1986, 1995: chap. 1), and thus also within its direct competitors. In the GB framework, the Binding Conditions governing the interpretations of different kinds of overt referring expressions were also intended to hold for covert nominals (NP traces, _pro,_ PRO, and variables). Thus the Binding Conditions had a central position within syntactic theory, effectively controlling both anaphora and movement. Since then there has been a tendency to handle movement constraints in other ways (by chain theory) and restrict the Binding Principles to the handling of anaphora. Still, in Chomsky's Minimalist Program, the Binding Conditions still play a crucial role, and remain essentially the same, except that they are recast as interpretive conditions holding at the level of LF (Chomsky 1995: 211). Intrasentential anaphora thus continues to be a focus of current work within the generative framework (see, e.g., Reinhart and Reuland 1993, Koster and Reuland 1991, Hornstein 1995, Harbert 1995). Here then are a series of closely argued proposals about syntactic constraints on the interpretation of anaphoric expressions. If we could successfully show that at least some of these constraints are in fact not syntactic in origin, but follow from patterns of preferred interpretation, it would amount to a substantial redistribution of the division of labor between grammar and pragmatics. I shall make tentative proposals along these lines, trying to attribute to our existing apparatus of inferential heuristics some of the patterns of interpretation that have been thought to be syntactically specified.

But briefly, the goal has nothing to do with wholesale functional reductionism. It has rather to do with introducing an additional toola rival line of explanation that has been grossly underestimated, largely because pragmatic inference has been thought to be largely contextual and thus not systematic. Once the very notion of a preferred interpretation based on highly general principles is accepted, it opens up the possibility of a radical redivision of labor between grammar and pragmatics. The possibility ought to be welcomed by grammarians, because once recalcitrant phenomena with the hallmarks of preferred defeasible interpretations are removed from what is to be explained, much cleaner syntactic theories may become available. Because GCI theory is in its infancy, worked on by only a handful of scholars, we cannot expect these first attempts to handle all of the complexities. If first indications are even at all promising, however, it ought to indicate that more work should be diverted in this direction.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Often, the reactions of syntacticians to such attempts to renegotiate the division of labor are of the form "a miss is as good as a mile," with the provision of a few apparent counterexamples; but all syntactic theories, in the domain of anaphora at least, are also replete with counterexamples (and indeed Chomsky (1995: 19f) himself sees the need for fairly radical idealization). Because the pragmatic theory, in a way to be explained, is in crucial cases essentially parasitic on the syntactic theory, the apparent counterexamples for the pragmatic theory may actually reflect inadequate syntactic analysis. Indeed, one of the special properties of pragmatic analyses is that they are simple, direct instantiations of enormously general, crosslinguistic tendenciesyou cannot tinker with them to get the right result in a particular language in the same way that you can finetune a syntactic analysis. In the long run, when such pragmatic principles are better grounded, we may even be able to use the pragmatic theory predictions to help in the fine-tuning of the syntactic analysis: because the pragmatics operates on the syntactically specified interpretations to yield further preferred interpretations, if the latter are incorrectly predicted it may indicate that the former have been misanalyzed.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

(Incidentally, the special Chomskyan sense of _Anaphor_reflexives, reciprocals, and their likewill be distinguished by a capital letter; the unmodified term _pronoun_ will be used in the Chomskyan manner to exclude reflexive pronouns.) Not every anaphoric expression has a referential interpretation. In _Everybody has his foibles,_ for example, the pronoun _his_ is usually thought to be equivalent to a logical variable, whereas in _John has his foibles,_ the pronoun _his_when its referent is coidentified with Johnis usually thought to be parasitically referential, through linkage to _John._ Some of these decisions are theory-dependent, and I shall loosely talk about coreference and disjoint reference without necessarily presuming that the anaphoric elements in question are strictly referential. I am concerned here only with NP-anaphora, but there are many other kinds (see Webber 1979: chap. 1 for a catalogue).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Despite the preoccupation with anaphora in the syntax and semantics journals, there are good prima facie reasons to think that anaphora is primarily a pragmatic matter. Anaphora is, after all, basically a crosssentence ("discourse") phenomenon and thus quite largely outside the domain of intrasentential processes. Now it would be odd if crosssentence patterns of interpretation were entirely unrelated to intrasentential patterns; and of course they aren't. Consider for example the parallel between (2) (so-called discourse anaphora) and (3) (sentential anaphora).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|<br>\\|<br>\\|\\\|   \\\|   \\\|<br>\\\|---\\\|---\\\|<br>\\\|\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|(2) a.

Not all grammar is "frozen pragmatics" of course, but some undoubtedly is. From a diachronic perspective, there is thus no necessary incompatibility between a grammatical and a pragmatic analysis. From a synchronic perspective, on the other hand, we clearly want just one analysis. In trying to decide whether we are dealing with grammatical stipulation or mere preferred interpretation, we inevitably appeal to our litmus test of defeasibilityin (4b) coreference is preferred but not necessary, and in (4c) there is only one interpretation.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Another, more fundamental reason for thinking of anaphora primarily in pragmatic terms has to do with the essence of anaphoric expressions: they are semantically general, and require additional contextual resolution or inferential specification. Anaphora consists in the _referential dependence_ of one NP on another, rather than simply in the matter of coreference. (One might have accidental coreferenceas when a speaker forgets that he has already mentioned some protagonist or is unaware that Cicero was the same man as Tully.) That referential dependence can only arise if an NP fails on its own to achieve reference, generally through under-specification. That is why pronouns are the primary type of anaphoric expression in many languages; they are minimal nominal expressions with maximal semantic generality (usually encoding only some subset of person, number, gender, and case features). Although languages may generally (but apparently not universally) have specialized expressions that are _necessarily_ referentially dependent, like _himself_ in English, just about any semantically general expression can function anaphorically.

Yet the only difference is that in the (a) sentences a semantically more specific (less general) description precedes a compatible one that is semantically less specific (more general), whereas in the (b) sentences the order is reversed. This shows, I think, that semantic generality is at the heart of anaphora; it is the essential property for an anaphoric expression. Now notice that semantic generality is also the essential property inducing I-implicaturesfor example, it is the semantic generality of "I don't like garlic" that invites the inference 'I dislike garlic', and the semantic generality of conjunction that suggests causality in "He threw the switch and the engine stopped."

In many languages, even those restrictions are missing (e.g., in many Australian languages, a single third-singular pronoun will cover any animate entity indiscriminately).

Anaphoric potential is, on the whole, a property not of expressions but of uses of expressions. Nevertheless, the more semantically general an expression is, the greater the likelihood that it will be descriptively inadequate for reference identification, and thus the greater the chance that it must be referentially dependent (hence the tendency to the anaphoric use of pronouns even though they are capable of supporting in many circumstances a directly referential use).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|In perhaps the majority of languages (including the Australian ones again) NP-anaphora is also expressed through an NP-gapby dropping the NP altogether. Such a device gives us the limiting caseNP-gaps are of course at the extreme limit of semantic generality, with no intrinsic content features of their own. Many languages thus provide their speakers with a scale of semantically reduced NPs that includes at least the following kinds of expressions:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|lexical NPs > pronouns > NP-gaps\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|where a choice towards the right increases the likelihood of an anaphoric reading.8\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Thus an anaphoric NP is dependent by virtue of being semantically general to the point that it fails to adequately refer; it is only by being linked to some other, usually prior, NP that has fuller semantic specification (or is linked to one that does) that reference is achieved. But that linkage is nearly always pragmatic and inferential and scarcely ever a matter of grammatical specificationit is generally agreed that (besides any gender restrictions) the only information that a grammar provides (if any) is some specification of the domain in which a search for an antecedent can be made. (Sometimes it will turn out, of course, that there is only one possible antecedent in the specified domain, but that is a matter of accident.) Although the grammars of some languages (but not all, as we shall see) provide forms that are _necessarily_ referentially dependent within some domain (_Anaphors_ in the GB sense, or reflexives and reciprocals in particular), the linkage process itself nearly always remains firmly outside grammar in pragmatics and is often, as we know, a matter\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

They do this by suggesting that antecedents can be found locally, or alternatively, by contrast, outside a local domain. To be succinct: the use of a relatively semantically general expression (like a pronoun) will I-implicate local coreference, and the use of a more semantically specific expression (like a definite description) will M-implicate the complementary interpretation (i.e., disjointness from the reference of local NPs).11 In the case of crosssentential anaphora, the relevant concept of a local domain will be given to us by a theory of discourse (as for example sketched in Fox 1987, where the local domain amounts to a single conversational sequence). In the case of intrasentential anaphora, local domains are given to us by the syntax. In addition to the role of the I- and M-principles, the Q-principle will suggest that if a less informative, less restrictive expression (like a pronoun) is used just where a contrastive more informative expression (like a reflexive) could have been used instead, then the reading that would have come about through the use of the more informative expression is _not_ intended. These are very simple, switch-like operators:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

The explanation will go like this: I-implicatures predominate in the absence of countervailing Q or M implicatures, so in the (a) sentences there will be a general preference for local coreference encouraged by the use of semantically general forms. On the other hand, where, as in the (b) sentences, a marked, more prolix expression has been used, we obtain an M-implicature that is complementary to that which would have arisen by I-implicature from the use of the simple expressionin other words, we will now obtain the preference for noncoreference in a local domain. (Note that the reading in (13b) is normally assumed to be stipulated by grammatical principle, but it is also predicted by the pragmatic pattern.)

Our principles are just one component in a full account of how reference tracking takes place. Much work has been done on the empirical study of tendencies in various kinds of discourse, and it is clear that many complex factors are at work (see, e.g., Fox 1996). One should note that the GCI contribution to a full account of reference tracking in discourse is intended to be modest (the critique in Ariel 1994 mistakes it for an exhaustive theory of anaphora). A full account will certainly involve topic and "paragraph" units and other measures of textual distance to antecedents, thematic and syntactic saliency, cognitive saliency and mutual accessibility, encyclopedic associations, and so on (see, e.g., Kibrik 1996). Second, modest though the contribution is, it is essential: GCIs provide vital semiotic signals about roughly where to look for antecedentsit is, unlike many of the other factors, _part of the signal_ itself, a kind of meaning that piggybacks on the central coded significance, as sketched in the Introduction and chapter 1. 12\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|4.2.2  <br>Inferring Coreference13\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|I have claimed that the basic anaphora pattern is for a relatively semantically general NP to pick up coreference locally and a marked or prolix one to indicate that that would be inappropriate. It is important to show that there is some natural way in which the preference for locally coreferent interpretations of semantically general expressions is a by-product of the I-principle. What must be shown in particular is that where a coreferential interpretation is available it will generally provide an informationally richer, more informative, stereotypical, and "better" interpretation in line with the general direction of that principle.14 It is possible to show that, in general, coreferential interpretations will indeed be more informative than noncoreferential ones.

(Without such a theoretical argument, linking the preference for coreferential interpretations to the I-principle, we will have to state condition (c) as an independent pragmatic principle.) The argument would go as follows: a coreferential interpretation reduces the number of entities required in the domain of discoursethat is, the interpretation can proceed on a smaller domain of discourse than it could on a noncoreferential interpretation. But if the set of entities in the domain of discourse is smaller, so too will be the number of state descriptions _compatible_ with the assertion in question. 15 Thus the assertion will be, from an extensional point of view, less "general" (i.e., compatible with fewer possible states of affairs) and thus more specific and informative on the assumption of the minimal possible domain of discourse. Assuming coreference rather than introducing further entities into the domain of discourse will thus increase the informativeness of a statementand hence, it may be argued, the preference for coreferential interpretations can be seen to be properly a part of the I- principle.16\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Popper (1959: 68ff) independently offers another argument leading in the same direction. Existential statements are weakthey are not falsifiable by any single observation; consequently, the fewer existential commitments the stronger the "theory" (read "assertion" for our purposes).

Thus the preference for coreferential interpretations can also be seen to follow naturally from the I-principle on this alternative Popperian account. 17\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Some differences between these two accounts are worth pointing out. Notice that the Carnapian argument is at the level of reference; it is an argument favoring the assumption of parsimony in referenceit might be glossed "for interpretation, choose a domain (D) or world (compatible with all one knows) that makes a statement most specific and thus maximizes D-informativeness." The Popperian argument assumes that the domain of discourse is held constant, and offers an evaluation for alternative statements that a sentence might have been used to makeit might be glossed "choose the logical form (or set of truth conditions, or proposition expressed) that minimizes existential commitment and thus maximizes P-informativeness." It is thus an argument essentially at the level of logical form, although because it involves the referential apparatus of existential quantification, it is also an argument at the level of reference.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|There may be other ways in which to derive the preference for coreferential readings from the Principle of Informativeness. If both of the above arguments are partially at the level of reference, another argument is at the level of sense. In 'John came in and he sat down', regardless of the domain of discourse, the coreferential reading is obviously more informative _about John._ Indeed the coreferential reading is more informative about John than the noncoreferential reading would be about either referent if distinct; it is likely therefore to be a better, more informative interpretation. 18\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Recently, and largely independently of the philosophical tradition, notions similar to these have been explored in AI approaches to "common-sense reasoning." For example (as mentioned in chapter 1), some nonmonotonic reasoning systems employ the notion of circumscription (see Ginsberg 1987, sect. 3), which limits the model in which formulae are proved. The idea is to capture common-sense reasoning of the kind "Assume the car will start unless one knows it is broken" by adding specific conjectures about the data base to the reasoning system. One such conjecture is: if the system can't prove that certain entities satisfy a predicate (e.g., the battery is flat), then assume they do not satisfy it (i.e., the battery is not flat). Another is: if the system doesn't know about certain entities, then assume they don't exist (e.g., don't even consider that the _a_\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Assume then that, for the domain in question, "the known entities are all there are." McCarthy (1980) calls this _domain circumscription_ and notes that it is closely related to communicational presumptions, which turn such a conjecture into something more like a reliable rule of inference. Minimizing the domain of discourse is informative, on this account, because it allows us to make many additional inferences.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Yet another argument would make the preference for coreference a mere side effect of the search for strong I-induced connections across clauses. For example, by identifying _John_ and _he_ in (16) we can interpret the two VPs as describing a single complex action, here the action of entering in order to sit down:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(16) a.

There is a great deal of crosslinguistic evidence, nicely surveyed by Foley and Van Valin 1983, that supports the view that coreference assignment is intimately connected to cross-clause linkage. They claim that, looking at multiclause constructions in general, the tighter the encoded semantic linkage, the greater the degree of syntactic bonding, and the more tendency to coreference across clauses (see also Haiman 1985a, Lehmann 1988). Again, working from the point of view of computational pragmatics, Hobbs (1979, 1982) argues that it is the assumption of a specific kind of conceptual linkage between clauses that determines coreference rather than the other way around. The presumption (by the I-principle in our scheme) is that any two clauses _will_ be linked by one of a number of restricted conceptual ties (causality, instantiation, etc.) and in general this will require coreference across the clauses. There is much to be said for this alternative conceptualization of the problem, but it is surely a complementary perspective. In any case, here we will tend to idealize away from this more global view of the nature of coreference assignments.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|I shall assume that at least one of these arguments, and most probably a conjunction of a number of them, 19 is sound and that we may thus derive the preference for coreferential readings from the general I-principle, rather than stipulate it. And in any case, we may take that preference to be an empirical fact, whatever the success of this theoretical account.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

As I noted in chapter 2, the I-principle is triggered by expressions that are either _brief_ or _semantically general,_ the two generally being correlated by Zipfian principles (see Levinson 1987b for further discussion). The corollary is that, by the M-principle, if a speaker wants the addressee to avoid such a coreferential interpretation, the NP in question should be marked in form or semantically specific in content. Thus (to partially repeat earlier examples) we have the patterns in the following contrastive pairs of utterances (preferred readings marked with the appropriate indices):\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(17) a.

Now, implicatures being defeasible, there are systematic counterexamples. If the succeeding "heavy" NP can be seen as motivated by expressing an attitude of the speaker (as in epithets), or expanded to add a piece of further descriptive or explanatory information, it may nevertheless be read as coreferential:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(18) a.

Less obvious is that the Q-principle might also be involved in generating disjoint interpretations. Q-inferences typically (but not exclusively) operate over _privative opposites_ (Horn 1989: 317ff), where two expressions differ only in that one of the pair has additional semantic specification. Arguably, pronouns and reflexives have precisely this property: thus _himself_ and _him_ both have reference to singular, male entities whose identity is recoverable from context. They differ in that the reflexive has an additional property, which one may conceive of in different ways: one could hold that _himself_ must\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

In either case, in a straightforward way, the reflexive is more informative than the pronoun: it fixes reference much more narrowly. Even where the pronoun is presumed to be referentially dependent, while the reflexive must find an antecedent in a limited domain, the pronoun may pick up an antecedent in a much wider domain. A reflexive thus effectively rules out many more referential possibilities and by the Bar-Hillel and Carnap metric must be judged more informative than a corresponding pronoun. The Popperian metric, whereby the less existential commitments the stronger the statement, will also give the same result. 20\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Now, expressions that are paradigmatically contrastive (can occur in the same syntactic slots), that are in privative opposition within a semantic field, and that are both lexicalized ought to form a Horn scale. If _<himself, him>_ forms such a scale, asserting an utterance with the less informative _him_ in a slot where the expression _himself_ could have occurred should implicate that the speaker is avoiding the more informative statement. In effect, by utilizing a pronoun where a reflexive could have been used, the speaker Q-implicates disjoint reference. This gives us an alternative, and perhaps at first sight implausible, account of the following familiar pattern:21\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|<br>\\|<br>\\|\\\|   \\\|   \\\|<br>\\\|---\\\|---\\\|<br>\\\|\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|(19) a.

It may be that we are dealing here with a partially or generally grammaticalized pattern in English (although the limited defeasibility then needs some explanation).

One piece of evidence (to be discussed at length in section 4.3.3.1) is that there are languages without any overt marking of reflexivity (contrary to the many confident claims that no such languages existsee, e.g., Reinhart and Reuland 1993: 662). If the preference for reading statements of the kind 'John hit him' was only due to Q-implicature from the availability of a reflexive that was not used, it would be hard to understand the patterns in these languages, where the same (if much weaker) preference persists. Later, I shall attribute this to a background presumption that co-arguments of a verb are distinct in reference. Such a principle might be grounded in various ways. Indeed, I shall entertain the idea that the presumption of clausemate distinctness is simply an I-principle induced preference for the stereotype, where the stereotypical actions that humans are preoccupied with are irreflexive. If so, it should be easily canceled by Q- or M-inferences, which, as we have noted, always take priority if inconsistent (this raises one set of problems, which I discuss in section 4.3.3). In the English case, then, this I-inference to disjointness would be overridden by the semantics of the reflexive and reinforced by the Q-implicature to noncoreference by the use of a pronoun where a reflexive could have been used to refer to what a co-argument refers to. This double implicature in the case of nonreflexive pronouns will not prove totally redundant: often, reflexives encode more than just referential identity, so that avoiding a reflexive may be motivated by other considerations; but the I-presumption of coargument distinctness will help to focus the contrast between pronoun and reflexive on reference alone just when antecedent and anaphoric expression are co-arguments of the same verb.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|4.3  <br>Binding Theory and Pragmatics\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|4.3.1  <br>Introduction\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Let us turn now to intrasentential anaphora, the area where we expect to find competing grammatical and pragmatic accounts of constraints on\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Particularly worrisome, though, is the crosslinguistic evidence that points to substantial differences, especially with regards to Anaphors that can be bound at seemingly arbitrarily long distances. The response has been a flurry of attempts to come up with better formulations. It would be impossible here to review the many alternative formulations that have been proposed. Suffice it to say that there are a number of critical ways to fine-tune the predictions. First, one can employ different notions of c-command or, more radically, seek to replace it altogether with other notions less directly configurational (theta-hierarchies or obliqueness hierarchies, see, e.g., Jackendoff 1972 or Pollard and Sag 1994). Second, one might rethink the basic classification of NPs in three types (Anaphors, pronominals, and R-expressions): one could deny that everything that looks like a reflexive is an Anaphor, or one could insist on different kinds of Anaphors, and so on. Third, and this has been the major focus of research, one can play with the definition of the domain _D_ in rather different ways: (a) one can, like Chomsky, attempt to hold onto a universal definition but so arrange things that the _D_ for Anaphors is effectively slightly different than the _D_ for pronominals, so handling one class of counterexamples where the general complementary distribution of pronominals and anaphors breaks down; (b) one can abandon universal constraints and specify, for example, a domain _D_ according to each language; or one can allow that some languages may have more than one kind of Anaphor, each with different relevant domains. On the whole, the preferred solution is to parameterize _D_ or the notion of governing categorythat is, to handle the variation needed both across languages and within languages with different kinds of Anaphors, by expanding or contracting the local domain _D_ by specifying that it must also contain some other element, such as a subject or an agreement feature (see Reuland and Koster 1991: 2, and other papers in Koster and Reuland 1991, Harbert 1995).

Conditions B and C are then reduced to pragmatics by showing them to be the consequence of applying GCI theory to Condition A.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|This account relies heavily both on Chomsky's original (1981) formulation of the problems and the data and on Reinhart's (1983) own proposals for pragmatic reductionism. I dub this the _A-first account_ because it derives the rest of the anaphora patterns from Condition A of the Binding Theory.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|However, it has become clear that the original formulation of the problem is not quite correct; in particular, it ignores the following aspects of the problem that have filled the linguistics journals between 1982 and the present:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|1.

In those languages that permit zero-anaphora (e.g., the so-called _pro-drop_ languages like Italian, or many nonconfigurational languages, like most of the Australian ones) we can extend the scale of reduction, from lexical NP, to pronoun, to NP-gap. And our pragmatic principles can now be seen to predict the general anaphora pattern along the following lines.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|First of all, the I-principle will tend to favor locally coreferential interpretations wherever feasible, but especially where an NP tends towards semantic generality. Second, this tendency will be tempered by the M-principle, for by the Hornian division of labor wherever an I-implicature would lead to a coreferential interpretation, the use of a marked or prolix expression will M-implicate the complementary disjoint interpretation. By our projection principles, M-implicatures defeat incompatible I-implicatures; therefore, the use of a marked expression will overrule the tendency to coreferential interpretations.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(26) _The general anaphora pattern_\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|![C0309-01.gif](../Images/04c005d058244bcf48997ae1d52541fc.gif)\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|An interesting prediction here is that where a language permits anaphora by NP-gap, the use of a pronoun despite its semantic generality will Mimplicate some contrastive interpretation, and quite often a contrast in local noncoreference. Usage in many languages seems to support this prediction (e.g., in Chinese, Guugu Yimithirr, Tamil, Korean, Turkish, Greek) 26 although the contrast is by no means invariably interpreted on every occasion as a contrast in intended reference (but rather, sometimes in terms of emphasis, topichood, etc.).27\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|So far, we have employed only part of the pragmatic apparatus developed here.

In section 4.2.3 I suggested that reflexives and pronouns are in the kind of privative opposition typical of Horn scales, of the form <_himself, him>_ and thus that the use of the pronoun can Q-implicate that the reflexive situation does not obtain. The use of a reflexive will indicate coreference by semantic stipulation (in the A-first theory). But wherever a nonreflexive pronoun is used in a locus where a reflexive is structurally permitted, the I-inference will be overruled by a strong scalar Q-inference to disjointness (recollect that Q inferences always take priority over I-inferences). Both M- and Qprinciples thus constrain I-inferences to coreference.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|This much seems to follow directly from the theory outlined in chapters 1 and 2nothing more needs to be stipulated.

Then, taking Condition A as given, we can derive Condition B and C along the following lines:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

First of all, the use of the sentence in (28a) contrasts with the use of the reflexive as in (28a'). The alternates <_himself, him>_ form a clear contrast set, one member more informative than the other, as in a Horn scale, such that the use of the weaker _him_ Q-implicates the inapplicability of the stronger _himself._ 28 Second, Q-implicatures can only arise where there is a possible alternation between a stronger and weaker expression, such as a reflexive versus nonreflexive pronoun. There is no such possibility for the subject pronoun in (28b)(28b') is ungrammatical. In the absence of any Q-implicatures to block I-enrichment, the I-principle will induce coreference in order to achieve parsimony in reference; any semantically general expressions, minimized in an informational\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

(There is of course no account of this preference within the GB framework, but within our pragmatic framework it is correctly predicted.)\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Finally, however, expressions of roughly equal semantic generality may contrast on the level of markedness of linguistic form (they may be periphrastic phrases, complex in derivational morphology, or nonidiomatic terms). Where there is such a set, and a marked form is employed, an M-implicature will arise to suggest the complementary interpretation to the I-implicature that would have arisen from the use of the unmarked alternate. Thus the use of _the man_ in (28c) induces an M-implicature to noncoreferentiality, just where the pronoun _he_ would induce an I-implicature to coreferentiality.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|It should be clear from the analysis of the sentences in (28) that we now have a partial pragmatic reduction of the Binding Conditions themselves.

Condition B is then predicted (and rendered unnecessary) by the Q-principle as follows: wherever a reflexive (the semantically stronger expression) could occur, the use of a pronoun (the semantically weaker expression) will Q-implicate the inapplicability of a coreferential reading. We will thus obtain the complementary distribution of Anaphors and coreferentially interpretable pronouns, without invoking a separate Condition B. Where reflexives cannot occur, pronouns, being semantically general, will I-implicate preferred coreferential interpretations (a pattern for which there is, quite properly, no GB account, it being clearly a matter of preferred interpretation).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|3. The pattern described in Condition C is the outcome of two pragmatic principles: the one applied to Condition A, the other to the pattern normally labeled Condition B. The Q-principle, just as in the case of pronouns, will induce a noncoreferential interpretation wherever a lexical NP is used where a reflexive might have occurred (this alone would predict a similar distribution for pronouns and lexical NPs). Additionally, however, the use of the more prolix or marked lexical NP where a reflexive could not have occurred, and thus where a pronoun would normally be subject to I-induced coreferentiality, will M-implicate disjoint reference (thus distinguishing lexical NPs from pronouns in terms of distribution on coreferential interpretations).

In addition, there has been a growing body of counterexamples not only to the original Binding Conditions but also to the successive revisions developed to account for class after class of problems. This in turn has led some authors to acknowledge that much that had been thought to be grammatically stipulated is in fact better handled by a pragmatic or discourse theory. These retreats naturally open up an acknowledged space for a pragmatic account.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Now, there are some significant residual problems for such a first approximation to a pragmatic reduction of Binding Conditions B and C.

First, the pragmatic account appears to be in trouble wherever the complementary distribution between Anaphors and (nonreflexive) pronouns breaks down. This in fact happens in English in a number of wellstudied contexts, for example certain prepositional phrases:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(30) a.

Arguably, the unacceptability of _*He__1 thinks John1 is a genius_ is far too strong to be accounted for just by the M-principle. We may point to the fact that the ban on the coreferential interpretation is in fact defeasiblefor example, the sentence becomes acceptable when the context sets up a special relevant property of, say, thinking-John-to-be-agenius as in _Everybody thinks John is a genius, why, even he__1 thinks John1 is a genius._ Still, there is a contrast in acceptability between _John__1 thinks John1 is a genius_ (relatively acceptable) and _He__1 thinks John1 is a genius_ (relatively unacceptable), and this is not so easily explained by the Mprinciple alone.

But before proceeding, the reader should bear in mind that the moves taken in an A-first pragmatic analysis, which takes a Condition A for granted and gets the B and C patterns partly by mirror image from A, depend critically on the exact specification of Condition A. Thus the kinds of move that the pragmaticist should make here are very much determined by the choice of a syntactic or semantic account. Let us focus first on an approach particularly intended to interact with a pragmatic account. Later, however, we will return to consider some other approaches drawn from some of the many different contemporary kinds\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Note though that on an A-first account, most of the configurational constraints in the Binding Theory are not lost. Rather the constraints in Conditions B and C are now in part obtained by pragmatic reflection from the syntactically specified Condition A pattern, such that a pronoun in any structural location where a reflexive could have occurred, will be implicated to be free (unbound) in that locus. But further specific constraints on the occurrence of full NPs and pronouns seem now to have no account, as for example the just noted pattern where a c-commanded pronoun may be coreferential even if fronted (as in _Near him__1, John1 saw a snake_) whereas a pronoun c-commanding a lexical NP may not be, even if fronted (_*Near John__1, he1 saw a snake_). We clearly need some additional machinery, either in the way of constraints on full coreferring NPs in the rheme, or in terms of something like c-command. In this section, we explore the possibilities of building in more configurational constraints into the A-first account.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Reinhart (1983) develops an interesting account of the English binding patterns which makes a fundamental distinction between grammatical coindexing and mere coreference, an account since extended in various ways (Reinhart 1986, Grodzinsky and Reinhart 1993). On this account, only grammatical coindexing comes within the Binding Theory, and grammatical coindexing is invariably semantically interpreted as variable binding. Reflexives get grammatically coindexed, and interpreted as variables, as is usually assumed. Moreover, a reflexive or nonreflexive bound by a quantifier also of course has the variable interpretation. But nonreflexive pronouns also can get coindexed just in case they are ccommanded by an NP outside their local domain, in which case they must also be interpreted as variables.

This is demonstrated by the optional sloppy-identity reading of the ellipsed VP in (33e), where Humphrey thinks Humphrey, rather than Oscar, is a genius. Reinhart points out that in most circumstances a referential versus variable reading of (33c) amounts to an "equivalence" in interpretations (Reinhart 1983; Grodzinsky and Reinhart 1993: 74). The structures that allow these interpretations seem to be just the ones where a pronoun is c-commanded by an NP, matching in person, gender, and number, and where Condition B is met (the pronoun's antecedent is outside the minimal governing category). Thus in (33f), where _Oscar_ does not c-command the pronoun, the bound-variable reading for the pronoun appears to be ruled out (although coreference is always possible in these structures).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Now on this analysis _only_ bound-variable structures (i.e., reflexives generally and pronominals c-commanded by compatible NPs) come under the Binding Conditions, and these alone can be syntactically coindexed. Any other kind of coreference is just that, reference to an entity that happens to have been referred to before (such NPs will thus have distinct syntactic indices, although they may be interpreted as coreferring for other reasons). This leaves the following central "ungrammatical" patterns entirely unaccounted for at a syntactic level, although they would be ruled out by the classical Binding Conditions B (for (34a)) and C (for (34bd)).

She proposes (Reinhart 1983: 167) a pragmatic principle, a Manner maxim, "be as explicit as conditions permit." When applied to the structures in consideration, this amounts to the following addressee's strategy of interpretation: If the speaker avoids the bound-anaphora options provided by the structure he is using, then, unless he has reasons to avoid bound anaphora, he did not intend his expressions to corefer. Thus we have a specific explanation for why _He thinks that Oscar is brilliant_ resists a coreferential interpretation: the speaker has avoided the parallel structure _Oscar thinks that he is brilliant,_ which would have allowed the strong semantic interpretation. But because the source of the ban is pragmatic, defeasibility is permittedespecially where the bound-anaphora interpretation would in fact imply something different (Grodzinsky and Reinhart 1993: 79). Thus in apparent violations of Binding Conditions B and C, as in the following examples, these cases are not coindexed, merely coreferential, and further, they are interpretable as coreferring just because alternatives with reflexives (which would receive the bound-variable interpretation) would not be what the speaker meant:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(35) a.

Reinhart's account thus gives us two kinds of possibilities for syntactically encoding coreference: either through reflexives or through c-commanded pronouns. As a result, we get two pragmatic reflections of syntactic constraints on interpretation: the first, which we may call the _first mirror-image rule,_ gives us a strong disjoint reading wherever a reflexive could have occurred (an approximation to Condition B as sketched above), and a second inference, the _second mirror-image rule,_ gives us a strong disjoint reading for the pattern _Pronoun c-commanding lexical-NP._ The mirror image is given to us in both cases by the Q-principle: if you have not used an informative expression where you could have, then such an informative interpretation is not intended (italics in the example sentences indicate once again readings where the italicized NPs are coreferential):\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(37) a.

But a novel way of thinking of Reinhart's analysis-not one she promotes, by the wayis that it really amounts to claiming that English has something a bit like long-distance Anaphors (LDAs) disguised as ordinary pronouns: these are the pronominals under the bound-anaphora reading. The semantics is essentially the same for both reflexives and bound pronominals (her informal logical forms are shown in (37h,i)), but they must find their antecedents either within the local domain (for reflexives) or outside it (for pronominals acting as bound variables). LDAs indubitably exist in many languages, where an analysis in terms of features both pronominal and Anaphoric are sometimes proposed, as we shall see below. In any case, the central fact captured by Chomsky's Condition B, namely the unacceptability of interpretations like _John__1 admires him1_, is on Reinhart's account (like ours) a pragmatic fact. Consequently, we can think about Reinhart's approach as requiring a boosted Condition A, in line with A-first pragmatic account proposed here, which now has two syntactic/semantic components: a rule of interpretation for reflexives (just as in the classical Condition A), and a rule of interpretation for pronouns c-commanded by NPs. 30\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The skeptic will raise various doubts about both Reinhart's analysis and the proposed interaction with our three GCI principles. Let us deal with the latter first. How exactly does the pronominal variable case (or rather the pattern _Pronoun c-commanding lexical-NP_) come within our Qprinciple? Two doubts might be raised: (a) it cannot participate in a Horn scale because the pattern is an opposition between structures, not between expressions; and (b) the construction that would have to be held to be the informationally strong one, is in fact rather weak because it is ambiguous (between a variable and referential interpretation). In answer to the first doubt, we have already noted various systematic oppositions between structures, capable of yielding Q-inferences. For example, we considered in chapter 2 Gazdar's (1979) analysis of clausal implicatures, where it is proposed that there is an opposition between such structures as _Since p, q_ and _If p, q:_ the use of the less informative conditional, which does not\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

In a similar way, a speaker who uses the structure _Pronoun c-commanding lexical-NP_ where he might have used the alternative _lexical-NP c-commanding Pronoun_ (thus permitting grammatical coindexing), appears to wish to avoid that stronger interpretation. Let us turn now to the question of how an _ambiguous_ construction or expression could be held to be the stronger term in a Q-opposition of this kind. In fact it seems quite generally to be the case that if the most precise, concise way to say that _p_ is _U,_ even where _U_ is semantically ambiguous or general over _p_ and _q,_ and the speaker instead chooses to say _W,_ which is semantically or formally distinct from _U,_ then he will suggest that he is avoiding _U_ and its implicatures. Take for example the M-opposition between _kill_ and _cause to die:_ the lexical causative does not entail direct causation but is instead semantically general over direct and indirect causation. Nevertheless, _kill_ comes to be pragmatically specialized by I-implicature to direct causation, so that _cause to die_ suggests indirect causation by M-implicature. More closely parallel, _most_ is a quantifier that has a certain generality of meaningspecifically, it does not semantically exclude 'all'; otherwise _Most, in fact all, of the boys have scarlet fever_ would be a contradiction. Still if one says _Many of the boys have scarlet fever,_ one implicates 'not most', thus showing that the semantic generality of _most_ is not inhibitive of Q-implicatures. Similarly, the quantifier _some_ may be held to be actually ambiguous between the scalar quantifier in opposition with _all_ versus a weaker indefinite determiner (usually unstressed as in _I want some beer;_ see Milsark 1974; Gazdar 1980: 64; Horn 1997), but this does not inhibit its role in a Horn scale.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Another kind of reservation may be directed squarely at Reinhart's account. There are long-recognized difficulties with the c-command analysis, so that Reinhart's predictions about the general unacceptability of coreference when pronouns c-command lexical NPs are not correct in all cases (see Kuno 1987: 5355; Pollard and Sag 1994: 246ff), and nor it is the case that all Anaphors must be c-commanded (Zribi-Hertz 1989). These problems are exacerbated when one comes to look at nonconfigurational languages, or languages with flat sentence structures, where the c-command analysis will generally fail (see, e.g., Levinson 1987b). For these reasons, the pragmaticist would be well advised to search for explanations for universal patterns that may be linked to machinery that appears less language-specific, and I shall discuss in section\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

The point is that it is the kind of analysis many syntacticians think is reasonable. And if so, we can see that by adopting both a standard Binding Condition A plus an additional analysis of the pattern _NP c-commanding Pronoun_ as a bound-variable structure similar in interpretation to reflexives, we can obtain all the rest of the patterns by means of our pragmatic rules. The substantial change from our first approximation to English, sketched above, is that now configurational structures play a role not only in the interpretation of pronouns where reflexives could have occurred (by the first mirror-image rule) but also (by the second mirrorimage rule) in the interpretations of pronouns where reflexives could not have occurred (e.g., as subjects of subordinate clauses). Configurational patterns then play a role in the pragmatic interpretations, but they do so only by reflection (i.e., by an inference from a structure that might have been employed but wasn't). What is of interest to the pragmaticist is the general strategy pursued here: build in to the syntax just as much structure as you need, so that when it interacts with the independently motivated pragmatics the overall account has two desirable features: it is hugely economical, and it predicts defeasibility just where it is allowable. For the syntactician, it ought to be reassuring that the kind of pragmatic apparatus that would be needed to ground Reinhart's proposals is already independently motivated.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|4.3.2.3  <br>Could Condition C be Syntactic After All?\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The second approximation given above goes some way to dealing with two of the three problems we foresaw for the A-first account: Reinhart's account gets a crucial element of further configurational structure into the account of pronoun interpretation, thus accounting for some of the asymmetries of interpretation that cannot be explained by the sheer order of pronoun and antecedent. At the same time, it accounts for the robustness of the ban on coreference in _Pronoun c-commanding lexical-NP_ structures, now attributed to a Q-inference reinforced by an M-implicature. The third problem, the occasional overlap in distribution between Anaphors and pronouns, is still unaccounted for, but we will consider this shortly.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Despite the enormous volume of work that presupposes the three Chomskyan Binding Conditions, there has been very little attempt to\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Lasnik argues that Reinhart's pragmatic rule, which enjoins a speaker to use the most explicit means at his disposal, would predict that _*John__1 thinks that I admire John1_ should be preferred over _John__1 thinks that I admire him1._ And if one wishes to include extra information in an epithet, that too should license the full NP, as in _John__1 thinks that I admire the idiot1._ These complaints ought to evaporate given our more explicit pragmatic apparatus, where the inference to conjointness is based on the I-principle and disjointness inferences are produced by Q- and M-inferences. Even if the repetition of full NPs were more explicit in some sense than a resort to anaphora, the systematic semiotics of GCIs would give rise to marked interpretations, including disjoint reference. GCIs constitute a market economy of forms engendering default interpretations; one cannot freely innovate without semiotic consequences (see the conclusions to this chapter). Nor is there anything very vague about the notions employed: Q-inferences are based squarely on semantic informativeness (fnbsp; la Bar-Hillel and Carnap), whereas M-inferences based on markedness and prolixity give one the complement of I-inferences from corresponding unmarked forms.

Where a reflexive could have occurred (as in (38c)), that would have restricted the referential interpretations further and would, _ceteris paribus,_ have been more informative; its avoidance thus Q-implicates disjoint reference, reinforcing an M-implicature to the same effect. Note however that names rigidly refer and that descriptive phrases may also uniquely refer to the same individual; then naturally the referential semantics of _Scott admired the author of Waverly_ overrides any implicature to disjoint reference (and similarly in (38c). If Condition C of the Binding Theory was really a rule of grammar, then (38d) would be ungrammatical, as indeed would all identity statements. 32 However, because the Condition C effects are mere implicatures, they evaporate in the face of the conflicting semantics of asserted identity. Pronouns in English (unlike in some languages) do not permit determiners, relative clauses, modifiers, or complements, especially in the accusativeone cannot (alas) in modern English say things like _Him of the lion heart,_ so additional commentary will require a prolix head noun (as in (38e)). In example (38f), we have another identity statement, which can be read either referentially or attributively; but either way it is grammatically fine, so it is not possible to explain away these Condition C violations in terms of attributive _versus_ predicative uses.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Lasnik's second line of attack is that a pragmatic account should be universal, whereas a syntactic account can be parameterized. Given which, the facts of a language like Thai should be problematic to the pragmatic account, for in Thai one can say sentences that are glossed as 'John1 thinks that John1 is smart' or even 'John1 likes John1'. However, a pragmatic account depends on the total local economy of NP types, for full lexical nouns can only implicate, on our account, by opposition to zeros, pronouns, and reflexives, and such implicatures fall away in the\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Chinese is another language that freely permits full NP repetition, and we are fortunate to have a careful study of the whole system from a pragmatic point of view (Huang 1994). In Chinese, for example, one must repeat lexical NPs to express a boundvariable interpretation (as in 'Every mother-in-law has mother-in-law difficulties'), but where the choice is free, there are implicatures, but not necessarily ones of disjoint reference (Huang 1994: 199ff). But Lasnik's argument here is on soft ground anyway. English has registers that permit, nay require, lexical-NP repetition instead of pronouns, notoriously for example in legal documents: on Lasnik's line of argumentation we would need a different parameterization of the Binding Conditions not just for each language but for each discourse genre. Crosslinguistic and cross-genre variation is not the stuff of syntactic universals. A pragmatic theory of the kind developed here, on the other hand, uses general principles interacting with language-specific conventions to predict both unmarked crosslinguistic tendencies and language-specific effects, while allowing for marked types of genre without grammatical violations.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Lasnik claims that Condition C should be split into two subconditions: (a) R-expressions (full lexical NPs) may not be bound by R-expressions, this held to be parameterized crosslinguistically; and (b) R-expressions may not be bound by pronouns, this holding universally. Both are supposed to hold in English, but we have already glimpsed exceptions.

C-command is defined over phrase structure, and the Binding Theory relies on the hierarchical nature of phrase structure as a crosslinguistic universal. However, it is well known that this view is problematic with respect to languages that either have flat-sentence structure (i.e., with no VP constituent; see, e.g., Kiss 1991), or worse, have little overt constituent structure altogether, as in languages with not only free phrase order but free word order (see Hale 1983). Therefore it is worth looking for alternative accounts phrased in terms of other grammatical or semantic notions that may have greater crosslinguistic currency. In this section, let us first consider a nonconfigurational language and how it reinforces the need for a pragmatic account, and then turn to alternative concepts that might be employed to explain the patterns currently explained in terms of configurational notions.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|4.3.2.4.1  <br>Binding in a Nonconfigurational Language\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Guugu Yimithirr, a language spoken in northern Queensland (see Haviland 1979), may serve to remind us of the difficulty of extending the standard Binding Theory to nonconfigurational languages. Like many of the Australian languages, it does not exhibit the structural properties that are the basis for a Chomskyan account. For example, there seem to be only two rather weak arguments for any kind of constituency at all in Guugu Yimithirr (Levinson 1987b); this makes the application of notions like c-command and structural domain for binding impossible to define in a configurational manner. Many other notions central to such accounts either fail to apply or are counterexemplified (like the q-Criterion, which forbids two arguments to have the same semantic role).38 Even the contrast between\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

In all these properties it is by no means unique; Guugu Yimithirr may stand as one of a large class of languages where the application of such concepts is essentially problematical.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Guugu Yimithirr has no unequivocal reflexive construction; reflexivity is expressed by use of what is often called the antipassive in Australian languagesthat is, a verbal affix that converts a transitive verb (with an ergative subject) into an intransitive verb (with an absolutive subject). The interpretations of this construction are potentially very wide, ranging from indefinite or accidental agency to reciprocal or reflexive action of an agent upon itself:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(41) Bama gudhiira gunda-dhi.  <br>people-ABS two-ABS hit-ANTIPASSIVE  <br>'Someone hit the two people accidentally.'  <br>'The two people hit themselves.'  <br>'The two people hit one another.'\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Interestingly, the reflexive or reciprocal interpretations are much strengthened if the emphatic particle -:_gu_ is added to the subject (a point we will take up in connection with a B-first pragmatic account). This construction therefore offers a way of expressing reflexive action of a subject upon what would, without the antipassive affix, be expressed as a direct object:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(42) John-ngun nhangu gunday.  <br>John-ERG him+ACC hit+past  <br>'John hit him.'\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|No other kinds of arguments, such as adjuncts or oblique NPs, can thus be reflexivized, unlike in the English sentence _John gave Mary the book about herself._ The issue of having to find an antecedent within a specified domain (as with English Anaphors) is thus irrelevantthere is no Anaphor (only an indication that one argument is missing) and the "antecedent" must be the subject.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Thus not only is the coding of reflexivity not directly explicit (but rather semantically general over reflexivity and unknown agency, etc.), it is also restricted to the relationship between what in a transitive sentence would be core co-arguments, specifically subject and direct object.

This prediction seems to be generally correct; sentences glossing as 'John hit John', while having a preferentially disjoint intepretation, would seem more freely to allow coreferential interpretations than in English, and English _John gave Mary the book about herself_ would have to be translated as 'John gave Mary the book about Mary'. Further, in Guugu Yimithirr, just as in English, we express 'John1 asked his1 father' with a possessive pronoun, there being no way to reflexivize the possessive; but the possibilities of coreference here, which on the Binding Theory would follow under Condition B from the pronominal being free in the NP _his father,_ are clearly due to the absence of a pragmatic contrast (as, on our account, they are in English). Similarly, under Condition C we would expect sentences glossing 'His1 father told him1 that John1 should make it' to be out; but in fact they appear to be fine, which indicates that we have no strong inference here against coreferring lexical NPs with pronominal antecedents.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|What is striking therefore is the association of a preferred disjoint interpretation of pronouns and NPs just where the antipassive might have been used to code a missing argument (and thus, inter alia, coidentity of the arguments) but was not. This can be neatly accounted for by Q-inference. There is no evidence that the GB apparatus of binding domains and disjoint reference conditions are in any way involved. Referential dependence is indicated by a construction that signals a necessarily omitted argument (all arguments in Guugu Yimithirr in any position whatsoever can be optionally omitted).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|In fact Guugu Yimithirr offers much further evidence for the operation of principles of pragmatic cohesion and contrast. The general anaphora pattern is nicely exemplified in a system where zero-anaphora is general, and thus a three-way contrast in semantic generality is available (lexical NP, pronoun, NP-gap). NP-gaps induce coreferential interpretations where possible but indefinite reference where there is no available appropriate antecedent, whereas the use of a pronoun where a gap may have been expected is often sufficient to suggest (via M-implicature) locally disjoint reference. But the reader is referred to Levinson 1987a and 1987b for further discussion. The point here is that in languages of this sort, the _grammar_ of anaphora appears reduced to a minimum. Without a pragmatic account of the anaphora patterns, we have no account of the clear preferences in interpretation at all.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

One candidate often proposed is a hierarchy of thematic relations (Jackendoff 1972, Wilkins 1988, Reinhart and Reuland 1991, Kiss 1991). Suppose we have a thematic hierarchy Agent > Goal > Theme, and a constraint that the antecedent must outrank the Anaphor on this hierarchy; then we can understand the following sort of pattern:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(43) a.

Pollard and Sag (1992, 1994) therefore advance an account in a configuration-based theory of grammar, HPSG, in which nevertheless configurational constraints are (ironically enough) supplanted by a hierarchy of obliqueness across grammatical relations (see also Hellan 1991). Clearly, for this to work, genuine Anaphors have to be restricted to those whose antecedents are co-arguments, and thus antecedents that also bear a grammatical relation to the same predicate. Their theory simply requires that an Anaphor must be bound to an antecedent that is a _less oblique_ complement of the same head. Thus we obtain not only the standard examples as in (44a), but also where a verb subcategorizes for both a primary and more oblique object, the former may perform as antecedent for the latter.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(44) a.

Because these pseudo-Anaphors overlap in distribution with pronouns on a coreferential reading, Pollard and Sag (1994) can adopt a Binding Condition B that requires a nonreflexive pronominal to be free in just the domain where an Anaphor must be bound, thereby predicting a complementary distribution between true Anaphors and pronouns. 39 We could therefore without problems apply an A-first pragmatic account to this theory, and reduce their Condition B to implicature, along the lines sketched in our first approximation.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Such grammatical alternatives to configurational accounts are not the only possibilities. At the outset, it was shown how linear order seems to play a crucial role in cross-sentential anaphora, presuming some rule of the kind "first introduce your referents with full forms, thereafter use reduced forms." Intrasententially, however, this conflicts with many an example, as notedthere are exceptions in both marked phrase orders (_Near him, John saw a snake_) and in cases where the pronoun is embedded in the subject (_His children admire John_). In early transformational grammar, these observations gave rise to the "precede and command" analysis, which was observationally fairly good (see Kuno 1987: chap. 2 for review) and which preserved the ordering requirement, arguably an essentially pragmatic or discourse element, later lost in the c-command account, which makes the ordering facts epiphenomenal. It would seem worthwhile to explore the possibility of reversing the argument, thus making the configurational facts epiphenomenal from discourse principles. Something very near to the right principle is given by Bolinger (1979: 306), using the notions theme and rheme, and _reidentification_ (i.e., the use of a full form after a referent has already been introduced in the discourse): don't reintroduce the topic of the theme in the rheme (or "the topic may be reidentified easily in the theme, but in the rheme only if the theme lacks a normally topical form"). As Reinhart (1983: 97) notes, this gives a good account of many apparently configurational constraints, but she notes that it would need extending to handle cases where both antecedent and pronoun are in the rheme (e.g., _Rosa locked him in Ben's room_ where _him_ cannot be identified with _Ben_). My own suggestion (Levinson 1991: 114115) was that there is also a gradient within the rheme, where thematic role hierarchies would restrict coreferential possibilities (this ties into Jackendoff's (1972) observations). It is not at all clear that such an account could not be made to work, but we should concede that it needs further exploration (see also Van Valin 1990: 178183).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Thus in the first two sentences above, both an Anaphor and a pronoun can occur in the same slot bound to the same antecedent. This is because, on the 1986 account, _each other_ simply cannot be coindexed within the bracketed NP domain; therefore the actual domain is the matrix sentence. The pronoun however must be free in its domain; therefore the issue of an obligatory potential binder doesn't arise. The pronoun is thus free in the NP which is its domain, and can be coreferential with the subject of the matrix sentence just like the Anaphor. A similar analysis can then be given of (45c,d): in (45c) the compatibility requirement for a potential binder within the governing category (marked with square brackets) is not met, so the Anaphor may be bound by the matrix subject, but in (45d) the pronoun must still be free within the same domain.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|A pragmatic account is not the slightest embarrassed by the failure of a contrast between (45a) and (45b) in coreferentiality. This is because the reciprocal and the possessive pronoun do not mean the samethe pairing of books and readers in (45a) is unconstrained, but in (45b) each reader must read the books owned by the other. If one means the latter, one will have to say it. There may be as consequence a (Q-based) assumption that the plain possessive does not denote that particular reciprocal situation, but in both cases the anaphoric link-up is the same. The reasons then are entirely general: where two Q-contrasting expressions (or constructions)\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Many languages (e.g., Norwegian) have possessive reflexives that will contrast on just the one dimension with the reciprocal, and on the other dimension with the possessive (nonreflexive) pronoun, which will then tend to be read as disjoint (Hellan 1991).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|But the overlap in (45c,d) is more problematic for the simple A-first pragmatic account developed so far. In fact, however, the pragmatic explanation, which presumes some extension of the range at which reflexives can be bound, will turn out to be exactly the same in kind as that given for the reciprocal versus possessive pronoun: the reflexive here contrasts with the pronoun on two dimensions, necessary referential dependency and a subjective perspective called _logophoricity_ in the literature. The general nature of this second dimension of contrast becomes clearer when we look at other languages, which we shall shortly do. 40 Meanwhile, note that Chomsky's (1986) emendation of the Binding Conditions will not in fact achieve any generality of coverage. Reciprocals can occur deeply embedded from their antecedents (as in _They__1 feared that the prosecutor would reveal that Noriega had contributed to each other1's campaign funds;_ see Pollard and Sag 1994: 257), and even the nonreflexive pronoun in _They__1 put the books_ [_beside them__1/themselves1_] escapes the account, because it ought to be free throughout the sentence (the bracketed PP not constituting a binding domain on this theory; Harbert 1995: 192). Within the GB framework there have been many attempts to find different kinds of solutions to the empirical inadequacy of the classical Binding Theory (see Harbert 1995 for review). In fact, as we shall see, English reflexives are routinely long-distance bound, as are reflexives in many other languages. The patterns in these other languages, to which we now turn, also give us a better idea of how to develop a pragmatic account that can handle the kind of neutralization between disjoint/conjoint reference that we find in the above contexts in English.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|4.3.2.5.1  <br>Long-Distance Anaphora and Logophoricity\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|It has been clear almost from the outset that the Binding Theory runs into difficulties with so-called long-distance Anaphors in many languages (see, e.g., Maling 1984).

Pretheoretically we may coarsely distinguish between different kinds of referentially dependent Anaphors: those locally bound reflexives that require co-argument antecedents (like prototypical cases of English reflexives), those that require binding within the clause but can occur in adjuncts (like English reflexives embedded in PPs), and those (so-called non-clause-bound reflexives [NCBRs]) that may be bound outside the immediate containing clause altogether (like Icelandic _sig,_ Chinese _ziji_). The last are of course particularly challenging to the theory, and a great deal of work has gone into trying to understand the phenomena. The distribution of such long-distance Anaphors may include the following, as indicated by the English glosses with _self_ standing for the Anaphor (although the European languages tend to lack a nominative long-distance Anaphor as in (46b)).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(46) a.

Thus in the Germanic languages (Icelandic, Norwegian, Dutch, etc.) the long-distance Anaphors are simplex morphemes (like _sig, seg, zich_) which may occur clause-bound, and prefer subject antecedents; when bound outside the clause they are not necessarily in complementary distribution with pronouns (i.e., pronouns can be conjoint with the same antecedent). But despite the commonalities, even here the details vary in intricate ways, according to such factors as the finiteness or the subjunctive nature of higher clauses, and according to the availability of other (often compound) reflexives in clause-bound contexts. Thus although Icelandic, Danish, and Gothic allow structures in English gloss like (47a), Icelandic exceptionally allows binding across a tensed-clause boundary as in (47b) (Harbert 1995: 193194).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(47) a.

But it is the second and third facts that are crucial here: the complementary referential possibilities between pronoun and reflexive break down conclusively in these long-distance environments, permitting (in gloss) both 'John said self would come' and 'John said he would come' for the coreferential reading (or for languages without nominative Anaphors, 'John said Bill loves self' and 'John said Bill loves him'). This neutralization of the referential contrast between Anaphor and pronoun is of course problematic for the classical Binding Theory, and it has become the focus of intensive research and a substantial literature (see, e.g., Harbert 1995: 193ff; Huang 1994: chap. 4, in preparation; and Koster and Reuland 1991 for review and references).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|There are at least three major responses within the framework. First, one can reclassify LDAs as something other than the Anaphors of Binding Theory (Bouchard 1983). Or, one can assume that in underlying LF the Anaphor is actually locally bound just as presumed in the classical theory (and is thus raised at LF; Pica 1987). Finally, one can parameterize Anaphors, so that they have distinct binding domains in different languages, allowing that even different Anaphors within a language (e.g.,\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

The first option requires, for example, that one treats homophonous expressions as distinct lexical items (e.g., Anaphors when locally bound, referentially dependent pronominals elsewhere), and that one minimizes the difference between pronominals (with their exophoric and deictic potential) and LDAs (which have only referential dependence and distinct distribution). The second option, using a raising at LF analysis, has been applied ingeniously to some of the Germanic languages (see Harbert 1995: 203ff), but it runs into overwhelming problems with languages like Chinese (on which there has also been considerable work; see Huang 1994: chap. 4 for review). The last option gives the best hope of empirical coverage, but at the expense of an ad hoc variation of domains which lacks the system-wide implications that parameters are supposed to have in the Principles and Parameters framework. Some analysts are optimistic that we may need just three kinds of domains: one for clausebound reflexives (like the prototype English exemplars) as in classic Binding Condition A, one for LDAs consisting of the first finite clause to be stated as a variant Condition A, and one for homophonous pseudoreflexives that are subject to discourse conditions rather than the Binding Conditions (Reuland and Koster 1991). The admission that many LDA look-alikes escape the Binding Conditions is unavoidable because they often seem to be "bound" by non-c-commanding antecedents, sometimes outside the sentence altogether. But it is damaging because it makes the claim that the Binding Conditions have, say, just two alternate domains pretty unfalsifiable. Most commentators would concede that despite the energetic exploration of these three different ways in which the Binding Theory might be reconciled with the phenomena of long-distance anaphora, we have at present no convincing overall theory from a syntactic point of view.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Now a pragmatic account of the (A-first) kind developed here would at first sight appear to be in just as much trouble from the failure of the complementarity of LDAs and pronouns as the Binding Theory accounts. Clearly, this is the same kind of problem we found with the English reflexives, which turned out to overlap in distribution (on a coreferential reading) with pronouns in a few special contexts; but here in the case of LDAs the overlap is not marginal, but systematic, and for most of the\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

But the LDA facts very clearly signal the direction in which the pragmatic theory can be rescued: as mentioned, even where the Anaphor and the pronoun can have the same reference, they always contrast in meaning in some other dimension. And the way in which they contrast is similar to the contrast in reference: the Anaphor is necessarily referentially dependent, whereas the pronoun may or may not be; the Anaphor carries additional perspectival information, which the pronoun is unmarked for. In short, in both the referential and nonreferential contrasts, the Anaphor is informationally richer than the pronoun. This opens up the possibility that just as we have a Q-inference contrast from the use of the pronoun to the absence of conjoint reference that would have been signaled by an Anaphor in some loci, so we have a Q-inference in other loci from the use of the pronoun to the assumption that the perspective associated with the Anaphor is not intended. Let us examine the meaning difference in a little more detail.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The relevant meaning distinctions associated with LDAs were first noticed in connection with the logophoric pronouns and clitics of West African languages (Hagège 1974). Logophors are special expressions used in subordinate clauses to indicate coreferentiality with a matrix subject, but under specific conditions: usually the matrix verb must be a verb of saying or a verb of mental state, and thus the prototype context is of the sort 'John1 said that _logophor__1_ would come', where the logophor may in some cases actually have evolved from a first-person pronoun. Hagège noted that the logophor encodes the subjective perspective of the participant, and noted the parallel to long-distance anaphora in languages like Japanese. In fact, recent work has shown that the similarities are farreaching (Sells 1987; Stirling 1993: chap. 6), and we will return briefly to consider the distinctions between switch-reference systems, LDAs, and logophors. Logophors are licensed by specific semantic contextstypically a verb, or complementizer associated with a verb, of communication, epistemic or mental state, or perception and what is clearly signaled is the perspective and subjective state of the protagonist, the so-called logocentric NP or antecedent, not the current speaker. Sells (1987) analyzes these semantic contexts in terms of three features: whether or not there is an internal, reported speaker or _source_ of communication, whether or not there is an internal _self_ whose mental state is described, and whether or not there is an internal _pivot_ or relativized deictic center. The strongest logophoric contexts are those in which there is a textinternal source, self, and pivot, and the weakest are those in which there is\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

These contexts are forced by, respectively, verbs of communication, verbs of psychological attitude, and constructions (like verbs of perception) forcing the perspective of an internal protagonist. Logophoric languages appear to allow logophors progressively down this implicational scale (Stirling 1993: 259260).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Just as in LDA, logophors and pronouns are not necessarily in complementary distribution with regards to reference: whereas the logophor must be coreferential with its antecedent (the so-called logocentric NP) a plain pronoun may or may not be. As Stirling (1993: 266267) puts it:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|In all languages in which such a contrast is possible, it is associated with a meaning distinction of a remarkably consistent kind: if the ordinary pronoun is used, it indicates that the speaker has assimilated the proposition being reported into her own scheme of things, and accepts its truth and/or approves of its content. If the logophoric pronoun is chosen, it indicates that the speaker has not assimilated the proposition into her knowledge base, and does not necessarily accept its truth or approve of its content: in some sense, responsibility for its truth, content or linguistic characterization is distanced, and left to the referent of the logophoric pronoun.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Not surprisingly, then, there are collocational constraints with evidentials (O'Connor 1993: 225f) and with mood (Stirling 1993). The subjective point of view associated with the logophor can be thought of as a complex feature [+logophoric] which is imposed by, or in concord with, such a feature associated with logophoric verbs, the feature being in turn characterized in terms of the atomic features source, self, and pivot mentioned above (Sells 1987; for a simpler alternative, see Stirling 1993: 282ff).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Long-distance Anaphors and logophors have a great deal in common, as was already noticed by Hagège (1974). First, the semantic constraints on LDAs and logophors appear to be very closely similar. For example, in Icelandic, the LDA _sig_ occurs especially in subjunctive clauses, where the mood signals that the point of view is not the speaker's but that of the subject of the relevant verb, as evidenced by the deniability of the truth of the proposition (Stirling 1993: 268). Second, the perspectival distinctions associated with logophors versus pronouns also correctly predict many aspects of the distribution of LDAs versus pronominals (see, e.g., Kuno 1987, Sells 1987, Hellan 1991, and references therein for studies of Japanese, Korean, and Germanic long-distance anaphora). For example, the\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Indeed, so close is the parallel that one may ask whether they are not in fact the same basic phenomenon, the main differences apparently being that whereas LDAs may usually be locally bound, logophors are usually in complementary distribution with locally bound reflexives (Stirling 1993: 259). Scholars in the Binding Theory tradition have also noted the parallels, but their reaction has been, for example, to distinguish between different uses of LDAs: (i) those uses of LDAs, subject to the Binding Theory, that have antecedents within the first finite clause, and (ii) those so-called logophoric uses that occur beyond this maximal extent of syntactic binding and are controlled by discourse factors (Reuland and Koster 1991: 2224). 45 This retreat from a global structural theory is motivated by the fact that both LDAs and logophors can have their antecedents outside c-commanding positions, even outside the sentence altogether, and thus elsewhere in the discourse (see examples in Stirling 1993: 262263; Huang 1994: 195; Mazuka and Lust 1994).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Let us return then to the pragmatic account. The proposal (which originates with O'Connor [1987]1993) should now be clear. Long-distance Anaphors have two essential semantic properties: first, they are always referentially dependent; second, they are logophoric. That these are conjunctive conditions is clear, from Kuno's (1987: 141) analysis of Icelandic LDAs, for example:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|A reflexive pronoun can be used in a complement clause in Icelandic if it is coreferential with a [+logo 1] NP of the main clause _and_ if the complement clause is an expression of the logophoric NP's point of view rather than the speaker's rendition of it\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(where Kuno's [+logo 1] feature marks the source or self in Sells's terms).

It may also hold for switch-reference markers, which are again closely related to both logophors and LDAs. 46 Switch-reference systems are systems of (normally) verbal suffixing that indicate whether a (usually subordinate) clause has the same or different subject as the main clause; they are found in areal clusters in North America, Africa, New Guinea, Australia, and a few other locations (see Haiman and Munro 1983 for a collection of case studies, and Stirling 1993 for analysis and survey). In fact, a Gricean account of disjoint reference in switch-reference systems was independently proposed by O'Connor (1993) for Northern Pomo, which also has long-range reflexives.

Quite typically, the SS marker is associated with a sequence of actions performed by the same actor in proximate locations, so that it can be seen as one complex action (as in the gloss 'He went to the store and he bought-SS some whiskey'), following a pattern we have already associated with the I-principlecoreference is associated with cohesive interpretations. In line with this expectation, SS markers tend to be the relatively unmarked morphological option (sometimes zero) associated with sequentiality, whereas the more marked (morphologically complex) DS markers are associated with simultaneous actions by different actors (see Stirling 1993: 3032). So far we have the familiar I- versus M-inference pattern, discussed at length in chapter 2, but apparently here fully grammaticalized. But there is also evidence in some switch-reference systems with overt SS marking for a privative opposition, with the DS marker actually unspecified for disjointness, but picking up that presumption by Q-inference. So we would have an opposition of the following kind (where the "single complex action" feature may be variously interpreted in different languages to involve same degree of agency, or close spatio-temporal cohesion):\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|<br>\\|<br>\\|\\\|   \\\|   \\\|<br>\\\|---\\\|---\\\|<br>\\\|\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|(50) SS marker\\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|DS marker\\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\|\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|<br>\\\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|[+referential dependence]\\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|[± referential dependence]\\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\|\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|<br>\\\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|[+single complex action]\\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|[ ± single complex action]\\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br><br>  <br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|If this is correct, we would expect the disjointness of the DS marker to be defeasible, and in many languages this seems to be the case. Further, we would expect that there would be two main reasons to avoid the SS marker: either the two subjects are disjoint in reference, or the two actions do not form a single complex action, one action being less intentional or separated in space or time from the other. DS markers then implicate a disjunction, either disjoint reference or two distinct actions. Again, such cases of DS markers unexpectedly allowing coreference coupled with a contrast in action-coherence seem to be well attested, although the details are complex, and depend of course on the exact specification of the features built into the SS marker in particular languages (see Stirling 1993: 3334, 50, 98114, 150153).

This reopens the fundamental question, raised by Dowty (1980) and Reinhart (1983), but at first sight closed by the very existence of switch-reference systems, concerning whether we can state an important linguistic universal that holds that disjoint reference systems are never fully grammatically specified whereas coreference systems may be so. It seems in fact unlikely that this is an interesting property of Universal Grammar, unpredictable on other grounds. Rather, it is probably a tendency that follows on Zipfian grounds of functional economy: given a grammatical specification of the informationally richer pole, namely coreference, disjoint reference can be signaled by avoiding that grammatical construction. 47 Just as the fact that _some,_ by Q-contrast to _all,_ default implicates 'not all' and thus effectively blocks by redundancy the lexicalization of a new form _*nall,_ so the grammaticalization of Anaphors, logophors, and SS-markers may tend to make redundant the grammaticalization of systematic, specialized disjoint-reference mechanismsexisting terms in the privative opposition (between conjoint-reference marker and unspecified default) will do the job.48 This is the logic of the A-first pragmatic account. On the other hand, given that these disjoint inferences from the weaker term of a privative opposition are generalized, this existing expression may well come to have its GCIs conventionalized over time, as arguably in switch-reference systems or indeed even in the Condition B behavior of English pronouns.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|4.3.2.5.2  <br>The Long-Distance Uses of English Reflexives\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Let us now return to the puzzles of English reflexives. Can we find meaning differences, similar to those associated with LDAs and logophors, between reflexives and pronouns when they can both occur in the same locus with a coreferential meaning (as in _John hid the book behind him/himself_)? Kuno (1987), marshalling a large number of earlier observations by Ross (1970), Cantrall (1974), and others, has argued vigorously that we can. For example, we noted above three classes of much examined cases where reflexives and pronouns have overlapping distribution (leaving aside the\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

For example, in those locative PPs that allow this alternation, the reflexives set up a protagonist's perspective on events, which is intuitively clear enough in (51a) but even makes a difference to truth conditions in (51b) (after Cantrall 1974, cited in Zribi-Hertz 1989: 704; see also Kuno 1987: 153).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(51) a. i.

Zribi-Hertz seems to presume that these semantic conditions exhaust the constraints on the long-distance uses. She also points out that there is an intrinsic connection between the endophoricity, or obligatory referential dependency, of reflexives and logophoricity (1989: 724): "reflexive pronouns serve the _internal_ narrative point of view and they are bound _within_ some structural domain" in which this point of view is systematically maintained. 51\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|If we then assimilate the English cases of overlapping distribution of pronoun and reflexive to the same kind of phenomenon exhibited in LDA generally, we have most of the basic ingredients of an implicatural account of the patterns.52 The A-first account gives us the complementary distribution of pronouns and reflexives by Q-implicature where it occurs, essentially where antecedent and reflexive are co-arguments, or at least clausemates. To account for the long-range uses of English reflexives, Condition A of the Binding Theory would need to be extended; Kuno (1987) offers many rather specific structural conditions that could be added to Condition A with a wider domain, whereas Zribi-Hertz, as just mentioned, offers rather simple semantic constraints on logophoricity which can be set up to override the restrictions of Condition A. Either way, a syntactico-semantic set of constraints could predict the long-range occurrences of the reflexive.53 Once again, then, wherever we can have a reflexive in these long-distance environments, the use of a pronoun will contrast; but because the reflexive is marked for both referential dependency and logophoricity (or internal perspective), the contrast need not be in terms of reference. And in the long-distance uses, the contrast is now between a subjective versus objective point of view, or schematically:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(58) _Q-contrast in coreference, rather than logophoricity_\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|a.

It is to explain why, given that the reflexive encodes both coreference and logophoricity, the contrast in reference is dominant where the pronoun could have a clausemate antecedent, and the contrast in logophoricity is dominant elsewhere. 54 If reflexives with LDA uses are in general marked [+logophoric, +referential dependence], then avoidance of the reflexive with a pronoun should be interpreted as either a contrast in reference, or logophoricity, or both. Yet in the clause-bound cases, the contrast always seems to be one of reference _simpliciter,_ and with long-distance antecedents, the contrast generally seems to be one of logophoricity (although it may be one of reference, too).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|There seem to be essentially two lines of possible explanation here. On the one hand, one may claim, in a line following Bouchard (1983) through to Pollard and Sag (1994), that true reflexives are restricted to those with clausemate antecedents, whereas all long-distance bound reflexives are essentially pronouns of a special contrastive sort that happen to be homophonous with real Anaphors; we turn to this view in section 4.3.2.5.3. On the other hand, one may attempt to find an additional pragmatic factor that would explain the overriding concern with reference within the clause. In the second half of this chapter, I will show that such an additional factor (to be labeled the DRP) is independently motivated by the existence of languages without conventionalized Anaphors at all: such languages exhibit a preference for the reading of clausemate (coargument) NPs as disjoint. But because such languages have no grammatical Anaphors, this can only be a default presumption, and thus a pragmatic principle and not a reflex of a universal Condition B. It turns out that these languages are also relevant to understanding languages like English that conform to the A-first patternEnglish indeed is diachronically derived from such a language. This additional pragmatic principle, of presumed disjointness of arguments, ultimately involves superseding the A-first approach with a more complex, diachronically laminated account of the pragmatics of anaphora. Meanwhile, one can see that the\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

True Anaphors, on this line, are co-arguments with their antecedents, and all other uses of reflexives are homophonous pseudo-Anaphors ("exempt anaphors" in Pollard and Sag's terminology).

A second factor governing the occurrence of pseudo-Anaphors is the logophoricity requirement already reviewed in detail. An increasing number of scholars seem prepared to consider LDAs to be in general pseudo-Anaphors, subject to pragmatic constraints rather than the Binding Conditions (see, e.g., Koster 1994, Mazuka and Lust 1994)but they do not develop the pragmatic analysis that would then be required.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|If this line is correct, we have a natural explanation of the way that the Q-inferences from pronouns divide into disjointness-inferences for coarguments and a wider disjunctive inference, to either disjointness or antilogophoricity, in long-range uses of reflexives. The clausebound, coargument (nonreflexive) pronouns are in Q-contrast with true Anaphors, which must be bound by a coargument; pronouns elsewhere may be in Q-contrast with quite different lexical items, namely pseudo-Anaphors, with referential dependence and logophoric implications. Such a line would also have some support (unnoted by Pollard and Sag) from languages where reflexivity is indicated by a marked verbal form that indicates that two of its arguments are coreferential (see Faltz 1985)here reflexivity must be about co-arguments. The whole Pollard and Sag (1992, 1994) approach, which is based on a nonconfigurational version of the Binding Conditions within a different grammatical framework (HPSG), can be made to dovetail with the pragmatic account just as well as those more directly in the Chomskyan tradition.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|However, there are some good reasons to resist this approach to English. The first is methodological: as Zribi-Hertz (1989: 721) puts it, considering the same option, "First-year students in linguistics already know, however, that the homonymy solution should be regarded as a last resorta bad solution per se, a 'desperate' strategy." Why should there be two sets of reflexives, with exactly the same members, the same obligatory referential dependency, but different binding constraints? The second reason for skepticism is that long-distance-bound reflexives occur also in core argument positions, not just adjuncts, so that the distinction between real and pseudo-Anaphors becomes more definitional than observational. Indeed, Pollard and Sag (1992: 278279) are forced to suggest that many well-attested uses of such reflexives are just ungrammatical, but acceptable in prose. 55 Clearly, if this line is to be pursued, we need independent evidence for the distinction between real and\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Nearly all systematic disjointness conditions, specifically the sort of constraint specified in Binding Conditions B and C, would follow by pragmatic "mirror image" from the kind of binding principle exemplified in the various versions of Condition A. This would follow by principles of economy: unmarked pronouns pick up the disjoint meaning by Q-contrast to reflexives wherever they might have been employed. Meanwhile, pronouns and full lexical NPs tend to contrast in reference because of the I-inference to coreference from minimal expressions associated with pronouns, and the M-contrast to disjointness that then arises where a pronoun might have been used but a full referring expression was used instead. Hence the general contrastive behavior of reflexives, pronouns, and lexical NPs with respect to anaphoric linkage.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Such an approach has none of the inexactness of most functional explanations: whatever syntactic and semantic conditioning there is on the occurrence of Anaphors will get reflected into the pragmatic account of the behavior of pronouns. If the distribution of Anaphors was accounted for solely in terms of their lexical properties (and their necessary referential dependence in particular), there would be little motivation for maintaining an A-first account (for some languages, this may be the case; see Huang 1994 on Chinese). But insofar as there are three terms involvedantecedent, Anaphor, and binding domain defined in syntactic or semantic termsan A-first account is well motivated (see Hellan 1991 for an interesting typology of different kinds of domain constraints). On the other hand, while making precise predictions, the pragmatic account does allow for principled defeasibility, which a syntactic account of the Binding Conditions variety will never be able to explain.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The A-first style of account is not restricted to any specific kind of grammatical framework.

Pronominalization and anaphora were among the earliest subjects to be explored in generative grammar, and after 40 years of intensive research there is still no adequate explanation of all the phenomena nor any consensus about where it may yet be found. I believe that the failure to take into account the systematic contribution of a theory of generalized pragmatic inference is a substantial reason why further progress has not been made. A theory of GCIs can interdigitate with any of these frameworks, reapportioning some predictions from the syntax to the pragmatics and offering some handle on the unexplained residue of defeasible patterns. In each case, however, the corresponding pragmatic predictions will be different and worth investigating as indirect evidence for or against the different syntactic approaches. The overall power of the resulting theory, with the syntax and the pragmatics working in tandem, is certain to be considerably better than any of the purely syntactic accounts taken on their own. I have sketched in passing how for each of the discussed frameworks the pragmatics might be put to work.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The major challenge to an A-first account is undoubtedly the failure of complementarity of pronouns and reflexives (i.e., their overlap in certain loci as potentially linked to the same antecedent). We have gone to some effort to establish that the pragmatic account does not necessarily break down on account of this. Pragmatic contrasts can be on various dimensions, and where an Anaphor encodes perspectival information as well as referential dependency, the contrast with a pronoun can as well be in terms of the logophoric dimension. However, unless we buy the distinction between Anaphors and pseudo-Anaphors, we clearly do need an explanation of why the contrast is nearly always in terms of reference just in the clausebound cases, whereas in the long-range binding cases the contrast is either in terms of logophoricity or reference or both.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|4.3.3  <br>The B-First Account, with a Pragmatic Reduction of Binding Conditions A and C 56\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Let us now explore a radical alternative to the preceding account which has taken Condition A of the Binding Theory as a basic rule of grammar,\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

In this alternative, we shift the center of the account and make the Condition B pattern basic and derive Conditions A and C as pragmatic derivatives. Such an alternative account seems better suited to certain languages, and because the account uses the same pragmatic apparatus, there is no theoretical inconsistency between our _A-first_ and what we may call a _B-first_ account. In either case, any one language (now being thought of as a sociolinguistic entity) should be treated as having stabilized a particular pattern of anaphoric interpretation as basic, as the conceptual anchorage for the rest of the system. This stabilized core (whether Condition A-like or Condition B-like) is then subject to our familiar Q-, I-, and M-inferences, yielding "for free" the rest of the system. What determines this kind of pragmatic parametrization is historical process, and in the end I shall argue that A-first languages tend to exhibit residues of a B-first stage, thus showing that there is no radical discontinuity between these types.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Here is how a B-first account might be developed. The starting point is a stabilized pattern of interpretation where clausemate NPs are preferentially interpreted as distinct in reference. This could be thought of as a matter of grammatical stipulationCondition B or C as part of Universal Grammar surfacing as an inferential presumption. Against that, whereas Condition A is often thought to display parametric variation in the size of the binding domain, there is little evidence that Condition B behaves in the same way (specifically, the exclusion domain tends to remain strictly local; see Harbert 1995: 194195). Second, as we have seen, the B-pattern is defeasible. Thus the core B-like pattern could itself be pragmatically motivated. Farmer and Harnish (1987), for example, advance a pragmatic presumption as the basic datum for pronominal anaphora; they propose a pragmatic Disjoint Reference Presumption (DRP), which holds that "the arguments of a predicate are intended to be disjoint, unless marked otherwise" (1987: 557). The origin of such a pragmatic presumption is left unclear on their account, but we may perhaps be able to relate it to the GCI framework. Under a classification of actions of central human interest, agents normally act upon entities other than themselves; the prototypical actionwhat is described by the prototypical transitive clauseis one agent acting upon some entity distinct from itself. If that is how the world stereotypically is, then an interpretation of an arbitrary transitive sentence as having referentially distinct arguments is given to us by the I-principle, which encourages and\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Note that this is not some kind of behaviorist presumption that the statistical preponderance of nonreflexive states of affairs, or even linguistic statements, is inductively learned and then reflected unwittingly in pragmatic presumption. The I-principle is a principle of default interpretation, which capitalizes on the underspecification of linguistic meaning together with mutual beliefs about regularities in the world to yield rich interpretations as hypotheses about utterance-meaning. It thrives on mutual assumptions of mutual orientation to stereotypes (i.e., on complex mental constructs), not behaviorist response.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|In language typology, crosslinguistic tendencies are used to suggest, for example, a universal markedness hierarchy, so that Agents are prototypically animate and Patients inanimatethe _Ur_-act, as it were, is somebody doing an action to somethingwith deviations from these expectations progressively marked (Comrie 1981: 120ff). The same reasoning applied to reflexivity would set up a universal prototype or tendency where Agents doing things to disjoint referents is the unmarked expectation, any deviations being marked either by formal or pragmatic means (cf. a similar presumption in Reinhart and Reuland 1993). Because this tendency is not reflected in all languages by special morphology or syntax, but in some languages may be merely reflected in patterns of use, it is plausible that it is due to extralinguistic principles rather than innate ideas or Universal Grammar.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|There will be those who are skeptical. As Zribi-Hertz (1995) puts it, criticizing the use of the DRP by Huang (1994), "What criteria do we have to decide what is 'more 'natural' than what? If we don't have any independent test for 'naturalness,' the DRP is nothing but a clone of Principle B." But there are signs of naturalnessnamely, the fact that it is reflexive statements, not the nonreflexive ones, that are the linguistically marked alternative in all languages that mark reflexivity at all. Second, the DRP is only a defeasible tendency, so it is distinct in kind from a grammatical stipulation like Condition B. Still, the critic may point to the fact that some actions are stereotypically reflexive, like brushing one's teeth, bathing, and so on. But here, interestingly, languages often do recognize the special character of such stereotypically reflexive actions. In Frisian, for example, it is just these predicates that allow the use of the normal pronoun for self-reference rather than the reflexive or emphatic form (thus one says _Willem__1 wasket him1_ not _*Willem__1 wasket himsels1_ for 'William washes himself', Reuland 1994: 239; the same was true in\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

In this case the unmarked pronoun indicates the stereotypical situation, irrespective of whether one or two agents are involved. However, because the DRP is the normal presumption, languages more often indicate stereotypical reflexive (or so-called introverted) predicates in a way that signals both their departure from the DRP and their stereotypical status: as a strong crosslinguistic tendency, introverted predicates occur with a null or reduced reflexive marking (Haiman 1985a: 168174), as in English "He put a coat on _" (or as in the "weak" reflexives of the Germanic languages, discussed below). Here the reduced form picks up the stereotype in line with the I-principle, and the special marking indicates deviation from the DRP. This special treatment of such exceptional predicates as shaving, bathing, dressing, adorning, and so onin accord with their stereotypical expectations of reflexive action but in contrast to the DRPis interesting indirect evidence in favor of the pragmatic nature of the DRP, as based on stereotypical expectations for disjoint arguments with regard to the majority of transitive predicates.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Still, the critic may point out that reflexivity in many languages is not confined to core arguments of transitives, as in so-called raising contexts like _John revealed himself to be a Mason._ The response here is that the DRP is only a small part of an explanatory apparatus, which cannot predict all the loci that a specific language will treat as requiring reflexivization. In English, the DRP plays only a small part in explaining the patterns (namely, it predicts where pronoun and reflexive firmly contrast in reference), which at least as far as Anaphors are concerned are firmly grammaticalized.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Huang (1991, 1994: 130) notes that there are potential problems for the neo-Gricean theory if the DRP is taken to be given to us by the I-principle. Although there are good reasons, already reviewed in chapter 2, for taking the priority of Q > M > I inferences to regulate implicature projection, there are no worked out principles regulating, say, the relative priority of subtypes of I-inference. But if the DRP follows from the I-principle, and the preference for local coreference of reduced forms also follows from the I-principle, the two will often be in conflict, unless we recognize that the preference for coreference operates only beyond the clause. Huang therefore entertains the conjecture that the DRP should be thought of as part of our background presumptions about the world, which would then, as always, override default implicatures. That, however, has problems of its own: as we shall see, the origin of many reflex-\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

In that case, the DRP itself must be cancelable by a higher-ranking inference type, and all this fits with the assumption that the DRP is I-implicated, with M-implicatures taking priority over I-implicatures in the usual way. 57\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|But whatever the exact source of the DRP, once we presume it, we can then derive the Condition A pattern this way. First note that reflexives are marked forms; if they are pronoun-like in grammatical category, they tend to be longer, more morphologically complex than ordinary pronouns (cf. _himself_ with _him_); if reflexivity is encoded on the verb, then the verbal morphology is marked (Faltz 1985). Thus, what the marked, prolix forms indicate is that the normal, stereotypical scenario associated with a transitive clause does not in fact obtainnotice is served by M-implicature that the I-inference to the stereotype is not intended. If the stereotype is disjoint reference for arguments, then the M-implicature is (by Horn's 1984 division of pragmatic labor) to the complement of that interpretation, namely to coreference. Hence (given that, by our projection rules for implicatures, M-implicatures cancel any rival I-implicatures) we derive the Condition A-like pattern for marked pronouns, so-called Anaphors.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|It remains to account for the Condition C-like pattern. Here the account is familiar. Where a pronoun is in a lower clause and thus not a clausemate with another NP (thus the pragmatic Condition B-like DRP is not in play), as in _He thinks that he should come,_ there will be nothing to prevent the I-implicated tendency to coreference (assuming matched agreement features, etc.). But if, just where such a pronoun would so implicate coreference, a marked form (in this case a lexical referring expression) is employed instead, as in _He thinks that John should come,_ then again we get the complementary M-interpretation, this time to disjoint reference.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Thus, to recapitulate: the sentence in (62a) below is interpreted with disjoint arguments in line with the (I-induced) stereotype "clausemate arguments are distinct"; the marked form of the pronoun in (62b) warns (M-implicates) "contrary to stereotype," and because M-implicatures override I-implicatures, we obtain a conjoint interpretation. The pronoun in (62c), on the other hand, does not fall under the presumption of clausemate disjointness because the only potential antecedent is in another clause; the pronoun is unmarked, so there is nothing to stop the I-preference for coreferentiality of reduced forms going through. In (62d), by contrast, the use of a full lexical NP suggests (M-implicates) that whatever might\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

One kind of support comes from typological evidence for a widespread association of reflexives and emphaticsin language after language, the reflexive seems to be homophonous with an emphatic particle or affix (Moravcsik 1972, Langacker and Munro 1975). 58 For example, just as in English we have the emphatic use of the reflexive pronoun in (63a), compared to the reflexive use as in (63b), so in, for example, Tamil we have the emphatic particle in (63c) homophonous with the root of the reflexive pronoun in (63d).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(63) a.

The contrastive, emphatic particle or affix does the job nicely. Note that many languages have two or more reflexive Anaphorsfor example, the Germanic languages typically have two reflexive forms, cognate with German weak reflexive _sich_ and strong reflexive _sich selbst_ (see Reuland and Koster 1991). It is the strong reflexives that tend to occur with clausemate antecedents, and the weak ones with long-distance antecedents, except that they also occur locally bound with inherently reflexive (introverted) verbs.

That overlap is sufficiently salient that there have been a number of attempts to try and explain it. In the heyday of Generative Semantics there were attempts for example to derive _John himself came_ from _John, he came_ (Moyne 1971) or _JohnJohn's own selfcame_ (Cantrall 1973; see Jayaseelan 1988 for a revival). There have also been careful and interesting attempts to characterize the exact semantic/pragmatic import of the intensifier use of reflexive forms; thus Moravcsik (1972) distinguishes a head-bound use (as in _John himself came_) from an adverbial use (_John came himself_), and Edmondson and Plank (1978) suggest the first has to do with a pragmatic scale (in the sense of Fauconnier 1975) of unexpectedness, the second with a scale of direct agency or experience.60 Philosophers, too, have speculated on the meaning of phrases like _He himself,_ Hintikka (1970) for example claiming that the intensifier rules out an intensional (or attributive) interpretation, Geach (1972) that it translates a first-person pronoun into a form appropriate for indirect speech (cf. the discussion of logophoricity above). All of this is usefully reviewed by Edmondson and Plank (1978) and König (1991), but summarizing the semantico-pragmatic effects of the intensifier uses of reflexive forms, we may note that (a) there is a contrastive, contrary-to-expectation element; (b) there is a natural negative gloss, of the sort 'and not anyone else', 'and not the more expectable persons', and so on; (c) the intensifier often plays a role in reference, by forcing a particular coreferential interpretation of a pronoun;61 (d) the intensifier could often be replaced with like effect by stress; and (e) issues of scope arise according to placement. All of these features are compatible with, indeed explained by, an account in terms of M-implicature and Horn's (1984) division of pragmatic labor (i.e., in my terms, the complementarity of I-implicatures and M-implicatures). M-implicatures, by picking out the complementary interpretation to the stereotypical I-based interpretation that would have been generated by the use of simple unmarked form, naturally give rise to contrary-to-stereotype, negative interpretations. It is left open on this account that the contrast intended may be either one of unexpectedness or point of view, on the one hand, or\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

That contrastive stress might do exactly the same job is likewise explainedfor all the intensification of the NP is doing is warning of a marked interpretation.

In those languages, like many Australian ones, where the reflexive is signaled by a special verb form, that verb form is a marked form. In languages like Guugu Yimithirr (Haviland 1979, Levinson 1987a,b) this special verb form does not directly encode reflexivity but only indicates directly that one argument is missing. There is a pragmatic inference in many cases to the reflexive. But this can be further reinforced by the use of an emphatic affix which then makes the reflexive or reciprocal reading central:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(64) Bama-gu gunda-dhi.  <br>the people(ABS)-EMPH hit-ANTIPASSIVE  <br>'The people hit each other.'  <br>'The people hit themselves.'  <br>'Someone hit the people.'\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Thus in languages which currently lack, but which seem to be in the process of acquiring, fully grammaticalized, unequivocal Anaphors, we can find the same association between markedness and reflexive readings.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|A third closely related kind of evidence for the B-first account is the diachronic fact that reflexives seem in many cases to have derived from emphatic or contrastive forms, even if there is no longer a homophonous corresponding emphatic particle or affix. This seems to be the case with Tamil _taan_ or Chinese _ziji,_ for example, and I discuss the history of English reflexives in detail. But the most persuasive kind of evidence for the B-first analysis comes from consideration of languages that lack Anaphors altogether. As noted, such languages obviously cannot support an A-first analysis. It is therefore crucial to see what patterns of anaphora they exhibit.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|4.3.3.1  <br>Languages without Reflexives\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|There are scattered reports from around the world of languages that do not directly code reflexivity.

Faltz (1977: 210f) cites the Low West Germanic subgroup of languages (including Old English) and Biblical Hebrew; Carden and Stewart (1986: 51) cite Fijian and other Austronesian languages, a Papuan language Harway (data from Comrie), and perhaps up to half the pidgins and creoles (in many cases by independent innovation). We can add a number of Australian languages, and there are no doubt other groups of languages yet to be reported (e.g., Carden 1989: 3 notes the same pattern in Isthmus Zapotec). In this section I provide a sketch of the facts for some of these cases to aid and abet the rehabilitation of these linguistic orphans.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|4.3.3.1.1  <br>Australian Languages\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|We have already seen that there are languages, like Guugu Yimithirr, that lack true reflexives. In fact, the majority of Australian languages would seem to lack Anaphors. Instead, in many of these languages the reflexive meaning is indicated by a semantically general antipassive or detransitivized clause (Dixon 1980: 434, 448; see also Austin 1981: 151155; Evans 1995: 278279, 348354). The antipassive construction can be thought of as transforming a transitive clause into an intransitive one with a single absolutive argument; it thus simply indicates that, for one reason or another, one of the arguments of the verb is missing, unknown, or irrelevant. Thus the reflexive meaning is just one natural interpretation of the antipassive.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|For example, recollect the Guugu Yimithirr facts discussed previously: There is no unequivocal reflexive or reciprocal construction. To indicate reflexivity one uses a detransitivizing verbal affix, which suggests the irrelevance of the missing argument. That irrelevance may stem from the speaker's not knowing (or not caring) who or what the agent was, or from the accidental nature of the agency, or from the fact that the missing argument is identical to the surviving one. However, the reflexive reading can be made prominent by marking the surviving NP with the emphatic particle -: _gu_ (as expected on the B-first account, which derives reflexives from marked pronouns, or more generally, marked reflexive clauses from unmarked nonreflexive ones). The same use of the emphatic attached to a pronoun can suggest coreferentiality where the antipassive construction cannot be used, for example, in a sentence glossing 'John1 helped his1-emphatic father'. Here we see an emphatic reflexive in the very making.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|In some languages though, the use of such an intransitive form to express reflexive meaning is optionalfor example, Dixon (1983: 497) discusses Nyawaygi, where the reflexive can be expressed by an antipassive,\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

In other languages one simply has two NPs in the absolutive with a normal transitive verb, as if they were both the subjects (one the head, the other a modifying adjunct) of an intransitive verb (Dixon 1981: 6465). However, some of these languages do not employ any such device at all. For example, in Gumbaynggir (New South Wales), the reflexive is expressed by a normal transitive sentence (Eades 1979: 312):\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(65) Gua:du bu:rwang gula:na magayu.  <br>3sg-ERG paint-PAST 3sg-ABS red paint-INSTR  <br>'He painted himself/him with red paint.'\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|There would appear to be a suffix -_w_ (_gula:naw_ instead of _gula:na_ in (65) above) that forces a reflexive reading, but this is definitely optional (p. 313). 63 Similarly, Austin (1987) reports that Jiwarli does not formally express any distinction between an ordinary transitive sentence and a reflexive meaning: "Jiwarli reflexives are indistinguishable from simple transitive clauses except that the subject and object nominals are coreferential." Thus, in addition to the widespread antipassive or middle marking of reflexives on the continent of Australia, there are clearly languages where reflexivity is not marked at all.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|4.3.3.1.2  <br>Austronesian\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|A number of Austronesian languages are reported to lack reflexives and reciprocals, but Fijian is perhaps the best documented. Thus in Dixon's (1988: 255256) grammar we find that "For first and second persons the reflexive is simply shown by using the appropriate pronoun in both subject and object slots," or if it is an indirect object that is involved, the ordinary pronoun in the relevant case is used. In the third person, a verb with the transitive marker -_a_ and without an explicit object is interpreted as having unmarked reference to a third-singular object which is noncoreferential with the subject. If coreference or reflexivity is intended, a full object pronoun (e.g., _'ea,_ third-singular object) is required, and although this might be interpreted disjointedly, it encourages a coreferential reading:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(66) sa va'a-.dodonu-.ta'ini 'ea o Mika.  <br>ASP correct 3sg+Obj Art Mike  <br>'Mike corrected himself' or 'Mike corrected him.'\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The pattern looks like our hypothesized B-first type: the least marked form of a transitive clause encourages the supposition that the arguments\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

There is no formal means to distinguish the readings. Yet another, distantly related, Austronesian language, Tahitian, apparently follows the same sort of pattern (Tryon 1970: 97). To express the reflexive, one can only use the pronoun:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(68) 'ua ha'opohe 'oia 'iana.  <br>was kill he him  <br>'He killed himself' or 'He killed him.'\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|But there is an emphatic affix _iho,_ which when added to the pronoun seems to be the standard way to express the reciprocal meaning.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|An Austronesian language that has been the subject of some detailed GB work is Chamorro (Chung 1989). Chung notes (1989: 148ff) that Anaphors and pronominals are morphologically identical just as in Fijian, although the reflexive interpretation can be forced by an optional adverb _maisa_ (glossed as 'by oneself'). However, she goes on to argue that two grammatical constraints are sensitive to the coindexing of NPs within minimal governing categories, and therefore that Chamorro quasipronominals are in effect ambiguous ("morphologically syncretic"), distinguished into Anaphors and pronominals at the syntactic level. However, it is hard to see how this can be made an empirical proposition, given that whenever a proform is locally bound, it can be claimed to be a covert Anaphor, and where not, a pronominal.

It seems to me then that it may be preferable to treat the special constraints on Chamorro pronominals construed reflexively as semantic. For example, there seems to be a syntactic filter banning any third-person-plural subject of a normal transitive clause, unless subject and object are coreferential. But the exception is surely based on the natural semantic conception of reflexive clauses as quasi-intransitive, as shown in the worldwide association of middle verb forms with reflexivity both synchronically and diachronically (see, e.g., Geniusiene *, 1987). The second constraint likewise gives no real support to a syntactic distinction between Anaphor and pronominal.65 In any case, Chamorro is clearly a language where a single set of pronominals does double duty as a set of reflexive and nonreflexive pronouns, as seems to be so often the case in the Austronesian family.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|4.3.3.1.3  <br>Creoles66\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|A third and diverse group of languages that seem to generally lack Anaphors are the pidgins and creoles of all origins. These languages have recently been surveyed by Carden and Stewart (1986, 1988, 1990) to see to what extent the Binding Conditions adequately describe their anaphoric patterns. They point out that the issue is rather interesting from the point of view of the Bioprogram hypothesis advanced by Bickerton (1981); if the Binding Conditions are innate, and if pidgins upon creolizing should reveal the essential stripped-down properties of human language, then we might expect to find the Binding Conditions rapidly instantiated upon creolization. This is not, however, at all what was found in the survey. Instead, the evidence seems to show both that pidgins and creoles tend to lack Anaphors and that they tend to lack a grammaticalized Binding Condition B (pronouns obligatorily disjoint with clausemate antecedents).

They conclude from this that the Northern dialect of the creole can be treated as an earlier, less grammaticalized stage of the creole. Historical data seems to support thisthe earliest materials provide plenty of evidence for the use of the plain pronouns as reflexives but little or no evidence for the specialized reflexive forms. The implication is that the earliest forms of Haitian Creole (pre-1800) had no reflexives; the later reflexives based on body-part metaphors may be due either to ultimate (African) substrate sources or just as likely to independent invention.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Other creoles also evidence no reflexive forms, such as the Spanish-based Palenquero (Carden and Stewart 1986: 24, 199), French-based Guadeloupe, and Arabic-based KiNubi, not to mention various pidgins including Chinese pidgin English and early Chinook Jargon (Carden and Stewart 1990: 5). Moreover, perhaps half of all Creole lects allow the reflexive use of clausemate pronouns (1986: n. 58; Carden and Stewart 1987: 23ff exemplify from, e.g., Martinique Creole, Chinook Jargon, Bislama, KiNubi, Negerhollands). Corne (1988) shows that Mauritian Creole uses the ordinary pronouns as reflexives in the unmarked case, even though it has reflexive forms (although Corne believes this use of pronouns to be a post-creole innovation, Carden and Stewart (1989) reanalyze the historical material to argue that this use of the pronouns is derived from the original pidginization process).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Comparison leads Carden and Stewart to hypothesize a diachronic sequence in creole languages (I here generalize from their 1986 discussion of Haitian Creole):\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(a) _Stage 1:_ no encoded reflexives; plain pronouns used reflexively\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(b) _Stage 2:_ gradual emergence of morphological reflexives (e.g., based on body-part metaphors) with a clausemate, subject-antecedent condition, coexisting with but encroaching upon the use of ordinary pronouns as reflexives\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(c) _Stage 3:_ the loss of the reflexive use of the ordinary pronouns\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|One point that they draw special attention to is that the tolerant treatment of pronouns as possible reflexives is not a feature that is by any means lost abruptly (surviving some hundreds of years in some dialects of the Haitian Creole), as might be expected if Condition B were part of the Bioprogram that would assert itself immediately upon the acquisition of\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

The gradual nature of the change towards a typologically unmarked system (with reflexives and Condition B-like patterns) argues either against Bickerton's (1981) idea that creolization should reveal the Bioprogram in the raw as it were, or against the idea that the Binding Conditions are core elements of that Bioprogram.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Carden and Stewart also note the parallels in language acquisition, pointing out that this supports the idea that creole patterns are tied closely to patterns in first-language acquisition. Studies by Solan (1987), Jakubowicz (1984), and others (see Lust 1986 and Kaufman 1994 for review) show that while the clausemate restriction on the interpretation of reflexives (in languages that have them) is acquired early, the Condition B nonreflexive use of pronouns is much more uncertainly acquired, with sometimes as many as 50% of four- to six-year-olds finding a clausemate coreference between an NP and a nonreflexive pronoun perfectly possible (Solan 1987).

It seems however to have taken some time before _self_ was added to the reflexive pronouns [i.e., ordinary pronouns used reflexively] . . . that already from the beginning of the Old English period were widely used as objects without the addition of _self._ (p. 420)\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Thus _self_ clearly began as an emphatic adjectival adjunct to nominative pronouns "with the purpose of emphasizing the identity of the person or thing denoted by the object and the subject" (p. 425), and at the time of Beowulf a reflexive object could only be expressed by the normal accusative pronoun, as in _ic me clænsie_ ('I washed me'). 68 By the time of King Alfred both that mode of expression and its counterpart with _self_ (as in _ic me selfne clænsie_) seem to have been current: thus both _hie forseoð hie selfe_ and _hie forseoð hie_ (p. 421). Indeed the use of the simple pronoun as a reflexive continued right through the Middle English period, although during that period (say 12001500):\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|there is a distinct change in the relative frequency of the two forms: the simple pronouns, which in the beginning are numerically predominant, are gradually, and to an ever increasing extent, encroached upon by the compound pronouns (= pronouns + _self_), with the result that by the second half of the fifteenth century they are more or less in the minority in most writings.

Nevertheless, text counts show that "potentially reflexive uses are _one_ typical context for use of an emphatic" (Faltz 1989: 328).

The hypothesis suggests that where a reflexive interpretation might in fact be stereotypical, as with predicates like 'wash' and 'dress', the emphatic pronouns would not in fact be used. And this seems to have been the case in Middle English: one said _he cladde hym as a poure laborer_ rather than _he cladde hym self._ In these stereotypically reflexive actions one can see a tension between the global stereotype reflected in the DRP ("presume no coarguments corefer") and the specific stereotype ('one washes, etc., oneself') and consequent instabilities in their treatment. Thus the progression from _ic me clænsie > ic me selfne clænsie > ic clænsie_that is, the loss of the reflexive object with verbs like _wash, dress, shave,_ and so onhas been much commented on (see, e.g., Jespersen 1927: 325f; Visser 1963: 145ff). The endpoint of the development, the correlation of the omission of the object with the stereotypical reading (as predicted by the I-principle), is of course striking. The history of English thus seems to provide excellent evidence for an evolution of reflexives out of emphatics. The point at which the emphatic became grammaticalized as a reflexive can perhaps be equated with the point at which it lost its inflection, at the transition of Old to Middle English. But as just indicated, this long preceded the acquisition of indefeasible (or grammaticalized) Condition B-like patterns outlawing the reflexive use of ordinary pronouns, a practice that survived well into Shakespeare's time and beyond (Visser 1963: 435; Haiman 1995).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|However, regardless of the diachronic progression, there is little doubt that Old English was a classical B-first language, at least in the earliest period: it lacked Anaphors entirely, operating with a presumption of clausemate NP disjointness, a presumption that could be defeated by the use of a pronoun with an emphatic adjunct. The history of Dutch (and no doubt other West Germanic languages) might have been similar had it not been for the relatively recent influence of German: before then just as in Old English there were no reflexives, with pronouns doing double duty. 71 But, according to Everaert (1986: 3), "in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the eastern dialects of the Dutch language area started to use a _sich_-reflexive (which later developed into _zich_) under the influence of Middle Low German dialects involved in a process of _sich_ adoption from Middle High German. If we look at the present-day non-standard dialects we can observe that the use of _zich_ is still limited to the eastern dialects (Ureland 1981)." Everaert notes that West Flemish (1986: 43) and Afrikaans (1986: 3940) continue to operate without morphological reflexives.72\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

The most interesting thing about such languages from the current point of view is that _the opposition between coreference and disjoint reference in such languages can only be achieved pragmatically__it_ can only be suggested, indeed implicated, by the choice of a specific kind of referring expression. If there are general pragmatic processes that can be reliably employed to make such referential distinctions in such languages (and there must be), then there is every reason to think that the same pragmatic processes operate in other languages to support partially grammaticalized oppositions of the same kind. Thus the very existence of languages of this sort is evidence in favor of the fundamental role that we are attributing to generalized conversational implicature in the interpretation of anaphora.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|4.3.3.2  <br>Interim Conclusions: The B-First Account\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|There is, then, distinct evidence in favor of a B-first analysis. First, as we have seen, there is evidence that there are languages that have no way of coding reflexivity at all. This makes an A-first analysis impossible, of course, because the A-first analysis predicts all the patterns of anaphora as pragmatically derived from a grammatical coresomething like Condition A of the Binding Theory. It goes without saying that such B-first languages are even more serious challenges to theories like that of Chomsky (1981, 1986), where Condition A is claimed to have no basis in experience and is held to govern NP-movement as well as Anaphor construal. We can then ask whether in languages with an ill-developed or zero-coding of reflexivity, we can nevertheless find a grammaticalized Condition B. But the question suggests its own answerif nonreflexive core arguments of transitive verbs were stipulated to be necessarily disjoint (as in Conditions B and C), how could reflexivity be expressed at all when there is no direct coding of reflexivity? Nonreflexively marked NPs in such languages must be construable, under the right circumstances, as coreferential with a coargument antecedent. So, in such languages, the assumption of disjoint clausemate arguments can only be a tendencyin short, a pragmatic inference to the stereotype. What we do see in such languages is the development of some device to suggest the nonstereotypical coreferential interpretation; the theory of GCIs predicts that such a device would be merely a matter of marking the NP or the verb emphatically or contrastively, so suggesting a marked situationthat is, M-implicating conjoint reference against an I-based assumption of disjoint clausemates.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Yet Reinhart for one thinks that at least the disjoint pattern in bound-variable anaphora as in _Everybody likes him_ does indeed have an innate basis (Grodzinsky and Reinhart 1993; see also Chien and Wexler 1990). But the language-acquisition facts even in A-first languages like English, where adult intuitions about locally disjoint pronouns are very strong, do not support an innate Condition B. As mentioned, these studies seem to show that children learning A-first languages learn the clausemate restriction on reflexives relatively early (as early as 3 years old) and relatively exceptionlessly (up to 95%); but the assumption that a nonreflexive pronoun in object position is disjoint from the clausemate subject is learned relatively late (as late as 5 or 6 years old) and applied only some of the time (in some experimental conditions as little as 36%see Solan 1987; also Jakubowicz 1984, Read and Hare 1979). Surveying these studies, Kaufman (1994: 182) concluded that "taken together, these studies demonstrate that children's performance with pronouns is sometimes poorer and often more variable than their performance with reflexives," nor did she find the recent tests of bound-variable disjointness to support Reinhart's assumption that at least that aspect of Condition B was more robust (see also C. Koster 1994). These particular investigations in A-first languages support our A-first analysis, by suggesting that children must first learn, or learn to apply, Condition A, and only then would be able to slowly appreciate the pragmatic implications of that pattern (i.e., Condition B and C patterns), often not before middle childhood (C. Koster 1994: 201). They also clearly indicate that Condition B is not as natural and robust as it seems to the intuitions of adult speakers of A-first languages.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|We seem to be left then with the possibility that there are two rather radically different kinds of languages: those that have a grammaticalized Condition A (or similar principle), and those that lack it but have a pragmatically based Condition B-like assumption that clausemate arguments are distinct unless otherwise indicated. The A-first languages are numerically in the ascendant, and there is historical evidence that the B-first languages tend to develop into A-first systems. In both cases, though, our theory of GCIs gives some account of how the rest of the anaphora patterns can be derived.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

We have reviewed the earlier A-first account of binding patterns, which makes the anaphoric patterns often attributed to Conditions B and C of the Binding Theory pragmatically derivative from grammaticalized Anaphors. We have shown how certain difficulties with this may be circumvented. In particular, the most prominent problem, the overlap in distribution between (especially long-range) reflexives and pronouns, was shown to not necessarily be an overwhelming difficulty at all. Instead, by bringing the subtle logophoric aspects of long-distance reflexives into the picture, we can maintain the Q-based contrast between pronoun and reflexive. Thus we end up with a natural extension of the A-first account into languages and phenomena (like switch reference) beyond those for which it was originally developed. We can now say that there is a large class of languages (those we have been calling the A-first languages) that seem to fall within the scope of such a partial pragmatic reduction of the Binding Conditions.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|But the reader will recollect that one problem remains with the A-first account, sufficient to suggest that we are still missing an essential ingredientnamely, the fact that the reflexive and the pronoun seem to be in a different kind of opposition where there is a clausemate, co-argument antecedent within the clause, compared to where the antecedent is more remote. In the first case, the opposition is nearly always one of reference; in the second case, it is either one of reference or one of logophoricityhence the pronoun can often occur with the same reference but opposed in logophoricity. On the face of it, this fact in many languages with longrange reflexives predisposes us once again to a grammatical account, taking the reflexive and the pronoun to have different binding domains. But once the wider facts about distribution of such reflexives are considered (like the fact that the antecedent can be far removed, even beyond the sentence, or deictically implicit in the case of first- and second-person antecedents), the grammatical account of long-distance Anaphors no longer looks so attractive (see, e.g., Mazuka and Lust 1994, J. Koster 1994). The basic facta semantic factis that the reflexive is necessarily referentially dependent, the pronoun only optionally so; the search for an antecedent seems to be guided by matters of preferential interpretation, not grammatical principles (for an extended justification of this for\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Suppose we assume that in A-first languages we can find the same presumption that is central to the anaphoric operations of B-first languagesnamely, the presumption that core arguments of a single clause are disjoint (the DRP). Additionally, of course, we have the Q-implicated contrast between reflexive and pronoun, which in a language without long-distance reflexives is sufficient explanation of the tendency to read the pronoun as disjoint with a clausemate antecedent. Thus in languages without long-distance reflexives, the presumption that core arguments are disjoint is redundant, which is why it never figured in our original A-first account. But in languages with long-distance reflexives, although the two pragmatic principles will be largely overlapping and reinforcing, in the case of the long-distance use of the reflexive there will be a Q-contrast outside the scope of the clausemate-disjointness presumption. In those long-distance locations, the Q-contrast need not be interpreted as a contrast in reference (although it may be); it may instead be interpreted as a contrast in logophoricity, along the lines that O'Connor (1993) suggests.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|To summarize the argument, then, we have two pragmatic principles at work underlying the different patterns of interpretation for pronouns in opposition to locally bound reflexives on the one hand, versus pronouns in opposition to long-range reflexives on the other:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|1.

I would now like to propose that this is the general evolutionary route by which the familiar A-first languages have arisen. Restricting ourselves to the languages that mark reflexivity by NP type, on such a diachronic account, Anaphors arise as marked pronominal NPs M-implicating contrast with the clausemate-disjointness presumption. But the use in a B-first language of emphatics to encode the marking, as is so often the case, is obviously consistent with a much wider use of such forms. In particular, because a deictic perspective is the perennial unmarked presumption, a marked or emphatic form may always suggest a contrastive perspective, such as one where (as Stirling 1993 puts it) the "validator" is not the current speaker (see also Levinson 1988a). So here we have the explanation of the association of logophoricity with reflexives: both conjoint reference within the clause and a marked deictic perspective are perennial possibilities of interpretation of the use of a marked form in a B-first language, because it will suggest by M-implicature an interpretation complementary to the stereotypical one that would arise from the use of the corresponding unmarked form.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Putting these ingredients together, we may schematize the diachronic progression from B-first languages to A-first ones as follows (where English glosses sketch the various language patterns): 73\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(70) _Stage 1: No reflexives; core-arguments tend to be disjoint_ Sentences of the form 'John hit him' will I-implicate disjoint reference, via the DRP;74 only ad hoc means such as the use of an emphatic or marked intonation can be used to M-implicate the complementary interpretation of exceptional coreference; the same means are likely to be used to M-implicate a marked deictic perspective.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

But the hypothesis seems to be largely, if not entirely, compatible with the diachronic hypotheses about the origins of reflexives that Faltz (1985) advances on the basis of typological reviews of reflexivity encoding. His findings are worth reviewing in detail. Faltz suggests (1985: 48ff) that the main typological distinction is between languages that have true, underived, pronominal reflexives (like Russian _sebja_ and German _sich_ 75) and those with compound reflexives. Compound reflexives are of different types: (a) nominal head reflexives, usually modified by a possessive pronoun, as in Turkish _kendi-me_ ('self-mine');76 (b) adjunct reflexives, based on a pronoun modified with a reflexive adjunct as in Old English _hinesylfne_ '3msg-ACC + REFL' or Irish _é féin_ 'him + REFL'; and (c) fused adjunct reflexives, like modern English where _himself_ can no longer be analyzed simply as head + modifier.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|In addition to all these types, there are verbal reflexivizers, often derived from cliticized pronominal or nominal reflexives (e.g., French _se +_ Verb from Latin _se_), but which end up as true verbal affixes (like Russian middle -_sja_ from pronominal _sebja_). Diagrammatically:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|![Z0373001.GIF](../Images/4e8aa2aeefb5dcb677a451b55aeaf1c6.gif)\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Certain properties are said to be restricted to each of these types. For example, P (pronominal) reflexives require subject antecedents, strictly require all coreferential clausemates to be encoded with the P form, but may have long-distance uses; whereas C reflexives tend to allow nonsubject antecedents, allow some oblique nonreflexive coreferential clausemates, but don't permit long-range uses. (It's clear, in fact, on the basis of more recent information that these could be at most systematic trends.)\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Faltz (1985: chap. 6) then suggests that the following kinds of diachronic progressions may be hypothesized:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|1.

Perhaps all C reflexives come from emphatic adjuncts on pronounsfor example, Old English _self,_ French _même_ (from late Latin _*metipsimum_),78 Dutch _zelf,_ Papago _hijil,_ and so on (1985: 243ff); some of those based on forms glossing like 'his head/body' also clearly derive from emphatics (Biblical Hebrew), whereas others may possibly have been directly coined to encode reflexivization.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|3. More speculatively, P pronouns derive from subordinate reflexives (long-range-only reflexives)that is, nonreflexive pronouns used coreferentially with nonclausemate antecedents, like the logophoric African pronouns discussed in section 4.3.2.5.1.79 These subordinate reflexives in turn derive either from stressed pronouns or from a first-person pronoun used in direct reported speech.80\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Thus, if in broad outline Faltz is right, nearly all reflexives ultimately arise from emphatic or stressed pronouns.81 As to why this might be the case, he advances what is in effect a brief and informal version of our Bfirst account: "an emphatic is added to an NP as a warning to the hearer that the intended referent of that NP is unusual or unexpected" (p. 240); "in the absence of a reflexive strategy, it is natural for an emphatic to be used to signal that the more highly marked, less expected situation is present, namely that the NP (argument) in question has the same referent as another one in the same predication" (p. 242). In addition to Old English, Faltz cites Dutch, French and Spanish secondary reflexives (_même_ and _mismo_), Papago, Hebrew, among other languages, as providing clear evidence for reflexives derived from emphatics.82 The German secondary reflexive _selbst_ is also interesting here; cognate with English _self,_ it remains an intensifier used to mark reflexivity with nonsubject antecedents (the primary reflexive _sich_ requiring a subject antecedent) as in:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(74) Hans sprach mit Fritz über ihn (selbst).  <br>Hans spoke with Fritz about him (self)  <br>'Hans spoke with Fritz about him (himself).'\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Here, without the addition of _selbst,_ the reference of _ihn_ is likely to be taken to be a third party, but with the addition, the referent is taken to be Fritz (Faltz 1985: 240). But _selbst_ is also synchronically an intensifier:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Nevertheless, the diachronic evidence is still relatively thin and still relatively biased by data from Indo-European languages. Clearly we need much more work on the history of reflexives in those languages, like Tamil, Chinese, and Japanese, that provide long continuous records. In the history of all three of those languages, we can find evidence for at least a precondition for the reflexives-from-emphatics hypothesisnamely, evidence for overlap in function of the same morpheme(s) for both emphasis and reflexivity. Thus Classical Chinese _zi_ clearly had both reflexive and emphatic uses like modern Chinese _ziji._83 Ancient Japanese had a range of reflexives that also functioned as subject intensifiers or emphatics;84 modern _zibun_ or _jibun_ (the _ji_- morpheme is written with the same Chinese character as Classical _zi_ and is obviously borrowed) clearly maintains the emphatic adjunct function (Mazuka and Lust 1994: 152).85 Modern Tamil has the same telltale overlap in function of the morpheme _taan_ as an indeclinable NP intensifier and a declinable (long-distance) reflexive; in Classical Tamil, the intensifier was a declinable postposition (Andronov 1969: 108). The tendency to pronominalize is continuing in the more recent use of _taan_ as a nonreflexive honorific second- (or sometimes third-) person pronoun. Even in the present language, the emphatic and the reflexive are more than mere accidental homonyms: "with regard to the emphatic\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

As Caldwell (1961[1865]: 401) noted over a century ago, Dravidian _taan_ "must, I think, have originated from some emphatic demonstrative base," a conclusion supported by later comparative Dravidian studies (e.g., Gondi _tanaa_ is "only used in the third person and in the nominative" (Burrow and Emeneau 1961: 207); that is, I suspect, purely as an emphatic adjunct).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Still, whatever the current empirical basis, the hypothesis seems plausible enough, and it is certainly open to empirical refutation. It clearly makes interesting predictions about the evolution of anaphoric patterns generally; it suggests, for example, that languages with long-distance reflexives may be midway between A-first and B-first patterns, and if so, we might expect a greater flexibility in interpretation in such languages than exists in English. Chinese is an interesting case in point, and it is worth seeing how the facts might be incorporated into an account of this sort.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|In a thorough reexamination of Chinese anaphora, Huang (1991, 1994) claims that no grammatical account of the Chomskyan type will be able to handle the observed flexibility of interpretation associated, in particular, with the pronominal _ta_ and the long-range reflexive _ziji._ He thoroughly reviews the many recent attempts to bring Chinese within the fold of the Binding Theory predictionsfor example by means of (a) expanding the binding domain for _ziji,_ (b) postulating movement at the level of Logical Form, and (c) reclassifying _ziji_ as a special kind of pronominal. Each of these simply makes the wrong predictions. The essential facts (Huang 1994: 7678) are that Chinese has two candidate reflexive Anaphors, simple _ziji_ and complex _ta ziji_ (or pronominal + _ziji_), which distribute in mostly the same ways: they can be both short- and long-distance bound (i.e., their antecedents can be local or indefinitely distant), and their antecedents need not be in c-commanding positions. They differ in that _ziji_ requires a subject antecedent and _ta ziji_ does not; and _ziji,_ which is (unlike pronominal + _ziji_) unmarked for person, assumes the nearest possible antecedent is of the correct person (i.e., long-distance linking is ruled out by a "blocking rule" if the distant antecedent is of a different person than a local candidate). Rather than invoke the Binding Theory apparatus, an accurate account of the behavior of these reflexives can be obtained, he claims, simply by the interaction of their lexical or\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Instead, he argues that to account for the patterns in Chinese one needs only M- and I-implicatures (with that order of priority), together with a presumption of intraclause argument distinctness (the DRP). Note that this is closely related to the B-first account already described (which was partly prompted by his work): on a B-first account, the DRP is the foundation, and M-implicatures invoked by emphatics are used to indicate coreference, whereas simple pronouns are I-implicated to be closely coreferential beyond the clause. In a B-first account, the Q-principle is otiose, because until a privative opposition between pronoun and reflexive has developed, there is no basis for scalar (or Q-based) implicature. However, Huang (1994: 130) does not invoke the M-principle to explain clausemate conjointness with _ziji,_ which is rather semantically explained: _ziji_ is clearly lexically specified as referentially dependent and thus can override the pragmatic assumption of the disjointness of co-arguments. The B-first account is tailored to a rather different situation, where there is no such stabilized semantic encoding, as in Old English. A schematic comparison between the accounts may help to make the contrast clear (where > signifies "overrides" and where "I-coreference" indicates an inference to conjointness induced by the I-principle, "semantics" indicates specified referential dependency, M+> indicates M-implicates and so on):\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|<br>\\|<br>\\|\\\|   \\\|   \\\|   \\\|<br>\\\|---\\\|---\\\|---\\\|<br>\\\|\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|(77)\\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|Bfirst account\\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|<br>\\\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|Huang's account of Chinese\\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\|\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|---\\\\|<br>\\\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|   \\\\|   \\\\|<br>\\\\|a.

There is, in effect, a global tendency to locally coreferential readings of both the reflexive _ziji_ and the nonreflexive pronoun _ta,_ a tendency defeated in the case of _ta_ with a potential clausemate antecedent by the presumption of co-argument distinctness. Contrasts between _ta_ and _ziji,_ which may be expected by M-implicature, tend outside the domain of the DRP to be interpreted as contrasts in emphaticness or logophoricity rather than reference. Both _ta_ and _ziji_ contrast with lexical NPs, which discourage coreferential interpretations by M. Because Chinese permits zero-anaphora, this has to be brought into the picture too: except in special circumstances, _ta_ and zero tend to contrast in the expected way, with the pronoun suggesting more distant coreference than the zero-anaphor (p. 134ff). 87\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Chinese therefore differs from a prototype B-first language like Old English in having, in the form of _ziji,_ a conventionalized pronominal that is obligatorily referentially dependent but without a clear syntactic specification of a binding domain. It is tempting to think of Chinese as transitional between a B-first language and an A-first one, with _ziji_ being in the process of acquiring the Q-contrasts so typical of A-first languages. Unfortunately, there seems to be no history of pronominals and reflexives in Chinese easily accessible to the nonspecialist. Perhaps some speculation may be forgiven in the hope that specialists may be goaded into supplying us with the facts. As already mentioned, _ziji_ already in Classical Chinese had both emphatic and reflexive uses, and it continues to be used as an intensifier (e.g., in collocation with a subject; Li and Thompson 1981: 138f). Thus, on the hypothesis that _ziji_ was in origin an emphatic, we can hypothesize an earlier B-first state of the language with the following properties:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|_1. Intraclausal anaphoric patterns:_ use of the pronominal _ta_ would tend to I-implicate local coreference, except with clausemate antecedents where the DRP would block coreference; this presumption being overruled by the use of a marked, emphatic _ta ziji_ or _ziji_ that would M-implicate the complementary interpretation, here coreference.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|_2. Cross-clause anaphoric patterns:_ here, where there is no presumption of disjoint reference, _ta_ would tend to pick up a local antecedent; the use of (_ta_) _ziji_ will M-implicate a contrastive interpretation but not necessarily a contrast in reference (no longer especially salient, outside the scope of the DRP)the contrast may be on the dimensions of unexpectedness, sole agency, or nondeictic (logophoric) point of view.88\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

First, let us see to what extent Chinese can be seen as conforming to A-first predictions. We might look at it this way: given that _ta_ encompasses both deictic and anaphoric uses, there is now an ordering of semantic informativeness over the two expressions and thus the makings of a Horn scale <_ziji, ta>_, with the use of the weaker _ta_ suggesting that the use of _ziji_ would be inappropriate. But _ziji,_ even in the present language, is not an Anaphor in the Binding Theory sense, because it carries no specification of the domain in which it must be bound (Huang 1994: 88ff). The Q-opposition between _ziji_ and _ta_ is thus rather weak_ziji_ is no more informative about where to find an antecedent, and, after all, most pronominal uses are anaphoric and thus referentially dependent in any case. What strengthens the opposition is the encoding of contrast or unexpectedness, emphasis, and logophoricity associated with _ziji._ The use of _ta_ therefore Q-implicates that either the speaker wishes to avoid referential dependence or that he wishes to avoid the logophoric or contrastive associations of _ziji._ Where reference is the salient issue (especially, where there is a potential intraclause antecedent such that the presumption of intraclausal argument distinctiveness is pertinent), the use of _ta_ will strongly suggest disjoint reference, 89 but elsewhere it is just as likely to suggest noncontrastiveness or nonlogophoricity. So we obtain the following patterns of preferred interpretation (from Huang 1989: ch. 3, 1994: 125):\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(78) a.

To this extent, an A-first account is compatible with the facts.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|As discussed above, Huang's (1991, 1994) account of all this is simpler: in (79b) the presumption of clausemate argument distinctness overrides the I-preference for local coreference, whereas the latter in turn is overridden by the semantics of referential dependency in (78a). In (79a) the preference for coreference goes through unchecked. But Huang's account leaves questions unansweredfor example, why the _ta/ziji_ opposition fails to form a Q-implicating Horn scale. It also, perhaps, hides the crosslinguistic generality of these patterns: if we bring the subjective (logophoric) meaning contrasts back into the picture we can see why we can have a pragmatic contrast without a change of reference. These contrasts, subtle though they are, are surely a prominent part of these systems, partially eclipsed by the focus on referential potential in grammatical theory but correctly emphasized in recent work by O'Connor (1993), Kuno (1987), Sells (1987), Stirling (1993), and others. The contrast between _ta_ and _ziji_ is therefore often interpreted nonreferentially, as acknowledged by Huang (1991), where _ziji_ is claimed to carry an "unexpectedness message" indicating either logophoric viewpoint or contrastiveness, when used in positions where a pronoun or zero-anaphor could have the same reference. He has since gone on to document the logophoric implications of _ziji_ in detail (Huang 1994: 184199), suggesting that the logophoric implications of _ziji_ are at least in part conventionalized. One piece of evidence (op. cit. p. 196) in favor of this is that, for example, a third-person antecedent cannot be searched for over a more local first-person antecedent, because the first-person reference defines a perspectival domain (hence, in gloss, *'John1 thinks that I trust self1 too much'). In short, if we consider _ta_ and _ziji_ to constitute an emerging privative opposition (with _ziji_ necessarily referentially dependent and logophoric, _ta_ unmarked), we have an account of the Chinese patterns that fits the crosslinguistic spectrum of systems, as intermediate between A-first and B-first.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Such an intermediate position would also help to explain some rather striking parallels between modern Chinese and the B-first Old English.

On a B-first account, an emphatic form may be used to implicate disjointness, overriding the DRP. Double emphasis, though, may itelf override that interpretation in turn. 91 As Huang (1994: 197198) notes, both _ziji_ and _ta ziji_ continue to have emphatic meanings: if _ziji_ can implicate conjointness, then _ta ziji_ can by double contrast implicate the complementary interpretation (i.e., disjoint reference). In some respects, then, Chinese appears to behave in the manner of a B-first language like Old English, with _ziji_ and _ta ziji_ operating just like emphatics. This M-like behavior of _ziji_ and _ta ziji_ can also be seen in the logophoric implications: example (81a) below (conforming to the alleged "blocking rule" mentioned above) must be interpreted with _ziji_ linked to the first-person antecedent, because this introduces a subjective point of view, but the double form _ta ziji_ in (81b) can override this (Huang 1994: 196).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(81) a.

Similarly, Mitchell (1985: 194) argues that _him seolfum_ in this extract from Bede "refers to Gregorius, the subject of the main clause, and not to God, the subject of the clause in which it stands." Thus the passage glossed 'He1 prayed to Almighty God2 . . . that He2 to himself1 would grant . . .' has the same pattern of anaphora as the Chinese sentence. Mitchell (1985: 194) points out that often the -_self_ form in Old English "is in effect reflexive, though not grammatically so" in just this way.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|These are surely striking parallels across time and linguistic phylogeny. In both Old English and Chinese, we seem to be dealing with a flexible system of anaphoric interpretation, with only very partial coding of Anaphoricity (i.e., referential dependency within a restricted domain), where the referentially dependent pronominal clearly has primordial emphatic or intensification functions that continue to affect its use. In the case of English, we know the further direction of development, toward true Anaphors with restrictive binding domains; it may not be entirely fanciful to imagine that Chinese is heading in the same direction, towards\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

But regardless of that, the categories A-first, B-first, and transitional may provide a useful, if crude, first step towards a crosslinguistic typology of anaphoric systems, providing that they are taken together with the pragmatic principles that generate the patterns and severely restrict the possibilities of preferred interpretation.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|4.5  <br>Conclusions\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|4.5.1  <br>Summary\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|This chapter has examined one crucial area, intrasentential anaphora, where syntax and pragmatics seem to closely interact to generate patterns of interpretation. I began by exploring the A-first account (Levinson 1987a,b), which attempts to reduce Binding Conditions B and C to matters of generalized conversational implicature using an apparatus independently motivated by much work in pragmatics. This analysis can be extended to subsume Reinhart's theory that holds that only boundvariable anaphora is grammatically specified. I also noted that the pragmatic theory could be made to engage with other approaches, such as those with nonconfigurational theories of binding, but in each case precise predictions will be made which are a further constraint on theory construction. Now, the A-first account runs into a number of difficulties, notably the failure of complementarity between pronouns and Anaphors. It was shown, however, how this could be handled by the observation that pronouns and reflexives are in other kinds of contrast in these positions. In developing this account, we also saw how it could be extended to cover some of the facts about long-distance reflexives, logophoric anaphoric expressions, and even perhaps switch reference.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|But there is one crucial piece of data that has been ignored by all the work on Anaphorsnamely, the existence of languages that lack reflexives altogether. Here an A-first account is clearly inapplicable. So for such B-first languages (Levinson 1991) I have shown how the same Gricean pragmatic principles can be used to predict a rather different strategy for indicating coreference and disjoint reference. While the A-first account explains how anaphoric patterns are projected by Gricean principles applied to grammaticalized Anaphors, the B-first account shows how grammaticalized Anaphors might arise in the first place. The B-first approach makes basic the DRP (i.e., the presumption of co-argument disjointness) and explains proto-Anaphors in terms of the use of marked expressions to indicate a marked message, namely co-argument coreference.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

If we take this diachronic perspective, linking our A-first and B-first accounts, we are then provided with a plausible explanation of the persistent association of logophoricity (marked perspective) and long-range reflexives. The DRP, inherited by A-first systems from B-first ones, explains why long-distance Anaphors are contrastive with pronouns over reference inside the clause but may be contrastive over point of view or logophoricity beyond the clause. Thus the third approach, a diachronic A-from-B account, seems to offer a detailed explanation of many of the facts of intrasentential anaphora across a broad spectrum of languages. The fact that independently motivated Gricean principles, with reasonably intricate projection rules, should happen to offer explanations in the right directions over the details of, say, English or Chinese is quite encouraging. Consider too that they throw light on such matters as why English-speaking children should start learning Condition A before learning Condition B, or why emphatics and reflexives so often have the same morphological form, or how English reflexives evolved, or why the typological facts about reflexives seem to be the way they are.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|All three of the pragmatic accounts are of course compatible: the A-first and B-first accounts handle the synchronic patterns in different types of languages, and the diachronic A-from-B account connects them historically. But because the diachronic account gives a functionally motivated account of Condition A, it further undermines the idea that even this residue of the Binding Conditions is a direct reflection of innate predispositions, or Universal Grammar. Clearly, on this account, anaphoric patterns are layered accretions of practices motivated by rational functional principles, but which in becoming conventionalized make available yet further pragmatic exploitations. The patterns are learnable on the basis of evidence for the use of language taken together with the rational principles underlying language use. The time scale for evolution of one system into another (e.g., a B-first system into an A-first system), or of the emergence of true Anaphors, may be measured in hundreds of years. All this, of course, seems clearly at variance with a Chomskyan perspective, where anaphoric patterns are instantiations of mental templates and are considered to be in principle unlearnable, and where parameter switching can only take place within the space of a single generation. Because the conclusions are radical, it is worth briefly reviewing other evidence against the view that the Binding Conditions are a deep part of our intellectual makeup.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

To restrict the possibility of unknowing overgeneralization (given the absence of explicit information about the grammatical/ungrammatical boundary), the child must, it seems, prefer parameter values that generate the "smallest" language consistent with the data, the so-called subset principle (Wexler and Manzini 1987). Applied to the Binding Conditions this has the result that the child should always opt for the smallest domain _D_ for Anaphors consistent with the data, and the largest _D_ for pronouns (assuming that Anaphors and pronouns may have distinct Binding domains, as with LDAs). In effect, children should always opt for the most restrictive language. But as we have already noted, this does not fit the data for child speakers of languages like English, at least, where children allow nonreflexives to have more unrestricted interpretations (Solan 1987, Kaufman 1994). Nor do children learning LDA systems seem to go for a clause-bound interpretation initially (see, e.g., Sigurjónsdóttir, Hyams, and Chien 1988 on Icelandic, and discussion in Lightfoot 1989: 370371). And B-first languages like Old English would be predicted to be highly marked, because the one set of pronouns can be interpreted unrestrictively as either Anaphors or nonreflexive pronouns. 92 Yet the evidence we reviewed showed that pidgins and creoles, which one would expect to exhibit unmarked parameter settings, are also in initial stages very likely to be B-first languages (Carden and Stewart 1988).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Compare now a pragmatic account of the learning of such systems. The evidence for the Q- and I-principles abound in many aspects of language data (see, e.g., Atlas and Levinson 1981; Levinson 1987a,b; Horn 1984, 1989). True, it is not clear exactly how the learner comes to formulate such principles, some like Sperber and Wilson (1986) presuming that something like these principles derives directly from innate predispositions to process information in certain ways, and others like Grice and those who follow him more closely (like the present author) imagining that they arise from some complex interaction between native rationality and the demands of the communication setting (see Levinson 1989). Be that as it may, such inferential principles (or something like them) indubitably exist and are clearly utilized (to growing extents) by the lan-\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Patterns of anaphora will then be inspected to see whether they can be treated as instantiations of Q- or M-oppositions to the I-based tendency to stereotypical and coreferential readings. If anaphoric patterns are learned this way, then there are clear predictions for acquisition based on the fact that the patterns arise from contrastive opposition. For example, in an A-first language, where Condition B patterns are parasitic on Condition A patterns, Condition A patterns would have to be learned first. And so in fact they seem to be. 93\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The parameter-setting model also has clear implications for how one would expect language change to occur. Lightfoot (1989: 325) suggests such change should happen because a structural reanalysis by the language learner of some syntactic patterns (a parameter switch) may force certain data to be ignored as 'impossible data', not part of the 'trigger (parameter setting) experience'. Vincent (1989a: 361) comments that one would then expect a certain special kind of obsolescence, notable for "the relatively sudden disappearance from attested sources." For example, once a _himself_ form is analyzed as an Anaphor bound within a minimal domain, one might expect rapid loss of homophonous forms bound further afield; or once _him_ is analyzed as a pronominal free in a domain, one would expect rapid squeezing out of the use of _him_ as a reflexive. The loss should take place in transmission across one generation, and although one must allow for sociolinguistic diffusion across a population, individuals' usage should be consistent (Lightfoot 1989: 370).94 But again, none of these predictions seem true of the history of anaphora in English, or indeed other languages, where the establishment of, for example, Condition Btype patterns of usage began in Anglo-Saxon times but were not complete in Shakespeare's. All this suggests that if language learning does indeed generally proceed by the setting of parameters, the view that Binding domains are candidate parameters does not have obvious empirical support from the facts of acquisition or the indirect effects that modes of acquisition might have on language change.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|4.5.3  <br>Pragmatics and the Generative Program\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|There are striking crosslinguistic parallels in anaphoric patterns.

One model for such an explanation is a parameterized Binding Theory interacting with other parameters in an innate language-learning device. Another model, the one being suggested here, is a universal pragmatic theory that covers the anaphoric tendencies, interacting with language-specific details that are partly historical accretions of practices.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The observations in this chapter, if correct, would seriously undermine the view that the Binding Conditions are part of the native endowment of human language. The A-first account suggests that all disjoint reference conditions belong to pragmatics, with only Condition A as a plausible candidate for a language universal; even here, the linguistic variation suggests that perhaps we are dealing primarily with the semantics of necessary referential dependency. The B-first account, though, suggests that Condition A emerges from usage conditions. The nativist hypothesis, in the absence of direct genetic evidence, can only be an argument from the absence of any alternative plausible account, so the very possibility of a pragmatic account of the core patterns of anaphora must raise doubts about whether the Binding Conditions play as central a role in our innate linguistic endowment as so much linguistic theorizing has presumed.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|There is of course no general challenge here to some concept of a rich, restrictive innate linguistic ability or Universal Grammaronly an argument that we need to look elsewhere. Equally, there is no suggestion here that the current patterns of anaphora in, say, English, are entirely pragmaticrather that the central facts can be seen to have functional motivation, that diachronic explanations might refer more to pragmatic principles than to principles of UG, and that defeasibilities of interpretation, at the margins as it were, are the stigmata of the functional origin of currently grammaticalized patterns. Thus the presumed inability of a pragmatic account to predict, for example, the details of reflexives in raising (or Exceptional Case Marking) contexts like _John believes himself to be ill_ does not undermine the thrust of the argumentonce a language has grammaticalized an A-first system, such a system will have to treat such weakened clause boundaries one way or the other, as permeable or impermeable barriers to binding.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|An important question is whether other well-researched areas of grammatical analysis might not turn out to allow pragmatic analyses.

But even in English one can note that the patterns, which are at least partially grammaticalized, conform to the pragmatic expectations.

Otherwise, we assume we are dealing with either general or language-specific syntactic specifications. A pragmatic account working in tandem with syntactic principles (as in the A-first account) can give us a better overall explanation on three counts: (a) it is economical, because it reduces what needs special, language-specific or arbitrary specification; (b) it accounts for restricted areas of defeasibility in interpretations just where they occur; and (c) it further constrains the syntactic part of the account by making predictions about further inferences from each syntactic specification of interpretation.

We have tried to show that a system of interacting pragmatic principles, with well-defined interactions between them, could in fact be heuristically valuable. Although the default nature of such principles indeed raises methodological problems by the standards of exceptionless syntactic principles, major pragmatic principles in turn have a signal methodological advantage over syntactic principlesthey apply crosslinguistically across the board. 96 Such pragmatic principles make us question, for example, any proposed grammatical stipulation of disjoint reference, make us suspect any opposition between gaps and pronouns (or more generally simplex and complex morphemes) as a potential case of Horn's division of pragmatic labor, and make us scrutinize any privative opposition for its predicted Qimplicatures. The I-principle suggests systematic links ought to be found between clause-connectedness and coreferential interpretations, of the kind represented by PRO-structures, but not sufficiently explored crosslinguistically (see Foley and Van Valin 1983). Such principles also suggest typological distinctions, like those between A-first and B-first systems of anaphora (or systems with greater and lesser syntactic core; see Huang 1994: 259260). They make rather detailed predictions about diachronic trajectories, as in our B-first to A-first transition, from emphatics to reflexives, thus explaining the associations of reflexives with logophoricity. It has to be conceded that these heuristics are still relatively broad and crude, but then the detailed study of pragmatic principles has hardly begun.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

The idea is simple but crucial to a theory of communication: when we say something, we find ourselves committed to much more, just by virtue of choices between all the ways we could have said it. There is nothing new in the idea, but the notion has never been pushed to the forefront of the theory of meaning where it belongs, together with the other, more familiar cast of charactersthe entailments, presuppositions, metaphors, and so forth. One genus of such presumptive meanings is the category of GCIs, with the now-familiar species of Q-, I- and M-inferences. Together with other principles governing idiomatic use of language, these constitute our third level of utterance-type meaning, sitting between the coded meanings of linguistic expressions on the one hand, and nonce-inferences to speaker-meaning on the other.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Because of the interstitial position of this third level of meaning, reductionists will forever be tempted to assimilate it to either the level of coded meaning or the level of nonce-inference. But this is a mistake, not only because the interstitial nature of the phenomena with its defeasible regularities will resist such a move, but because this third level interacts so deeply with the structure of language that we will never build an adequate linguistic theory without paying proper attention to it.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|I hope to have been reasonably successful in making a case for GCIs as an important kind of linguistic orphan. But why, one may ask, are such pragmatic factors so relatively neglected in current linguistic theory? One general source of resistance to incorporating pragmatic factors into linguistic theory is the continued feeling that pragmatics is not wellenough developed to yield any kinds of prediction. 1 Second, the view that pragmatics is concerned only with nonce-inference and with post hoc accounts of speaker-meaning discourages the search for any systematic\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Third, the idea that pragmatics concerns itself with nonlinguistic reasoning that happens to be applied to linguistic objects suggests that the essential principles, insights, and goals lie far from those of linguistic theory. Fourth, resistance to the invasion of pragmatic explanations into areas erstwhile thought of as semantic or syntactic may be linked to a mistaken view that such explanations go together with an extreme functionalism that attempts to reduce all structure to use. Such reasons may add up to a feeling that syntax, phonology, and semantics must go it alone.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|GCI theory is very clearly not related to this perception of pragmatics. Let me address the points above one by one. The theory makes clear predictions, as I have tried to detail throughout this book (and I will return to the point in a moment). It is not about nonce-inferences nor about post hoc explanations about what a speaker may in full context have meant: it is about what any reasonable interlocutor would understand by a certain way of putting things. The theory is not about reasoning _simpliciter:_ it is about special modes of inference that come into play on the basis of our heuristics and their role in the special coordination problems posed by meaningnnindeed, as suggested in chapter 1, the kind of reasoning involved may be the Ur-type of default reasoning. Nor should it be misconstrued as a kind of radical reduction of structure to function: GCIs are inferences from structure and meaning to further presumptive meanings. The role of the theory of GCIs in linguistic theory is as an additional tool in the explanatory armory. It is not likely to replace any of the alternative tools, but it offers to shrink their domains of application to more manageable proportions.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Let us pursue a few of these issues in a little more detail.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|5.1  <br>Predictive Power of the Theory of GCIS\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|GCI theory in its current state is a set of generalizations about the interrelations of linguistic expressions, the extra inferences that these interrelations give rise to, and the conditions under which these default inferences do not go through.

For example, unmarked lexemes will have specializations by I-inference to the stereotype, whereas their marked doublets will pick up complementary interpretations; informationally asymmetric sets of items in the same field will form scales, inverted under negation, with regular scalar inferences; weak scalar items will be in privative opposition with their stronger counterparts, with compatible extensions excluded by implicature. GCIs do not of course predict exactly what is lexically or grammatically codedthat is quite largely a language-specific matter. But they do constrain what is lexicalized, and they do govern the likely relations between such codings. Notice that the theory predicts multiple inferences even from quite small semantic fields, as exemplified by the "logical" connectives with their Q-, M-, and I-inferences (e.g., the scalar inference from _or,_ the marked interpretation of double negation, conditional perfection of _if_) and the complex interactions between them governed by the projection rule. Notice too that the theory makes predictions not only about content but about form/meaning relations: unmarked forms pick up I-inferences; marked ones the complementary M-inferences.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|At the next higher level, the theory makes general predictions about constraints operating over the lexicalization patterns in such fields. Here, for example, lies the crosslinguistic generalization that O-corners of the square of opposition generally resist lexicalization, while blocking rules in syntax and morphology (Aronoff 1974, Williams 1997) are arguably merely specific instantiations of Horn's (1984) division of labor between I- and M-inferences. At a still higher level, it makes predictions about the interaction of semantics and pragmaticsfor example, the intrusion of pragmatic inferences into syntactic constructions where one constituent is evaluated against the interpretation of another. Similarly, it suggests economy in the syntactic component, with, for example, no need for stipulation of disjoint-reference conditions. Putting these different levels of abstraction together, we have clear predictions about pragmatic constraints on language structurein effect, predictions about possible languages. These predictions arise because the Q-, M-, and I-heuristics operate across the board, generating presumptive inferences that insert themselves willy-nilly into the interpretations of utterances. They thus play a decisive role in structuring lexical fields and syntactic constructions, especially by redundancy constraints: what is implicated need not be coded.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

But here the predictions have not yet been worked out in any detail. Take online utterance comprehension: the prediction clearly is that GCIs should be available early, before full sentence-meaning is computed, because of their association with linguistic expressions and their alternates. There is very little psycholinguistic work directly addressed to implicature, and still less of this concerns online processing, but one may hope for rapid progress here. 3 One might also expect Gricean inferences to play a significant role in hypothesis formation about the meaning of linguistic expressions during language acquisition. The hypothesis would be that children would have the principles early but apply them incorrectly because of incomplete control of the relevant semantic fields (and this seems generally correct; see Jackson 1981; Jackson and Jacobs 1982; Clark 1993, 1997). Finally, GCI theory should make interesting predictions about language change (as in the hypothesis in chapter 4 about the evolution of A-first from B-first anaphoric systems). Because GCIs are regularly associated with linguistic expressions, they may easily be misanalyzed by both theorist and language learner as part of the coded content. On the other hand, the general redundancy constraint (i.e., what is implicated need not be coded) may be expected to put a brake on such tendencies for GCIs to end up as part of the conventional meaning of expressions. The present theory suggests that I-inferences might be primary engines of change, because inferences to the stereotype will reflect changes in sociocultural environment. M-inferences to the complement of I-inferences would then consequently be shifted also. But Q-inferences might be less likely to become conventionalized on the grounds that they arise from constrained sets of salient alternates, where change in the meaning of one member would have immediate implications for the understandings of the other members, the whole set acting as a constraint on change within. These tendencies seem consistent with what is known (see König and Traugott 1988, Traugott 1998).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|In sum, GCI theory makes widescale predictions about the association of presumptive meanings with specific forms, and thus crosslinguistic predictions about a myriad of such particulars as lexicalization constraints on quantifiers, the kinds of predicates allowing Neg-raising, the semantic generality of anaphoric expressions, the tendency for switchreference systems to lack strict coding of disjoint subjects, the rhetorical import of periphrasis or double negations, and so on.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Wilson and Sperber (1986, 1991: 583) have argued that pragmatics amounts to nothing more than central reasoning processes applied to linguistic stimuli: "Grammar is a special-purpose modular system; pragmatics is not a cognitive system at all. There are no special-purpose pragmatic principles, maxims, strategies or rules; pragmatics is simply the domain in which grammar, logic and memory interact." They go on to suggest that "many linguists have assumed without question that speakers of English know a pragmatic code, analogous to a grammar, which enables them to recover the intended interpretation. . . . They have assumed in other words that pragmatics is a module, an extension of the grammar" (1991: 584). There is little doubt that they had Gricean theories of the present sort in mind as the target of these remarks.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|The present theory has indeed proposed "special-purpose pragmatic principles," but even here, just as Grice did with his maxims, we hope to show that such principles follow from rational design characteristics (as outlined in chapter 1). Regardless of our success in that, the other charges certainly miss the target. GCI theory does not confuse inference under heuristics with decoding (indeed the Relevance-theory claim that interpretation involves the recovery of a single message under deduction seems closer to a decoding view). Nor is there any assumption that pragmatics is a module in the Fodorean sense of an encapsulated processing module. However, GCI theory does suppose that there is a body of knowledge and practice concerned with the _use_ of language. This knowledge crucially involves metalinguistic knowledge about the structure of the lexiconspecifically, knowledge about the structuring of semantic fields, the availability of alternate expressions, subjective assessments of frequency and markedness of specific expressions, knowledge about the stereotypical associations of linguistic concepts in the speech community, mutual assumption of principles for resolving conflicts between inferences, and so on. It also involves mutual awareness of the central heuristics and a crucial understanding that recovering meaningnn involves solving coordination problems under those heuristics. These background assumptions about the nature of communication radically change the nature of the reasoning: if I see a man moving a hand in front of his face, the kind of reasoning involved in trying to guess what he is trying to hit versus what\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

But it does suggest that there are specific kinds of inferential analysis done on the decoded content of utterances that are not applied to our analysis of other things in the world, including any other noncommunicative aspect of human behavior. Because (as I have argued) this special mode of reasoning yielding default, defeasible inferences must interdigitate with another kind of reasoning that yields monotonic inferences, pragmatic reasoning of this sort must be organized in such a way that it can interact with the results of semantic processing. We can, if we like, think about pragmatic processing as specific kinds of subroutines that are called from time to time. To that extent, pragmatics can be said to be a component in an overall theory of grammar, without claiming that all the processes involved have exclusively linguistic uses.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Sperber and Wilson also assume, along with many cognitive linguists, that the semantic component outputs (possibly fragmentary) representations that are directly in the "language of thought." This is improbable, even assuming there is one such thing (most cognitive scientists assume with good reason that there are multiple conceptual representational systems). Semantic representations are going to be much too closely tied to the properties of language in general (e.g., the linearity due to the medium) and to the structure and content of specific languages (e.g., specific grammatical categories and constructions) to make this plausible. Rather, it seems that semantic representations are likely to be intermediate formats, which interface with linguistic form at one end and general conception (and indeed further specialized formats) at the other (Bierwisch 1996; Levinson 1997; see Jackendoff 1996a: 546547 for discussion). If pragmatic inferencing is working on semantic representations rather than conceptual structures (which must, after all, include imagistic representations and the like), then that is another reason to think that pragmatic reasoning is language-specialized.

Not at all: rational speakers meannn both what they say (except in nonliteral uses of language) and what that saying implicates; different levels of meaning all come under the umbrella of meaningnn. Grice (1989: 8891, 117137) himself made a number of distinctions within meaningnnfor example, the distinctions between the _applied timeless meaning of an utterance-type_ (capturing disambiguations), the _occasion-meaning of an utterance-type_ (capturing what the speaker means by the use of the words), and _utterer's occasion-meaning_ (capturing what the speaker intended). Although the distinctions are tortuous, I think that GCIs would fall somewhere between the first two distinctions (Grice indicates that idioms would be part of applied timeless meaning, and what the words are used to mean falls within occasion-meaning). Because GCIs are associated with utterance-types, they can be accessed without considering the utterer's occasion-meaning, and it is thus legitimate to view them neutrally, both from the speaker's and addressee's perspectives.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|A second issue concerns whether GCIs are just too subliminal, as it were, to count as implicatures. In chapter 3, I discussed possible terminological distinctions (of the implicature, impliciture, and explicature sort) in the area between what is said and what is not said at all but implicated only. I concluded that boundaries are here hard to draw, precisely because of the way in which the very same inferences may or may not "intrude" into the meanings of complex constructions, and can be phrased in different ways by the analyst. All the authors there surveyed presume that the inferential mechanisms would be essentially the same in all cases, and I have made the same assumption, and argued therefore that there is no clear way to make such distinctions. This may be wrong. It may be, for example, that the inferential procedures underlying I-inferences are sufficiently distinct to belong to an entirely different genusafter all, compared to the M- and Q-inferences they are much less metalinguistic in character, and much more dependent on common presumptions about the world (i.e., stereotypes). We may expect that future research will expose a much more detailed typology of pragmatic inference than we currently have at our disposal. But such a typology should be based precisely on the underlying inferential procedures and corresponding distinctions between the properties of inferences.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

The idea is that anaphoric potential relies crucially on semantic generality, in line with the I-principle, and that the intricate division of labor between NP-types in different loci is explained by the complex interactions of Q-, M-, and I-inferences, governed by their projection properties. Such moves have been suggested before, but in general the attempts have been rejected by syntacticians on the grounds that they simply don't get down to a sufficient level of detail to be interesting. I have tried to show that the detail both intralinguistically and crosslinguistically, synchronically and diachronically, fits the broad outlines of a pragmatic account. At the same time, different possible analyses, with different degrees of pragmatic reduction, have been sketched to show that the general promise of such an approach does not lie in a particular analysis but in the general way in which it interdigitates with semantic and syntactic accounts.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Chapter 4 suggests a reanalysis of phenomena that have been thought about as purely syntacticthat is, a shifting of the burden of explanation. In the same way, many of the inferences discussed in chapter 2 have been thought to be semanticthat is, part of the coded content of expressions; here, an attempt is made to shift the burden off the coded semantics into pragmatics. These are issues about the division of labor between explanatory devices, and of course there will be plenty of room for further argumentation. What I hope to have established is that GCIs have just the right properties to assume part of this burden.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Chapter 3 introduces more radical issues about the relation of this branch of pragmatics to linguistic theory. I have argued that GCIs force a reconstrual of the semantics/pragmatics interface. Instead of a simple feed-out, feed-in model of the interface, which continues to be assumed in much work that is close to GCI theory (like Relevance theory), I have argued that something more complex is required. But not much more complex: what I have suggested is that we divorce the issue of representation from the issue of what processes or components contribute to that representation. 4 In that way we have a level of representation, say as in DRT, to which the semantics contributes entailed conditions, whereas default inferences contribute pragmatic content marked as subject to later cancellation, and the whole structure can be semantically interpreted in the normal way and can then be further enriched by additional pragmatic\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Such a model seems to escape with ease the chicken-and-egg problems (of pragmatic contributions to semantic content) that assail the classical input/output model of the relation of semantics to pragmatics. At the same time, it keeps separate the two crucially distinct kinds of informationthe defeasible and the indefeasible content.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|There would be other ways to think about this model. One could equally view it in the following way: GCI pragmatics is a theory that inter alia maps (coded) semantic representations onto (enriched) semantic representations. Semantics is now understood to do two things: map syntactic structures onto (coded) semantic representations, and (enriched) semantic representations onto propositions. Pragmatics likewise not only maps initial semantic representations into enriched ones, but (if one likes) propositions into additional propositions. And the two processes, each masters of their own (indefeasible or defeasible) mode of inference, interleave. Thus the general picture is simple enough, although we cannot rule out additional interactionsfor example, the role of pragmatics in extracting disambiguated (coded) semantic representations out of syntactic structures in the first place.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|This picture though does change the way we think about (coded) semantic content. The more power there is in the pragmatic theory, the less rich such coded content has to be (a point well made by Sperber and Wilson 1986). Other work in pragmatics and semantics is now converging on the idea that such coded content may be abstract in the extreme and may fail to determine anything like a logical form. This opens up intriguing questions about what exactly the shape of such representations is. There are questions both about what we may call structural factors (the syntax, as it were, of semantic representations), and content factors (representations of lexemes in the object language). Many have assumed that the structural properties of semantic representations are logic-like. But there are reasons for doubt. Atlas (1989) argues persuasively that logical negation is not part of our representation of meaning and that negation is scope-indeterminate. Scope-free semantic representations have been proposed by a number of authors (e.g., Bach 1982), and the motivations are obvious. Hobbs (1996: 58) notes that a sentence like (1) has 120 possible scopings:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(1) In most democratic countries most politicians can fool most of the people on almost every issue most of the time.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Similar problems assail other kinds of structural ambiguity (e.g., PP-attachment as in _Look at the man with a telescope_), and rather than posit a combinatorial explosion of readings, it makes good sense to consider the possibility that the structure is indeterminate or underspecified (see Matthews 1981, Van Deemter and Peters 1995). The need for a pragmatically informed way of building structure is particularly clear in the case of ellipsis (Kempson 1996).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Encoded lexical meanings may also be skeletal. Some authors have arrived at this conclusion just by considering the apparently limitless range of uses of lexemes, often crossing various syntactic categories (Ruhl 1989), or by documenting our ability to create what are clearly nonce uses (Clark 1983, Clark and Clark 1979, Nunberg 1995). It has also been long noticed that senses get specialized in verbal context, which argues against both polysemy and classical conceptions of compositionality. Ross (1981), for example, showed how the meanings of lexemes in construction with one another alter each other's senses (consider the meanings of _on_ in _barnacles on the hull, soap opera on TV, opinion on the matter, man on the moon, cars on the move,_ and so forth). More recently, these issues have come center stage in computational linguistics. Pustejovsky (1995), for example, shows how "co-compositional" effects can be achieved by having semantically general specifications in one lexical item be filled in by semantic specificity in another, supplemented with pragmatic presumptions (so that _John is enjoying the book_ suggests that the enjoyment comes from reading it, whereas _John is enjoying the ice cream_ suggests another kind of pleasurable activity). As a consequence, we need semantically general senses that will often be specialized by contextual or pragmatic factors rather than intratextual ones. But not every combination of words and background understandings can be forced into a meaningful collocation (compare _a sad day_ vs. _*an afraid day_). Consequently, Pustejovsky (1995) argues that we have to find a middle ground between senseenumerative lexicons on the one hand, and fully unconstrained pragmatic determinations of sense on the other.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Current work on semantic generality and underspecification is generally conservative, modifying and relaxing older logical formalisms and sense-representations in the direction of more open structures. But we cannot rule out the possibility that much more radical rethinkings of the concepts of semantic representation are in order (Atlas 1989).

Here a developed theory of presumptive meanings may play a crucial role: the more that can be said about default pragmatic inferences, the more we can guess about the nature of the semantic representations that must support them. Thus we can make significant progress on these issues only if we work simultaneously on both semantic and pragmatic theory. The central contribution of GCI theory is to suggest specific ways in which, given an underspecified or indeterminate semantic representation of a sentence-meaning, the possible interpretations are not equipollentthere is systematic biasing of interpretations, even before specific contextual influences have come into play. It is because of this predicted biasing that GCI theory, unlike nonce-theories of inference, puts systematic constraints on a theory of underlying representations.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|It was Grice's personal goal to try to build a synthesis between the formalist and functionalist views of language (with Russell and Strawson, respectively, as prototypes).

I have tried to advance this same goal on more thoroughly linguistic, and weedy, turf. The theoretical synthesis may or may not be successful, but that is not ultimately the most important issue, which is to keep those prominent pragmatic features in theoretical play. For as Grice (1987: 379) remarked in a somewhat different context, "The continuation of progress depends to a large extent on the possibility of 'saving the phenomena'."\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

The problem is that, whereas the speaker reasoned from an intention to a verbal means of achieving that intention, one can never reason back from conclusions to the premises that produced themfor the simple reason that there are always infinite candidates. Because, as a matter of fact, we do seem to make correct inferences of this kind, there has to be some heuristic limitation of the problem space. I believe that these heuristics are of distinct kinds: the sort explored in GCI theory, for example, as well as the different kind explored in the sequential analysis of discourse, which yields PCIs.

An important departure from the classical Gricean account is sketched in Atlas and Levinson 1981, where it is pointed out that it is the structure of the semantical representation as well as the truth conditions that are the basis for the calculation of implicatures. Manner implicatures can also generally be read off the semantical representation (e.g., _p_ and ¬¬ _p_ will have the same truth conditions, but ¬¬ _p_ will M-implicate that the stereotypical exemplication associated with _p_ is not intended), although in some lexical/morphological oppositions sheer markedness is the operative factor.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|3.

This construal of Relevance (quite unlike the Sperber and Wilson (1986) informational version) correctly captures our pretheoretical intuitions that relevance is about connectedness and collaborative activity, as I outlined in Levinson 1987a. It is also along the lines that Grice intended: the tying of relevance to particular plans and goals is very clear in Grice 1989 (p. 222), hence his objection (p. 371372) to the Sperber and Wilson conception. Plan-reconstruction accounts of particularized implicature are now standard in the AI literature (see, e.g., Cohen, Morgan, and Pollack 1990, Green and Carberry 1993).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|5. Compare for example these recent comments: "His best known examples are particularized implicatures; the discussion of generalized implicatures is restricted to a few cases; and there is no evidence that he saw the distinction as theoretically significant" (Sperber and Wilson 1987: 748) and "The traditional distinction between generalized and particularized implicature is a false one, an artifact of the inventiveness of analystsor lack thereof" (Hirschberg 1985: 42). Yet Grice's work on implicature opens with the issue of whether there is a way to account for the _systematic_ divergences between the logical connectives and natural-language connectives (the issue which motivated his further development of the theory of implicature; see Grice 1989: 374). In addition, there is every reason to think that he was especially interested in the GCIs because they offered some kind of evidence for the way in which utterer's meaning might become associated with expression-meaning (the theory of implicature was a preamble to _that_ theory; see Grice 1989: chap. 5 and 6).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|6. This makes remarks like the following inapt: "The distinction between 'generalized' and 'particularized' conversational implicature is not represented in this diagram [presented in Neale's paper] because it is theoretically inert (for Grice)" (Neale 1992: 524, note 18).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|7.

The classical Gricean or Radical Pragmatics tradition took this semantically broad meaning to be identical to the weaker or less specified of the meanings exhibited by the expression in question (e.g., _some_ would have a lexical content glossable roughly as 'at least some', which is overlayed by the GCI '(and) not all'. Atlas 1984a, and following him others, have argued that we should not presume this uniformly: we need to entertain the possibility that the lexical content is not to be equated with the weaker meaning but indifferent between the weaker and the stronger. On his account, we need to distinguish, as candidates for the lexical content, between a semantically broad but weakly specific meaning on the one hand, and a semantically general meaning on the other.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|9.

Speaker-meaning is here understood exclusivelythat is, as speaker-meaning minus sentence-meaning (of course in Grice's theory of communication, both "what is said" and "what is implicated" are _ceteris paribus_ part of meaningnn, and thus included in speaker-meaning). Similarly, I shall use utterance-type-meaning as a shorthand for meaning that is not conventional meaning and not _just_ speaker meaning (although following the Gricean scheme the speaker means it) but is suggested by the utterance structure.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|11. For Austin (1962), the perlocutionary act was a residual category that he was keen to detach from the illocutionary act, the main focus of his interest, and it was certainly broader and less well-defined than speaker-meaning. Nevertheless, this is the Austinian category into which Gricean particularized implicatures would fall: his prototype was an intended effect on an audience which relates to what is said at most obliquely (1962: 101), so that one can say "by saying _x,_ I did _y_" (even the terminology shows the kinship between Austinian and Gricean thought; see Grice 1986). Searle (1986: 210) for one holds that "Grice argued that the intended effects of meaning were what Austin called perlocutionary effects."\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|12. Bach developed the notion specifically to account for explicit performatives being primarily constatives while standardly (but indirectly) performing the action they named.

There is nothing easy, of course, about the notion of sentence-meaning.

Uncontroversial it might seem, but Chomsky of course differs. He has argued (in, e.g., the 1981 Darwin lecture on "Language and communication," or _The Minimalist Program,_ 1995: 18) that the mismatch between syntactic structures and parsing strategies points to a more haphazard history of our communicational abilities.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|18. A range of measurements for different languages from different authors has been given by Laver (1994: 541544). Not all the estimates are in agreement. But for English at least, the following facts look solid: in 20 hours of spontaneous English, the fastest rate was 5.4 syllables/sec. or 13.4 segments/sec. Practiced maximal rates for English peak, on optimal segments, at 8.2 syllables/sec., estimated to be a physiologically conditioned maximum.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|19.

Calvert (1986: 178) notes a normal speaking rate of 10 sounds (segments) per second, with an effective maximum of 15 sounds/sec., and adds: "While we typically produce speech at 10 sounds/second, we can understand it at as much as 30 sounds/second when paying careful attention" (quoted in Laver 1994: 543).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|21. This kind of argument from design was a favorite device of Grice's, most evident in his seminars (see Grandy and Warner 1986: 31ff).

Even from a recipient's perspective, inference seems cheapfor example, there is no time advantage for resolving unambiguous pronominal anaphora over "ambiguous" zero-anaphors (Marslen-Wilson and Tyler, 1980). There may be additional virtues of inference: inferred messages often seem to have greater impact than coded ones, as long noted in traditional rhetoric.

The information-theoretic value of such a heuristic can easily be appreciated by comparing it to the compression algorithm based on the idea "only describe what has changed" with the decompression corrollary "what isn't mentioned hasn't changed." The heuristic may also be related to the closed-world assumption used to reason in AI databases: if there's no information about whether _x_ is a P, assume that x is not a P (Reiter 1978).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|25.

The information-theoretic value of this heuristic can be seen by comparison to frames or data structures with inheritance by default, much used in AI (whereby, e.g., if _x_ is a bird, and birds generally fly, _x_ can be assumed to fly). Such inferences are potentially hazardous because they may be wrong, but where there is a tacit communicational convention to speak in such a way that they can be assumed to be true unless there is explicit warning to the contrary, the danger is removed. Various formalizations of such default reasoning systems may be found in Ginsberg 1987.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|27. In the simplest case, ranked informativeness can be characterized in terms of unilateral entailment.

Conflicting inferences would not alone justify the designation "projection problem," which has come to refer to how the inferences of complex expressions may not just be the sum of the inferences due to the parts. But GCIs of complex expressions involve just this kind of problem.

Simplifications include: (i) Q inferences may be based on sets other than informationally asymmetrical ones, (ii) I inferences may have other than stereotypical bases, (iii) the overiding or canceling of GCIs probably depends also on the incremental order of clauses, and certainly Relevance PCIs may override all GCIs.

Some philosophers (e.g., Harman 1986: chap. 1), Kent Bach points out to me, insist on a distinction between reasoning and argument (in the sense of proof in a system), but those interested in capturing properties of human reasoning inevitably think about reasoning in terms of systems of inference, which are the only tools we have in which to model reasoning. Still, if one insists on this distinction, defeasibility is a property of reasoning and nonmonotonicity is a property of argument systems. Further, the exercise in this section may then be beside the point: reasoning is an activity that may employ fragments of argument, jumps of intuition, violent revisions of belief. Reasoning is an activity, not a system, and different modes of reasoning cannot be captured in terms of distinct systems.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|31.

Implicature cancellation would then be exactly like having taken the wrong horn of an ambiguity, and being jolted by a later context into backtracking and taking the other horn. But there is no evidence for this and rather a lot against it, including the absence of garden-path phenomena in implicature resolution (compare, e.g., the cancellation of the implicature in "John stole some of the money, and possibly all of it," where there is no gardenpath phenomenon, to "John didn't steal some of the money, he stole ALL of it," where there is). Another problem for the premise-swapping account is that there is in fact no contradiction in an utterance like "The facts are that John stole some of the money, if not all of it. In fact, my own belief is that he didn't steal it all," where a scalar implicature is generated, then suspended by a clausal implicature, but then the very same suspended inference is asserted. No serious attempt has ever been made to explain all these well-known problems by the few (like Sperber and Wilson 1986) who continue to maintain a deductive account (see Levinson 1989).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|32.

Actually, this account departs slightly from Gazdar's characterization.

Perhaps this is what McCarthy (1980, 1986: 147) had in mind when he wrote of his theory of nonmonotonic reasoning using circumscription: "In puzzles, circumscription seems to be a rule of inference, while in life it is a rule of conjecture" (where by "puzzle" he meant a linguistically posed problem).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|39. Bach (1984) has, for example, suggested that default reasoning in general (e.g., about the physical world) might be based on rather simple rules of thumbfor example, 'if it seems that _p,_ infer _p, unless_ a reason to the contrary occurs to one'. Here the weight of keeping reasoning reasonable falls on some special, yet to be elucidated, detection procedures for counterexamples (p. 45).

Some authors (e.g., Searle 1979) doubt that there is much value in a notion of utterance-token meaning, on the grounds that an utterance-token has the same semantic content as its type, and its import as a token is best captured in terms of psychological notions (i.e., in terms of speaker-meaning).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|41. GCIs are of course not untypical at all, if the phenomena surveyed in chapter 2 are anything to go by, and as I have argued they were certainly the ultimate targets of Grice's investigations. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that GCI theory was never intended to replace the need for a theory of PCIs, although it may give clues to how such a more general theory might be usefully developed (see Hirschberg 1985). A great deal of misunderstanding has been generated by the failure to see the need for the third level in the theory of communicationnamely, a theory of utterance-type meaningand the failure to appreciate the very limited ambitions of GCI theory.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|42. The critiques of Relevance theory center on getting any kind of predictive measure out of the theory (for a sympathetic attempt, which ends up adopting an account Sperber and Wilson (1986: 130) reject, see Poznanski, 1992: 12944). The essence of the problem was given by Zipf's (1949: 34) maxim of the "singleness of the superlative"maximizing the inferences while minimizing the effort is a double superlative that "renders the problem completely meaningless."\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|43.

The need for a theory of preferred interpretation in the theory of communication is perhaps just a reflex of a need for a new kind of theoretical object in the social sciences generallynamely, the maxim, the preferential mode of behavior. Bourdieu (1977) has argued eloquently for this kind of construct (his "habitus"), distinct from the notion of norm or rule (with its strict complementarity between permitted/prohibited or grammatical/ungrammatical), but capable of generating regularities in behavior. It is the _preferred ways_ of making bread, of cooking leeks, of talking at dinner, or of marrying kin, passing on property, making a living, and so on, that constitute a culture, just as much as the jural rules that have been the major focus of anthropological research. I am chagrined to have to acknowledge that John Haviland pointed this out me almost a decade ago before I could see any sense at all in it.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Chapter 2\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|1.

Atlas 1993a elaborates Grice's (1989: 42) objectionnamely, that this amounts to nothing more than a restatement of the maxim.

The reference (Grice 1989: 26) is to Kant's _Critique of Pure Reason_ (1781: 70; 1933: 107). Irrespective of Kant, the four central Aristotelian categories of Quantity, Quality, Relation, and Action (Manner or Modality) have long been central in English philosophy of language. See, for example John Wilkins' 1641 _Essay towards a real character, and a philosophical language_ (Eco 1997: 240).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

I have phrased the principles in terms of a speaker's maxim and an addressee's corollary for reasons of perspicuity. They could be phrased more neutrally as heuristics to which both speaker and addressee are mutually oriented, as I sketched in chapter 1. There is however a special onus on the speaker: he or she will be understood _ceteris paribus_ to have meant what (to employ the legal jargon) "any reasonable man" would have meant by the choice of expression that he or she used under these heuristics.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|4.

As already mentioned, "_U" +>_ '_p_' designates that uttering _U_ implicates _p,_ or more exactly an utterance of the type _U_ engenders _ceteris paribus_ the generalized conversational implicature _p._ I shall however be loose for the sake of brevity and reduce clauses to the relevant expressions; thus whereas one should say: 'a sentence of the form "Some j'd" +> 'Not all j'd', I will sometimes reduce this to the statement: "Some" +> 'Not all'. This is indeed loose talk. Where important, I distinguish between the implicated content alone (designated by +>) and the (relevant) implicated content together with what is 'said' (designated ++>).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|6. These utilize the epistemic logic formulated by Hintikka (1962).

For example, whereas "John has three children" may have the weaker implicature 'the speaker doesn't know that John has four', "I have three children" clearly carries the stronger 'the speaker knows he doesn't have four'. First-person statements can then often be expected to carry the stronger inference.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|8. There are however one or two distinct signs that the weak epistemic modification is not correct for the scalar implicatures. For example, from the perhaps rather special scale <_know, believe>_, an utterance of the form "I believe that _p_" will then generate an implicature 'The speaker doesn't know that/whether the speaker knows that _p_', which is incoherent or incorrect (whereas the stronger form 'The speaker knows that it is not the case that the speaker knows that _p'_ is fine).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|9. But Hirschberg (1985: 81) represents this as ~BEL(S, 'All came') in a three-valued logic (so ~ BEL(_S, p_) ranges over cases where S believes _p false_ and where _S_ does not know whether _p_ is true).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|10. Jay Atlas clarified the point to me thus: asserting a weak scalar "A(W)" implicates _~A_(_S_) because the addressee infers from "A(W)" that the speaker is not in an epistemic position to assert "A(S)." The speaker intends that ~_A_(_S_) is recognized to be consistent with what the speaker knows, this to be the grounds for adding plain ~_A_(_S_) to the common ground.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|11. The essence of the problem is that we need a wider range of distinct epistemic commitments than are offered by duals of _K_ and _P._ The Horn-scale inferences are in fact among the strongest commitments that can be implicated; much weaker suggestions also arise, as I show later on.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|12.

Thus _Kp_ can be read 'The speaker believes _p'_, and _Kp_ _º ~P ~ p,_ where _~P_ ~ _p_ is read 'it is not consistent with what the speaker believes that _not-p'_. _K_ and _P_ are thus related like and fnbsp; in, on Gazdar's 1979 formulation, an S4 modal logic.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|14.

Van der Auwera (1995) attacks this lexicalization constraint because he wishes to enlarge the scope of scalar implicature to account, for example, for conditional perfection, (in the current framework, this will be given a completely different account in terms of the I principle). In fact, the degree of lexicalization of scalar items is crucial for understanding the complexities of scalar interpretations. The point is made clearly by Horn (1989: 497499), who notes that it is precisely because there is no lexicalization of, for example, 'not everybody' that "Everybody didn't come" has an ambiguity of scope. Matsumoto (1995: 45) also attacks the lexicalization constraint in order to extend the scope of scalar implicature, even though his own theory of the bounding of scalar implicatures by a "conversational condition" (to the effect that there should be no _other_ reason why the speaker might have avoided a stronger statement) is in fact more in line with the account given here and the brevity condition of Levinson (1983: 135).

This is related to the restriction noted by Barwise and Cooper (1981) that monotone-increasing and monotone-decreasing quantifiers may not be conjoined, thus _*Few students and most faculty came,_ a constraint that can be described alternatively as 'Do not mix quantifiers from positive and negative scales' (see Horn 1989: 245ff).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|21.

How do we determine this horizontal alignment? Partly in terms of which side of the tolerance line they fall. But partly by Horn's stipulation that a quantifier Q and its internal negation Q. . .~ are linked by a horizontal line. Suppose then we wish to know whether _most_ has as a (sub)contrary _few:_ we know that _most_ is intolerant, so can only have a contrary; so if _few_ is to be a candidate, it must be intolerant, which in fact it is (_*Few of them came but few did not come_). _Most men came_ has as contrary _Most men did not come;_ so we can use the suspension tests to see whether _few_ is ranked higher or lower on the negative scale than _most._ . ._not,_ and what we find is that we can say _Most men didn't come, and in fact few came_ but not ?? _Few came and in fact most men didn't come,_ which suggests that _few_ is higher on the scale and thus not a true contrary for _most._ In fact, on Horn's arithmetic model (sub)contraries Q and Q. . .~ should be so arranged that they sum to zero (i.e., are linked by a horizontal line).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|23.

Some scholars consider that there are a number of other fatal flaws in the implicature account of numeral expressions. For example, Seuren (1998: 409) thinks that _exactly three_ would then incoherently mean 'exactly at least three'; but the solution is given by Kadmon (1987: chap. 4), who shows how an 'at least' semantics is compatible with modifiers like _exactly_ (and nonredundant with _at least_) within a DRT framework. Essentially the solution works by treating _three men_ like an indefinite phrase: _three_ introduces an exact cardinality, but there is no commitment that that the set of three men is exhaustive. She points out that such a view is compatible with any further constraints on interpretation that may arise from predicative uses or rhematic positioning (an observation that has led other scholars, like Scharten (1997), to abandon the implicature account).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|27.

This may be an over-simple analysis for English.

Alternatively, Larry Horn suggests to me, one could claim that in the stereotypical case one does not succeed without trying, and thus _succeed_ I-implicates 'try'. But just how the generalized implicatures of expressions should play a principled role in the construction of scales has never been worked out (indeed for arguments against the transitivity of implicatures, see Atlas 1984b: 359, 372373).

The classical theory of scalar implicature had also assumed partial orderings (Gazdar 1979: 58, n. 22).

Burton-Roberts (1984) offers a serious account of the pseudo-scale <_necessarily p, p>._ It was the need to rule out such absurdities that led Atlas and Levinson (1981) to propose the lexicalization and aboutness constraints, which require salient lexical alternates about the same relations.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|39.

At first sight it seems that these clausal implicatures might be reduced to scalar implicature, especially if (as argued, e.g., by Soames (1982)) one abandons for scalar implicatures the strong epistemic modification (_K ~ p_) in favor of the weaker modification (~ _K ~ p_) associated by Gazdar with clausal implicatures. But intuitively, from the assertion of _p or q_ more is (generally) implicated than uncertainty about the applicability of the conjunctionnamely, uncertainty about both individual propositions _p_ and _q._ So alternatively (as Horn has suggested to me) we could claim that it is the opposition between the assertion of _p_ alone and the disjunction that is responsible for that further inference. But this cannot be achieved by a scalar inference because a scale of the sort <_p, p or q>_ would fail the lexicalization constraintessential to fend off other pseudo-scales like <![square.gif](../Images/48ba85e578be146d280e6410cad080ba.gif)_p, p>._ What the concept of a clausal implicature captures is indeed this opposition between the assertion of _p_ and the assertion of something that fails to entail _p,_ but the account relies on a constructional asymmetry between constructions that entail _p_ and those that fail to do so. Overall, I still find Gazdar's concept essential.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|41.

For example, because of the stereotype that gold is yellow, _white gold_ or _blue gold_ suggests a substance other than gold (cf. _black gold_ for 'oil'), although jewellers in fact deal in both, and pure gold is white, uncontaminated with copper (see also Putnam 1975: 250).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|45. A formal machinery that might be adapted for characterizing such a notion was explored originally in Carnap's (1947) concept of _intensional isomorphism:_ to capture the fact that say ~ (_~ p_) and _p_ have the same intension but not the same meaning, we need a notion of structured intensions in which they may be seen to be nonisomorphic (see, e.g., Lewis 1972: 182186).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Those who believe in notions like explicature (Sperber and Wilson 1986) or impliciture (Bach 1994) will find in these characterizations of I-implicature further reason for suspicions that many GCIs are really instances of these preimplicatural enrichments of conventional meaning into something closer to what the speaker intended.

Van der Auwera notes rightly that, in earlier formulations of the constraint, Atlas and Levinson (1981) required _equal_ lexicalization of expressions in a scale and that negative scales (like <_none, not all>_) are then counterexamples. The correct formulation of the constraint is that the stronger element must be _equally or more lexicalized_ than the weaker element. The properties of negative scales are now correctly accommodated. But for the psychological reasons I discuss in section 2.2.2 above, it may be better anyway to think of negative scales as introduced by meta-rule from the positive scales. Either way, the lexicalization constraint now escapes his strictures. However, in an interesting observation (1995: 5), he claims that Chinese does lexicalize 'iff' and 'if' to approximately the same degree, and if this is indeed so, the current theory predicts that the consequent Q-implicature from the _if_-expression should defeat conditional perfection, because if one meant the biconditional one should have said it.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|50. Exactly how these utterances get read as conditionals is another matter; it has much to do with the illocutionary force of advice/suggestion associated with this use of the imperative, constituting a minor sentence-type (see Sadock and Zwicky 1985).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|51. What I said was if _p_ I-implicates _q,_ then _q_ must entail _p,_ but that in both Q and I-induced implicatures this is only one of the conditions (Levinson 1987a: 74). What I should have said is "If _p_ I-*implicates _q,_ then _q_ must entail _p._ However, in neither the Q- nor the I-induced *implicatures is it [this necessary condition] anything like a _sufficient_ condition." I would have thought that the second sentence made it sufficiently clear that the entailment condition between *implicatures and what is said holds for both species of *implicature. The reason that Carston (1995) attaches so much importance to this is that she hopes to make a distinction between _explicature_ and _implicature_ that hinges on implicatures not entailing explicatures.

Larry Horn points out to me that two indicatives can have a conditional interpretation in English, too, as in _You want it, you got it_ (especially with a rising intonation on the first clause). But the imperative plus indicative construction clearly has (as he points out) more conventional conditional force, as indicated by the negative polarity forms in, for example, _Take any of that money and you're dead._\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|57. This form of incremental processing is incorporated into formal semantic models like DRT. Note too that presuppositions of the consequent can be asserted in antecedents but not vice versa (as in _If John has children, John's children must have black hair too;_ cf. _John has children. John's children must have black hair too._)\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|58. Why is this contrast between _and_ and nothing (parataxis) not obvious in English? It is obscured by a number of factors, such as prosodic marking, which can turn a paratactic association into an unrelated list, and syntactic gapping and reduction, which take the place of parataxis to suggest close association between events.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|59. However, verb omission or gapping proper in English actually inhibits a causal reading (Levin and Prince 1986; Levin 1987): _A man was shot and a woman was arrested_ can be read as a causally related sequence, but _A man was shot and a woman arrested_ suggests a mere list. Clearly, gapping is restricted to sentences with parallel structure and thus suggests parallel, perhaps simultaneous, events.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|60.

There are exceptions like _hot,_ which participates both in the scale <_hot, warm>_ (and its negative corollary <_not-warm, not-hot>_) and in the I-implicature from its negation to its antonym _cold._ The prediction from my theory is that "It is not hot" should Q +> 'It is warm', for this should defeat the inconsistent I-implicature 'It is cold'.

In general, iconic factors enter into the present account in two ways: simple, brief, unmarked expressions warrant maximally cohesive, stereotypical readings, by virtue of mutual attention to the I-principle; and marked expressions indicate the complementary interpretations by the M-principle that is about to be explained. Iconicity itself is _sui generis,_ but the exploitation of it by virtue of mutual orientation to such licensing principles converts it into a matter of communicative expectation and thus a pattern of generalized conversational implicature. Hence it should occasion no surprise that many of the factors detailed in Haiman's (1985a) notes on the iconicity of grammar surface again in a theory of GCIs.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|66. The intoxicating I-implicatures of _drink_ are now long conventionalized and recognized in dictionaries as a separate sense, an autohyponym. In contrast, the sexist I-implicatures of _secretary_ or _nurse_ are, argues Horn, matters of social rather than linguistic convention. Certainly, I-implicatures seed the crystalization of semantic change, and one can expect to see gradations of conventionalization. But the distinction may not be so easy, because by changing social conventions one can change linguistic ones: in British English _vicar_ and _vicaress_ meant, respectively, male priest in the Church of England and his spouse, until the recent innovation of female priests.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|67. If this is so, notice that the child's task is greatly complicated by the tendency for common vocabulary items to have irregular or suppletive forms instead of regular derivations, as in the strong verbs in Germanic, with _went_ instead of _goed._\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|68. Like many observations useful to the GCI theorists, these derive from Generative Semantics, which attempted to "syntacticize" many acute observations about meaning. The orphans of that theory, including the one discussed here or Neg-raising discussed previously, can in many cases be happily adopted within GCI theory. Newmeyer (1980), Harris (1993), and Seuren (1998: 502526) offer accounts of the Generative Semantics movement and reference to central works.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|69. Note that the prior existence of _sad,_ following the blocking principle mentioned earlier, requires that _unhappy_despite being read as a contrary of _happy_somehow means something different from _sad;_ the solution with this (and other cases like _unintelligent_) is to associate the derived form with a slightly less extreme value on the scale (see Horn 1989: 279280).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|70.

As mentioned, Soames (1982) suggests that both scalar and clausal implicatures should have the weak epistemic modification, of the form ¬_Kp._ Then inconsistencies between scalars and clausal implicatures do not seem to arise and one could dispense with the relative ordering of incrementation. But in fact this proposal doesn't capture the intuitive difference in epistemic content between the two typesit is the epistemic uncertainty that is precisely the content of the clausal inferences but not the scalars, which is why I have not followed him here.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|78. This does remove one of the outstanding differences between presupposition projection and implicature projection, presuppositions by definition not being blocked by negation. In the case of scalar implicatures, the reversal of the scale comes to the same thing as blocking, but in the case of other implicatures, their behavior can now be seen to be the same as presuppositions.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|79.

Theoretically arbitrary distance has to be tempered by performance facts.

Horn (1989: 145), having specified antinomic Q- and R-principles of his own, notes briefly in a column detailing the properties of conversational implicata "Projection properties unclear, since conversational implicatures 'may be indeterminate' (Grice); but cf. Gazdar 1979, Hirschberg 1985." Kent Bach points out to me that one might hold that it is not the job of the GCI theorist to resolve the projection problem anyway. The GCI theorist's job might be complete when the _default_ inferences are predicted, the rest of the story being left to the PCI theorist, because projection properties will be a story about particular constructions and usages. And as pointed out in chapter 3, some aspects of the projection problem ought to be solved by a better understanding of the intrusion of pragmatic inferences into the truth-conditional content of certain constructions.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Chapter 3\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|1.

The ideas were developed in lectures to the 1987 Linguistic Institute of the LSA, and I am grateful to Larry Horn, who co-taught the course, for much interaction over them. In the following year at Stanford, I benefited from much discussion over these issues with Ivan Sag, and I am conscious of having absorbed many ideas, references and ways of looking at issues from him, which I have not acknowledged at every step.

One such historical reason was the attrition of the "wars of presupposition," between those who held that presuppositions were essentially pragmatic, and possibly implicatural, in character, and those who held that they were essentially semantic. The battles seem to have come to an end from mutual exhaustion without final resolution. Another such reason was the attempt to derail the Gricean program by developing the theory of particularized implicatures at the expense of the generalized, a program that arguably has little strictly linguistic interest.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|3. I consider this discovery of the different components of meaning to be the fundamental advance in modern semantics. Of course, it may happen that (as I myself have suggested) specific concepts like "felicity condition" and "presupposition" may in the end be reducible to others; but the point is that the observations of apparently distinct processes constitute the advance. Those who, like Jackendoff or Sperber and Wilson, assume that there is no such variety of phenomena, display, I think, a disregard for the fine-grained texture of linguistic meaning in the hope of getting a simple macroscopic picture. Out of focus photographs can have a certain charm, but out of focus X-rays are of no scientific use.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|4. The notion of a component or level in linguistic theory has been thought about both in terms of a distinct type of representation for each level and a distinct set of operations over those representations. Defining the relations between levels as input/output relations requires that representations at the interface are compatible, indeed essentially the same. Another way of thinking has it that there are special mapping rules between levels, allowing much more significant mismatches between representations at the interface (Sadock 1991, Jackendoff 1997). Chomsky (1995: 27) himself uses the term "module" in a special way of course, referring to distinct sets of syntactic constraints (binding theory, Case theory, etc.) which interact in more complex ways to yield, it is supposed, the observed and complex patterns of grammatical well-formedness. Neither my use nor Chomsky's has anything to do with Fodor's (1983) notion of module as a distinct mental faculty.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|5. Any overall model of the theory of meaning could be construed in either an abstract ("competence") or a processual ("performance") way. We shall be concerned here primarily with an abstract perspective, essentially with what kinds of information must be available to what processes, rather than the _order_ in which such processes might actually operate in speech production or comprehension. As Bach (1994: 154156) points out, despite noises to the contrary, we are in no position to provide processing models at this stage.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|6.

Indeed I assume that we need to distinguish one sense of semantics, call it _semantics__1_, referring to a process that extracts an impoverished level of semantic representation from surface structure and lexical content, from another, call it _semantics__2_, which is a set of procedures that operate over a richer level of semantic representation to compute sense relations, entailment relations and truth conditions. The level of representation extracted by semantics1 may perhaps be relatively autonomous, but even here we have to allow for pragmatic resolution of ambiguities. However, semantics2 computes over a level of representation to which pragmatics has contributed in fundamental ways. My claim is that semantics2 is essentially linguistic and cannot be equated with conceptual structure or thinking in general (as Sperber and Wilson 1986 or Jackendoff 1992a suggest). It is the properties of semantics2 representations (not those of semantics1) that are described in semantic textbooks (under the rubrics of sense relations, entailments, meaning-postulates, truth conditions), so that the claim that _this_ level is not autonomous with respect to pragmatics is not a vacuous claim.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|7. The truth conditions of sentences or utterances? If utterances, so what? So asks Kent Bach. But on the views developed below (and indeed in Bach 1982, 1987a, 1994), sentences don't have truth conditions, only utterances do. The interesting question then becomes: what kinds of inferential process get us to the minimal proposition-bearing entity, and my claim is that these are just the same kinds of process, with the same kind of product, that elsewhere may take us from a proposition expressed to something else the speaker meant, which is more obviously an implicature.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|8. Bach (1994: 143) points out that a slightly unfortunate consequence of this definition is that 'saying that p' then entails 'meaning that p' (in Grice's sense of meaningnn), so that Grice is forced to say that a speaker who intends a nonliteral interpretation of, for example, a trope has not 'said that _p'_ but merely 'made as if to say that _p'._ One cannot in pure Gricean terminology then talk about 'saying one thing but meaning another instead'. (Grice's concept of meaningnn has itself been endlessly discussed; see, e.g., Schiffer 1972, Avramides 1989.)\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|9. Compare, for example, Bach (1994: 142, citing Grice 1989: 87): "Let me suggest that . . . for Grice the contents of what is said are _structured_ propositions associated with syntactic forms," so that, for instance, active-passive pairs with the same truth-conditional content will not count as 'saying the same thing'. Earlier, Bach and Harnish (1979: 29ff) had pointed out that the formula _'U_ said that _p'_ must be taken opaquely; that is, what U said depends not only on the extension but the intension, the sense, of the expressions used. Grice's own views about how finely the contents of what is said are to be individuated beyond the level of truth conditions are, it must be admitted, not clearly articulated.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|10. It is a much discussed point whether anaphoric linkages should be thought of as syntactic ambiguities (resolved by grammatical coindexing) or semantic ambiguities (resolved at the level of denotation assignment) or, as I argue in section 3.24 and in chapter 4, as semantic generality requiring pragmatic resolution (except in the case of syntactically specified coreference, as in reflexives).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

This is my appellation. Grice (1989: 138139) himself identified another circle, possibly related, of this sort: can we give an account of the (timeless, literal) meaning p of expression _C_ in terms of people normally meaningnn (intending) _p_ by _C,_ where what they intend or meannn by _C_ will surely make reference to the timeless, literal meaning of _C_? Incidentally, the phrase "Grice's circle" is not meant to suggest that he had unwittingly tied himself in knots; Grice (1989: 375) indicates that he was entirely cognizant of the problems treated here.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|17. Other theorists of many different persuasions seem to have come to parallel conclusions. Lewis (1979) supposed that accommodation (a kind of pragmatic presumption) is involved in many uses of definite descriptions, in the narrowing down of modal meanings to deontic versus epistemic, and so forth. Moore (1986) in an AI context states "the only way to hold fast to the position that the construction of logical form precedes all pragmatic processing seems to be to put in "dummy" symbols for the unknown relation," and so concludes that "a theoretically interesting level of logical form will have resolved contextually dependent definite references, as well as the other 'local' pragmatic indeterminacies" (1981 (1986: 286)).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|18.

Even though the notion of impliciture encompasses both the minimal proposition expressed and the fuller enriched implicit proposition, Bach (1994: 157160), in contrast to Carston and Recanati, holds that the minimal proposition plays a distinct and important functional role in getting to the expanded proposition. This is surely correct. But then why did he include the "expansions" beyond the minimal proposition in the category of impliciture?\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|22. He adds that an implicature "is a conceptually independent proposition, a proposition with perhaps no constituents in common with what is said", and gives the example of an utterance of "It's after 10" implicating 'the restaurant is closed'. But we could have phrased the implicature as 'The restaurant closes after 10', in which case there is a constituent in common with what is said, and the inference must be reclassified as an impliciture.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|23. Explicatures are derived just like implicatures by the monadic principle of relevance (Sperber and Wilson 1986: 183193), while "both [completion and expansion aspects of impliciture] involve basically the same sort of pragmatic process as in implicature proper" (Bach 1994: 144).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|24. This point is not, it seems, easy to get across. Thus Carston (1995: 239) berates me for not supplying "any coherent distinction between those implicatures which contribute to what is said and those which function as independent assumptions communicated by the utterance." But there is none. That is why I don't subscribe to the terminological exercises surrounding "explicature," "implicature," and so on.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|25. This would be the line favored in some recent treatments of tense; see, for example, Partee (1984: 257ff) who proposes "if the main clause is an event-clause, the last step in its processing is the resetting of the reference time to a time 'just after' the main clause event."

It may be argued that there is some slippage here: _some x are P_ can't be intensionally equivalent to _some and perhaps all x are P_ because only the latter involves a modal notion; and in circumstances where 'some but necessarily not all _x_ are _P'_ is true, the first will be true and the second false. However, I think the objections are immaterial: the simpler nonmodal paraphrase as in (_a'_) (with stress on _some_ and _at least_) would seem to give the same result.

Atlas (1993a: 171) complains that utterances of the form "A is better than B" show no anomaly when A is equivalent to B because these are intensional contexts. However, we can make all the same arguments with extensional predicates like _bigger than._ For example, if the semantic content of "A family with five children is bigger than a family with two children" can be glossed 'A family with at least five children is bigger than a family with at least two children', then what is _said_ would seem to be far from self-evidently true; the whole achieves its plausible interpretation through upper-bounding implicatures on the cardinals.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|31. For example, consider Atlas's (1984b) account of comparatives.

This kind of phrasing looks like a category mistake, Kent Bach points out to me: traditionally, sentences entail and speakers implicate. But we are moving steadily away from this picture. First, utterance-types carry with them presumptive meanings (GCIs, to which the speaker is committed of course); second, sentences in the abstract are (at least in general) much too underspecified to entail anything. Thus in the new picture, it is utterances that both entail and implicate propositions. The idea that it is only _statements,_ not sentences, that entail or carry truth, is of course not really new at all (see, e.g., Austin 1950).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|35. Moore's paradox is of course the anomaly of the assertion "_p_ and I don't believe that _p._" Grice (1978: 114) noted that this would follow from his maxim of Quality but held that uttering "_p_" did not _implicate_ 'The speaker believes/knows that _p_' on the grounds that such a presumption only expresses the maxim itself. Others have been less cautious (see, e.g., Gazdar 1979: 4648; Levinson 1983: 105) but have noted that unlike most implicatures this inference is not deniable (hence the paradox), indicating perhaps additional reinforcement through a sincerity condition on assertion.

Bach argues that many uses of sentences are _nonliteral:_ taken literally, they express an absurdity or untruth and must be understood as expressing a related, more explicit, more plausible proposition (Bach being in this regard, an incarnation of our Obstinate Theorist). Thus, if I say "I haven't eaten breakfast", I mean 'not yet today' although the literal meaning of the sentence might entail 'never' (cf. "I haven't eaten sheep's testicles"). On this account, we go around expressing falsities, charitably interpreted as closely related propositions. Bach's account and my account differ in that, using the mechanism of default interpretations, I think\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

In some ways, the example is weakened by the presence of the second referring expression; given three visible children near the brother-in-law, he is (we suppose) the only referent describable as _the man with three children,_ so by elimination the speaker's brother must be the other man.

The hedge "scale-like" merely points to the fact that the opposition <_like, not mind>_, although it has all the logical properties of a Horn scale, would seem to fail the lexicalization constraint posited by Atlas and Levinson (1981) and Levinson (1987b). A less stringent constraint, posited by Horn, only requires that the stronger item on a scale is _more_ lexicalized than the weaker item (as in this case), as discussed in chapter 2.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|46.

We'd also lose the intuitive distinction between _a [rich [rich]] man_ (rich among the rich) and _a rich, rich man_ (rich, I assure you).

For example, Katz specifically argues for a full semantic determination of the modifier relation, which we have taken to be given by I-inference: according to him _good knife_ can only mean 'good for cutting with' (1987: 203ff), because there's a 'cutting' marker waiting as it were for modification.

But the quantifier _some_ falls of course under the scope of the negation in (i), and the scale upon which any scalar implicature would depend is likewise sensitive to the negative scope. Instead of the scale operative in (ii), viz. _<all, some>_, we have in (i) the scale <_not some, not all>_, and in fact therefore no scalar implicature at all (unless the utterance is interpreted as a denial of a prior assertion). In short, implicatures have none of the direct referential character that marks out indexicals.

In this discussion, I will argue that pragmatics should be considered a component in a theory of meaning, not of course in the Fodorean sense (Fodor 1983) of a specialized, encapsulated module, but in the sense (more normal in linguistics) of a set of distinct principles (I continue to use the term _module_ only because _component_ fails to yield an adjective like _modular_). Wilson and Sperber (1986) argue explicitly against this (although there may be some confusing conflation here between the notion of a linguistic level or component and a Fodorean module proper). But their arguments are based on the assumption that Gricean mechanisms are not inferential principles specialized to communication, and more particularly on the assumption that there are no GCIs. It should be clear that I make neither of these assumptions: maxims like the I-, Q- and M-principles are, on my account, specific heuristics adapted to the narrow bandwidth of human speech (or other forms of human communication), and rely on metalinguistic reasoning. And perhaps GCIs, by virtue of their resident default nature, have specific memory requirements and thus need some mental home base, as it were. However, even if pragmatic principles belong to no specialized linguistic component, but are freefloating in a Fodorean central processor, none of the arguments below about the interrelation of semantics and pragmatics seem to be weakened in any obvious way.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|54.

Kadmon notes (1987: 52f) that the cancellation mechanism introduced by Gazdar (1979) and generally assumed correct, viz. cancellation by inconsistent prior background knowledge, cannot handle backwards cancellation as in _I went into a house; it was my house._\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|57. This is because within Kamp/Heim theories discourse referents are unbound variables unless they occur within the scope of an explicit quantifier or quantifier-inducing construction (like the conditional), and the rule of interpretation has the effect of an unselective existential quantification over all unbound variables. This peculiarity of the theory, whereby an assertion of the cardinality of _x_ as _n_ in the DRS does not restrict the cardinality of _x_ in the domain to exactly _n,_ has the benefit that it is possible to get semantics for _at least three_ distinct from that for _three_ (a problem that had always baffled me). In effect, _at least three_ specifies in the DRS that the cardinality is equal or greater than three, thus not permitting an upper-bounding implicature (Kadmon 1987: 80). _Exactly three_ specifies in the DRS that any set in the domain that meets the conditions for that discourse referent is a member of the self-same threesome (p. 62).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|58. An exception is made for numeral-determiner indefinites in predicative position that are claimed to have the semantic content 'exactly three'; this is supposed to be achieved automatically by Partee's type-shifting semantics (Kadmon 1987: 64).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|59. However, let me record here one obvious inadequacy. The DRT treatment looks as if it will work quite well for those implicatures we may call _additive_ (i.e., GCIs and particularized implicatures that add pragmatic content to semantic conditions). But there is another class of implicatures, which we may call _subtractive,_ which remove, coerce, or replace semantic conditions. (The terminology comes via Sag from, I believe, Sadock.) Examples of subtractive implicatures are ironies, and Lakoff's (1974) "amalgams" as in "I saw _you'll never guess how many_ people at the party" (where _you'll never guess how many_ acts like a quantifier). Clearly these subtractive implicatures need to modify or replace semantic conditions rather than merely add additional constraints. The problem is that this process apparently requires semantic conditions to be defeasible. It may be that we will need to insist that these apparent intrusions are indeed postsemantic, but I am concerned by some evidence to the contrary (in part reviewed in section 3.5.3).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|60. Copying operations are quite fundamental to DRTthat is what is involved in anaphoric resolution. Various complex kinds of copying operation have also been explored by, for example, Craige Roberts in unpublished work on the pragmatic accommodation required to understand modal subordination.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|61. Horn would no doubt respond that a generalization is being missed by this accountwe now appear to have three kinds of negation: ordinary descriptive negation, implicature-denying negation, and metalinguistic negation. In a sense, this is correct: implicature-denying negations share one crucial property with the descriptive cases (i.e., the meaning of negation as a truth function), but the retort properties with the true metalinguistic cases. But in fact the DRT treatment suggests that implicature-denying negation is just the intersection of descriptive\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

In (ib) real-world number (optionally) overrides grammatical singularity, and in (ic) construal _of five children in a car_ as a singular situation permits singular verb agreement, and in (id) _two eggs_ functions as a singular menu. One might hope to account for (ibd) in terms of some general ambiguity of plural NPs between, say, plural and singular collective readings. But this will not dowe should then be able to say _*The men is coming in_ and we can't. Inevitably, some process of pragmatic construal seems to be involved. Implicature proper is more clearly involved in other cases, for example, honorific plurals may collocate with singular predications, as in (ie), where the plural form originally merely implicated respect, and in some languages continues to do so rather than being fully conventionalized (Brown and Levinson 1987: 198ff).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|3.

Chomsky (1981: 65) points out that the Avoid Pronoun alternations in _John would prefer going_ (coreferential) versus _John would prefer his going_ (preferably disjoint) might be related to Gricean factors, a point taken up by Horn (1984). Levinson (1987b: 417420) argues that Control structures fit the same pattern and are not fully grammaticalizedsee Comrie 1984 on Russian and Huang 1994: 149158 on Chinese.

This and related issues are discussed by Horn (1989: 345353). Indirect speech acts are another class of cases where collocational constraints are associated with standardized or short-circuited presumptive inferences. Thus preverbal _please_ is associated with indirect requests, but only those that have idiomatic status (Lakoff 1973; see Levinson 1983: 272ff for references):\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(i) a.

Thus the nonce modifier seems licensed by an implicature. The appropriate theoretical moves here are not so clear, but the phenomena certainly support the idea broached in chapter 3 that implicature can play a role inside the process of semantic interpretation, and that an incremental construction of a construal can play a role in licensing grammatical processes like agreement, or treatment of a sentence fragment as an NP as in (iia).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|6. Perhaps the last point requires a further word. Defeasibility has to be, as far as I can see, the litmus test for a grammatical versus pragmatic account of linguistic patterns. Chomsky (1981: 227 n. 45) for one will not agree. He would rather suppose that pragmatics may override grammatical stipulation. It is true, of course, that under special conditions (e.g., a noisy environment), anything goes that works. But the greater the range of interpretations, and the more normal defeasible interpretations seem, the less plausible the grammatical account becomes. Let us concede though that the big picture counts too. If we have perfectly general principles, which work across language and provide deep insights into the workings of specific languages, and which would give us an account of the phenomenon in question "for free," then naturally we want to hang on to that explanation.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

The hypothesis is that any language with deictic pronouns will allow these to be used both anaphorically and as variables. Certainly, there are also specialized referentially dependent expressions, like long-distance anaphors to be discussed in section 4.3.2.5.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|8. Although semantic generality is clearly intrinsically connected to referential dependence, the former does not of course automatically engender the latter. It is quite possible to have a semantically general definite description like _the man_ serve as a referentially independent expression as well as (on some other occasion) a referentially dependent one. Even though reflexive pronouns _encode_ referential dependency in a certain domain (and are therefore in that respect not semantically general), nevertheless in many languages they are interestingly stripped of number/gender features and thus conform to this general pattern (for an interesting reanalysis of GB theory which makes this generality central, see Burzio 1991).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|9. A possible exception is switch reference, in which a subordinate or coordinate verb may indicate that its subject is identical to that of a prior matrix or coordinate verb; in that case, perhaps the linkage is itself grammatically specified (see section 4.3.2.5.1).

Kent Bach has objected to this kind of phrasing: addressees are not in the business of inferring coreference or its complementrather, they are in the business of determining reference. That I think is true. GCIs, on the account developed in this chapter, at most help to signal _how_ the addressee is to find the reference; just as often (as in the case of I-inferences) the assumption of coreference will be a side product of a larger inference (e.g., finding a maximally cohesive interpretation).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|14. In a critique of my earlier papers (Levinson 1987a,b, 1991), Ariel (1994: 20) suggests that I am deeply confused about informativeness: "If anything, then, nonstereotypic interpretations are more informative than stereotypic ones, in that they eliminate from consideration a more deeply engrained belief. In other words, the I-principle cannot both be informativity and stereotypy." In fact, however,\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

The former is syntactic and probabilistic and plays absolutely no role in the theory here; the latter is semantic and structural and is the relevant theoretical foundation to this work.

To illustrate: given two predicates _M_ and _Y,_ and one entity _a, M_(_a_) will be compatible with just two state descriptions or states of affairsnamely, (i) _M_(_a_) and _Y_(_a_), and (ii) _M_(_a_) and ~ _Y_(_a_). But if we add another entity _b, M_(_a_) will now be compatible with eight different state descriptions, as the reader may verify. Enlarging the domain to three individuals will yield 16 state descriptions compatible with the assertion M(a), and so on.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|16. Bar-Hillel and Carnap (1952) did not themselves explore the effects of relative size of domain of discourse on this concept of informativeness. (There appear to be interesting theorems in this area, such as: the proportion of compatible to incompatible state descriptions for a given assertion stays constant whatever the size of the domain.) This concept of informativeness thus makes the informativeness of a statement relative to a domain of discourse a three-place relation: statement _S_ is more informative in domain _A_ than in domain _B._ It is a concept of the informativeness of a statement relative to a world. I owe these clarifications to Jay Atlas.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|17.

This argument I owe, once again, to Jay Atlas. He adds that if it is objected that a particular addressee might prefer having a little information about two referents to having a lot about one, then one must concede that of course that is possible. But this is to invoke yet another notion of informativeness, namely informativeness-for-a-person in a context, which is of course a matter entirely relative to context. Such a notion of informativeness is of course not relevant to the business at handfinding a default preference for interpretation.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|19. Incidentally, we shall make use of yet further arguments about the relative informativeness of coreferential versus noncoreferential readings in section 4.3.2. These are notions at the level of sense, rather than extension. I shall claim that a sentence with a reflexive or other Anaphor is more informative than the corresponding sentence with a nonreflexive or non-Anaphor, because the former entails coreference where the latter at most permits it.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|20.

A similar line of argumentation goes back to Dowty (1980), Reinhart (1983), Sadock (1983), and others. The only novel element here is the employment of the specific pragmatic machinery developed in this book (this too prefigured in Horn 1984: 2425).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|22.

Some pragmatic inferences are undoubtedly stronger than othersthat is, they are defeasible in fewer contexts, and alternative interpretations are intuitively less salient, or even hard to conceive. It should be an aim of GCI theory to account for at least some of these gradient effects, but there will inevitably be many other factors to do with functional sentence perspective, discourse structure, and so on. On the current theory, we can account for gradient strengths only along the following lines:\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(a) Some kinds of implicatures are intrinsically "stronger" than othersin our theory Q-implicatures cancel both inconsistent I-implicatures and M-implicatures, whereas M-implicatures only cancel inconsistent I-implicatures. That the inference (if ungrammaticalized) from _John hit him_ to the disjointness of the arguments is due to a scalar Q-inference helps to explain why it might be stronger than the I-inference to coreference of _John_ and _his_ in _John hit his children,_ where coreference is only a suggestion. The strength of Q-inferences is in turn due to their metalinguistic character, which unlike M-implicatures is not gradient in kind (markedness of expression being upgradable in various ways).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(b) Implicatures from different sources may reinforce one anotherthis would be one explanation of why _John hit him_ is so strongly disjoint: not only is there a Q-implicature as just noted, but on the theory sketched below that there is also an I-inference to disjoint co-arguments, the two consistent implicatures would reinforce each other.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(c) Finally, we may decide that some pattern like the disjoint reference in _He thought John could do it_ is an especially robust inference and handle it, as Reinhart (1983) proposes, by building extra grammatical machinery that assigns to _John thought he could do it_ a strong variable interpretation, so that we have an additional Q-inference from the failure to use the strong structure.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|24.

In fact, to handle preposed constituents, one needs a more complex formulation: X c-commands Y iff either (i) the first branching node a dominating X also dominates Y, or (ii) the node ?' immediately dominating ?? is of the same category as _????? and ??'_ also dominates Y.

See, for example, work by Huang (1994) on Chinese, Cho and Hong (1988) on Korean, Levinson (1987a) on Guugu Yimithirr, Enç (1986) on Turkish, and Dimitriadis (1995) on Greek.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|27. Ariel (1994) complains that such a scale from lexical NP to pronoun to zero is far too crude, because there are many kinds of intermediate types. But this was never intended as a full scale, and the account can be extended as required, according to the NP types in the language (see remarks in chapter 2 with respect to Gundel, Hedberg, and Zacharski 1989).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Incidentally, as it has long been noted (e.g., Dowty 1980), there is no such contrast in English between _his own_ and _his_ (as in _He loves his/his own mother_) as one might at first expect. This follows from the lexicalization constraint on Horn scales, which requires the stronger expression (here _his own_) to be equally or more lexicalized than the weak expression (_his_), a condition clearly not met in English. In some languages, in contrast (like Norwegian) it is met, and then there is indeed a Q-contrast of the predicted sort. See the discussion of example (45).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|29. An obvious objection is that the mirror-image relation is not a perfect reflectionthis issue of the noncomplementarity of pronouns and Anaphors is discussed at length in section 4.3.2.5. A less obvious objection is that Conditions A and B appear to have independent existence, as shown by the fact that in certain loci they overlap and exclude both pronoun and Anaphor. For example, both _They hate him_ (Condition B) and _They hate himself_ (_Condition_ A) seem ill-formed when _him_ or _himself is_ understood as one of _They_ (Safir 1992: 38, after Lasnik). But in fact the Condition Btype case seems fine under the right contextual conditions. Consider _The Board must elect its own chairman unanimously and without abstentions__The bishop volunteered, so they elected him;_ or _Renaldo was their best player__the whole team relied on him;_ or under cultural conditions where all must drink to a toast, _They toasted him._\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|30. Of course it does not matter at all whether one prefers, as Reinhart does, to think about her account as absorbing Condition A, together with a fragment of Condition B, with the rest of Conditions B and C obtained pragmatically. This is terminology only, as long as we acknowledge that Condition B has not been wholly reduced to pragmatics, because the NPc-commandingpronoun rule of interpretation requires that the pronoun is not in the same domain as the NP.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|31.

Larry Horn suggests to me that there has always been a tacit presumption that the Binding Conditions or their predecessors hold only for presupposed, not asserted or denied, coreference. But it is not clear why configuration-based principles should be sensitive to such semantic, or indeed, as it turns out, pragmatic content (Safir 1992). An account in terms of defeasible pragmatic conditions is attractive: asserted identity will automatically override pragmatic default inferences to disjointness, and no special exceptions have to be stated.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|33.

It is worth noting that Kuno (1987: 109) proposes an independent pragmatic constraint that may help to explain the general rarity of coreference in the pronounc-commandingNP pattern. The constraint is partly a matter of linear order but partly a matter of _logophoricity,_ a concept reviewed in section 4.3.2.6.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|37. To these examples it may be objected that the coreferential lexical NP is not referentially dependent on the pronoun, even though it may be coreferential (thus invoking Evans's (1980) distinction again). Thus if the Binding Conditions were recast in terms of referential dependency rather than referential identity, these examples, it might be claimed by, say, Higginbotham (1983), would not be counterexamples.

The ?-Criterion specifies that "each ?-role is assigned to one and only one argument" (Chomsky 1981: 36) or that "every NP must be taken as the argument of some predicate; furthermore it must be so taken once" (van Riemsdijk and Williams 1986: 243). On the face of it at least, the Guugu Yimithirr antipassive construction (to be reviewed below) is a direct counterexample; it indicates that single absolutive subject of the verb is to be taken twice, first in agent role than in patient role. And pleonastic pronouns in Guugu Yimithirr also violate this condition (see Levinson 1987b: 391, n. 19).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|39.

In the literature it is often stated that LDAs are invariably monomorphemic (following Pica 1991); this is in fact not necessarily the case, as just noted for longrange uses of Chinese _ta ziji_ (Huang 1994). There are also the LDA usages of English reflexives like _himself,_ as discussed by Zribi-Herz (1989) and Horn and Lee (1995).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|43.

The complementarity of pronouns and LDAs does apparently persist systematically in a few languages, as in Gothic, and up to a point in Icelandic (see Harbert 1995: 194). In general, the pattern in the European languages is for the complementarity to evaporate once the reflexive is outside the classical Binding Theory domain (minimal governing category including a subject)see the tabular presentation in Reuland and Koster 1991. For Icelandic the complementarity persists when the LDA _sig_ is bound within the first containing finite clause but is lost beyond that (ibid. 1213).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|45.

There may perhaps also be cases of English LDA where there is no such overlap of pronoun and reflexive, especially where predicates of identity are involved as in _Frankenstein wants to produce a monster similar to himself/?him._ Safir (1992) presents a discussion in a framework that introduces pragmatic effects on Conditions A and B.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|50. Interestingly, observes Larry Horn, this constraint is less clear with first- and second-person pronominals as in _Will you trade me those pictures of yourself for these pictures of myself,_ but perhaps that is explained by the fact that the protagonists share the same perspective in the current speech event.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|51. Baker (1995), also utilizing textual data, casts some doubt on Zribi-Hertz's (1989) logophoric analysis of English LDA. He suggests a systematic dialect difference between British and American English, with only British English systematically employing reflexives as "intensive" NPs. An "intensive" NP is not only contrastive but also refers to a central protagonist, a bit like Algonquian proximate (vs. obviative) pronouns. If he is correct about the dialects, this will certainly help to explain the muddied intuitions. But the "intensive" content analysis can be accommodated within the approach being developed here, although there are reasons (given below) to think that the range of meanings associated with the reflexive tend to be related to deictic markedness.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|52. Zribi-Hertz (1989: 703) herself rejects a Gricean approach, apparently because she sees the principles involved as belonging to a systematic realm of their own, namely discourse grammar, from which sentence grammar is ultimately derivative (p. 724).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|53. As Zribi-Hertz (1989: 705, n. 12) points out, there has been an unjustified reluctance by workers in the Binding Condition framework to consider English an LDA language. Consequently, such structural conditions as there are in longrange uses of the reflexive have been largely unexplored within this framework (but see Kuno 1987 and review in Van Valin 1990; Parker, Riley, and Meyer 1990).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|54. There is an interesting set of exceptions to this tendency in English. Horn (1984: 24, and forthcoming work) notes that with first- and second-person pronouns, where reference is fixed, nonreflexive pronouns may be used with clausemate antecedents to signal the avoidance of the subjective, logophoric associations of the reflexive, as in (Horn's textual examples):\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(i) I'm not looking at you, _I_'m looking at _me._\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(ii) Take good care of yourself. _You_ belong to _you._\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(iii) Well, I'm employed by them but _I_ am working for _me._\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

If _John hit him_ I-implicates disjoint reference by the DRP, why doesn't _John hit the man_ M-implicate the complement, given that R-expressions often M-contrast with pronouns? The observable fact is that the DRP is strong and holds over all NPs unless the contrary is signaled by grammar (reflexivity, special marking of introverted predicates) or by marked or emphatic forms (in languages without any reflexive marking). Additionally, the opposition between pronoun and lexical NP arises in loci where coreference is at issue, and the pronoun is a minimal form suggesting coreference; but here disjoint reference is at issue, and if the pronoun is disjoint, then certainly the less minimal form will be too, unless specially marked by, say, emphatics in languages without Anaphors.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|58. The term "emphatic" is (as Faltz 1985: 239 remarks) regrettably vague.

The effect is thus to insist on the exact reference, to rebut a contrary suggestion or a stereotypical presumption, and so forth. The scope of such particles can be complex, as indicated by the ambiguity of (iii) (_He himself flogged the Bishop_ vs. _The Bishop himself was flogged by him_). For a most useful exploration of the semantics/pragmatics and scope of such particles, see König 1991. He notes (pp. 8796) that a general phenomenon is the fact that scalar additive particles often take the same form as the so-called emphatic reflexive pronouns or intensifiers: German _selbst,_ Dutch _zelfs,_ Norwegian _selv,_ French _même,_ Irish _fein,_ and so on. Thus he relates scalar _even_ to the emphatic uses of _himself_ (cf. French _même,_ German _selbst_ cognate with English _self_)\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

It is thus the weak reflexives that (especially) participate in long-distance binding and its associated logophoricity (see, e.g., Everaert, 1986: 212f; Hellan 1988: 87ff, 95). The strong reflexives have not had the same intensive study as the weak ones (Hellan 1988: 87), so perhaps the facts are not so clear. For example, the strong reflexives in Dutch, Norwegian, and Icelandic also have long-range uses if they are stressed (Everaert 1986: 218f, 253 n. 4, 254 n. 12; Hellan 1986: 104), an observation in line with the current theory. But clearly the main factor here is the relative antiquity of the weak reflexive (from proto-Indo-European _*s_(_w_)-, lost from West Germanic and then reborrowed later in, for example, Dutch), which may itself derive from an emphatic (see below). The strong reflexive form in all these languages seems to retain the pure emphatic functions (e.g., as a modifier of a subject) and to be in the process of extending its functions in the way predicted by the argument here. For some generalizations about weak/marked versus strong/unmarked reflexives, see Faltz 1985 and Yang 1983. For an attempt to predict their respective distributions, see Pica 1984, 1987; Everaert 1986: chap. 8; among others. Rizzi (1989) treats the association of weak (morphologically simple) reflexives and long-range binding (and conversely, compound reflexives and local binding) as so universally strong that it would suffice for "degree0 learnability"a child would not even need access to subordinate clauses to know what the binding domain of a specific lexical Anaphor was! But Chinese, for example, allows long reflexivization with both simple _ziji_ and compound _ta ziji_ (Huang 1994: 77f). The tendency for weak (morphologically simpler) reflexives to have long-distance uses is attributed by Faltz (1985: 256ff) to their diachronic origins as stressed pronouns in subordinate clauses, as with the African logophoric pronouns and perhaps proto-Indo-European _*s_(_w_)-. If the association between weak reflexives and long-range uses does turn out to be a language-family wide generalization, there is a direct potential explanation from our theory. The very fact that clausemate reflexivity is indicated by what was originally an emphatic form, which in long-range uses may be indicating merely a contrast in perspective rather than reference, may motivate double emphasis in the clausemate cases. In fact, there is direct diachronic evidence for this process in the origin of many strong reflexive forms as double or triple emphatics. For example, Homeric Greek reflexive _he_-(from Proto-Indo-European _*s_(_w_)-) was later fused with _autós_ (a form used like English -_self to_ form compound reflexives) to yield Classical _heautón_ in the third person, this in turn becoming Modern _eaftós,_ now further modified with a possessive pronoun indicating person, as in _eaftó tu,_ 'self his'. Proto-Romance _*metipsimum_ is an even clearer case of triple emphatic derivation.

An anonymous referee, commenting on Levinson 1991, held that the existence of languages without Anaphors is no more embarrassing to the Binding Theory than the existence of languages without nasal consonants, although it might be interesting to see whether such languages invariably fail to have NP movement processes, as GB-theory might predict. Such a correlation is almost certainly missing; for example, one can find passives in most of the languages under consideration. There is in fact one detailed GB-style analysis of a B-first language by Chung (1989), which describes Chamorro as without overt morphological Anaphors but with canonical NP-traces in raising and passive constructions. Chung in fact is driven to the reluctant conclusion that Chomsky's parallel between movement and bound anaphora may have to be abandoned. See discussion in section 4.3.3.1.2. More recently, there have been moves to think of the Binding Theory as simply failing to apply to languages that at first sight seem to have good long-distance Anaphors, like Japanese (see Mazuka and Lust 1994).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|63. This could function like the optional English _own_ in _John admires his own book_ (Larry Horn suggests to me), but much more likely it is just an emphatic.

The subject is composed of demonstrative affixes flanking a classifier for men (marked 'CPman').

The other syntactic reflex of the supposed Anaphors in Chamorro is a "subject effect" whereby coreference is exceptionally ruled out where an antecedent precedes a subject with an embedded pronominal (in general, Chamorro seems to allow coreference wherever an antecedent precedes or c-commands a pronominal). This is because, it is claimed, in these structures c-command is impossible, but real Anaphors require it. It is unclear though, on this explanation, why a pronounwhich would look identicalshould not be able to be bound in this location. In short, other factors seem involved. Chung (1989: 162164) therefore considers an alternative pragmatic explanation, that this disjointness is due to a pragmatic opposition of the kind used by Reinhart (1983) or in our Q-based account of A-first languages, preferring the use of the Anaphor (with a passive or active transform if necessary). Overall, the attempt to distinguish pronominals from covert Anaphors masquerading in the same form seems an almost-impossible task.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|66.

The evolution in the other direction (i.e., by the loss of Anaphors) is not of course inconceivable; indeed this seems to be what exceptionally happened in the West Germanic languages which are presumed to have lost the reconstructed Proto-Germanic reflexive _*sik_ (see note 75). But the diachronic processes here would be of a quite different kind, Nigel Vincent points out to me, perhaps owing to phonetic change or language contact. The bidirectional possibilities should not be confused with some natural cycle; for example, Vincent (1989b) insists, the apparent synthesis-analysis-synthesis cycle in some Romance verbal inflections disguises quite different underlying mechanisms. The historical change of B-first to A-first systems would seem in accord with the kind of grammaticalization of analytic into synthetic grammatical systems.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|74.

Of course, the Guugu Yimithirr antipassive might already have passed through a reflexive stage, with subsequent semantic bleaching; but some evidence against this is that some verbs (see Haviland 1979: 126f) that obligatorily take antipassive inflection (by some frozen, and thus presumably old, process) simply have an intransitive meaning (e.g., 'explode', 'shine').\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|78. Nigel Vincent tells me that the Proto-Romance formation _*met-ipsimum_ must be a case of threefold emphasis: _met_ was an emphatic (as in _egomet_ 'I myself'), _ipse_ was the standard Latin emphatic pronoun with case inflection, and -_imum_ was the superlative suffix as found in _maximum._ He adds that Italian _stesso_ derives from _iste-ipse,_ a double pronoun combination. Langacker (1977) also discusses the evolution of Uto-Aztecan reflexives.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|79. Faltz (1985) does not appear to have been aware of Hagège's work and makes no reference to the subjective point-of-view phenomena associated with long-distance reflexives, although he discusses some of the classical logophoric languages, like Ewe (p. 252).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|80. Of course, the derivation of a long-distance pronoun from a first-person pronoun in a language that has no system of indirect reported speech (i.e., from a form glossing as "John said I will come" to a form "John said self would come") would make immediate sense of the logophoric associations of such pronouns. But Faltz (1985: 263ff) notes a number of problems for such a development, although it seems eminently plausible for some of the African languages (like Ewe). However, it is quite clear that this cannot be the source of all such long-distance reflexives with associated logophoricity, because these are (as Faltz notes, p. 257ff) often (as in Igbo) clearly third-person in origin.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|81. The exceptions will be those derived from first-person long-range-only "reflexives" and any C forms of the 'body-his' kind that may have been directly coined. For the record, Baker (1995: 9495, n. 33) doubts this historical analysis on semantic groundshe thinks that the two functions (reflexivity, emphasis or discourse prominence) are "conceptually independent" and the diachronic relation between them involves drastic reanalysis, but he owes us an account of why the two conceptually independent functions so repeatedly get marked with the same morphemes.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|82. The evidence is of different kinds. The weakest is mere overlap in function between emphatics and reflexive morphemes. Stronger evidence, as in the case of Papago, is where this is reinforced by comparison with related languages where the morpheme only has a reflexive function. Best of all, of course, as in the rest of the cited languages, is where there are records showing increased grammaticalization over time of the emphatic into a reflexive.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|83.

For example, Syromiatnikov (1981: 81f) notes both reflexive and emphatic adjunct uses for _onöre_ and _midukara_ in Ancient Japanese (cf. Modern Japanese _mizukara,_ an alternate to _zibun;_ Hinds 1986: 116). These seem to be bleached head nominals (e.g., _kara_ means 'body'), a common reflexive source classified by Faltz (1985) as a kind of C pronoun.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|85. Although rarely mentioned in the recent theoretical literature on _jibun/zibun_ (e.g., in neither Kuno 1973 nor Hinds 1986 nor Sells 1987), the emphatic functions figure prominently in traditional pedagogical grammars (e.g., Vaccari and Vaccari 1948: 358ff list uses similar to English 'He himself came' and 'I bought it myself'; they even note the double emphatic use of _jibun jishin_ to translate 'you did it yourself' [lit. _ji-bun_ 'self-part', _ji-shin_ 'self-body']).

Incidentally, Huang (1994: 144) wonders in fact whether his account might not be generalized to languages like English, making an A-first account generally unnecessary. But there are at least two basic differences between the languages which motivate holding on to an A-first account. Firstly, sentences of the form 'He1 hit him1' with the coreferential interpretation have a different status in the two languages, being traditionally accepted by the grammarians as grammatical in Chinese (Huang 1994: 130) and rejected in Englishthus we need an explanation (given by the Q-principle) of why the DRP is not so easily overruled in English. Second, reflexives in English (but not it seems in Chinese) have (it is argued) grammatically specified binding domains, and there are other signs of conventionalization (as in the bound-anaphora patterns), which then in turn have pragmatic implications, as modeled in the A-first account.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|88. It is notable that in modern Chinese there is often a contrast in preferred referential interpretation of embedded pronominals that favors a local antecedent for _ta_ and a more distant one for _ziji._ For example, Huang (1989: 91) notes of the following kind of example that the favored interpretation coidentifies _Wang_ (rather than _Li_) and _ziji:_\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|(i) Lao Wang yiwei Lao Li bu zhidao ziji qu guo Meiguo.  <br>Lao Wang think Lao Li not know self go EXP America  <br>'Wang thinks that Li doesn't know that self has been to America.'\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|This tendency for _ziji_ linkage to skip over a good candidate antecedent that would have been the favored link with _ta_ may therefore be partially explained by this pragmatic theory (specifically, the M-contrast between _ta_ and _ziji_). Huang (1989: 106 n. 6) points out that a similar pattern has been noted for Japanese. However, our account cannot be the full explanation because even where there is no contrast with _ta, ziji_ still prefers a more distant antecedent.

That this is only a suggestion was clear, Huang (1994: 130) points out, to traditional grammarians of Chinese; he quotes Wang Li: "As for _ta ma ta_ ('He rebukes him'), it is ambiguous: it can mean either 'he rebukes himself' or 'he rebukes another person'."\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|90.

For an attempt to construe the pronouns of a B-first language as systematically ambiguous between Anaphor and pronoun, see Chung 1989. More generally, some theorists, like Koster (1986: 341ff, 1994), consider that pronouns are ambiguously Anaphors and pronominals, while reflexives may equally be Anaphors or pronominals (as in _John himself came_).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|93. Apart from the delayed acquisition of Binding Condition B patterns found by Solan and others mentioned above, Reinhart (1986: 140142) notes that findings about children's use of backward anaphora favor treating Condition B patterns as pragmatic. She argues that the data support her particular A-first analysis, with all types of bound anaphora collectively distinguished from pragmatic anaphora (but see C. Koster 1994). Her argument, like mine, is based on the presumption that innate predispositions should show up earlier in acquisition than pragmatically determined patterns.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|94. Consider, for example, Platzack's (1987) consideration of the time scale for the parameter switch from null subjects to realized subjects in Swedish. Platzack argues that there are a number of syntactic reflexes of this parameter (e.g., subjectverb agreement, expletive pronouns vs. gaps, _that_-trace filter violations) and that the historical record shows that "these changes occurred together during a relatively short space of timemore or less within the seventeenth century" and that this supports "the hypothesis that they are all reflexes of a single parameter in the grammar" (p. 397f). The statistics he produces for frequency of null subjects might support a slightly more gradual account, in terms perhaps of a 200-year process; and there were also special sociolinguistic factors during this period of major state formation (as he points out). Nevertheless, there is a rather striking contrast in timescale between this Swedish case, with relatively rapid linked changes, and the history of English anaphora with the very slow acquisition of Anaphors and the apparent lack of linkage between the acquisition of something like Condition A, on the one hand, and Condition Btype patterns on the other. Kroch (1989) takes a more skeptical view, maintaining that most linguistic change is likely to be gradual and that language learners may happily operate with two\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Although in recent work Chomsky (1995) has stressed economy and lack of overdetermination within the linguistic system itself which maps phonological form onto logical form, he now concedes that "we do expect to find connections between the properties of the language and the manner of its use" (p. 168).\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|96. That is, we do not expect a Gricean principle to simply not apply to some specific language, in the way that it has been supposed that syntactic principles (especially outside the "core") might admit of marked exceptions. A claim to this effect has indeed been made by Elinor Ochs for Malagasy (then E. O. Keenan [1976] 1998), but Brown and Levinson (1987: 9, 288289 n. 27) point out that the data do not substantiate this but rather point to specific social taboos overruling direct speech in limited circumstances. Brown and Levinson (1987) develop a theory in which the signaling of politeness works precisely by foregrounding such departures against a Gricean background. In the same way, against such a firm background of Gricean expectations, exceptional practices will be found in specific discourse genres. In these cases, Gricean principles are not even in limited suspensionthe practices take their semiotic value from the departures from Gricean expectations.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Epilogue\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|1. Gazdar (1979: 1113) documented this sentiment 20 years ago, and in the interim it has diminished perhaps only slightly. The complaint is often made that pragmatics "has found it difficult to achieve the degree of formal precision considered desirable in the linguistic sciences today" (Seuren 1998: 407). Note that formalization and prediction are not necessarily related; most predictions in the empirical branches of linguistics (e.g., psycholinguistics or language typology) are not formalized but are clear enough. Because pragmatics is, more or less by definition, not concerned with _rules_ or with _monotonic inference,_ any formalization is going to have an unfamiliar appearanceit is just not going to look like formalization in syntax and semantics (good examples can be found in the work on AI or natural language processing; see, e.g., Hobbs et al 1993). Large-scale formalization is also likely to be premature and involve fundamental fudges because we simply do not fully understand the underlying kinds of reasoning involved. This is not to say that fragmentary formalizations (as in Gazdar 1979, Wainer 1991, or Lascarides and Asher 1993) may not be extremely helpful. GCI theory, because of its limited scope and because of the existence of models of default reasoning, is a particularly promising area. Meanwhile, if the thesis of chapter 3 is roughly correct, much of what is currently done in formal semantics is the formalization of the pragmatically enriched semantic content of utterances.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

Admittedly, because the inferences arise under our heuristics from the underlying semantic representations as well as the form of expressions, precise predictions depend on the semantic analysis of the relevant expressions. Note that because the conditions under which default inferences are defeasible are reasonably clear, defeasibility itself should not greatly weaken the predictions.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|![f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif](../Images/f18389342cb855a03a7d56071eb1a417.gif)\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|3. For off-line effects of Gricean inferences, see, for example, Moxey and Sanford 1993, Newstead 1995 on scalar inference; Dulany and Hilton 1991, on scalar inferences; Politzer and Noveck 1991, on Gricean effects on the conjunction fallacy. For on-line processing of anaphora, ambiguity, and so on, which may involve Gricean effects, see the reviews in Garrod and Sanford 1994 and Singer 1994.

I do not pretend that this notion is straightforward, and I grant that it is not easy to defend. Yet I believe that the idea of a _preferred (or default) interpretation_ is much too important to be ignored just because it is a difficult concept. Moreover, the existence of preferred intepretations has (for me at least) something of that brute self-evidence that Dr. Johnson invoked when he kicked a stone to dispatch Berkeley's idealism. We grope to grab and harness the beast without the slightest doubt about its existence.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|I attempt in the book to justify the notion of a generalized conversational implicature, first, by trying to show that some general theoretical sense can be made of the notion of a preferred interpretation; second, by defending the notion against its detractors and exposing the deficiencies of the proffered alternatives; and third, by showing that a rather simple first approximation to a theory of such things can give us coverage of a broad range of important interpretive phenomena. This is the thrust of the first two chapters.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Then I try to show just how useful and important such a theory of preferred interpretation is for our understanding of how language works. To make the point with maximum dramatic effect, I have gone for the linguistic jugular, as it were. On the one hand, I try to show that the phenomena of preferred intepretations force us into a radical reconstruction of the entire theory of meaning. On the other, I attempt to reduce much of the alleged grammar of anaphoracentral to many recent developments in syntaxto matters of preferred interpretation. I feel that these attacks are successful enough to lend powerful credence to the theory I provide.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|My ambitions, in this book at least, do not extend beyond this.

On the contrary, I believe that a theory of preferred interpretations is just another piece in the jigsaw puzzle of the theory of meaning, that complex multifaceted landscape which the explorers of twentieth-century philosophy and linguistics have proved to be rugged terrain indeed. Thus my modest ambitions contrast strikingly with another recent attempt to recast Grice's theory of implicature, viz. Sperber and Wilson's (1986) Relevance theory, which is offered to us as a wideranging cognitive principle from which all pragmatic facts follow just as do facts about human attention, memory, and so on. Nevertheless, I do not believe that my narrow, technical slant is devoid of general conclusions; on the contrary, I believe that the theory of preferred interpretation that I sketch, although crude, is sufficient to show that central problems in the theory of meaning and the theory of grammar have been completely misconstrued. A scalpel cuts deep just because it is thin.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|Finally, those who know other strands of my work may be puzzled that I should have written this book: the rationalist, universalist tinge may seem inconsistent with my current attempt to divert cognitive science into a proper consideration of social and cultural factors, or my previous efforts to understand some of the bases of social interaction. But I do not believe there is any inconsistency. Current perspectives on the relation between universal human nature and cultural factors often seem to me to be inverted: for example, language is held to be essentially universal, whereas language use is thought to be more open to cultural influences. But the reverse may in fact be far more plausible: there is obvious cultural codification of many aspects of language from phoneme to syntactic construction, whereas the uncodified, unnoticed, low-level background of usage principles or strategies may be fundamentally culture-independent. This is not to suggest that culture is a mere veneer that sticks just to the more rule-bound aspects of human behavior. Indeed, I think I have demonstrated that culture-specific semantic concepts can run deep in human thinking (Levinson 1996, 1997). But underlying presumptions, heuristics, and principles of usage may be more immune to cultural influence simply because they are the prerequisites for the system to work at all, preconditions even for learning language. Whether the principles explored in this book really have universal application is, given the primitive state of our knowledge in pragmatics, merely a working hypothesis, which at least seems to fit what we currently know. (Incidentally, the idea that usage principles may be much more uniform and simpler than the conventions\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

It may also help in the other direction, so to speak, by connecting to other, more complex, areas of pragmatics like the study of verbal interaction. Here, our patterns of preferred interpretation should provide an additional semiotic out of which the moves in social interaction must willy-nilly be constructed (see Levinson 1987a). And here, there are perhaps connections to broader strands of thinking in the social sciences, such as Bourdieu's (1977) notion of _habitus,_ a structure of dispositions that generates tendencies to act and interpret in certain ways.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\||   |   |

The answer depends on your interests. Students wishing simply to get a feel for the phenomena that modern Gricean pragmaticists wrestle with may find chapter 2 all they really need. Those with theoretical interests in the theory of meaning will find chapter 3 central, and they may want to work back to check the reasoning in chapters 1 and 2. Those students whose primary interests are in the relation between form and meaning will want to concentrate on chapters 2 and 4. But the reader who attempts to shortcut the development of the book in this way will need to use the index to check back on concepts developed earlier.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|This book presupposes some familiarity with the standard neo-Gricean or Radical Pragmatics approach to conversational implicature but treats only a portion of that subject. Levinson (1983, chap. 3) provides a textbook treatment that summarizes the Gricean approach and the work of Horn (1972, 1973), Gazdar (1979), Atlas and Levinson (1981), and others. Updates have been provided by Horn (1984, 1989: chap. 4 and 5 [which is also very useful bibliographically], 1992a, 1996b) and Huang (1994). The collections of Cole (1978, 1981) contain a number of relevant papers, as does the 1990 _16__th Proceedings of the Berkeley Linguistics Society._ The readers edited by Davis (1991) and, more extensively, by Kasher (1998) reprint in handy form critical papers by Grice and the important early paper by Harnish (1976), with much other relevant material. Grice's (1967) William James lectures are (largely) published, together with other papers, in Grice 1989 with an epilogue, and there is useful discussion of Grice's general philosophy (together with Grice's reply) in Grandy and Warner 1986.
