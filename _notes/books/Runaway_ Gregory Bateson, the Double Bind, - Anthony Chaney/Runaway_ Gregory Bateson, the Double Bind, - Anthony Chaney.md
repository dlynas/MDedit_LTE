## Introduction: Gregory Bateson and the Spirit of 1967

In a 1986 interview, the poet Allen Ginsberg was asked to look back on the year 1967. That was the year of psychedelia, the year of the Human Be-In, where San Francisco’s counterculture came out to the American mainstream. It was the year the Beatles’ _Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band_ was released, initiating a season that some called Vietnam Summer and others the Summer of Love. What was the true impact of that fabled year, Ginsberg was asked, and what remained of its spirit?

Ginsberg’s answer may be unexpected. Civilization was conscious now that “the planet as an ecological unity” was in danger, he said. Beyond changes in style and music, in sex and politics, beyond the drugs and liberation, the most significant and “permanent change” had to do with humankind’s relationship with the earth. “Remember,” Ginsberg said, “the notion of Armageddon apocalypse before the Sixties was considered eccentric, whereas now it’s a universal awareness.”[^1]

Ginsberg spent a good deal of the summer of 1967 not in San Francisco but in Italy and England. In July he attended a two-week-long London event called the Congress on the Dialectics of Liberation. Organized by the “anti-psychiatrist” R. D. Laing and his colleagues, this forum brought together radical writers, artists, social scientists, and political theorists, including Herbert Marcuse of the Frankfort School; Paul Goodman, the author of _Growing Up Absurd_; and civil rights activist Stokely Carmichael, who had spent the previous year stirring up audiences on the topic of Black Power. These voices mixed Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud, Gestalt psychology, Frantz Fanon and decolonization, and existentialist philosophy. They set one “down in the mire,” as the novelist Saul Bellow had complained a few years earlier, “of post-Renaissance, post-humanistic, post-Cartesian dissolution, next door to the Void.” The war in Vietnam, almost two years in escalation, and urban riots in progress in Newark and Detroit provided urgency to the gathering and tipped it toward talk of violent revolution.[^2]

The event’s many programs drew crowds large and small. A number of the participants were members of what seemed a rising nation of discontented, insurgent youth, and the crowd was laced with this movement’s self-styled leadership. Ginsberg himself had appeared at the old railroad roundhouse where the congress was held, on a panel with Laing, Carmichael, and Emmett Grogan, founder of a San Francisco cadre of artist-anarchists called the Diggers. Yet almost two decades after this event, as Ginsberg elaborated on his answer about the legacy of 1967 and the Summer of Love, he did not mention Laing, Carmichael, or Grogan. He didn’t mention Timothy Leary, Che Guevara, or any of the other cultural-political icons of that year. Instead, he spoke of Gregory Bateson.

Gregory Bateson (1904–80) was what might be called today an “outlier.” He was a generation older than Ginsberg. He was, and remains, relatively unknown. Bateson had never held an institutional post of any distinction. Yet he came from an illustrious family with roots deep in the British legacy of the life sciences. His father was the biologist William Bateson, who had pioneered the field of genetics. Gregory trained in the new field of anthropology and was part of a group of engineers, mathematicians, and social scientists who initiated concepts in systems and information theory in the Macy Conferences on Cybernetics. He had been married to Margaret Mead. In the 1950s, after his divorce from Mead, Bateson studied communication in a psychiatric clinic in Palo Alto and introduced the double-bind theory of schizophrenia. In 1967 he was sixty-three years old and was living in a sleepy Hawaiian beach town, studying dolphins. Not unlike Ginsberg, there was something of the rebel in him, demonstrated by his willingness as a scientist to move from discipline to discipline in a career where to specialize was to thrive.

Bateson had spoken at the London congress, too. Ginsberg had met and heard him. Very tall, with longish gray hair pushed back from a domed forehead, Bateson was informal and even careless in his posture and dress but rigorous in his thinking and talk. To the audience in London, he spoke of something called “the greenhouse effect.” Humankind’s large-scale burning of fossil fuels threatened a change in the earth’s climate, a melting of the polar ice caps, and a rising of sea levels worldwide. The greenhouse effect, together with a number of other threats to the environment, was evidence of an ecology undergoing what the systems engineers of the Macy Conferences called “runaway.” A system in runaway was a system out of balance and accelerating toward breakdown. It was a “general lemmings situation,” Ginsberg wrote to his friend the nature poet Gary Snyder.[^3]

Ginsberg’s glib remark belies how much the exposure to Bateson haunted him. It was a revelation, he recalled in the 1986 interview, that if man did _not_ destroy the earth by an atomic bomb “in one flash,” he might achieve the same end by “a slow poisoning of the atmosphere.” In his poem “Howl,” Ginsberg had reckoned with the emotional toll resulting from the threat of instantaneous atomic annihilation and the Cold War culture of containment at home and abroad. Now he confronted another kind of toll, another kind of apocalypse.[^4]

Ginsberg’s experience in London was an instance of what Richard Falk called “the apocalyptic encounter,” the stark confrontation with the unsustainability of modern ways of being and of perceiving, an encounter Falk described as the “essence” of the postmodern. This book takes Falk’s and Ginsberg’s claims seriously: that a shift in thinking about humankind and the environment is the underrecognized legacy of the 1960s and the foremost intellectual experience of our time.[^5]

Although the brainchild of R. D. Laing and his colleagues, the Congress on the Dialectics of Liberation took on a life of its own, driven by the concerns of a surging protest movement. Debate was most heated over how best to meet foreign and domestic imperialist oppression, by the expansion of consciousness or by militant resistance. Amid familiar calls for political liberation, Bateson raised the less familiar prospect of ecological limitation.

This book unpacks that London moment. It untangles the emerging ecological consciousness from the dissent and political activism with which it was intertwined. The emancipatory and anti-imperialist voices of the age lodged a critique of what was wrong with the modern world, but the ecological critique cut deeper. Fighting for freedom and self-determination was not a new concept. In contrast, ecological consciousness unsettled what it meant to be a human being.

Articulated by Bateson, the ecological consciousness reorganized perception away from the older concepts of substance, power, force, and impact and around a newer set of concepts that had been transforming philosophy, physics, and the life sciences for decades: information, complexity, uncertainty, and interrelationship. By shifting attention from social crisis to environmental crisis, Bateson gave his audience a kind of keyhole through which to glimpse this new “postmodern” science of complexity and interrelatedness and, in turn, a new accounting of reality. That new accounting suggested not greater autonomy but greater responsibility; it emphasized not emancipation but dependence. Bateson’s message resonated for many who already took a holistic view of the era’s various crises—who already saw individual neurosis, poverty and social unrest, the war in Vietnam, and environmental degradation as interrelated. But as Ginsberg discovered, that resonance raised prospects that were painful and repugnant to the modern mind and with which the postmodern mind has still not fully reckoned.

Repugnance, fear, and other unpleasant emotions are part of the force field the apocalyptic encounter invokes to ward off sustained contemplation. I take this as a sign that it draws close to fundamentals where our most cherished truths lie vulnerable.

### GINSBERG, BATESON, AND THE DOUBLE BIND

Toward the end of Jonathan Franzen’s novel _Freedom_, Walter, the much-abused environmentalist and moral center of the book, has a breakdown. He’s announcing plans for a future songbird preserve, a project he has negotiated on behalf of a corporate strip mining interest. Broadcast live on television, Walter’s appearance confirms his standing as a professional environmentalist working at the national level. It represents, too, the moral compromises Walter has had to make to achieve that standing. His personal life in turmoil, his careerism on display before the world, Walter falls apart, making a spectacle of himself with angry and inflammatory pronouncements. Just before he’s knocked off the podium, the last of his rhetorical restraint gives way, and he shouts, “WE ARE A CANCER ON THE PLANET! A CANCER ON THE PLANET!” However impolitic the admission, this must be what Walter truly believes, at least when he’s no longer able to control himself and is most in surrender to despair. There is something here that speaks to the repugnance I mentioned. In Walter’s testimony to his own apocalyptic encounter, hopelessness and self-hatred are intertwined.[^6]

A similar dynamic occurs on the other side of the political spectrum. There, apprehensions like Walter’s are plainly ridiculous. Environmentalism in its “extreme” form—“green guilt,” “Calvinism, minus God”—implies that “you should feel guilty for your very existence.” Environmentalism is dismissed as an ideology, a creed that gives people “a way of validating certain emotions”—cringing emotions, one assumes, better suited to a more superstitious time. One thinks of the procession of medieval penitents in Ingmar Bergman’s _The Seventh Seal_, whipping themselves to expiate the sins that had brought them the plague. “We are all sinners, doomed to die,” the novelist Michael Crichton scoffed in a much-reprinted 2003 speech, “unless we seek salvation, which is now called sustainability.” This characterization of environmentalism as a substitute or secular religion is commonplace, but the objection isn’t to religion, per se, but to what are perceived as its retrograde aspects: guilt, sin, irrationalism, self-abasement, and a decidedly un-modern lack of faith in human agency and technical prowess. Such thinking is “kooky,” said Virginia Postrel, editor of _Reason_ magazine. People “believe in solving problems,” they “don’t want to be peasants,” they “have a knack for innovating their way out of ‘crises.’” To think otherwise expresses, as Walter does, “an utter contempt for humanity.”[^7]

These are the depths to which one is transported by an apocalyptic encounter like Ginsberg’s. What is most feared or hidden, what must be most guarded against, what is most subject to ridicule, it seems, is the paralyzing funk, the state of self-loathing, the despair over human capacities, perceived as characteristic of an earlier age.[^8]

The 1967 connection between Ginsberg and Bateson was presaged by another from the Beat era. Ginsberg had dedicated his 1955 poem “Howl” to Carl Solomon, a friend who was diagnosed with schizophrenia and committed to the Rockland psychiatric hospital. Ginsberg’s mother, too, was institutionalized as a schizophrenic. In “Howl,” Ginsberg wrote about his mother’s predicament and about the experiences of Solomon, himself, and his friends in a world driven mad by a culture bent on self-destruction. That same year “Howl” was published, in 1956, Bateson and the research group he led at a veterans hospital in Palo Alto, California, published a paper that offered an environmental explanation for schizophrenia. The disease was perhaps not best understood, the paper proposed, as some chemical malfunction inside the victim’s body. Rather, schizophrenics were responding strategically to a communicational environment patterned by what Bateson called the double bind.[^9]

The double bind, stated briefly, was an inescapable paradox in which a message was refuted by its context. “Don’t be so obedient” was one such message. The context was an imperative; the message ordered the listener to ignore that context. One could neither comply nor escape complying. A child who learned to expect punishment when an alcoholic parent “gets the bottle out of the cupboard” and who was then punished for correctly demonstrating his or her fear of punishment—that was a child who might learn not to know what he or she knows. That was a child caught in a double bind.[^10]

The idea was sparked by something Bateson learned from the mathematicians and engineers of the Macy Conferences. A computer went into runaway when it met a paradox in its programming. This triggering of breakdown was not about force or energy; it was about information and the disorders of communication. Bateson applied the concept of runaway to the life sciences and called the paradox the double bind.

The trapped feeling, the sense of being pulled apart by contradiction, spoke to something in the postwar zeitgeist. Madness in general, and schizophrenia in particular, became a resonant metaphor, applicable across many registers. Modern people were “schizo” or “schizoid,” the modern mind was “divided,” and so on. Victims and families facing the heartbreak of mental illness were not necessarily well served by this climate of metaphorical promiscuity. But the double-bind concept was never about tracking down and eradicating the “cause” of schizophrenia. It was always bigger than that and was itself broadly resonant.[^11]

The double bind resembled other “impossible dilemma” concepts at midcentury, such as Albert Camus’s notion of the absurd, Reinhold Niebuhr’s reformulation of original sin, and, more whimsically, Joseph Heller’s “catch-22,” to which the double bind is often compared. Similar in formal terms, these impossible dilemma constructions expressed a return to the tragic sensibility in human life against the technological optimism of the modern age and its cult of progress. Camus’s claim was that any philosophy that didn’t acknowledge the absurd was shallow and escapist. Niebuhr insisted that any theology that didn’t acknowledge original sin was “insufficiently profound.” In a similar way, Bateson’s double bind restored profundity to naturalistic accounts of the human condition. What it might mean to restore profundity, I intend to explore. That’s what this book is about. But let a few general statements serve as a first stab at greater clarity.

The double-bind paradox distilled a stark confrontation with the failure of modes of organizing perception that are associated with the modern age. In terms of humankind’s relationship with its environment, it expressed the overwhelming trapped-ness and runaway still associated with ecological crisis—that painful experience when the “correct” response to environmental problems seems to produce no solution but only to exacerbate those problems at an accelerating rate. As a naturalistic concept, tied to the empirical world, the double-bind paradox gives these emotional experiences some purchase in the real, allowing us to investigate and contemplate them rather than dismiss them out of hand. As our environmental challenges grow larger, the double-bind paradox helps to expose the modern project of mastery over nature as shallow and escapist. It proposes the more _profound_ notion of responsibility without control.

### BATESON AND THE ECOLOGICAL CONSCIOUSNESS

Gregory Bateson’s emergence as a public intellectual begins, roughly speaking, with the publication of the double-bind hypothesis in 1956 and ends with the publication in 1972 of _Steps to an Ecology of Mind_, the career-spanning collection of essays that would become the bedrock of his legacy. Exactly what that legacy is is difficult to get a bead on. He fits into no clear canon. Much of today’s science, though certainly not all, has long since shed the strong materialism that Bateson disfavored. It includes and continues to investigate the concept of information, which Bateson strived to make central in the life sciences. Because this shift from substance to information is spread across so many disciplines, no single descriptive term has emerged to capture it. Broad phrases such as the “cognitive revolution” and “complexity studies” are attempts to do justice to this transformation. The concept of information is central to linguistics and semiotic theory—the logical analysis of communication—and the crossover influence of these disciplines has run from philosophy to the social sciences to literary studies to biology and back again. And this is only to cover the shift as it applies to the academy. The revolution in digital technologies—the age of information—has remade the global economy and the experience of everyday life.

Bateson’s thought bears on all of this development, though to what degree is as of yet unclear. The reason for this is partly due to the nature of scientific work, which is more about the present than the past, and the novel contributions of individuals to that work is less important than collaboration across the field. Whereas, for instance, the double-bind hypothesis today gets little play (and scant respect) in the field of clinical psychiatry, the present constitution of that field is unthinkable without the techniques of family and group therapies that came out of the environmental view of psychological disorder that the double bind so vividly illustrated. Add to that the fact that Bateson did not devote his life’s work to clinical psychiatry or indeed to any particular disciplinary practice.

Bateson moved from discipline to discipline as the needs of his own intellectual inquiry demanded and within the limits that opportunity allowed. In consequence, individual thinkers from across the disciplines—environmentalists, philosophers, postmodern theorists, and scientists of all kinds—cite Bateson’s influence on their work, while overviews attempting to chart general change tend to mention him in passing, if at all. Bateson’s work pointed in a particular direction more than it refined pathways already mapped out. University of California–Berkeley anthropologist and neuroscientist Terrence Deacon has said this of Bateson: “Like many who were far ahead of their time, his legacy has been and will probably remain thin for a while longer, as the world catches up.” Was Bateson marginal, or is he, as a _New York Times_ commentator has recently put it, “a lost giant of twentieth-century intellectual history”? The answer to both questions may be yes.[^12]

Establishing Bateson’s canonical status is not, however, the aim of this book. Nor is this book a proper biography of Gregory Bateson. Rather, I mean to use Bateson’s life and thought as a contextual vehicle with which to break through the emotional force field surrounding the apocalyptic encounter so that at least one instance of it may be explored and its meaning may be better understood. I use the term “contextual vehicle” because Bateson’s life and thought transport one into exactly those historical contexts necessary to grasp that meaning.

Bateson’s father, William Bateson, began his career as a scientist amid the bitter late nineteenth-century conflict in the British life sciences over accounts of evolution in the aftermath of Charles Darwin. Strong Darwinists such as T. H. Huxley fought a public battle against the Bishop Wilberforces of the world. But at the same time, they held biologists such as William Bateson, who were interrogating Darwin more critically, to be suspect of an unreconstructed romanticism too friendly to the church. Although his pioneering work in Mendelian genetics brought William Bateson into the Darwinist fold, it also required of him a certain intellectual contortion he later came to regret. The position he struck fell apart at the onset of the Great War. The war and its aftermath delivered a tragic blow to the Bateson family: the loss of Gregory’s two older brothers, in whom William Bateson had hoped to secure the survival of his thought.

Gregory came of age in the 1920s, and he imbibed the rebellious bohemianism of that period. But the form of bohemianism he enacted made most others seem like affectation. Bateson spent the bulk of the interwar years about as deep in the exotic as one might get, doing anthropological fieldwork among tribal peoples in New Guinea and Bali. It was during this time he married the indomitable Margaret Mead, who had already achieved success and not a little notoriety with her book _Coming of Age in Samoa_ (1928). Together with Mead, Ruth Benedict, and other anthropologists, Bateson helped advance a social scientific avant-garde of the period’s more general progressivism. During World War II, working as an anthropologist with the Office of Strategic Services, Bateson would apply his anthropological ideas to the war effort. But he would emerge from the war in a state of depression, with the sense that he had betrayed both his and his father’s belief of the proper practice of science as a near-sacred calling.

As the consolidation of American power in the aftermath of the war (the so-called liberal consensus) took shape in ideological opposition to Soviet communism, the U.S. government opened its doors to the social sciences, even to those branches most critical of the American experiment. Bateson’s marriage to Mead crumbled amid his refusal to accompany her through these doors. The refusal took a toll on Bateson. It alienated him in the specialized and increasingly careerist atmosphere of postwar science. But it also gave him the transdisciplinary freedom that would prove crucial to the development of his thought. Bateson’s refusal to join the liberal consensus anticipated “the Great Refusal” of the discontented youth of the 1960s, which was in turn decisive to the collapse of that consensus. This anticipation also helps to explain the “fit” between Bateson and the audience that would prove so receptive to his thought.[^13]

This was an audience of non-scientists, and in a climate of social and political unrest, most prominently surrounding the war in Vietnam, it was an audience for whom discontentment had become a kind of moral pain. “What do you do when a child is on fire?” was how one dissident of the period put it. It was an audience sensitive to the critique of modern ways of thinking and being but also one pressed by an urgency to act.[^14]

This moral crisis, though a direct response to the war in Vietnam, can be understood as a local outbreak of a more general problem with the strong materialism of modern science. Discontentment with mechanistic depictions of reality was prominent among the complaints of Berkeley students involved in the free speech movement in 1964, prior to the war’s escalation. Students claimed they were being shaped into machine parts, punch cards, cogs in a vast, malicious system by the “multiversity”—an institution corrupted by its alliance with the military-industrial complex, “the technocracy,” “the Combine”—the great malicious Moloch of Ginsberg’s “Howl.” These students sought liberation from a machine existence to lead lives of relevance and meaning. Models for both liberation and meaningfulness were available in a decade of civil rights activism and, later on, in groups associated with the New Left. Models could also be found in the program promulgated by the “spiritual generation” in San Francisco across the bay by Ginsberg and the Beats. This model was about rebellion against and liberation from the constraints demanded by a schizoid culture, especially those constraints regarding recreational drug use and sexual behavior.[^15]

During a year and a half of war escalation, a movement against the war grew, bolstered by this insurgent youth nation and encouraged by coalitions between the approaches represented by the available models—the civil rights activists, the New Left, the spiritual generation. But the same urgency that created convergence between models created pressures around any program for action. Change was called for, but what form should it take? Positions among radicals tended to divide along the lines of the ancient debate over where change is properly located: in culture or in structure, in ways of thinking or in collective action against the institutions of power. To simplify the division for the purpose of argument: “culturalists” located the necessity for change on the “inside” and advocated a program aimed at hearts and minds; “structuralists” located that necessity on the “outside” and advocated a program of political revolution. The debate was not a new one, but it was shot through with the prospect of violence. If there was any single public event where the debate over the locus of change and its implications for violent action was played out, it was the event Ginsberg and Bateson had attended in London, the Congress on the Dialectics of Liberation. There, as one participant put it, “the revolutionary left met the mindblowers.”[^16]

It was here, amid a hunger for programs of action, that Bateson interrogated action itself. Consciousness was partial, screening only an arc of what was a much more complex cybernetic circuit. That partial view introduced a pathological error that the greater system had to somehow absorb. What worried Bateson were the collective actions of scale that had come to predominate modern industrialization. The results were _pathologies of scale_ that threw the system out of balance and set it on its runaway path to disaster. As exemplified in Ginsberg’s response to Bateson’s message, the portent of disaster linked to the bomb was extended beyond mere human aggression and pointed to something more cherished and fundamental in human nature itself. At the same time, it shifted attention away from social relations and called attention to ecological relations.

In Ginsberg’s case, a shift from human-human relations to human- environment relations was not wholly new. On the night in 1955 when Ginsberg first read “Howl” in public, Gary Snyder read “The Berry Feast,” a poem representative of the Buddhist discipline of reverence Snyder brought to his writing about nature. Bateson’s message, however, was on the one hand constructed in the authoritative language of science and on the other rather more analogous to the Christian concepts of original sin, judgment, and the prophetic tradition. This may partly explain the sobered, chastened quality of Ginsberg’s reaction. Bateson’s critique of action complicated the liberationist character of both culturalist and structuralist responses by placing focus on the more central problem of human agency. If what was called for in the human-environmental relationship was some kind of atonement, it would not be atonement through new freedoms but perhaps through new checks on freedom, not least of which would be a repudiation of what Bateson termed, variously, “the instrumental way of life,” “the purposive philosophy,” and “our philosophy of control.” Bateson’s stress on dependency was an even further affront to the modern cult of the individual and suggested that renunciation itself was a species of control and therefore beyond human capacities. This was the essence of the bind. Certainly, Rachel Carson had raised the prospect of ecological crisis as spiritual crisis in _Silent Spring_, her seminal work of 1962, but when it came to concrete solutions, she too had proposed addressing the crisis with better control.[^17]

In 1967, at the Congress on the Dialectics of Liberation, Bateson’s ideas were avidly received by a radicalized audience steeped in the literature of alienation and hungry for a new worldview. But these were also the ideas that aggravated the uncertainties and fears generated by this group’s political and cultural experiments in living a new worldview and by its factious, ongoing debate over the nature of revolution and the proper locus of change. Any new ecological worldview, insofar as it could be imagined, blurred boundaries and destabilized the human self in ways similar to those described by the period’s psychedelic enthusiasts. But it also threatened to sink the human subject into nature to the extent that this subject was no longer recognizable and moral action could no longer be clearly discerned. Did ecological consciousness call for a posthumanism that would expunge the hard-won moral achievements of a millennium of humanist thought? Does an indictment of human agency preclude the collective action many believe necessary to address social injustice and arrest modernity’s destructive path?

The apocalyptic encounter generates obstacles that remain for a postmodernism that wishes to retain the commitment to human dignity and egalitarianism that represents the best of the modern project. As Jedidiah Purdy puts it in his recent book, _After Nature_, the understanding that “we are not entities but ecologies” and other “strange intuitions of posthumanism” continue to trouble our striving to grasp the political meaning of our new ecological imagination. But all were implicit in Bateson’s address to the London congress.[^18]

### BATESON AND THE AGE OF CATASTROPHE

In his masterful overview _The Passion of the Western Mind,_ Richard Tarnas identifies Bateson’s double-bind concept as an accurate distillation of the dilemma at which the Western mind had arrived by the middle of the twentieth century. The dilemma, as Tarnas summed it up, was that we perceive ourselves as meaning-making souls within a universe that is “entirely indifferent to that quest, soulless in character, and nullifying in its effects.” This speaks to the resonance of the double-bind concept. It also suggests that there is a much broader way one might tell this story.[^19]

In this telling, the story is about the exhaustion of modern thought played out against what historian Eric Hobsbawm called the Age of Catastrophe (1914–45). The Great War, rising out of the inequities and conflicts of the modern political and economic orders; worldwide economic collapse; the rise of genocidal authoritarian regimes in the Soviet Union, Germany, and Japan; and World War II—all were knitted together in causal loops and packed into the space of three decades. Together, they made a troubling case against the achievements of Western civilization and the promise of the modern worldview: that the liberation of the individual, under the auspices of rational humanism and the scientific method, would lead to material and social progress. The broadest way to understand the emerging ecological consciousness is as the closing argument, so to speak, in this case.[^20]

The critic Lewis Mumford would have sympathized with this general sketch. What I called “the promise of the modern worldview,” Mumford called the New World Promise. As for “worldview,” Bateson preferred the term “epistemology,” which he used in an idiosyncratic way. A transformation as fundamental as that from the medieval to the modern necessarily entails a transformation in the way perception is organized and in how reality is thought to be known. That’s what I mean by worldview, roughly—the “everyday metaphysics,” the concepts and metaphors with which reality is semiconsciously accounted for. These deep-down truths, not often consulted or revised, are the depths, following Ginsberg and Falk, that the apocalyptic encounter speaks to and disturbs.[^21]

Saul Bellow, as quoted above, was himself disturbed by what he perceived as “post-Renaissance, post-humanistic, post-Cartesian dissolution,” and his categories are useful here. Renaissance humanism affirmed man’s place among the higher beings, apart from the brute beasts, apart from the rest of nature, and championed man’s ability to shape the natural world as he saw fit. (“Man” is the proper term here, for this process was gendered, to be sure.) René Descartes and the thinkers of the scientific revolution built on and refined these affirmations by drawing a sharp line, as a first principle, between matter and the individual mind. Prior to that, the line had been rather porous in comparison. The modern, in contrast, would increasingly claim mind as its own.[^22]

By now this is a familiar story. The postulates of Descartes and Isaac Newton allowed causality to be explained in a mechanistic, quantitative, linear fashion, translatable into the language of mathematics. In this manner, the mind-matter line was leveraged to construct new forms of power and order. Old constraints were de-authorized; everything on the matter side of the line (including women, children, and “others,” when deemed expedient) was freely available for use by the individual mind of man. The notion of freedom was paramount: the freedom to think and act, apart from received knowledge; the freedom to build a new body of knowledge based on rigorous inquiry into nature; the freedom to use that knowledge for greater mastery over nature via technical prowess; the freedom to fashion, so to speak, a seat of command.[^23]

Criticism of this procedure was ongoing. Much of the criticism focused on the incoherence of the central mind-matter split. In accordance with the new scientific modes of inquiry, materialist accounts of reality were based on measurable, quantifiable, empirical evidence present to the human senses or that could be made present via technological means. In contrast, phenomena not present in this way—value, judgment, purpose, and the like—belonged to the transcendent mind, spirit, or soul of the individual and was explained as a gift of God. This content was prevalent in supernaturalist and mytho-theological accounts of reality, but it must be noted that belief in the supernatural is not required to recognize that “mental” or “spiritual” phenomena not present to the senses is nevertheless pervasive in human experience. The contents of mind include such phenomena as how we feel about things, what perspective we take on things, the what-might-be, the what-might-have-been, and all the ways one thing can be made to signify another thing, in language or in gesture. None of these phenomena are present to the senses, none are locatable in matter, yet they are the human stock-in-trade.[^24]

The situation, as Tarnas puts it, became “profoundly unintelligible.” Incoherence between mind-exclusive and mind-inclusive accounts of reality made for further incoherence between numerous and much argued-over pairings: fact and value, means and ends, science and religion, nature and culture, and so on. As the modern moved into its later nineteenth-century phase, strong materialists attempted to provide coherence by explaining mind-oriented phenomena as derivative of and thus reducible to material interactions at the microscopic level. The contents of mind, so common to human experience, were explained as epiphenomenal, as a kind of froth upon the physical-chemical processes of the real, material world. Despite almost constant attack, this reductionism came to dominate the modern worldview. Marxism, Darwinism, Freudianism—those interpretations of the most influential theorists of modernity’s later phase—all partook of it.[^25]

Thus, whatever one calls this strong materialism, whether “positivism or agnosticism or scientific naturalism” (to quote William James, himself casting about for a term), critics objected not only to the incoherence between mind- and matter-oriented accounts of reality but also to the subsequent granting of greater authority to materialist accounts and the increasing delegitimization of accounts that included mind. It was as if the modern devaluation of the contents of mind resulted in “the disenchantment of the world,” in Max Weber’s enduring phrase. The critique of disenchantment was commonly put in starker theological terms: disenchantment meant the loss of God. Friedrich Nietzsche’s assault on mind-oriented accounts posed for him, as his American interpreter Walter Kaufman put it, the “greatest and most persistent problem” of “whether universally valid values and a meaningful life are at all possible in a godless world.” In the well-known phrase commonly attributed to Dostoyevsky’s fictional character Ivan Karamazov, without God, everything was permitted.[^26]

This was only the most pointed expression of what was, in general, the modern problem of value. When commentators speak of the “acids of modernity,” they refer to a burning away of the apparatus surrounding the attribution of value. The result was the modern experience of alienation. Certainly, the modern worldview had championed value-focused concepts, such as natural rights, open and rational discourse, democracy, and the legitimacy of individual experience. But in modernity’s later phase, even these suffered corrosion. “If there is no higher law,” Walter Lippmann wrote in a 1937 updating of Dostoyevsky, “there is no ground on which anyone can challenge the power of the strong to exploit the weak.”[^27]

Against charges that the strong materialism of the modern worldview drained human society of its moral foundations, defenders typically responded by holding the line between the human and the environment and by leveraging that line for greater power. They labeled critics romantics, dogmatists, idealists, and sentimentalists and charged them with clinging to the notion that moral values might be found out there, across the line. Representative was the naturalist T. H. Huxley’s insistence that there was “no sanction for morality in the ways of the cosmos.” The cosmos was mindless, and any argument otherwise was to rationalize from preconceived ideas and to read those ideas into nature. The point would be an important one. The romantic impulse was vulnerable to the reckless reading into nature of such cultural concepts as nation, race, destiny, and the _Volk_.[^28]

Still, there is some irony in the fact that Huxley was writing in defense of Darwinism, for in Darwinism there was no component of the modern worldview that better lent itself to reckless use. As technological advances continued to solidify the modern worldview and its political and economic orders, Darwinism delivered what seemed the final blow to accounts of reality that allowed for the contents of mind. In Darwinism, human ideals and aspirations became reducible to organisms in ruthless battle over resources and living space, driven by some brute life force the theory left unexplained. The promise of the modern was to raise humanity, through individual freedom and the rational procedures of the scientific method, above the ancient law of “might is right.” To many, Darwinism seemed to give that law a new modern footing.[^29]

This was the context in which the Age of Catastrophe would unfold. When the atrocities and modes of coercion the West had long been perpetrating in Africa, Asia, and the Americas were transferred to European soil, the result was an explosion of barbarism, amplified as never before by industrial technologies of scale. World War II, the last and worst catastrophe of the Age of Catastrophe, ended in a victory over the latest madness, but that victory was tainted by the invention and use of the atomic bomb. For critics of modern disenchantment and the problem of value, the bomb and its association with American power became the focus of the tragic and paradoxical failure of the modern worldview.

Allen Ginsberg’s poem “Howl” was very much a work in this vein, a broad religious indictment of the strong materialism that had culminated in the bomb. “Howl” was an attack on Moloch, the leviathan born of the modern line drawn between spirit and matter, and on the ravage it left on the human psyche and civilization. Ginsberg and his cohort were a generation “beat,” in a sense of being defeated and overwhelmed by futility, and who responded by seeking the sublime—the “beatific.”[^30]

“Howl” was an initiatory document for the period historians have called—again, inspired by Hobsbawm—the “Long Sixties,” roughly 1955–75. This way of describing the period provides for a continuity between the discontentment of the Beats and that of a later generation, born in the aftermath of the Age of Catastrophe, “in the shadow of the atom bomb.” In 1967, a decade after the publication of “Howl,” Ginsberg was the most prominent living representative of that continuity, and his role was to pass the torch from the Beats to “the spiritual generation” of San Francisco and the other bohemian enclaves around the country. Ginsberg enacted his role in January 1967, at the Human Be-In, in Golden Gate Park. It was an ecstatic moment. Before television cameras and a massive crowd, he chanted, played finger cymbals, and danced.[^31]

But later that summer, at the London gathering, hearing Bateson speak sobered him. Back in San Francisco, writing anonymously in _The Digger Papers_ about his reaction to Bateson and the greenhouse effect, Ginsberg contemplated an earth without human inhabitants: “If there’s 400 feet of water over the continents, that’ll leave more room for the porpoises . . .” His contemplation of “more room for the porpoises” was a posthumanist gesture of a kind that would characterize an emerging ecological consciousness. It was not only that the earth didn’t require human beings but also that the earth was likely better off without them. In consideration of what he had heard from Bateson in London, Ginsberg asked himself “as deep a question as ever,” whether or not it was worthwhile to go on.[^32]

This is where this book ends, when Ginsberg, representative of a certain response to the failed promise of the modern worldview, had his apocalyptic encounter, so that in the days following he would ask himself “as deep a question as ever.” The prospect of ecological catastrophe redoubled the meaning of the bomb and extended its implications beyond the social problem of human aggression. The source of the problem ran deeper than that, to the inherent error in human instrumentality that Bateson had spoken of in London. Amplified by modern technology to levels of scale, that error had tipped the earth’s ecology into runaway, and the more the human collective responded in kind, the faster the runaway accelerated. Civilization didn’t have to wait for some rogue paranoid from _Dr. Strangelove_ to crack the nuclear fail-safes. The explosions had already begun.[^33]

This book unpacks the cultural and historical context of this moment in terms of the thought and activities of Gregory Bateson through the first half of the Long Sixties. The meaning of this period is unsettled, and not only among historians. But by many if not most accounts, the Long Sixties was the period during which the foundational premises and tacit assumptions of the modern worldview, so long contested, were finally broken down and rethought to a degree that a new worldview could be spoken of, with premises and assumptions composing an emerging postmodernity. The term “postmodern” is also contested, but my claim is reasonable if a postmodern agenda is understood to address, as physicist David Bohm put it, “our attitude toward the problem of physical reality.” It is reasonable if a postmodern agenda is understood to include an effort to repair, in Donna Haraway’s phrase, “the discredited breach of nature and culture” and thus the connection between any given account of reality and the set of values that it implies.[^34]

Bateson contributed to that agenda at an early stage of transition. Like so many others, Bateson’s thought challenged strong materialist accounts of reality and their persistent holding of the dualist line. Because he approached the problem from the life sciences, as someone trained in the methods of natural history, he didn’t downplay the faculty of reason or propose any suspension of nature’s fundamental laws. He didn’t indulge in mysticism, and yet, like other social scientists of his time, he neither excluded nor delegitimized matters of value and emotion. By drawing on science’s submerged protomodern traditions to build on a postwar body of thought then known as “cybernetics,” Bateson proposed a richer naturalism, grounded in the empirical world but not reducible to the mechanisms of its tiniest units. Rather than hold the line between humankind and its environment, Bateson explored its permeability. He opened up the line to what he called “the Heraclitan flood.”[^35]

More than that, however, Bateson’s thought is representative, in rather the same way that Ginsberg’s poetry is representative of a broader project across the sciences, humanities, and the arts. That unfinished project aims for a more accurate, more coherent, and more satisfactory picture of reality, one that reintegrates accounts of the material world with nonmaterial phenomena common in life—what William James called “mind-stuff” and what others referred to as “soul.”[^36]

Surely today, many of the ideas Bateson explored concerning the human relationship with its environment are far from revolutionary. That the material world is not passive to our actions, that it does not respond in mindless obedience but rather answers back and affects us in turn—this is a way of perceiving reality that holds much sway in contemporary hearts, well into the mainstream population. The political and economic orders and their institutions are not as open and flexible as human hearts, and the failure of these orders and their institutions can be charged to their defense of the modern worldview against the change the ecological consciousness calls for. Not grasping the differential between the shift toward a fundamentally different way of organizing perception and the strong resistance to it is a deficiency in understanding ourselves as persons and as communities. We require stories to speak to this deficiency. Between the covers of this book is one.  

## One: The Way to Waimanalo

Gregory Bateson spent most of the 1960s watching dolphins. He had worked with the famous bottlenose, _Flipper_-type dolphins in the Virgin Islands earlier in the decade, but by 1965, his subjects were of a small species known as “spinners.” They were held in an immense 300,000-gallon tank, an “oceanarium” called Bateson’s Bay, newly built for Bateson’s research at the Oceanic Institute in Waimanalo, Hawaii. Waimanalo was a sleepy village on the eastern coast of Oahu, across the Wa’ahila Ridge from Honolulu and Waikiki. Bateson lived there in a ramshackle beach house with his third wife, Lois, and their two sons, John and Eric, each from a previous marriage. He would arrive at the institute early in the morning for his observations, well before the dolphins were scheduled to work with the trainers for their regular shows at Sea Life Park, the Oceanic Institute’s sister facility.

Everyone called him Gregory. Karen Pryor, cofounder of the institute and the park and a pioneer in dolphin training, remembered Bateson fondly in a memoir of her work there, _Lads before the Wind_. She recalled him, at sixty-one years of age, as the institute’s “resident guru,” a favorite among colleagues and trainers at the park. Dressed down in dungarees and “the world’s oldest sneakers,” his charm mixed a rumpled informality with a clipped Cambridge accent and courtly manners. He was very tall but the kind of tall man who didn’t like to tower over people, hiding his six-feet-four-inch height with a slightly stooping posture. Once he finished his morning’s observations, he ambled around the grounds, smoking, preoccupied with his thoughts, but not unapproachable. If you were a colleague and met him on the path, Pryor wrote, Bateson would likely share the question he was currently struggling with, putting it to you with a squint and a genial smile. “If you had been born with two hands on your left arm, would both of them be left hands? Or would one of them be a right hand?”[^1]

As well-liked as Bateson was, Pryor and the others were unsure whether those thoughts were perfectly sensible. If they knew of Bateson outside their acquaintance with him, it was probably for his double-bind theory of schizophrenia, or perhaps through his involvement in the Macy Conferences of the late 1940s and 1950s. They may have known of him as an anthropologist, once married to America’s most well known anthropologist, Margaret Mead. If they were aware he had published in disparate fields, that range was likely to be both intimidating and, at least among the more accomplished of his colleagues, a little suspect. As Pryor remembered, “People who were outstanding in any one of Gregory’s fields tended to brand him a dilettante, because how could he possibly know all about their field and still have time left over, which they did not have, to know all about several other fields, too?” It was a fair question. “Besides,” she added, with a touch of hyperbole, “you couldn’t understand a thing he said.”[^2]

This statement captures much about Bateson, about how he was perceived, and about the life path that had led him to Waimanalo. Whether or not the charge of dilettantism was accurate, Bateson in his seventh decade now suffered the dilettante’s fate. Without steady salary or pension, his personal finances were precarious. At the Oceanic Institute, he was “Associate Director of Research,” but the title disguised the fact that his funding came from a time-limited grant he had brought in on his own. This was the common arrangement during his long years of research. Bateson had worked and taught steadily as a scientist for decades, but he had never secured tenure within an institution or even scarcely tried. There was a certain freedom in this. With an income supplied from a combination of grants and loosely related institutional contracts, oversight was almost nonexistent. He could follow his inquiries wherever they led. But they had led across traditional disciplines, where fewer and fewer could accompany him, and those he met on the other side “couldn’t understand a thing he said.” Although today the ideas one might characterize as Batesonian are far from unfamiliar, at the time Bateson himself wondered whether there were more than a handful of people alive who might have understood him. To be a solitary genius, widely renowned—someone like Albert Einstein, say—was one thing. But it was something very different to be in a Hawaiian backwater appreciated (and that, with reservations) only by the locals.[^3]

Nevertheless, Bateson’s moves from field to field were not characteristic of some restlessness or whimsical search for novelty but rather of persistence and—especially in times of difficulty and frustration—a return to what was most familiar to him. Bateson had been trained as an anthropologist at St. John’s College, Cambridge, but as the son of the British pioneer geneticist William Bateson, his basic approach to science was through the methods of natural history. That practice favored observation over experimentation, organisms over their microscopic building blocks, the out-of-doors over the laboratory, theory over application. In the past, as an anthropologist, and now as an ethologist specializing in dolphins, Bateson brought this naturalist’s legacy to his materials in novel ways, but because his mode of scientific practice was based on values at odds with mainstream science, he was much less able to draw on the resources of its institutions.

Over and over throughout his life these values had been tried. War, especially, had put his values to the test, and the shame Bateson felt over the failure of that test had stayed with him. Bateson was indeed free of oversight and the confines of a single discipline. But in the climate of the postwar, a period when power recruited and rewarded the kind of science he opposed, Bateson’s professional and personal decisions became increasingly isolating. They had led him to Waimanalo and its dolphins.

### SCIENCE, PHILOSOPHY, AND WHAT WORKS

Bateson may have been a likable eccentric to Pryor and her trainers at Sea Life Park, but they were well aware he disapproved of their methods. They employed a version of operant conditioning, an application of the stimulus-response behavioral theory of B. F. Skinner. Bateson’s dislike of behaviorism and operant conditioning, Pryor wrote in her memoir, had “an almost religious intensity.”[^4]

Dolphin training was new territory, exciting and often frustrating, and operant conditioning was a new application. Trainers reinforced behaviors, first by marking them with a whistle, then by following the whistle with a reward. Recent advances in refrigeration made fresh fish now readily available, and dolphins learned very quickly what a whistle meant. Repeated whistles allowed trainers to reinforce small movements and to build them into elaborate acts. This was called “shaping.” A single pivot leftward, reinforced repeatedly, could be shaped into a full leftward circle. Through this technique, the dolphins at Sea Life Park were trained to jump through hoops and over bars, to pull levers, and to bump rings and balls with their noses. Punishment was categorically rejected. The dolphins were never struck with sticks or tugged with chains—methods customary at that time for the training of circus animals. Rather, operant conditioning was a technique that, as the trainers at Sea Life Park saw it, allowed for mutual communication between dolphin and trainer. “It was entirely a 50–50 basis,” Pryor explained, with each species sharing in an experience of enjoyable play.[^5]

If Bateson disagreed, Pryor attributed it to a more general bias against Skinner that existed both inside and outside the scientific community in the years after the war. According to this bias, Skinner perceived living creatures as mechanistic, “empty organisms” whose behaviors were wholly conditioned by the environment and therefore programmable. The bias, sometimes exaggerated, partook of dystopian, totalitarian visions of a society in which enlightened scientists shaped human beings into useful citizens, as presented in the satiric _Brave New World_ (1931) and later, more sincerely, in Skinner’s own _Beyond Freedom and Dignity_.[^6]

Bateson did share in something of this bias. Skinnerian methods represented to him a scientific practice that sidestepped theory in favor of quantifiable data generated in laboratories. As Bateson saw it, laboratories were “desert places,” and Skinner-box stimulus-response experiments were “phony problem situations” in which the subject, either human or animal, was persuaded into caring about “trifles”—meaningless outside the lab relationship. Bateson appreciated the skills of Pryor and her staff and surely valued their rejection of physical punishment. But the pools in which the dolphins were trained were no less laboratories for being outdoors in the Hawaiian sunshine, and whether or not the animals were struck with rods was not, for Bateson, the substantive issue. In either case, of reward or of punishment, the trainers were adept at making clear to the animal that the selected behaviors were the only behaviors acceptable, “and no nonsense about it.”[^7]

In Pryor’s view, Bateson’s problem with operant conditioning was that he did not want to believe that it worked, and he found it “infuriating” when it did. She saw Bateson as both a scientist and a philosopher and his disapproval as an instance where these dual identities didn’t mesh: “I found Gregory’s stand unbecoming to the scientist in him, but perfectly acceptable in the philosopher, who may hate the fact that the sky is blue, if he wishes.” The suggestion here is that, had Bateson been more of a scientist, he would have set aside the value judgment and accepted the facts: operant conditioning worked.[^8]

Pryor’s comment drew on familiar divisions characteristic of the modern worldview: is and ought, fact and value. By the middle of the twentieth century, the separation of the sciences and the humanities, with the social sciences often uncomfortably in between, had been scrupulously described and much worried over. Appeals for a bridge between what C. P. Snow called “the two cultures” were numerous, but because it was so hard to imagine how such a bridge would be made, any attempt often remained merely rhetorical. Pryor’s remarks are illustrative of the rough consensus among those wary of creeping romanticism: the division between the sciences and the humanities simply had to be accepted. The consensus was one aspect of something more general, a kind of working dualism that allowed humanity to get on with things and move forward.[^9]

Whether or not it infuriated him, Bateson was not surprised that the relationship between animal and trainer, under the procedures of operant conditioning, would “work” as it did. He wasn’t surprised that it resulted in a dolphin jumping through a hoop on command or leaping over a bar. For Bateson, whether or not it worked wasn’t the question. The important question was about science itself. Why was science justified by utility, in the first place? Why was it defined by what “worked”? This was more a question of perception, if perception were not simply regarded as an immaterial mental activity relegated to the world of philosophy but taken as the legitimate content of natural history.

### A FATHER’S LEGACY

At the time of Bateson’s birth in 1904, natural history was already considered an old-fashioned mode of science. This is true despite the fact that Charles Darwin was and remains the best-known example of the naturalist in the British tradition. Naturalists were people who did what Darwin had done. He boarded the _Beagle_; he did fieldwork in the wild; he observed nature, devised theory, and conducted experiments to test the theory and to fill in its gaps. Necessarily, too, he wrote. He communicated his thinking, to test it against the thought of others. These activities made up the pursuit of natural history, and they were the primary concern of the particular world in which Gregory Bateson grew up.[^10]

His father, William Bateson, was the son of John Bateson, the headmaster at St. John’s College, Cambridge. William Bateson was a talented naturalist. He came of age in the 1880s, in the midst of controversies over Darwinism, both religious and scientific. The greatest scientific controversy over Darwin’s theory involved the process of heredity. The current understanding was that an offspring received from its parents traits in blended form. This posed, however, a logical problem to Darwin’s law of natural selection. How could a trait prove to be adaptive over successive generations if, in each generation, blending reduced its “strength” by half? The inability of Darwinism to answer this question left the door open to its critics among scientists, particularly the vitalists, and this was a door the more prominent Darwinists wanted very much closed. The vitalists saw all life as infused with an indwelling, animating principle, unanalyzable by empirical investigation. They tended to favor Lamarckian theories of the inheritance of acquired characteristics. The appeal of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck’s theory was that it allowed an organism some determination over the long-term adaptive success of succeeding generations rather than leaving this success, as the Darwinists seemed to do, completely to “pure chance.”[^11]

Early in his career, William Bateson was considered something of a heretic by the Darwinists and was partly shut out of their circle due to his persistence in pressing the logical problem of heredity. His research trips to the lakes of central Russia and to northern Egypt in the late 1880s were attempts to gather data to counter the accepted Darwinian understanding of heredity as continuous. William’s idea was that evolution occurred discontinuously, in steps. In 1894, he published a book meant to bolster that argument. _Materials for the Study of Variation Treated with Especial Regard to Discontinuity in the Origin of Species_ built its case by way of illustration. Over 200 woodcuts of plants, insects, and animals of all kinds, including human beings, offered instances of asymmetry and oddity: six-fingered hands, two-headed turtles, off-centered nipples, and supernumerary teats. A naturalist learned more about the norm, William believed, by attending to abnormalities. In the abnormal, one might better grasp the formal relations less pronounced in the seeming givens of the norm. “Cherish your exceptions,” William liked to say, and _Materials_ demonstrated the maxim perfectly. Here was a reference book of recorded monstrosities; meanwhile, the so-called transitional forms of current theory were more hypothesized about than actually found. To those in the scientific community, dominated by the Darwinists, William’s 700-page tome—the culmination of years of research and field collection—was unwelcome, and they ignored it. Only his father’s position at St. John’s, and a job overseeing the kitchens at Cambridge, allowed William a place on the scientific fringe.[^12]

Then everything changed. In 1900 William took a train trip to London to give a lecture to the Royal Horticultural Institution. On the way, he reviewed a decades-old article by an obscure Austrian monk concerning experiments in pea hybridization. William saw in a flash the article’s significance in regard to the issue he had been struggling with for so long. It did not prove his argument about discontinuous steps, but it suggested another solution to the heredity problem in Darwin. Traits were not undifferentiated blendings of mother and father. Rather, traits were passed down from parents as unchanging singularities, appearing or disappearing in the offspring depending on whether they were “dominant” or “recessive” and in what parental combination they were paired. Awestruck by the implications—he would claim it was one of the most intense emotional experiences of his life—William Bateson rewrote his lecture and delivered the news. Traits were fixed, not blended. The law of natural selection was clarified.

The theory was significant enough to garner resistance and novel enough to be misunderstood. Much as T. H. Huxley had done on behalf of Darwin’s theory, William Bateson promoted the new “genetic theory” and defended it from attack. He coined the term “genetics” and became a founder of the discipline. When Gregory was born, four years after the providential train ride, his father named him after the Austrian monk, Gregor Mendel, whose work had brought William to the forefront of evolutionary theory and had given him a position within the fold.[^13]

At the time of Gregory’s birth, William Bateson was forty-two and in his prime. A larger-than-life figure, known to all as W. B., he was an avowed atheist who read the Bible and William Blake aloud to his children at the breakfast table. He played croquet on the lawn in a fez and practiced a stroke that required a Zen-like emptying of mind. The life of the Bateson family centered on him and his work. They lived in a five-acre walled estate in the village of Grantchester, near Cambridge. A large portion of the grounds was taken up by poultry pens, rows of peas, and various gardens and greenhouses. W. B. ’s wife, Beatrice, was a devoted helpmeet, making notes as he examined chick embryos and measured stamen. The Batesons’ two older sons, John and Martin, had the run of the grounds and spent much of their time digging for fossils or collecting beetles and memorizing their Latin names. The family took regular trips to the seashore, where they investigated tide pools. They took hikes in the surrounding countryside, packing butterfly nets and specimen bottles. William provided on-the-spot instruction. But Gregory was born a third son into a family already self-contained. His eldest brother, John, was six years older, and John and Martin, just sixteen months apart, made an inseparable team, far advanced in “beetling” by the time Gregory was old enough to learn. As a student he was, all the Batesons seemed to agree, less promising than his brothers. As a family member, he often went unnoticed.[^14]

In 1910, when Gregory was six, W. B. left Cambridge and accepted a position as director of the John Innes Horticultural Institution. The family moved to Merton Park, a working-class town on the southwest edge of London. John and Martin were away at boarding schools. Within a few years, Gregory too went away to school, first to elite preparatory schools and, by 1922, to Cambridge. He started out reading zoology. He joined the Cambridge Natural History Society and the Botany Club. But in time, he took his degree in anthropology, a minor rebellion against family tradition. Zoology lacked for him, he claimed, the “personal element” required for motivation. Both the rebellion and the claim were no doubt influenced by the bohemian thought he was soaking up in the pubs off campus. W. B. was skeptical and disappointed by the move. Anthropology was a newer, less stable discipline, uncomfortably close to the humanities. He tried to read some Bronisław Malinowski but had to put the book down, horrified by a description of tribal people roasting an opossum alive. Still, he gave Gregory his blessing. By the late 1920s and through most of the 1930s, Bateson was living among tribes in New Guinea and Bali, observing, taking notes, conceiving theory, and writing.[^15]

### FEUDS AMONG THE IATMUL

Bateson approached anthropology by way of his upbringing in natural history. He operated under the holistic assumption that explanations for form and change were analogous across the life sciences—that, for example, the laws that governed physiology governed individual and societal relations as well. As an anthropologist he was interested in human behavior, but he had a way of conceiving behavior as form, in the way a beetle’s leg had form or the way a leaf bud formally diverged from a stem. Form changed with growth. Growth was the directional determination of an organism’s form as it was constrained by inner processes and by the environment. Behavior, too, was inhabited by form and, in this sense, grew. It took shape and progressed in a particular direction according to internal and external constraints. Bateson’s aim was to investigate and describe that direction—what processes moved it, brought it to a close, and gave it form and therefore distinction. Natural history, after all, was fundamentally concerned with the same thing human history was: continuity and change.[^16]

For example, what factors were involved when a single group of humans changed into two? The question was an important one for Bateson because the Iatmul people of New Guinea, among whom he did his first significant fieldwork in the 1930s, were constantly being threatened by division. When one tribe of Iatmul broke into two, the source of the break was a conflict between fathers. One father would get into a boasting contest with another father. Each new boast raised the ante. Boast turned into insult, insult into fight, and fight into a longer-lasting feud. The climax was schism: one father took his sons and lived elsewhere. Up to this point, directional change (growth) had been continuous, progressing from the first boast through the feud. Continuity was then punctuated by the climax of schism and a new class of change: not one tribe of Iatmul but two.[^17]

Even with schism, certain continuities endured. The patrilineal lines remained continuous. Since sons stayed with fathers and wives with husbands, schism occurred along affinal lines, where families were joined by marriage. Feuds between males unrelated by blood were therefore the pressure points of Iatmul society, and the affinal ties were its fault lines.

Bateson called the process “schismogenesis.” To classify the two forms of behavior governing the process, Bateson assigned two more terms. Two males trying to top each other with boasts was an example of “symmetrical” behavior. Aggression spurred aggression; that was the first class. The second class of behavior he called “complementary.” Here aggressive action triggered submission, and submissive acts triggered aggression. This class of behavior occurred between males and females, the former domineering and exhibitionist, the latter deferential and admiring. Because the tribes were small, and no central authority or code of law existed to impose stability from above, societal instability was typically lateral in these two ways, symmetrical or complementary. Symmetrical male relationships supplied the pressure, and when the society broke in two, it broke when wives submitted to husbands (laterally) rather than to fathers (hierarchically).

All this was illuminated by a particular Iatmul ritual Bateson observed called “naven.” Naven marked any occasion when an adolescent child in the tribe demonstrated in some way a coming of age. The ritual was carried out by the child’s older relatives across the affinal fault line—by, in other words, the brothers, sisters, and cousins of the child’s mother. During naven, the uncles dressed as women, the aunts dressed as men, and they interacted with each other in elaborate displays and scenarios of transvestite exaggeration. The uncles took on submissive roles, dressed in rags, cringed and cowered, took beatings from the aunts, mimed the birthing of the celebrated child, and so on. The aunts, in turn, behaved histrionically, swaggered and boasted, dressed in finery, and mimed sexual dominance and penetration of the uncles.

Bateson the anthropologist tried to figure out what it was all about. In his book _Naven_ (1936), he argued that the components of the ritual—the reversal in roles, the blurring of identity boundaries, performed across the weak affinal line—diffused the Iatmul’s schismogenic tensions. The ritual helped a tribe remain one tribe, in other words, precisely where it was in danger of fragmenting. This analysis of naven made sense, but Bateson was dissatisfied. To state that the function of naven was to hold the tribe together fit a Western mode of analysis in that it explained how a society “worked.” But it was not what naven “meant” to the Iatmul. It was not what it “felt like” to them.

Nor did a functional explanation speak clearly enough, as Bateson saw it, to continuity (continuous directional change) and change (punctuation). Certainly, there were clues to a tendency or direction toward a particular kind of change. These clues answered questions about relational status. Am I dominant? Am I submissive? Behavior patterns, symmetrical or complementary, posed answers to these questions. But until the point of climax, until schism punctuated the continuity, the truth of these answers remained uncertain. Therefore, to close in on certainty, behavior moved in the direction of self-maximization: further aggression, further submission, increased pressure on the pressure points, more slippage along the fault lines.

What stopped this slippage toward climax? What protected the group from splintering or exploding? There were diffusing patterns, and the naven ritual was one of them. But where had that ritual come from? This was where Bateson found the functional explanation unsatisfactory. He could find no cause for group equilibrium other than coincidence. Bateson completed his book about naven and the Iatmul and about the symmetrical and complementary schismogenic processes, but he could not see any “functional _dependence_” between them and “had to leave the matter there.” It was an uneasy question to leave hanging: why should an entity not explode?[^18]

### MARGARET MEAD’S INTEGRATION OF MEANS AND ENDS

Splintering tensions bore down on the West in the spring of 1939 when Bateson left the field and came to the United States with his wife, Margaret Mead. He was thirty-five; she was two years older. They were anthropologists, they were scientists, and they believed that the authority of science was dependent upon open inquiry and international exchange. That made Bateson and Mead committed internationalists. They believed that fascism, if permitted to triumph, could set science back a hundred years.[^19]

With a number of prominent colleagues in the behavioral sciences, they formed the Committee for National Morale, a group dedicated to understanding the social preparations necessary for war. The committee studied “psychological warfare,” then a fairly neutral term encompassing matters of patriotism and propaganda. For the most part, Americans were still in the mindset of the Great Depression. If war came, personal struggles or ambitions—if only those of economic survival—would have to be set aside for the common cause. Everyone would have to do their bit, not least the social scientist. When war broke out in Europe that September, Bateson felt duty-bound to return home to offer his services to his country. The British government found no immediate use for an anthropologist, but he was still away when, that December, Mead gave birth to their daughter, Mary Catherine, in New York.[^20]

Although it would not enter the conflict officially for another two years, the U.S. government was already employing scientists of all disciplines in the war effort. This was a boon especially to the relatively young behavioral sciences, whose practitioners were eager to prove themselves and the usefulness of their expertise. Mead was a case in point. Skills developed analyzing so-called primitive cultures could be transferred, she believed, to the analysis of modern Western nations. She summed this up in _Keep Your Powder Dry_ (1942), a book she wrote in twenty-one days about the American temperament facing current demands. “I came home to a world on the brink of war,” Mead explained, “convinced that the next task was to apply what we [anthropologists] knew, as best we could, to the problems of our society.”[^21]

Society was receptive to these goals. As many as half of all professional anthropologists found jobs in war-related capacities, federal or civilian, during the years of the war, and this facilitated a trend from research to application that would continue in the postwar years. For the behavioral sciences the war was an opportunity for funded research and leadership, but not one free of hazard. Would the objectives of the sponsoring institutions conform to those of researchers? What responsibility did social scientists have for how their data would be used? Social science was soft science, so-called, but these were precisely the questions that would be put to the physicists of the Manhattan Project in the aftermath of Hiroshima.[^22]

One might expect anthropologists like Mead, Bateson, and Mead’s mentor Ruth Benedict to be especially sensitive to these questions. They were proponents of the approach to the discipline established by the German émigré Franz Boas, who had trained both Benedict and Mead at Columbia. Boasian cultural anthropology was based on the principle of cultural relativism. Values were culturally determined and could be judged only within the terms of the societies that formed them. By not assuming Western superiority, the approach seemed more willing to use comparative studies of primitive cultures to criticize Western ways. Mead had garnered early renown and controversy with her book _Coming of Age in Samoa_, which presented adolescent girls of the South Pacific as relatively free of the repressions that bedeviled the sex lives of Americans. Cultural anthropology took a stance that was at once more distant and more self-critical than conventional, positivistic modes of anthropology. If Mead, Benedict, and those in sympathy with them were more willing to pass judgment on Western culture from afar, they also emphasized the need to account for the _scientist’s_ cultural conditioning. The collectors of data were required to consider their own biases and habits of perception.[^23]

As the war commenced, Mead was enthusiastic about the potential contribution of anthropologists like her. She was detail-oriented and a natural manager, and the wider her web of contacts and influences, the more she was energized. Mead was confident in her ability, as one historian puts it, “to tackle big problems, in big units, using broad, swift, interdisciplinary, cultural and cross-cultural methods.” This was especially true with the moral question as seemingly clear-cut as the one at hand—that of Nazi aggression.[^24]

At the same time, Mead recognized that there were controversies within anthropology concerning how its expertise should be applied. By the spring of 1941, Edmond Taylor, the soon-to-be Committee for National Morale executive chairman, was arguing publicly that the use of deceit in propaganda would be necessary to stop Hitler and was therefore acceptable. Mead disagreed. That summer in New York, in a paper given to the Second Symposium on Science, Philosophy and Religion, she offered a written rebuttal to the pragmatism of the type Taylor was urging. Westerners, Mead argued, being eager to achieve their purpose and deeply invested in instrumental reason, devised plans to match the blueprints on their desks and executed those plans. Application and manipulation went hand in hand. This worked directly against democratic values. In contrast to authoritarian regimes, democracies were not supposed to manipulate and coerce.[^25]

This argument pressed up against the divisions of an old, persistent dualism, in this case means and ends. If scientists placed themselves outside their “experimental material,” Mead argued, it followed that their blueprints and plans would also be separate, leading to manipulation and to the denial of the desired values. Mead called for means and ends to be redefined as a single term, “direction,” and thus joined in a single, continuous process. With means and ends united, scientists could then put their knowledge to use without challenging the moral autonomy of the individual. “Only by devoting ourselves,” Mead advised, “to a direction, not a fixed goal, to a process, not a static system, to the development of human beings who will choose and think the choice all important and be strong, healthy and wise in choosing, can we escape this dilemma.” In short, by abolishing purpose, understood as separate, _integrated_ purpose could be achieved. Ever optimistic and facile with her explanations, Mead’s argument was one of those rhetorical bridges social scientists and humanists used in an attempt to unite their disciplines and resist modernity’s fragmenting pressures.[^26]

Bateson gave a paper at the symposium, too, which he framed as a comment on Mead’s. Bateson began by acknowledging that what Mead said would likely sound strange to many. Discard purpose to achieve purpose? It had the paradoxical ring of a Christian or Taoist aphorism and yet came “dressed in all the paraphernalia of analytic thought.” Bateson, however, had a perspective that those who heard Mead probably didn’t share. Mead’s words were informed by her experience in the study of comparative culture, he explained. That study required a heightened abstraction. It required new ways of speaking and thinking that could encompass both cultural worlds without the biases of either. Bateson understood what Mead was saying, he explained, because she was arguing from ideas they had arrived at together working side by side in the field.[^27]

### A MADNESS OF THREE

Bateson met Mead in 1932 at his camp along the Sepik River, in Papua New Guinea, where he was studying the Iatmul. She was traveling with her then-husband, Reo Fortune, another anthropologist, a New Zealander, who had been briefly acquainted with Bateson at Cambridge. Mead’s and Fortune’s work was somewhat at loose ends, with uncertainty over whose research agenda would take precedence. Ambitious and possessive, Fortune had more conventional attitudes toward marriage than Mead did, and he had not dealt well with her fame. Mead was frustrated with him and “starved for likemindedness.” In the field, extended contact with Westerners was rare, and all three were hungry for company and shoptalk.[^28]

Mead knew something of Bateson. She had read one of his articles and hadn’t been impressed. But Bateson quickly charmed Mead as he helped her and Fortune set up a camp and a new project in a nearby village. Writing to Ruth Benedict, Mead described him as having “all the slender unplaced grace of the most complete fragility. You’ve no idea how moving six feet four of vulnerable beauty is. He gets all the points, is extraordinarily sensitive to people. For all his utter at sea-ness, he has the kind of authority which people have who are absolutely faithful to their own temperament—I’m more moved than I’ve been since I met Reo.”[^29]

During the months Mead, Fortune, and Bateson spent in close contact, a draft manuscript addressed to Mead arrived in the mail. It was Benedict’s _Patterns of Culture_. When published two years later, _Patterns of Culture_ would bring the concept of cultural relativism to a wider audience. It would lay out the terms for the culture and personality school within the broader Boasian project that Mead would advance in _Keep Your Powder Dry_ and other works. For now, however, the three anthropologists living along the Sepik grew excited as they absorbed Benedict’s ideas. Her book provided an approach and a language at a “degree of sophistication” that enabled the extracultural criticism they required. Benedict made self-evident the variability of cultural convention that was at the core of their approach. They didn’t accept every point. Benedict’s explanation about the origins and opportunities for deviancy was unsatisfactory to them, a criticism that foreshadowed a sustained postwar critique of the culture and personality school in general. But her argument about how a culture selects those forms that better fit its “peculiar goals” corresponded to the evolutionary, behavioral morphology evident in Bateson’s analysis of the Iatmul, which he was at that time still straining to grasp.[^30]

If Benedict helped Bateson clarify his own thinking on symmetric and complementary behavioral forms, the exchange with Mead was crucial, too. Mead brought to Bateson a firmer grasp of Gestalt psychology, psychoanalysis, and learning theory. Mead, for her part, appreciated Bateson’s rigorous training in the life sciences. At the time, she was thinking through sexual differentiation and its relation to temperament and wanted to address matters of biology, which she believed Benedict had too summarily dismissed. Gregory was helpful because he thought like a biologist, as she put it. He moved “easily from one science to another, making analogies, now from physics, now from geology.” Mead’s mind worked quickly, and she excelled in the organizational challenges of data collection, but criticism of her work made her insecure about its theoretical foundations, and so she sought mentoring in what was precisely Bateson’s forte. “I do not mind the masses of concrete detail which bore Gregory,” Mead would write several years later, “and he induces order and method into my rather amorphous thinking.”[^31]

Bateson also admired Mead’s more aggressive methods of gathering data from informants. His tendency was to stand back and observe, to establish rapport, and to “pick up what comes.” Mead and Fortune tended to “bully and chivvy,” but their techniques were effective. Similarly, Bateson had long struggled with motivation, and to be around Mead was to partake of her work ethic, energy, and efficiency. She would be essential to the completion of his first book. Their differences in style would eventually lead to conflict, but for now the two found an intense congeniality, professional and personal. She was petite—she did not reach Bateson’s shoulders. His temperament, more passive than Fortune’s, was, she wrote to Benedict, “as sweet as the kingdom of heaven.”[^32]

The intensity of their interactions and personalities, the intellectual and physical stress of the work, the isolation, the heated mix of emotions and ideas—all added pitch to the months Bateson, Mead, and Fortune spent in the field together. Mead and Bateson had fallen in love, but Bateson and Fortune became close, too, often playing chess far into the night. Mead and Bateson, who had come of age in the immediate aftermath of World War I, had embraced the bohemianism of the 1920s. They shared a philosophy of free love, and both were accepting of bisexuality—Mead, at least, had practiced it. But in deference to Fortune’s greater conservatism and emotional well-being, the two did not consummate their relationship. Neither was willing to put Mead’s marriage at risk.[^33]

Still, jealousies and misunderstandings arose and were talked out, at length. Soon the three were analyzing each other as much as or more than they were the tribal people who surrounded them. Each of them was a cultural deviant, they decided, each in his or her own way. At the same time, each also represented a “type,” as deviance informed normality within the logical sphere. Pasts, past loves, and their relationships to each other were parsed and reparsed—“dressed in all the paraphernalia of analytic thought”—and in the terminology they were constructing for use in future publications.[^34]

It is not difficult to imagine how the love triangles of young intellectuals isolated in the rain forest might reach gothic dimensions. Mead miscarried Fortune’s child, and Mead described the days that followed as a _folie à trois_. Grief played a role; malarial fevers and hallucinations may well have contributed, too, to the madness. Finally, a return to civilization was required, an escape from the field. Mead and Fortune were divorced a year later, and in 1936, Bateson and Mead married. It was his first marriage, her third. The ceremony was held in Bali, where bride and groom each arrived from his and her respective far-flung location and where they would inaugurate their marriage with a mutual project.[^35]

In Bali, Bateson and Mead found a culture very different from any either had seen before. In terms of Mead’s interests, the Balinese were in-between types: neither their behaviors nor their physiques were characterized by pronounced sexual differentiation. They were peaceful people, eerily self-contained. Their distinction from the Iatmul spoke to Bateson’s interests. When conflict existed for the Balinese, it didn’t move progressively toward schism in symmetrical or complementary patterns. Rather, conflict was diffused in behaviors that optimized balance: in posture, in gesture, and in social interactions. The Balinese were a culture of artists: painters, dancers, puppeteers. The trance states they cultivated took expression, at times, in further inwardness; at other times, in spasms of violent agitation.

The pattern struck Mead and Bateson as schizophrenic. Indeed, early funding for their project was offered by a committee promoting the study of dementia praecox, an early term for schizophrenia, and some of Bateson’s preparations included interviews of patients in an asylum near Cambridge. Later, the project was generalized. To record their observations while minimizing their classificatory biases, Bateson and Mead paired her analysis with his extensive photographs. Their method initiated what came to be known as “visual anthropology.” Their initial impression, however, remained: behaviors normal to the Balinese would in the West tend to indicate mental illness.[^36]

The people of Bali were not necessarily warm; nor could they be described as wholly relaxed. But they were not, like the Iatmul or Westerners, self-maximizing instrumentalists who devised plans to reach goals meant to advance their competition with rivals. Their behaviors were more like moment-by-moment performances, artistic renderings, tightrope crossings, tensely balanced and appreciated aesthetically, as ends in themselves.

So in the summer of 1941 in New York, when Bateson spoke to the Second Symposium on Science, Philosophy and Religion and commented on Mead’s vision of a wartime policy that merged means and ends into a singular “direction,” he told participants this: the orientation to policy that Mead was describing was a style in some ways comparable to that of the Balinese. If, he argued, a scientist wanted to change the instrumentalist behaviors of the West and promote instead Balinese-style behaviors, the relevant question was a natural history question. How did the Balinese get that way?[^37]

### LEARNING TO LEARN

Bateson tried to answer that question in his symposium essay follow-up to Mead’s. The title was awkward: “Social Planning and the Concept of Deutero-learning.” Bateson’s starting place for this essay was what he had learned from Benedict. In _Patterns of Culture_, the patterning Benedict described was an evolutionary process—a culture _selected_ from a range of responses that conformed to its “peculiar goals.” Those selected responses developed over time into “unconscious canons of choice.” In his essay, Bateson demonstrated how he had refined Benedict’s process by describing it in terms of learning. How did the Balinese—or the Iatmul, the British, the Americans, and the Germans, for that matter—come to be the way they were? They learned to be that way.[^38]

If anyone knew about the science of learning, Bateson reasoned, surely behavioral scientists did. Their experiments were all about learning, as anyone who was familiar with Ivan Pavlov or Skinner surely knew. If, for example, a dog came to associate the sound of a bell with meat powder, to the point where the dog responded to the bell by salivating, that dog was thought to have learned.

It was important for Bateson to note, however, that this learning had occurred within a particular context. In this case, the context was Pavlovian. The dog received two stimuli, first the bell and then the meat powder, always in the same sequence. Salivating signaled to the experimenter that the dog had learned to associate the two stimuli. It was further noteworthy that if the same dog were used in a new experiment, framed in this same Pavlovian context with different stimuli, the dog would nevertheless learn to associate the two stimuli more quickly. “It is commonplace,” Bateson explained, “that the experimental subject—whether animal or man, becomes a better subject after repeated experiments.” In other words, the dog had learned to expect the Pavlovian context, had begun to fine-tune its behavior to meet that expectation, and as a result became more skillful in solving problems of the Pavlovian type.[^39]

Two kinds of learning were demonstrated here, Bateson asserted, and two kinds of change. First, the dog learned to associate the bell with meat powder. Second, the dog learned the Pavlovian context. The first learning Bateson called “proto-learning,” and the second he called “deutero-learning.” (He would later use the terms “Learning 1” and “Learning 2,” respectively.) Another way to describe deutero-learning was to call it “learning to learn.”[^40]

Learning to learn didn’t obtain only in Pavlovian contexts. All the basic experimental contexts known to behavioral scientists were commonly deutero-learned. Bateson listed these contexts: stimulus-positive response (learning to push a lever to get a pellet of food), stimulus-negative response (learning not to push a lever to avoid an electric shock), and rote learning (stimuli-response memorization, or “when I say two times five, you say ten”). In each case, when a subject learned to expect a certain context, by experiencing repeated sequences of it, the subject had “acquired a habit of looking for contexts and sequences of one type rather than another, a habit of ‘punctuating’ the stream of events” that gave meaning to that sequence.[^41]

Thus, the subject formed “apperceptive habits,” ways of perceiving the world, and then adjusted its behavior so as to be in that world. An apperceptive habit was, in other words, a way of being. One could give that way of being a name. An organism that had learned to perceive the world through repeated Pavlovian sequences would come to be a sort of fatalist, for example. There wasn’t anything the dog could ever do about it—the meat powder would always follow the bell.[^42]

Yet Bateson still hadn’t answered the pressing question concerning the naven ritual. He still couldn’t explain why various patterns within a culture tended to balance each other and create equilibrium, but now he had a more concrete way to understand how cultural patterns were formed. Cultural patterns weren’t the result of fixed characteristics but were habits of behavior learned through repeated sequences of experience. Inside the laboratory, these sequences were artificially simplified. Outside, they were far more complex. Theoretically speaking, however, there was no reason the processes should not be formally similar.

Could this knowledge be applied? The prospect was daunting, Bateson admitted: “Experiments in simple learning are already difficult enough to control and to perform with critical exactness, and experiments in deutero-learning are likely to prove impossible.” Still, if a behavioral scientist such as Mead desired Western instrumentalists to habituate themselves to a different, more Balinese pattern, it would behoove that scientist to understand the contexts in which the desired pattern was learned.[^43]

Bateson had observed “learning to learn” in the behaviors of the Balinese. He had tried to capture their sequences of learning in photographs. One series of photos depicted a Balinese mother repeatedly teasing her infant into flirtatious arousal. She nuzzled the baby and pulled it close. When the infant responded by taking the mother’s breast, the mother’s expression went vacant. She withdrew her attentions. The suggestion was that in each repetition, the child’s emotion was not permitted to bring its rising excitement into formal release. The child’s emotion was thrown back on itself. The tension remained unresolved. The Balinese child deutero-learned “not to see life as composed of conative sequences ending in satisfaction, but rather to see it as composed of rote sequences inherently satisfying in themselves.” This was something like the pattern Mead had recommended, “the looking for value in the act itself” rather than as a means to an end.[^44]

Despite his cultural relativism and his bohemian leanings, Bateson never adopted any version of “noble savage” romanticism. He didn’t believe that Westerners should imitate the Balinese. Nor would reverting back to some “primitive” mode indicate a return to a purer or more original human condition. He knew Mead wasn’t advising that Westerners train themselves to be Balinese, either. Analyzing how the Balinese learned their contextual patterns, however, could be useful, Bateson asserted. Aspects of rote learning were evident in their behaviors, especially in their artistic training. As painters and dancers, they were strict formalists. But instrumental avoidance was also evident in their learning contexts. Ritual behaviors performed badly meant “the ever-present risk of faux pas,” and thus Balinese life was “built on fear.” It was “the acrobat’s enjoyment both of the thrill and of his own virtuosity in avoiding disaster.” Certainly Mead was not arguing for this in American life but rather for some basis in “hope or optimism.”[^45]

Despite his doubts about the possibility of putting his theory into application, Bateson concluded his essay by allowing himself to imagine the result Mead had in mind:

If the Balinese is kept busy and happy by a nameless, shapeless fear, not located in space or time, we might be kept on our toes by a nameless, shapeless, unlocated hope of enormous achievement. For such a hope to be effective, the achievement need scarcely be defined. All we need to be sure of is that, at any moment, achievement may be just around the corner, and, true or false, this can never be tested. We have got to be like those few artists and scientists who work with this urgent sort of inspiration, the urgency that comes from feeling that great discovery, the answer to all our problems, or great creation, the perfect sonnet, is always only just beyond our reach, or like the mother of a child who feels that, provided she pay constant enough attention, there is a real hope that her child may be that infinitely rare phenomenon, a great and happy person.[^46]

When he wrote this passage, Bateson must have been thinking at least partly of his daughter, Mary Catherine, at that time still less than eighteen months old.

This wartime essay, “Social Planning and the Concept of Deutero- learning,” would be an important work for Bateson. It formally advanced his theory of learning, which, like schismogenesis, was critical to his thought overall and especially to the postwar formulation of the double bind. The essay also provides insight into his method. His enunciation of learning theory allowed Bateson to examine Mead’s proposal in plain terms. If democratic social scientists wanted to promote the characteristics of responsibility, individualism, and freedom—if they really wanted to change instrumentalist habits and establish new habits—they had to think in terms of providing learning contexts that would reinforce the desired responses. At moments Bateson sounds almost facetious about the Skinnerian aspect of the problem: “How would we rig the maze or problem-box so that the anthropomorphic rat shall obtain a repeated and reinforced impression of his own free will?” And yet these comments only draw attention to the difficulties Mead’s more facile proposal skims over. Western scientists were “deeply soaked in habits of instrumental thought,” Bateson admitted. How could you manipulate a people into being free?[^47]

The concreteness with which Bateson approached the problem also allowed him to illuminate the question of value. Those opposed to Hitler valued freedom and democracy, for example. These were the values Mead championed. But what, in terms of learning theory, did value actually mean? Values were the nouns and adjectives people used to describe apperceptive habits, ways of being. To describe the Pavlovian dog as fatalistic, or the Balinese as “present-time-oriented,” was to describe a gestalt, a pattern of perception, a habit of looking for certain sequences in the relationship between self and the world and then to behave accordingly. Likewise, “freedom-loving” was not a concrete trait of character. It was also a habit of perception and behavior. It followed for Bateson that when one spoke of values, one was speaking precisely of these learned habits, these ways of seeing the world.[^48]

Similarly, by framing the problem in the terms of learning theory, Bateson was able to unpack Mead’s moral question. Bateson didn’t rest on the platitude that it was wrong for propagandists and social planners to “treat people as things.” People and things differed in many ways, but Bateson’s learning theory showed—in strikingly commonplace language—precisely the distinction that was relevant in this case: “A screwdriver is not seriously affected when, in emergency, we use it as a wedge; and a hammer’s outlook on life is not affected because we sometimes use its handle as a simple lever. But in social manipulation our tools are people, and people learn, and they acquire habits which are more subtle and persuasive than the tricks which the blueprinter teaches them.” This was the obstacle that all social engineers faced, no matter what their values were or what their political persuasion. They were engineers, and if an engineer used people as tools, the result would be “tragedy and disillusion.” It would lead to demoralization on a wide scale.[^49]

But all of this only made the problem more urgent. Hitler and his operatives were social engineers par excellence. What stands out most in this wartime essay of Bateson’s, beyond the introduction of the concept of deutero-learning and the illustration it provides of his method, is his ambivalence about applied science and the dangers related to it under the present Fascist threat. It was “hardly an exaggeration,” he claimed, that ideologically speaking, the war was about the role of social science “in the ordering of human relationships.” Now that social scientists had the techniques, Bateson asked, “are we, in cold blood, going to treat people as things? Or what are we going to do with these techniques?” Perhaps not to use them would be the best thing to do. That was Bateson’s implication. But wouldn’t that mean lying down to Hitler’s war machine?[^50]

Finally, “Social Planning and the Concept of Deutero-learning” shows something about the relationship between Bateson and Mead at the outset of the war, about the differences between them, and about their bond. In 1941 Mead was at a pivotal moment in her career. She was becoming a figure on the national stage, pitching her message, as she had done at the symposium, outward to a community of shared concern. She would reach a wider and wider audience. The war would give her the opportunity “to tackle big problems, in big units,” and to promote “applied anthropology,” continually inspired by, as one biographer puts it, a “drive to see the world transformed.” Bateson’s tendency, in contrast, was inward. He was in essence addressing the same questions he had been asking himself in the field and extending them, with circumspection, to the community of shared concern. The impression is that the content of this 1941 essay would have been much the same, whether or not there was a war on. Yet a picture emerges here of Mead and Bateson working in tandem, still thinking each other’s thoughts, equal in their view of the Fascist threat, sharing a sense of mission and excitement—and a daughter whom they both adored. Here Mead and Bateson, for perhaps the last time, appear very much on the same page.[^51]

### BLACK PROPAGANDA

For a time, the couple shared an apartment in Greenwich Village with colleague Lawrence Frank and his family. Mead was soon tapped to lead the new Committee on Food Habits, a part of the National Research Council’s Division of Anthropology and Psychology. Food and its relation to health was a rich, unexplored field for applied social science. How did Americans eat? What challenges did a government face in feeding a nation at war? Mead took a house in Washington with her old confidant, mentor, and sometime lover, Ruth Benedict, who had become an analyst of overseas cultures for the Office of War Information. Bateson stayed in New York and looked after Mary Catherine. He continued to work on a theory of learning and to organize the Bali material.[^52]

But the following year, he too took a federal job. Along with a number of other anthropologists, he joined the newly created Office of Strategic Services, William “Wild Bill” Donovan’s OSS. As a “psychological expert,” Bateson was to produce and deploy what was then called “black propaganda,” information intended to subvert enemy intelligence and morale. Evidently he participated, at least at first, with enthusiasm. How can this be squared with the doubts he aired in “Social Planning”? Perhaps he was frustrated he hadn’t yet found a way to contribute to the war effort. Perhaps he sought, as Mead later claimed, an adventure.[^53]

A 1943 essay called “The Science of Decency” suggests that an increased sense of urgency was also in play. The essay summarized the argument he had made in “Social Planning” but with a more pronounced recognition of threat. Again, he noted the Nazis’ cavalier application of social science. The regime employed propaganda and economic planning “on a large scale, for the first time in history.” In the short term, its techniques had proved effective. The leaders of Germany had successfully coordinated a large segment of its people to advance Fascist goals. For Bateson, however, the long-term dangers were also clear: “The cold Machiavellian manipulator who despises his population and regards them as puppets will, if he is successful, turn that population into despicable automata.” There are hints here of critiques Bateson would later mount against other applications of social science, and even in Hawaii against operant conditioning. Hitler treated his people as things, and now they jumped through hoops for him. Hitler’s social science worked. Yet Bateson saw no alternative other than to fight back. The Allies had to use social science, too, he asserted, “both for defense and attack.”[^54]

The OSS, under the direction of Donovan, was an unconventional agency. Donovan recruited from the social and academic elite. He prized creativity and innovation and was known for his willingness to try anything, no matter how outlandish. Bateson was a British eccentric with a top-flight education. He had an intellectual confidence unconstrained by convention. He fit Donovan’s model to the letter.

Bateson was dispatched to the theater of the Far East—China, India, Ceylon. His original contribution to the tactic of black propaganda was that of a particular technique. Enemy propaganda would be obtained and rebroadcast with no change in content but one: some quantity would be exaggerated to the point that it would be impossible to believe. If Japan reported that ten prisoners had been captured, for example, the doctored report would cite the number of prisoners at 10,000. The objective was straightforward: to undermine trust. Yet, as was the case with many of the operations Donovan authorized, Bateson’s applied anthropology didn’t generate significant results.[^55]

At one point, Bateson’s war took a brief turn. Perhaps recognizing the weakness of his anthropological contribution, Bateson, officially a civilian, volunteered for a mission to rescue a number of agents behind enemy lines. He was later decorated for the endeavor. This was a hands-on operation, direct intervention on behalf of specific lives, and perhaps this struck him as more morally defensible than the manipulation of data to confuse and demoralize a faceless mass.[^56]

Whatever activities he executed in his official capacity, they didn’t seem to have changed his views about the dangers of applied social science. Populations were being hypnotized. War was operant conditioning writ large. Huge numbers of persons, himself included, had been coordinated into collaborating—“and no nonsense about it.” When he put his thoughts about the war in terms of the second law of thermodynamics, he expressed a kind of Malthusian pessimism. Any increased organization in one part of a system only meant an increase of chaos in another. Massive war-making transformed masses of order into entropy. There could be no hope for reform. “What do you say?” he asked a friend in a letter written from his current post in Ceylon. “Do you like to be used as an energy source? And do you like, at all, the product achieved by combustion of little pieces of your image?” Three weeks later the war was over, and the world was introduced to the bomb.[^57]

Bateson’s ambivalence deepened. Within days of Japan’s surrender, he had written Donovan a memo. In it, he analyzed the effect the bomb would have on future war-making. Bateson didn’t expect the United States to maintain its monopoly on atomic weapons for more than a few years. When numerous nations possessed the bomb, conventional wars would become unthinkable, and indirect methods of warfare would become imperative, especially those of intelligence and counterintelligence. Therefore it was advisable, Bateson wrote, that an agency be created, one much like the OSS, preferably under the auspices of the Department of State. A few days later, when the government’s budget secretary met with Donovan to discuss orders to disband his organization, Donovan argued for its extension under his own command, with Bateson’s memo in hand. President Truman disliked Donovan and dismissed him, and certainly Bateson was not the only one who foresaw a similar postwar scenario. But the activities and agenda of the Central Intelligence Agency, born out of the OSS, would match Bateson’s blueprint in every particular.[^58]

It is impossible to know exactly how Bateson felt about his wartime experience. He rarely spoke of it, though when he did, it was with bitterness and regret. In terms of what he believed about science, he had compromised himself and his avocation, although his black propaganda hadn’t done much to advance the Allies’ cause. It is one thing to compromise one’s beliefs on behalf of a perceived greater good. It is another, and perhaps worse, when that contribution proves negligible. Yet in a remarkably prescient analysis of postwar conditions, Bateson not only foresaw but also recommended an organization to apply social science in precisely the ways he most dreaded. One wonders whether Bateson ever thought about his memo to Donovan when he heard or read about the CIA’s part in events in Guatemala or Iran, say, or in the Bay of Pigs invasion, or when he considered the facts and controversies surrounding the coming spate of assassination of public figures in the United States and abroad. But it is no wonder that Bateson emerged from the war demoralized, or that he suffered bouts of depression well into the next decade. “Are we, in cold blood, going to treat people as things? Or what are we going to do with these techniques?” Bateson had raised the question, but the way he answered had been far from satisfactory. Using science as a tool in war, he had become, himself, war’s tool.[^59]

### WRONG ON A DEUTERO LEVEL

Bateson’s marriage to Mead was another casualty of the war. Despite their mutual dedication to a free-love philosophy, Bateson’s numerous affairs during the years after his return put stress on the relationship and troubled Mead deeply. Their divergent temperaments and work habits ceased to serve complementary ends. Unsure of his own future—the war had in this sense left him paralyzed—Bateson began to see Mead no longer as an energizing partner. Now, she struck him as manipulative and maternal.[^60]

This conflict speaks to a greater conflict in their respective views on the application of social science. Mead’s enduring faith that social scientists could use their knowledge on behalf of the greater good was only more pronounced by the war’s end, and as the triumphant U.S. government showed itself open to funding and employing scientists of all stripes in the postwar world, Mead found herself with proven administrative experience at the national level. She was recognized as a personage, a leader. In contrast, Bateson’s former ambivalence concerning the application of science—that conflict between what he had done and what he believed—was over for good. He would henceforth always avoid any pressure to seek applications of his thought, often strenuously, and almost always against the tide.[^61]

Bateson and Mead separated in 1947, and within another year, Bateson—still at loose ends—moved to California. As a research assistant in communications theory at the Langley Porter Clinic in San Francisco, and later as an ethnologist at the Veterans Administration hospital in Palo Alto, he moved further away from anthropology. Mead continued to try to interest him in the work of her Center for Intercultural Studies. Mead and Bateson had founded the institute in 1941, and he was still officially on the board. The center’s goal encompassed Mead’s vision for applied anthropology in its most pure form: the anthropological analysis of nations to better understand and manage their relations, in the interest of peace. Bateson, in a reference to the sort of spycraft with which he was now familiar, had taken to ridiculing the concept as “culture-cracking.”[^62]

A 1949 letter of reply to Mead’s entreaties gives a picture not only of how disagreeable their relationship was during this period but also of the degree to which Bateson rejected the very possibility of applied anthropology. Mead was no less sensitive than Bateson to the danger of anthropologists as unwitting instruments of imperial powers, but her belief was that such endeavors could be governed by an established code of disciplinary ethics. Bateson dismissed the notion: “Oh yes—I know that it is possible to tell the cadets how ad hoc they can squeeze the colonial lemon harder and have the pips squeak less _for a limited period._ But for the rest, I regard this ‘ethics of applied anthrop’ as a ritual which may help people to pretend to themselves that they are not manipulating, squeezing & castrating when that is, in fact, exactly what they are doing.”[^63]

In his letter, Bateson admitted to being aware that, by taking such an uncompromising stand, he was isolating himself from the mainstream of scientific thought, perhaps to the detriment not only of his career but also of his emotional stability. But he refused to “play ball . . . whatever the psychic cost.” If during the war it had been possible for Bateson to take a side against Germany and Japan, in the Cold War he found he could no longer collaborate. “There cannot be a partisan anthropology,” he wrote Mead, “Rand, etc. notwithstanding.” Bateson granted that he found himself more sympathetic with the American side. He had more friends among the Americans, at any rate. But he was uncertain whether it was good “to be blackmailed by personal consideration into an ideologically false position.” He dismissed as useless Mead’s suggestion that it was possible to work for change from inside, to subvert the system from within. “Subversion,” he remarked, “rhymes with coercion. So—not much can be done in the way of subversion, and it is reasonably certain that we shall again go into war rather than re-examine the basic premises.”[^64]

This was 1949, a few weeks after the announcement that the Soviets now had their own atomic weapon, with the Rosenberg trial, Joseph McCarthy, the loyalty oaths, and the blacklists soon to come. “Subversion” would become a word not so easily or safely bandied about. Concluding, Bateson faded into sarcasm. His general rancor and black mood is palpable:

Perhaps I would feel happier about it all if I read the newspapers & got myself properly propagandized. But that’s difficult. Something went wrong on a deutero level, & all that I get out of a newspaper is “the writer seems to think it would be a ‘good thing’ to damn the Russians”—I never get the simple assurance that “the Russians are bad people.” Perhaps if I had had more intimate contact with your culture-cracking projects I should by now have sounder opinions. I remember how we worked ourselves into a dislike of the “Japs” & Germans. Perhaps it is the human inability to forget a few things of that sort that leads to the spacing-out of wars—but I doubt it. . . . I was re-reading The Waste Land—& it seems that the obscenity of the epoch (inter-bellum) is a function of the inability to forget. . . . Perhaps if I participated in their war it might “sweeten my imagination”—but the last one didn’t.[^65]

Surely, this resistance to Mead had much to do with their estrangement. She was trying to engage him in collaborative work, as in happier days. She was trying to put his talents to use, as from her position of public prominence she now did the talents of so many others. He resented her effort to organize him. He perceived it as interference, as passing judgment. But one must also take Bateson at his word. He had drawn conclusions from his war experience, and here, he brings them to bear. War was total application. War worked. He had collaborated in war, not as a soldier but a scientist, and it shamed him. By the summer of 1950, he had become involved with Betty Sumner, a former secretary at Langley Porter. She was pregnant, and they planned to marry. He telephoned Mead at the apartment in New York and arranged a divorce.[^66]

Because science itself was largely defined in instrumental terms, the pressure to apply it instrumentally and Bateson’s refusal to comply would become a pattern in his professional life. It was a pattern about belief, about the demoralization and reestablishment of belief, a very human pattern, far from free of human pain. It was a pattern therefore woven into his personal life, as well, and to see it that way subtracts from neither the personal nor the professional. To refuse instrumental application was, as it were, an attempt to escape its authority and its demands, only to confront them again in the new place. That included Waimanalo, where dolphins were trained to bounce balls on their noses, where operant conditioning worked. But before that it included California, where Bateson lived for fifteen years, and where, leading a research team, he developed the concept of the double bind.  

## Two: Difficulties at the Metalevel

Joseph Heller introduced the term “catch-22” in his 1961 novel of the same name. The first mention appears about fifty pages in. The bombardier Yossarian asks the doctor on his base to excuse him from flying combat missions because they make him crazy. Doc Daneeka assures Yossarian that he will. In fact, the rules require that crazy people be grounded. But there’s a catch: “Anyone who wants to get out of combat duty really isn’t crazy.” Insanity, in other words, is a sane response to combat duty, and so Yossarian can’t be grounded, after all. Insanity is sanity, sanity is insanity, opposing terms converge in paradox, and Yossarian is caught in between.[^1]

Five years earlier the term “double bind” had been introduced in a new academic journal, _Behavioral Science_. The intended audience was narrower and more specialized than Heller’s, but those who read the article didn’t have to wait fifty pages for a definition. Authors Gregory Bateson, Don D. Jackson, Jay Haley, and John H. Weakland, later known as the double-bind research group, defined their term in a preceding abstract. The double bind was “a situation in which no matter what a person does, he ‘can’t win.’ It is hypothesized that a person caught in the double bind may develop schizophrenic symptoms.”[^2]

The similarities between catch-22 and double bind are striking. Each term shares with the other the confrontation of an impossible dilemma; each shares an association with mental illness. Both were coined within a few years of each other; both gained traction in the wider culture beyond the confines of their original sources. Both, in turn, shared formal and associational correspondences with other constructions of the period. Reinhold Niebuhr built his theology on a recasting of original sin as paradox. Albert Camus’s philosophy, resolutely secular, was founded on an impossible dilemma he called “the absurd.” All these constructions resonated, which is to say they were frequencies of similar shape that came into phase and amplified each other. Together they made a kind of music, a tune or theme: the human condition as an existential knot of contradiction, a tragic paradox, an impossible dilemma. Together they made a conundrum of what had been the modern worldview’s most inspiring tenet: that humanity could bring its rational intelligence to action on behalf of the good.

### THE LOGIC OF THE DOUBLE-BIND PARADOX

In one important sense, the double-bind group’s abstract was misleading, if one assumed that a “can’t win” situation and a “lose-lose” situation were identical. Neither catch-22 nor double bind described a “lose-lose” situation as commonly understood. A lose-lose is a problem to which there are (at least) two responses, both of them bad. This isn’t Yossarian’s plight. Rather, Yossarian is “caught” in an absurd dilemma between perceptions that reverse themselves in continuous oscillation. If he’s crazy, he’s not crazy; if he’s not crazy, he’s crazy; and so on. Catch-22 is a logical absurdity. Its paradoxical character is its binding element. This is also true of double bind.

Bateson formed the double-bind research group in 1952, under a Rockefeller grant to study “paradoxes of abstraction in communication.” The group took as its research question the following: Where does one see, in the communication between living beings, the generation of Russellian paradox? This is the sort of paradox derived from confusion over what philosopher and mathematician Bertrand Russell called logical types or classes. The classic illustration was the liar paradox “All Cretans are liars,” as stated by Epimenides of Crete. Here, a general statement _about_ Cretans was fused with a _particular_ statement by Epimenides and treated as logical equivalents. When a class was treated as a member of itself, the result was an irresolvable paradox. It is useful to note that in the title of their study, Bateson and his group described Russellian paradoxes as paradoxes of “abstraction.” A class is one level more abstract than a member, one might say. That there are levels of communication—that there is information and meta-information, data and metadata—is a notion easily grasped today, but in the early 1950s, it was new. Because these levels had a class-member relationship, they were vulnerable to the kind of confusion that Russell explained. Because communication was a constant in life, so was paradox.[^3]

The years since the war had been rocky for Bateson in a number of ways: the divorce from Margaret Mead, war-related depressions, and the uncertainties involved in his move away from anthropology. In California, he had carved out a few semi-affiliations, as a lecturer and researcher, with the University of California Medical School in San Francisco, with Stanford University, and, most centrally, with the Veterans Administration hospital in Palo Alto. His marriage to Betty Sumner and the birth of his son, John, provided Bateson some stability. He had also coauthored and published a book on communication theory, an early achievement in his project to rethink the behavioral sciences in light of ideas such as the Russellian paradox. The Rockefeller grant to build his own research team reflected further confidence in this work.[^4]

Bateson gave the members of his team a free hand in their research. Two were his former anthropology students Jay Haley and John Weakland, and one, William Fry, was completing his residency as a psychiatrist. They approached their task from a variety of directions, looking for paradox in animal behavior, humor, film narratives, and mental illness. By 1954, however, under a new grant from the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation, the group had narrowed its investigation to the symptomatic behaviors of schizophrenic patients at the VA hospital, where Bateson had based his project. When Fry was detained by military service, Don D. Jackson, a psychiatrist with expertise in schizophrenia, joined the group.[^5]

Having been raised in a household devoted to natural history, Bateson had throughout his life tramped through countryside and among tide pools, overturning rocks, examining specimens, observing, collecting, describing. What he had done as a young anthropologist among tribal peoples along the Sepik River and in Bali was something quite similar. He had always worked in the field, the wild, rather than in the laboratory. With Russell’s theory in mind, Bateson now brought this way of working to the wild of the Palo Alto clinic. He and his group observed how victims of schizophrenia communicated with their therapists, with the hospital staff, with their parents, and with their siblings. These patients exhibited a broad array of symptoms. Sometimes they spoke garrulously and disaffectedly, in random and unintelligible “word salads” (hebephrenia). Some suffered hallucinations, heard voices, and were tormented by intricate inner worlds (paranoia). Other victims ceased communicating altogether and slipped into vegetative states (catatonia).

In this wide divergence of symptoms, Bateson sought evidence of a pattern. The victim who displayed hebephrenic symptoms, for example, spoke in word salads without clear emotional cues. Who was speaking? Who was being spoken to? The word salads didn’t include information that clearly answered these questions. That was what made them so confusing. Where did the communication occur? How did the speaker feel about the message? These were “about” or “meta” questions because answers to them framed the communication taking place; they put the communication into a class or context. In healthy communication, answers to questions like these were readily supplied, either verbally or through body language, consciously or unconsciously. Providing answers to these question was crucial because without this metadata, messages were simply not understandable.[^6]

Bateson proposed that what the hebephrenic was doing was leaving out or distorting the metadata. One patient, for example, claimed that his name was Margaret Stalin. This claim placed all of his subsequent claims in a class other than the class of statements made by the real him, and thus he avoided being the person who said the things he said. From this perspective, the word salads weren’t exactly nonsense. Whether consciously or unconsciously, they were strategies of avoidance. Often, too, they were highly metaphoric. But since the hebephrenic lacked the ability—or perhaps the willingness—to supply the contextual data that would classify expression as metaphoric, his or her messages were randomized and rendered unintelligible.

Metadata gave any message its mode. Metadata allowed people to understand the difference between what was figurative and what was literal, what was a joke and what was serious, what was fantasy and what was real. The paranoid schizophrenic, who was especially deficient in telling this latter pair apart, became vulnerable to the imaginative manifestations of his or her own feelings of inadequacy, alienation, and guilt. These manifestations took voice and then seduced and bound the victim in a web of delusion and hallucination. To live in a world without metadata was to live in a world of informational disorder. The catatonic, so oppressed by this deficiency in producing or detecting metadata, gave up on all communication whatsoever.[^7]

What was the source of the deficiency? Here was the connection between double bind and paradox. Bateson and his group explained double bind as a message in Russellian fusion with its metadata: an “I love you” message, for instance, in an “I don’t love you” context. The victim of double bind, typically a child, received this message from someone of great importance in the child’s life, typically a parent. Double bind was “double” because the child might read the metadata rightly or wrongly. Double bind was a “bind” because either interpretation brought punishment, meted out by the message sender, the double binder, for whom either reading was intolerable. The double-binding parent punished the child for a correct reading of the “I don’t love you” context because this correct reading forced the parent to confront the fact of his or her own hostility toward the child. That confrontation caused the parent anxiety and guilt, which the parent evaded by simulating a contradictory message of love. Punishment was precisely this contradictory message, which proved the child wrong in his or her correct reading of the context.

Yet if the child read the context wrongly and chose to believe in the simulation despite its contradictory context and then to respond accordingly—which is to say, with love—the child was punished, too. For the child’s move toward loving intimacy would only provoke further hostility on the part of the parent, and thus further guilt, and thus further simulation, as around the child the poles of the paradox continued to converge. Bateson offered the following illustration from the clinic: “A young man who had fairly well recovered from an acute schizophrenic episode was visited in the hospital by his mother. He was glad to see her and impulsively put his arm around her shoulders, whereupon she stiffened. He withdrew his arm and she asked, ‘Don’t you love me anymore?’ He blushed, and she said, ‘Dear, you must not be so easily embarrassed and afraid of your feelings.’ The patient was able to stay with her only a few minutes more and following her departure he assaulted an aide and was put in the tubs.”[^8]

Further binding was applied to this sequence of reversals by the implied threat, felt by the child, that not playing the game on these terms would mean an end to the relationship altogether, and thus that the end would come of the child’s own account. That threat was terrible. After all, this was the relationship in which the child had learned the basics: about self, about others, about how the world worked and what to expect from it. The child might well perceive the loss of the parental bond as unthinkable, especially if he or she received no support against its demands from, say, the other parent, a sibling, or some other person important in the child’s life. In a formulation that is mirrored in Doc Daneeka’s rendering of catch-22, Bateson summarized, “The impossible dilemma thus becomes: ‘If I am to keep my mother, I must not show her that I love her, but if I do not show her that I love her, then I will lose her.’”[^9]

Again, here is the difference between double bind (or catch-22) and a conventional lose-lose situation. Whereas a lose-lose situation merely presents two (or more) choices uniformly bad, the double bind’s impossible dilemma involves the fusion of differing levels of abstraction, the primary and the meta. As Jay Haley of the double-bind group later clarified, “If I say to someone, ‘I will be angry with you if you obey me and I will be angry with you if you disobey me,’ he can choose one or the other. However, if I say to someone, ‘I want you to disobey me,’ he has no alternative choices . . . if he obeys, he is disobeying, and if he disobeys, he is obeying.” This is not a matter of ambivalence, but of impossibility.[^10]

Still, this was only half of the double-bind group’s claim. The other half held that “a person caught in the double bind may develop schizophrenic symptoms.” In regard to the clinical illustration of the mother and son, one assumes—given the son’s hospitalization and earlier “acute schizophrenic episode”—that double bind was nothing new to his experience. Bateson and his team hypothesized that a child who experienced double bind as a “recurrent theme” learned to expect it and its inevitable punishments. To put this in the terms Bateson had introduced at the wartime symposium with Mead, double bind was a context the child had deutero-learned. Double bind became an apperceptive habit, a way of being in the world.

As with any well-established habit, the ingredients that shaped it didn’t need to be present in order for the habit to be displayed. But the habit should be seen as appropriate to the learned expectation. It would be appropriate, for instance, for such a child to ignore, as a matter of habit, the metadata that classified messages. It would be appropriate for the child to habitually mislabel or distort metadata, so to obscure her own messages. It would be appropriate for such a child not to know “what kind of message a message is.” It would be appropriate for such a child to become an expert double binder herself. All these habits manifested the schizophrenic’s inability, when confronted with primary data at odds with its metadata, to commit to one or the other, because the schizophrenic had learned that any commitment meant punishment and pain.[^11]

Finding himself in a world where catch-22 was a recurrent theme, Yossarian “decided to go crazy.” Yossarian, of course, is a fictional character, and whether his choice was successful, the novel leaves ambiguous. Certainly he continues to be tortured by absurdities others seem to take as given, but his choice makes a kind of sense. At the end of _Catch-22_, Yossarian breaks away and runs for Sweden. The final pages depict him running and leaping. The reader takes some hope in this, as when the schizophrenic Chief Broom of _One Flew over the Cuckoo’s Nest_, a novel published a year after Heller’s, breaks out of the psychiatric hospital and escapes into the Oregon woods.[^12]

In the double-bind relationship, the attempt to avoid pain, no matter how appropriate or habituated, wasn’t considered a strategic success. Bateson and his colleagues stressed the confining quality of the condition they described. A variety of injunctions, threats, and punishments combined to make the double-bind relationship the only world its participants knew. That world—hallucinatory, paranoid, isolated, randomized—could be excruciating. For the nonfictional victims of schizophrenia, double-bind theory said, there was no “escaping from the field.”[^13]

### NIEBUHR, CAMUS, AND THE IMPOSSIBLE DILEMMA

The resonance of the double bind, and a few years later, of catch-22, emerged in a climate that generated similar formulations of contradiction, paradox, and impossible dilemma. Together they distilled a check on modern optimism about human prospects and capabilities that had been ongoing for more than a century and in earnest since the Great War. Expressed at various registers across society and expressive culture, impossible dilemma constructs urged a return to the fundamentals of the human condition, and in particular a narrowing of, in sociologist Peter Berger’s phrase, “the parameters of choice.” What was thought to be changeable by human effort, as opposed to what need be accepted as given? Modern thought, by championing human capacities to shape nature to human needs, had claimed a lot of turf in answer to this question. Impossible dilemma constructs signaled a retreat.[^14]

Tension surrounding modern optimism was especially apparent in the United States, which, as no other nation could, experienced the outcome of World War II as triumph. Certainly many continued to celebrate the role America played in the Allies’ victory and to boost American prospects. Wartime production had reinvigorated an anemic economy, and many Americans enjoyed a period of unprecedented material abundance. But for others, the mood of the decade and a half following the war has been widely characterized as “chastened,” or as a return to a sense of the tragic. One leading contribution to this mood came from thinkers and social critics who drew on neo-orthodox theologians, such as Karl Barth, and the “father of existentialism,” Søren Kierkegaard. Existentialist readings of the human condition emphasized irony, absurdity, and paradox and marked what historian George Cotkin has called a “religious turn.”[^15]

Prominent in this religious turn was Reinhold Niebuhr’s rearticulation of original sin. The concept was central to his Gifford Lectures, delivered in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1939, while war was breaking out in Europe. Niebuhr argued that human beings were finite creatures of the natural world and yet endowed with a creative spirit that allowed them to transcend that condition. Original sin was humankind’s effort to escape the paradox of being both creature and creator by emphasizing the transcending capacities and denying the creatureliness. This was the essential sin, the sin of pride. The concept of pride, of hubris, is so old and familiar that one might miss how Niebuhr set the grounds for it in paradox: “As a creature who is involved in flux but who is also conscious of the fact that he is so involved, he cannot be totally involved.” The creature’s ability to inquire into the meaning of creation proved “that in some sense he stands outside and beyond” that creation. Transcendence was, as Niebuhr formulated it, both real and a mere simulation. Original sin was the sin of believing in the lie that was true.[^16]

In the spirit not only of Kierkegaard but also of Friedrich Nietzsche and Franz Kafka, the secular existentialists of the immediate postwar period would also focus on the paradoxical nature of the human condition. When the Parisian lawyer in Albert Camus’s _The Fall_ pauses one evening on the Pont des Arts bridge to take in the view, he experiences a peak moment of “vast power.” As he “dominated” the Seine islands that lay before him, he hears a burst of disembodied laughter behind him, and the commanding moment is punctured. It is pride preceding a fall, echoing the same biblical fall Niebuhr referenced.[^17]

The grounds for that ironic reversal were laid out in Camus’s conception of the absurd, his central concept, constructed in an early essay, like Niebuhr’s, at the outset of World War II. The absurd was the contradiction between the human capacity to conceive the world as unified and the simultaneous collapse of that capacity. To put this in Niebuhr’s terms, the moment one made a claim for total involvement, the claim itself demonstrated that one “cannot be totally involved.” The dilemma for Camus, more explicitly than in Niebuhr, arose from the pervasiveness of Russellian paradox, where “assertions instantly negated themselves” in the fusion of claim and metaclaim. Recognizing this paradox as “walls enclosing him,” Camus became a “stranger to myself and to the world.”[^18]

As a character of fiction, this is Mersault, the protagonist of Camus’s novel _The Stranger._ Mersault is a modern man so affectless he seems almost without consciousness, and Camus binds him in a series of paradoxes, expressed not in the language of philosophical analysis but in blunt material forces, bodily sensations, and weather. Camus works and reworks this theme of emotional detachment and stifling heat, up to the moment on the beach when Mersault commits his infamous act of nihilism. To “shoot or not shoot,” to “stay or go, it amounted to the same thing,” an either-way-ness, like being “anchored in a sea of molten lead.”[^19]

Contained in both Niebuhr and Camus was a critique of modernity. In Niebuhr’s view, the concept of original sin, with its theological roots in the epistles of Paul and St. Augustine, had been set aside by the more modernist strains of Protestant Christianity as too gloomy and defeatist. This setting aside was, for Niebuhr, “the perpetual smile of modernity,” the mark of its “easy conscience” and unwarranted optimism. Camus’s historical critique was captured in his term “nostalgia,” one of the “pillars” of the absurd. Nostalgia for Camus was a longing less for the old religious certainties than for the modern promise of science and universal reason. These impossible dilemma constructs were meant to demonstrate that modern optimism had proved false. The chastened mood of the postwar period, its tragic turn, and its impossible dilemmas were in this sense a retreat from territory the modern had meant to occupy. What made impossible dilemmas impossible was that they limited the contours of human agency. They were also impossible to escape.

Actually, for Niebuhr, there was an escape through belief in a sharing of God’s ultimate transcendence—a transcendence that was total and _not_ a mere simulation. For some secularists, this final dependence on premodern categories only made the dilemma more impossible and the paradox more binding. The writer Kurt Vonnegut Jr. is illustrative of the pathos of the religious turn for those who accepted Niebuhr-like depictions of the human condition but who couldn’t manage Niebuhr-like faith. In his 1963 novel, _Cat’s Cradle,_ Vonnegut peppered scriptures from the metafictional _Book of Bokonon_ that acknowledge humanity’s creatureliness and final dependence on God. Yet the hallmark of Vonnegut’s style is his sustained ambiguity as to whether this sort of material should be read as sincere counsel or as knowing delusion. When the prophet Bokonon acknowledges “the heartbreaking necessity of lying about reality, and the heartbreaking impossibility of lying about it,” this “cruel paradox” serves as a metafictional comment on Vonnegut’s own method as a writer. To which does one commit, his fictions ask: to the consoling lie or to the embittering truth? In the novel’s final passage, Vonnegut has it both ways, leaving the reader with an image of Bokonon thumbing his nose at “You Know Who.”[^20]

Attitude becomes an important point of contrast in these ideas and points of view. From Niebuhr’s perspective, to face the fact of original sin was to be resigned to the inevitable failure of all human effort and yet to strike a particular attitude in that resignation. That attitude was one of reverence, a “benevolence to being in general,” to use a phrase of Jonathan Edwards, the Calvinist theologian of the Great Awakening whose thought was much revisited during the religious turn. A benevolent consent of the heart to “everything to which it stands connected” was, Edwards argued, the essential virtue, and the attitude of resignation that Niebuhr counseled was a revival of that view. Vonnegut’s Bokonon, and perhaps Vonnegut himself, consented to the bind, not with benevolent consent but with rebellion, with anger, and with irreverent nose-thumbing.[^21]

Vonnegut continued to play ironically with benevolent consent in his later novel _Slaughterhouse-Five_. In this story, protagonist Billy Pilgrim visits the planet of Tralfamadore. The Tralfamadorians are time travelers, and this allows Vonnegut to take Billy backward and forward in narrative time. Leaping forward, he reveals the epitaph on Billy’s tombstone: “Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt.” Through the Tralfamadorians, Billy achieves a philosophical, godlike distance that allows him to judge “everything” beautiful. Yet the novel also records a multitude of “hurts.” Here again is Vonnegut’s ambiguity: is Tralfamadore real, or is it the place Billy’s mind goes to escape this multitude?[^22]

No escape short of “philosophical suicide” was possible, Camus insisted. Compared to the sober formality of Camus and of the murderer Mersault’s refusal to even entertain guilt, Bokonon’s irreverence is untidy and misplaced. Camus’s project was to remain in the bind, to remain alive in the bind. As for Camus’s attitude, it is tempting to contrast Niebuhr’s benevolent consent against Camus’s sober rebellion. That wouldn’t be quite fair. At the outset of war, when Camus first explained what he meant by the absurd, the attitude he struck is hard to ascertain. It would take his participation in the Resistance, and other experiences of political and ideological conflict, to work out with more clarity his notion of rebellion and its relation to human effort. In the early essays and in _The Stranger_, the bind is unacceptable—Camus does not consent to it, yet he refuses any escape from it—and in regard to attitude, he implies that we should imagine him, as he asks us to imagine Sisyphus, “happy.”[^23]

Niebuhr spoke to issues of attitude and the parameters of human effort in a wartime composition that came to be known as the Serenity Prayer. It was printed up on cards by the National Council of Churches and distributed to soldiers as they shipped out. Billy Pilgrim (and perhaps the soldier Vonnegut) would take comfort in Niebuhr’s prayer. A version of it is framed on the wall of Billy’s office of optometry and engraved in the locket worn between the breasts of Montana Wildhack, the pornographic film star who is his coinhabitant on Tralfamadore. Niebuhr’s version reads:

God, give us grace to accept with serenity the things which cannot be changed,

Courage to change the things that should be changed,

And the wisdom to distinguish the one from the other.[^24]

For any who were tempted to take pride in or to be overly optimistic about their individual capacities, the prayer offered a message of benevolent consent. No individual could effect his or her own salvation; no single soldier could win the war all on his own. Resigned humility didn’t have to be gloomy; it could be serene. But the prayer also asked for wisdom, and this wisdom pertained to doing, to action. The prayer directed attention to the very boundary under review during the tragic turn, between what must be accepted as given and what was still subject to change. Alcoholics Anonymous, then less than a decade old, adopted the prayer into its program, simplifying the critical third line to the more familiar “the wisdom to know the difference.” As a response to the impossible dilemma, the Serenity Prayer didn’t surrender the possibility of human effort, but it artfully sidestepped how action was to be determined. What an individual might do on behalf of the good, however couched that activity was in a tragic sensibility, as for Camus, was left to be worked out in experience.

### MADNESS AND THE BOMB

Double-bind theory associated paradox with mental illness, but expressive culture and social criticism were well ahead on that score. What Eric Hobsbawn called the Age of Catastrophe, others called the Age of Anxiety or the Age of Schizophrenia. The metaphorical use of insanity was not without precedent, but as the period progressed, the prevalence and level of specificity of the madness metaphor rose to the level of theme. Postwar fictions of all kinds were read by critics as apologia for insanity under contemporary conditions. It was as if the doubleness of contemporary life, long explored by modernists, was clothing itself in the settings and language of psychiatric medicine. Schizophrenia, with its emphasis on psychic fragmentation, was a particularly useful trope. “Schizo” and “schizoid,” words derived from the clinical term but used informally, described a mind divided by the stress of ideas in contradiction. Squeezed by paradox and impossible dilemma, characters disassociated, or retreated into states approaching catatonia. Or else they did the opposite: they acted out, talked crazy, or exhibited bizarre behaviors.[^25]

As characters in fiction, the latter could be sympathetic and beloved. The Yossarians and Orrs of _Catch-22_, the Randle McMurphys of _One Flew over the Cuckoo’s Nest_: these were the borderline cases, the colorful actors-out, some obviously ill, others merely eccentric. The more “florid” their symptoms, to use the clinical description, the more fun they were to watch, and the more they could serve an editorial function. From word salads of seeming nonsense, nuggets of insight emerged. Orr keeps engaging his tentmate Yossarian in circular conversations about chestnuts in his cheeks, rubber balls in his hands, and “the flies in Appleby’s eyes,” which no one but Orr can see. In double-bind theory, mental illness was, while still pathological, in some sense an appropriate way of being. In fictions, mental illness could be not only appropriate but also creative and heroic. When Yossarian decides to “go crazy,” certain possibilities open up to him. He too can see the flies in Appleby’s eyes.[^26]

Nowhere did paradox and the impossible dilemma find social expression so clearly during this period as in the predicament of the atomic bomb. Many of the immediate reactions of Americans to the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki expressed a chilled humility, included not a few references to Prometheus and Frankenstein, and suggested a nation “at the moment of victory” perceiving “itself as naked and vulnerable.” Later, arms race imperatives and deterrence policy created a paradoxical peace, from which any deviation threatened nuclear annihilation on the widest possible scale. Alongside logical terms such as “absurdity” and “paradox,” descriptions of deterrence policy (known by the early sixties as Mutually Assured Destruction, or MAD) and the arms race commonly employed metaphors of mental disease: crazy, insane, paranoid, schizoid.[^27]

In some literary realms, fiction and nonfiction blurred. Madness was affecting the “best minds” of an entire generation, Allen Ginsberg famously declared in the first line of his poem “Howl.” In the poem’s first section, Ginsberg offered a catalog of high-risk behaviors that defied a mainstream culture of self-containment. They were an objection to the dismissal of emotion, the tightly prescribed roles, and the ideal of the American home as the domestic enactment of national Cold War strategy. “I can’t stand my own mind,” Ginsberg wrote in another poem published with “Howl,” adding, “Go fuck yourself with your atom bomb.” Beats and “angry young men” acted out in rebellion with bizarre behaviors deemed symptomatic of madness: incoherent, profane, obscure, and dangerous. In response to a crazy world, they, like Yossarian, decided to go crazy.[^28]

Such depictions of mental illness in literature were sometimes resented by those who had experienced the disease not as a choice but involuntarily, not as metaphor but firsthand. One enduring literary account of schizophrenia proper was the autobiographical novel _I Never Promised You a Rose Garden_, published in 1964. Like Deborah Blau, the book’s protagonist, the author Joanne Greenberg was institutionalized for schizophrenia as a young teenager. Deborah’s behaviors draw from a range of symptoms associated with schizophrenia: she acts out, is unruly, refuses to keep herself clean, burns herself with pilfered matches, speaks nonsense. Her primary symptoms, however, are those in the paranoiac middle ground. Like Billy Pilgrim in _Slaughterhouse-Five_, she is the captive inhabitant of an alternative world she calls the Kingdom of Yr. Its characteristics recall those of fantasy novels: a hierarchy of gods, each with his or her own special powers, their names and language reminiscent of those of Middle Earth. At first the inhabitants of Yr, the Yri (pronounced “eerie”), are friendly to Deborah, and Yr is more beautiful and meaningful than the real world. Increasingly, however, the Yr gods punish Deborah for any commitment she continues to hold to reality. They tell her that her “essence” is “tainted” and that her insanity is contagious. Deborah is beset by guilt and fear of her own toxicity and destructive power.[^29]

Having already authored several novels with no connection to her biography, Joanne Greenberg was wary of how _Rose Garden_ would be received and so published it under the pseudonym Hannah Green. But in writing the book, she had had something of a cause: she believed it important to refute the romanticizing of mental illness, most explicitly by the Beats. “‘Madness’ was seen as liberating—I knew it was the opposite; as creative—I knew it was the opposite; as honest—I knew it was the opposite,” Greenberg later explained. Certainly, little in her account of her condition is appealing. To read Deborah’s interactions with her own psyche, so intricately elaborated with the stuff of fantasy fiction, is to witness the curdling of mental function and to feel a kind of nausea. Yet the book is still popular with teenage readers. If Greenberg had wished to prove that schizophrenia was not “creative,” in this account, it plainly is. Deborah, for all her bizarre rebellion, is a bright, artistic, and brave young soul.[^30]

In several ways Greenberg’s depiction of schizophrenia is supportive of double-bind theory. The disease develops into habit, almost from infancy, through repeated reinforcement. Deborah’s painful memories “become tremendous. Each of the many, many times you are called to remember the cold of abandonment . . . this experience says deep inside you, ‘You see? That’s the way life is, after all.’” Deborah is particularly sensitive to “lies.” The doctors who performed major surgery on her reproductive organs when she was seven had assured her the procedure would be painless. Deborah’s retreat from reality begins with this lie. That retreat comes to include retreat from an anxious mother, as well. Nevertheless, what causes trouble for Deborah reaches deeply into the general perception of reality and extends into general experience. Like the Beats and their fictional counterparts, she is also in retreat from history: Hitler and the bomb had taught her that the real world was “lawless and wild.”[^31]

The Beats whom Greenberg charged with romanticizing mental illness were on the fringe of expressive culture. Mainstream works, however, were making many of the same connections. A film contemporary with Greenberg’s own institutionalization depicted a postwar mental illness–delinquency continuum that proved not only popular but also iconic. The three delinquents or quasi-schizophrenics, two boys and a girl, introduced in the opening scene of _Rebel without a Cause_ (1955) suggest a familiar symptomology. The scene takes place in a police station, where each of the characters is under arrest. Charges are not entirely clear. Judy has been picked up on the street; solicitation is implied. Plato has killed the neighbor’s pets. Jim, played by James Dean, has been arrested for public intoxication. He is another of those charismatic actors-out. His speeches and posturings verge on hebephrenia. They are at the same time cues meant to render context ambiguous and thinly veiled pleas for interpretation. Each of the characters is middle class, fashionably dressed, well groomed, and beautiful. The attractiveness of mental disturbance here is a good deal more straightforward than that offered by the Beats. But they too were making the kinds of postwar gestures, both inside and outside the metalanguage of poetry and fiction, that could get young people arrested, get them psychiatric appointments, or sometimes locked up in wards.

As _Rebel_’s story progresses, the source of pathology in each case is implied not only in family dysfunction but also in the broader culture. Judy’s budding sexuality has strained her relationship with her father. Jim’s family is a viper’s nest of passive-aggression. Plato’s wealthy parents are absent, vacationing overseas. There is no explicit commentary on the bomb or nuclear policy, but one early scene raises the prospect of sudden annihilation. The characters have gone with their classmates on a field trip to the planetarium, where they are shown a film that depicts the earth’s destruction in the explosion of a supernova. The children shift in their seats as the bright light from the film blanches their faces. Next to this inevitable “burst of gas and fire,” the presenter intones, “man existing alone seems an episode of little consequence.”[^32]

What are Jim and his friends to do with this information? What “difficulty at the metalevel” might it raise? Should they adopt the attitude of the presenter—a man speaking from the chilly authority of science in a tone both exultant and remote? No answers to these questions are forthcoming. It is as if that area of inquiry is out of bounds. The students are simply released from the theater into daylight. The universe is lawless and wild.[^33]

### LEWIS MUMFORD’S CALL FOR CONVERSION

What emerges here is a familiar complex, consisting of the bomb, paradoxical deterrence policies, the apprehension of reality as cold and meaningless, and the deleterious effect all this was perceived to have on mental health, especially the mental health of the young. This complex was mined to the point of cliché in the 1960s, but it wasn’t a product of that decade. Nor was it a product solely of young artists like Ginsberg, pushing the conventions of their craft. “The period in which we live,” social critic Lewis Mumford wrote in 1954, “is characterized by strange inner contradictions.” The “most rational procedures of science” now had “as their end product . . . wholly irrational goals.” As a result, “the price of victory in the next war” could very well mean “the extermination of the human race.” The “traumatic effects on the personality” of such contradictions were “already observable,” Mumford asserted, before Dean’s _Rebel_ and Ginsberg’s “Howl.”[^34]

Mumford’s social criticism also partook of the “chastened mood.” Like Niebuhr, Mumford constructed a broad critique of modernity in the years following World War I. In the late 1930s, the two found common cause as early center-left interventionists on the question of German aggression. In a 1940 essay in support of intervention, Mumford attacked liberals reluctant to confront Hitler. He called them “pragmatic liberals.” Pragmatic liberals, Mumford charged, rested too confidently in the rational instrumentalism of applied science. Mumford didn’t cite original sin, as Niebuhr did, but he charged pragmatic liberals with a failure to acknowledge what the concept implied. The problem of confronting evil was not a problem of incomplete or obscured knowledge but of unwarranted optimism, complacency, and pride.[^35]

The analyses of Niebuhr and Mumford also shared a chronology. For Niebuhr, the historical touchstone was the Reformation. It brought “the modern sense of individuality” to fruition and yet restrained individuality within the bounds of Christian doctrine. Similarly, Mumford’s “ideal liberalism,” which he preferred to the “pragmatic” variety, was rooted in the pre- and protomodern. It represented a “larger human tradition embodied in the folkways of the Jews, in the experimental philosophy of the Greeks, in the secular practices of the Roman Empire, in the sacred doctrines of the Christian Church, [and] in the philosophies of the great post-medieval humanists.” Pragmatic liberalism was a break from these traditions and an amplification of Enlightenment rationalism: “a wrinkled smile left over from the eighteenth century.” Mumford’s “wrinkled smile” was Niebuhr’s “perpetual smile”; Niebuhr’s “excessive pride” was Mumford’s “adolescent pride in the scientific conquest of nature and the invention of power machinery.”[^36]

Mumford did not, as Niebuhr did, mix historical interpretation with ahistorical supernaturalism. He could not, any more than Vonnegut could, accept salvation within the terms of Christian theology. Yet the remedy he posed echoed Niebuhr and placed it at the level of religious orientation: “What is demanded is a recrystallization of the positive values of life, and an understanding of the basic issues of good and evil, of power and form, of force and grace, in the actual world. In short: the crisis presses toward a social conversion, deep-seated, organic, religious in its essence, so that no part of personal or political existence will be untouched by it.” Here, Mumford set moral and physical categories side by side, suggesting that culture and nature required _re_integration, _re_crystallization. Thinking like this placed Mumford among the preeminent advocates of postwar holism. Holistic thinking was the intuition that, in Richard Falk’s words, “the whole and the part are united in reality,” or as Catherine Keller has put it, that “no one thing is really separate from anything else.” Mumford’s holism can be directly traced to his interest in Samuel Butler, the British novelist and naturalist who challenged Darwinism on scientific grounds, and to Mumford’s mentor Patrick Geddes. Geddes passed to Mumford the holistic idea, wrote one biographer, that “no living organism could be understood except in terms of the total environment in which it functioned.”[^37]

It isn’t difficult to see in double-bind theory, along with much of the other material under consideration, a baseline holism that fits the same bill. “The symptoms and the sickness and the secrets have many reasons for being,” Joanne Greenberg wrote of her illness in _Rose Garden_, emphasizing its interconnected, systemic character. “The parts and facets [of the illness] sustain one another, locking in and strengthening one another.” Greenberg’s holistic description of schizophrenia posed a challenge to the optimistic instrumentalism of the modern worldview, just as Mumford’s analysis had. If not for the systemic character of the disease, Greenberg writes, victims could be given “a nice shot of this or that drug or a quick hypothesis and say, ‘Craziness, begone!’ and it would be an easy job. But these symptoms are built of many needs and serve many purposes, and that is why getting them away makes so much suffering.” For Mumford, too, society’s pathological habits were “deep-set” and “organic.” Breaking them meant a change in orientation equally deep, “religious in its essence,” the equivalent of a “conversion.”[^38]

When in 1954 Mumford brought his holistic critique to the matter of the bomb, again he mounted his historical argument; again he attacked the shallow optimism of scientific progress. Again he made the holistic gesture: “By the automatic advance in scientific knowledge, we are now committed to processes whose tempo we do not dare to retard, whose direction we do not govern, and whose ultimate results we do not stop to evaluate. Under such conditions every permission becomes a compulsion.” In this and in subsequent passages, Mumford leans on the metaphor of mental illness. Irrational conditions, compulsive behaviors, automatic pathologies, and material destruction combined in a multitude of interrelated triggers, creating a vast and accelerating movement toward “general disintegration.”[^39]

Here Mumford’s critique betrayed the influence of a new postwar field of scientific inquiry known as cybernetics. This field included the study of systems governed by information running through them in “bits.” Such systems could be living or mechanical, so cybernetics included the potential interface between them, and more. Cybernetics had been born of the rigorous interaction of a group of original thinkers—engineers, mathematicians, physicians, and anthropologists—at a series of meetings held between 1946 and 1953 in New York under the auspices of the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation. Gregory Bateson was an enthusiastic contributor to these so-called Macy Conferences, and what Mumford was describing in the passage above is a system out of balance, a system careening back and forth between “inner contradictions,” a system in what Bateson and his Macy Conferences colleagues called “runaway.”[^40]

Bateson didn’t reference Mumford or Niebuhr in his work, but his thought was in accord with theirs in several ways. It was in accord with their chronology, which placed the root of the problem in the Enlightenment, with its “excessive pride,” its rational instrumentalism, its apotheosis of the “autonomous individual,” and its cult of progress. The genius of Newtonian science triumphed, Bateson believed, and then held sway throughout the nineteenth century’s Industrial Revolution, providing premises, now conventional, on which that revolution was based. These premises included strong materialism and linear causation: mentality was epiphenomenal, and in matter, the laws of force and impact held. These premises included atomism: a part could be studied without reference to its surrounding environment. They included objectivity: material observed could be considered without reference to the observer. These were the premises that supported instrumental rationalism and its emphasis on technique. In time, Bateson would summarize these premises as “the philosophy of control.”[^41]

Bateson believed another scientific tradition proved superior to the philosophy of control. This tradition emphasized flux, process, and mind not as separate from but as immanent in nature. Nourished by the new physics of Max Planck, Albert Einstein, and Werner Heisenberg, by the work of other thinkers in philosophy and science such as Henri Bergson, Charles Peirce, and Alfred North Whitehead, and more recently by the thinking that led to cybernetics, this tradition was, Bateson believed, more sophisticated and accurate than the Newtonian postulates. This strengthened tradition was holistic rather than atomistic, circuit-based rather than linear. Most of all, it had at its center not energy, not force, but information. It suggested a new set of postulates, a new orientation, a new epistemology in the life and social sciences of the kind Mumford had called for in society at large.[^42]

Not that any of this was clear in the last half of the 1950s. Bateson and his group hadn’t set out to construct a new epistemology. A group of four or five could never hope to achieve so comprehensive a task, even if they had conceived it in these terms. Rather, they were looking hard at the contents before them, informed by ideas they thought important. As Bateson would write years later, what he and his colleagues were struggling toward was but “dimly apprehended,” more “a matter of taste or smell than cogent argument.” Their double-bind concept, one might say, proved a significant sensory boost.[^43]

### THE MESSY AUTHORITY OF THE REAL

The impossible dilemma constructions of Niebuhr, Camus, and Vonnegut came from the humanistic disciplines—theology, philosophy, and the arts. Catch-22, in particular, was an inspired distillation, a sharp and insightful metaphor, mined from the common experience of modernity and hammered out on the forge of Heller’s artistry. Yossarian, like many of Kurt Vonnegut’s protagonists, is a sympathetic man of the flesh, his psyche strained by intolerable conditions, yet essentially comic. Other fictional creations of the period—Camus’s stranger Mersault, for example—are less funny, less colorful, less sympathetic, and their psychological brokenness often finds expression in heinous acts.

The nonfictional schizophrenics at the hospital in Palo Alto shared many of these traits. They could be opaque, buried in sadness, pathetic, and sometimes violent. Certainly, they could be comic. One institutionalized son presented his mother with a Mother’s Day card that read, “You have always been like a mother to me.” The expressions of schizophrenics, Bateson believed, often mirrored the structure of jokes, with some mischievous twist at the metalevel that pulled the rug on expectation. But unlike Yossarian, Billy Pilgrim, and Mersault, the broken people whose behaviors Bateson and his colleagues observed were real people with the grittiness and messiness of the real and with the real’s stubborn resistance to clean interpretation.

It is in this respect that the double bind differs from the other constructions of the period. Expressed at a rich interface between numerous disciplines—zoology, anthropology, clinical psychiatry, linguistics, and philosophy—the double bind was not merely a trope but a scientific hypothesis built upon empirical observation and collaborative research. Certainly, the double bind itself is an abstraction, but it was an abstraction that emerged within, in Bateson’s phrase, “the hurlyburly world of natural history.” The double bind spoke to widely shared subjective experience, but its construction drew deeply from the messy authority of the nonfictional, the real.[^44]

Still, when it came to mental illness, where was the line between the fictional and the real? Did it even make sense to think about a “mentally ill” individual, or was it more accurate to speak of “a system of disturbed relationships”? Bateson and his research team were moving in the direction of the latter. Because their 1956 paper presented the double bind as a theory (or, to be more accurate, as thinking _toward_ a theory) about cause, or etiology, in schizophrenia, it was received with greatest interest by the psychiatric community. That reception, too, would be messy. Among psychiatrists charged with the treatment of mental health, double-bind theory offered hope. It also disturbed long-held habits of perception. Even Bateson and his team would struggle with the concept and to grasp the breadth of its implications.[^45]  

## Three: The Hurly-Burly of Natural History

For some time Bateson and his team had been conducting research at the veterans hospital in Palo Alto, observing patients and their families in a number of settings and recording these sessions on audiotape and film. Now, following the publication of “Toward a Theory of Schizophrenia” in 1956, the group boosted and further formalized these efforts. Bateson and his colleagues went into homes and filmed families at dinner; parents feeding, bathing, and dressing their babies; older children at play. The group developed a structured interview to establish baselines. They added as a control group a number of “normal” families, who were also interviewed, taped, and filmed. To view the films that the double-bind group made is to enter into a scene of 1950s suburban California: the men, the fathers and team members alike, in plain suits, white shirts, and ties, even in times of leisure; the women in heels and dresses; glasses horn-rimmed, hair highly barbered; pipes and cigarettes, everybody smoking—Bateson smoked almost continuously; the research team hauling and handling the cameras, film canisters, and recording equipment with workaday expertise at a time when, for many Americans, television sets were still exotic.

From the beginning, Bateson’s background in natural history and his growing up in his father’s household influenced the group’s approach to research. It was “doing some natural history,” as his daughter Mary Catherine would phrase it. When she, almost a teenager, came to visit him from New York, they’d go exploring the coasts of Northern California. Gregory had the “English habit of latinizing in the woods or in the garden,” Mary Catherine remembered. His practice combined observation and theory, a “moving between an engrossing concrete reality and the abstract order of the biological world.” Theory was drawn from what was observed and then tested against further observation. At the VA hospital in Palo Alto, the double-bind group was in a testing mode now.[^1]

This activity answered to a concern that had troubled some in the group since the initial conception of the hypothesis. Applying Bertrand Russell’s logical types to the interpersonal world of schizophrenia, Bateson had posed a question: What must have happened in the lives of these persons, to have resulted in such habits of communication? The double bind was his answer. That Bateson’s idea began, not as a clear-cut empirical discovery, but as a deduction, had struck some of the team members by surprise. Bateson “never had any data,” Jay Haley later wrote. “It was a hypothesis really, that Gregory pulled out of the sky, on the basis of looking at the way people communicated.” Bateson’s deduction had led to publication, but for Haley and others, the actual existence of double binds needed verification. This became their main project.[^2]

Meanwhile, the double-bind concept began to gain traction in the psychiatric community, especially among those involved in treating schizophrenia. In the preceding chapter, the double bind was placed in the context of other impossible dilemma formulations across a broad range. To consider it now in the context of clinical psychiatry requires a shift in perspective. The context is narrower and thus thicker with detail. Interdisciplinary aspects of the double bind are easier to see, as is its place in a social sciences and life sciences conversation. But contested ideas in this narrower realm echoed those contested in the broader.

The twentieth century has been called the Age of Schizophrenia. The etiology of schizophrenia during this period was an area open to innovations such as the double bind precisely because this was a disease for which the promise of modern medicine had not materialized. Schizophrenics made up a significant—some would say exploding—portion of the resident population of psychiatric hospitals, but there was no consensus on how to treat the disease, how or why someone contracted it, or even whether it might be cured.[^3]

In the United States especially, schizophrenia was a volatile concept. How was one to understand such a disease from a worldview that reduced mental phenomena to physical-chemical processes? The default position was materialist and bottom-up: some unfortunate mechanics rising up through the body and taking expression in complex symptomatic behaviors. That these behaviors involved cognitive processes and linguistic representation—thinking and talking—made “spiritualist” heresy a temptation. That was akin to returning to times when such matters were explained by demon possession. Yet the default position was weak. As the double-bind group continued its research, conflicts arose that revealed how difficult it was to craft a new position.

### MEDICAL AND MORAL MODELS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA

An 1809 book titled _Observations on Madness and Melancholy_ by British physician John Haslam offered the first clinical picture of what would come to be called schizophrenia. He identified the malady as one of the young, striking typically between puberty and the early to mid-twenties. From the position of contemporary symptomology, Haslam’s description suggests hebephrenia deteriorating into catatonia, a kind of sudden-onset apathy progressing rapidly to extremes. Haslam was moved to mention the decided effect on those youth who had been bright and precocious, “the favorite of parents and tutors.” Victims became unwilling and eventually unable to care for themselves, even to manage their own bodily functions. It was a “hopeless and degrading” transformation.[^4]

Haslam did not give the condition a name, and eighty years passed before the concept and the field of psychiatry itself matured enough for more orderly classification. Details were filled in, some of which provided for a paranoiac stage. In the last decade of the nineteenth century, the German physician Emil Kraepelin, often referred to as the father of modern psychiatry, identified the condition as dementia praecox, or dementia of the young, to distinguish it from the dementias of old age. Aiming at precise description of course and outcome, Kraepelin documented many of Haslam’s basics: onset after puberty, behavioral incoherence, emotional flatness, hallucinations, rapid deterioration. He documented the hopelessness Haslam saw, too. According to Kraepelin, dementia praecox was incurable.[^5]

A decade later, the Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler coined the term “schizophrenia” to build on Kraepelin, with major refinements. At the hospital where he worked, Bleuler tracked outcomes for hundreds of patients fitting the dementia praecox description and found that a significant number had returned to the community and to their lives. Bleuler did not claim a cure existed, but his findings challenged its irreversibility and suggested a state of remission. That opened the matter up a bit. Like Kraepelin, Bleuler assumed a somatic etiology; the cause of the disease came from inside the body. But Bleuler was a colleague of Carl Jung’s and much influenced by Freud and so entertained the possibility that etiology could also include processes in the development of personality or traumas in life experience—an environmental, psychogenic cause. The result was disturbances or splits in the faculties of thought, the “schiz” of schizophrenia.[^6]

Terminology is instructive here. Making their journeys from Europe to America, from German to English, the terms “dementia praecox” and “schizophrenia” would vie for prominence in American psychiatric medicine. There would be a period when the two were interchangeable, until the outset of World War II, when dementia praecox was finally eclipsed. This was not a mere relabeling. Instability and conflict in classification matched instability and conflict at a more fundamental level. The shift in terminology concerned how to think about mental disease itself.[^7]

In regard to etiology, some have described the difference between dementia praecox and schizophrenia as the difference between a “medical model” and some version of a “moral model.” The medical model excluded on principle psychological, social, and cultural components. Moral models included them. By allowing for some psychogenic role, by allowing for a reaction to environment—to the events of life and learning—a moral model allowed significance to be attributed to symptomatic behavior. There was something in what victims said and did that held a meaningful relation to the why. For Kraepelin and the medical model, all pathology was pathology at the cellular level, and the behaviors in which these pathologies found expression were, to use a word from outside the field, “epiphenomenal.” Nothing the victims said or did bore significance to the disease itself. Such thinking, argued Kraepelin, was “meta psychiatry,” the product of the “winged imagination of Freud’s followers,” a thinking that offended his “philistine scientific conscience.” As for the patients in Bleuler’s study who returned home, who did not progress into catatonia—they, Kraepelin insisted, had been misdiagnosed.[^8]

Few of those involved in the argument—doctors, scientists—were not committed empiricists. But what was the empirical link between behavior and pathology? Knowledge of a causal mechanism was “virtually nil.” Those in Kraepelin’s camp assumed a somatic mechanism linking the diseased cell to symptoms, a mechanism they assumed would one day be found. Those open to psychogenic cause looked to the testimony of the Great War, the troops suffering shell shock and exhibiting dementia praecox–like behaviors. World War II repeated this testimony, and behind the lines, where many American psychiatrists gained practical training, therapies that included insight into the meaning of traumatic experience and its connection to psychotic symptoms often proved successful. But an empirical link between environmental trauma and the brain was no more locatable than was a somatic link between symptoms and a diseased cell. It too had to be assumed.[^9]

This is not to say the lines of debate were always, or even usually, clearly drawn. Concepts, approaches, and new ideas were typically received by those less concerned with theory than with practice. In the United States, doctors charged with the care and treatment of patients, and superintendents of large facilities juggling budgetary responsibility with numerous other demands, made use of what they found in Kraepelin, in Bleuler, and elsewhere. The integration many sought of somatic and psychogenic concepts became, in practice, eclectic. Doctors tried the new somatic therapies of the interwar and wartime period—chemical and electric shock, lobotomy and other surgeries—as well as the revolutionary psychotropic drugs of the postwar, such as Thorazine. At the same time, doctors were open to therapies that included psychoanalysis and “milieu” or group therapy and were friendly to the promotion of “mental hygiene” in society at large.[^10]

Where concepts met the demands of practice, the basic somatic-psychogenic conflict broke in numerous ways. Nineteenth-century insane asylums had been primarily custodial. More and more, however, the new psychiatric hospitals were serving an outpatient community in addition to the traditional and ever-present chronic cases incapable of self-care. The custodial role contended with the preventative role; research that focused on course and outcome contended with research into etiology. Here, the term “schizophrenia” seemed a better fit. If the cause could be identified, the disease might be prevented or even cured. What was split might be put back together. As psychiatry enlarged its jurisdiction, as more and more persons displayed symptoms that fit under schizophrenia’s expanded diagnostic umbrella, the term “dementia praecox” became “politically uncongenial.” One did not want to condemn so many to a prognosis of irreversible deterioration. Similarly, funding flowed more readily toward programs that held out the promise of eradication than toward those that merely aimed at maintenance.[^11]

When drawing conclusions from a perspective that spans two centuries, Gerald Grob, the historian who has traced the psychiatric care of the hardest cases in the United States, sees a swinging back and forth “between enthusiastic optimism and fatalistic pessimism.” The optimism was generated by the “illusory belief that good health is always attainable and purchasable.” When belief collapsed, a “prolonged disillusionment” followed, during which “ethical and moral considerations” sometimes lapsed. Freudian psychoanalysis can serve as an example. Psychoanalysis was the most influential of the moral models, giving environment its largest etiological role and insight its largest curative role. It rose to prominence in the middle decades of the twentieth century. Today few consider it a viable therapy. In a recent critique, psychiatrist and historian Richard Noll calls Freudian psychoanalysis in its heyday “simply a seductive way for doctors to maintain hope” that patients could be made better at all.[^12]

Here, then, is the contour these historians describe: the medical model’s insistence that reality be accepted according to some clearly prescribed standard, at times pushing against and at times giving way to the moral model’s determination to sustain hope. This contour resonates with that articulated by Reinhold Niebuhr’s Serenity Prayer. In the battle against schizophrenia, this heartbreaking disease, what could and could not be changed?

### A BIOLOGICAL MODEL

Into this climate the double-bind concept received a friendly hearing, and the shifts it posed were large ones. One shift was in how the pathology was thought to be contained. Both somatic and psychogenic thinking understood the disease to be something inside the symptomatic individual, within the boundaries of the skin. Double-bind thinking moved that pathology outside the skin and placed it in the family “system,” a system that had become pathological. Its mode of communication was full of unresolved error and coerced censorship. Paradoxes were not recognized or allowed to be acknowledged or reconciled. Punishments were meted out, punishments of cognitive frustration but also of true emotional hurt. Don D. Jackson, the psychiatrist and double-bind group member most experienced with schizophrenia, had seen young schizophrenic patients make considerable progress, only for that patient’s sibling to begin to exhibit symptoms, or for the marriage of the patient’s parents to come under severe strain, or for one of those parents to succumb to a nervous breakdown. Jackson’s anecdotes suggesting compensatory deterioration were by no means unusual. He, Bateson, and their colleagues began to refer to the schizophrenic victim as the “identified patient” to emphasize this notion that the locale of the disease not be understood as inside a body but as relational and systemic.[^13]

Obviously, like moral model approaches to schizophrenia, double-bind theory took environment into account. It insisted, too, that symptomatic behaviors were meaningful, in the sense that they were significant to the “why” of the disease. Yet Bateson never discounted a somatic or genetic factor in etiology. He simply refused to reduce pathology to the cellular and leave it at that. By grounding his hypothesis in child-parent relations, Bateson placed focus on patterns of interaction between individuals deeply attached to each other, indeed upon family members who shared not only experiential and emotional ties but also life itself and who were almost always related genetically, as well. The picture of pathology suggested by double-bind theory was neither chemical activity at the cellular level nor the Freudian impact of trauma during a crucial time of personality development but a progressive, repeated pattern of relationship. Rather than assuming an empirical link, either between the diseased cell and behavior on the one hand or between environment and behavior on the other, double-bind theory was an attempt to reveal what a link might look like at the level of interpersonal relations within a system whose content was information, was meaning.

The shift posed here was larger somehow, larger even than the shift in the “where” of the disease. This way of looking fit neither a medical model nor a moral model. With its emphasis on learning and habit formation, the double-bind hypothesis is perhaps better described as a “biological” or “interactive model,” if one included the back-and-forth of information, meaning, and suchlike as fundamental to biology. Of the key terms involved—“relationship,” “information,” “pattern”—the latter was perhaps the most important. Pattern could be detected but not precisely located. Double binds were not the sort of things that could be counted up and quantified.[^14]

This was an obstacle in the double-bind group’s project of verification. The researchers were striving to achieve some evidentiary weight to prove that double bind was something more than a mere deduction, as Haley put it, “pulled out of the sky.” To know that something really existed, it had to be seen. Double-bind terminology—message, metamessage—needed to be attached to the components of a communicative exchange that could be externally perceived. Emotions, expectations, meanings, and other internal processes were thought by some in the group best to be bracketed because internals were not reliably observable. Bateson resisted this walling off of the interior. On this and related matters, rifts within the group began to emerge.

One reasonable scientific response to a difficult patch was to impose greater rigor. In the case of the double-bind group’s project of verification, that would mean a more rigorous identification of double-bind “sequences” in the data: binding messages, punishments, and so on. This impulse, too, Bateson felt, must be resisted. Rigor for its own sake produced trivia. “If it’s not worth doing, it’s worth doing well,” he would say. For his colleagues, it was one of those memorable lines that spoke to Bateson’s long life in science. His tenure had resulted not in an assumption of rank but in a sort of wry humility.[^15]

Another ongoing source of conflict within the group was the pressure to find a practical application. Along with their research agendas, group members also had caseloads of patients to whom they offered therapy. Both inside and outside the field of clinical psychiatry during this time, it was not uncommon for research objectives and medical goals to overlap, and the members of the double-bind group had not clearly recognized any line between observing a patient for purposes of research and helping that patient to get better. By 1958 all the members of the double-bind group, excepting Bateson, had begun private practices, pioneering the techniques of family therapy.[^16]

That Bateson’s attentions were elsewhere was telling. It was during this time that Bateson immersed himself in the journals of John Perceval. Perceval was the son of an early nineteenth-century British prime minister. The journals, published in 1838 and 1840, narrate a period during which Perceval lost his sanity and was incarcerated in a lunatic asylum. Bateson had obtained the works years before, prior to any involvement in psychiatry, but had rediscovered them among items in the Bateson family estate, recently shipped over from England to California. Now he was rereading the journals, with an eye toward editing them for republication.[^17]

While this activity didn’t necessarily surprise Bateson’s colleagues, they may have wondered about it a little. The work of the double-bind group had been rewarded with growing interest. For obvious reasons, that interest was primarily psychiatric. “It was as if a door had been opened,” John Weakland would write, looking back on how well their early papers were received. The double-bind group’s framing of mental illness within a biological or interactional model struck many with the authority of self-evidence. The psychiatric community was perhaps most hopeful about the new experiments in family therapy. Surely, this was where the action was. Surely, here were the new tools doctors might apply to the needs of their patients. Why was Bateson devoting time to a document written before Kraepelin and Bleuler, before Jung and Freud, before the birth of modern psychiatry and its decades of progress?[^18]

Bateson, too, had a small caseload at the hospital, and his own approach to therapy sheds light on this question. Bateson’s patients were likely to be men, veterans, alcoholics. (If diagnosed with schizophrenia, they were likely to be among those for whom the old dementia praecox diagnosis would not have applied.) During a scheduled session, he might take one of these men golfing. While golfing, they would talk. If some of this talk concerned concepts related to the double bind, it was not because Bateson was convinced that insight was therapeutic in any direct way; it was because these were the sorts of conversations Bateson had with the people in his life. He might as well have been taking the man on a hike through the forest or along the shore, overturning rocks, latinizing, doing natural history. Bateson’s methods were much remarked upon. As a therapist he was not without gifts. He would “bust his ass for his patients,” making himself available to them, Haley said. Bateson cared for his patients as persons, as fellow human beings. But that care was not of intellectual interest to him. As a scientist, he was after something else.[^19]

### A THERAPEUTIC DOUBLE BIND

All remembrances of the participants of the double-bind group acknowledge the centrality of these two conflicts to the group’s work: first, the resistance in double-bind thinking to quantification and thus verifiability, and second, the pressure to apply their findings toward the relief of real suffering. Of course, difficulties were expected in such endeavors. Members continued to publish. The work progressed.

Jay Haley, looking back on his experience with the double-bind group from the perspective of twenty years, praised Bateson’s contribution as director. Bateson allowed Haley and the others a wide berth, and when they all came together to engage in the material, he didn’t condescend, despite his name, his first-rate education, or his being the elder of the group and Haley’s and Weakland’s former teacher. Haley’s commentary, however, demonstrates that what Bateson offered the group as leader had much to do with his background. He “provided a stream of interesting people to the project,” Haley remembered, “and he seemed to know everyone of any importance in a variety of scientific fields.” One of Bateson’s strengths was his ability to discern the trivial from the nontrivial among the countless questions and data the group confronted. Among scientists, too, Bateson “could distinguish the lightweights from the heavyweights.” One of these heavyweights was the psychiatrist Frieda Fromm-Reichmann.[^20]

Fromm-Reichmann was a longtime member of the psychiatric staff at Chestnut Lodge Clinic in Rockville, Maryland. A German Jew, she had immigrated to America, along with her then husband, the psychologist and philosopher Erich Fromm, during the years of Hitler’s rise to power. She had worked with shell shock victims during the Great War, and she believed the connection between psychology and mental illness to be elusive but inarguable and that the symptomatic behaviors of victims were deeply meaningful. During her years at Chestnut Lodge, she had worked closely with the neo-Freudian Harry Stack Sullivan to develop the methods of an “interpersonal” therapy.[^21]

Bateson had been acquainted with both Fromm-Reichmann and Sullivan when Bateson lived in New York with his then wife, Margaret Mead. Clearly, his own ideas about therapy were influenced by their approach. Later in Palo Alto, Bateson brought Fromm-Reichmann to the double-bind group for consultation, and the group had observed her in practice. A small woman of great warmth and energy, Fromm-Reichmann was renowned in the field for her ability to read the psychology of her patients and to make a connection with them. It was something, people thought, intuitive, a gift. Above all, Fromm-Reichmann was devoted to those she treated and willing to adjust to their timetables. Much of the problem with psychiatry, Fromm-Reichmann believed, was its tendency to prematurely surrender to despair.[^22]

Bateson had mentioned Fromm-Reichmann in connection to a case in the final paragraphs of the original double-bind paper. That case involved a young teenager, “very schizophrenic and quite hesitant about entering into a therapeutic situation.” Since the age of seven, she had been trapped within a hallucinatory world of her own making, “a complex religion replete with powerful gods.” In the paper, Bateson rendered the scene between patient and therapist as a kind of semifiction, with dialogue: “At the beginning of the treatment, [the patient] said, ‘God R says I shouldn’t talk with you.’ Dr. Fromm-Reichmann replied, ‘Look, let’s get something into the record. To me God R doesn’t exist and the whole world of yours doesn’t exist. . . . Now go to God R and tell him that we have to talk and that he should give his permission.’” What Fromm-Reichmann had done here, Bateson asserted, was to place her patient in a double bind. On the one hand, she made it clear that she didn’t believe the gods were real. On the other hand, she instructed her patient to speak to one of those gods, as if he _were_ real. It was, in other words, “I want you to disobey me” in elaborated form. Perhaps, because of her doctor’s doubt, the patient would be moved to herself doubt the reality of the hallucinations. Perhaps she would simply obey her doctor’s command to speak to God R about the request for permission. Either way, she would be engaging herself in the therapeutic program Fromm-Reichmann had instigated to help her. This was the point. She had lived in God R’s world for nine years, Fromm-Reichmann reasoned, and “he has not helped you.” Maybe therapy could. “Tell him I am your doctor and this is what I want to try.”[^23]

The exchange between Fromm-Reichmann and her patient appeared in somewhat different form eight years later in that patient’s fictionalized memoir, _I Never Promised You a Rose Garden_. In Joanne Greenberg’s book, Dr. Frieda Fromm-Reichmann is Deborah Blau’s psychiatrist, Dr. Fried. The scene in question includes no talk of a double bind. But it ends with the doctor’s paradoxical instruction to speak to the gods of the Kingdom of Yr in whom she claims not to believe. “I want you to go back and tell those gods . . . that I will not be cowed by them,” Dr. Fried says.[^24]

The scene is a crucial one in the book. It marks the start of Deborah’s trust in Dr. Fried. That trust becomes the basis of the relationship that makes her recovery possible. Establishing that sort of relationship was the essence of Fromm-Reichmann’s interpersonal approach.

Readers of the double-bind paper would not have yet known the name Joanne Greenberg or Deborah Blau, but if they knew of Fromm-Reichmann, they were aware of the case. Fromm-Reichmann had successfully brought a young, self-mutilating teenager up from the depths of paranoid schizophrenia and had returned her to her family and to life. She had done so without drugs, insulin or electric shock, or any other somatic treatments but solely through the skills of therapeutic relationship. Some psychiatrists suspected that Fromm-Reichmann had been lucky in this case. Whereas so many schizophrenic patients were blank, uncommunicative, too far gone to be reached, Fromm-Reichmann had had a kind of dream patient: bright, creative, her symptoms florid and interpretable. Other psychiatrists saw the case as an example of the diagnostic looseness that had entered into psychiatry and its ill-conceived efforts to expand beyond its jurisdiction. But whether it was viewed from the perspective of the moral model or the medical model, or somewhere in between, it was the case for which Fromm-Reichmann was most renowned.[^25]

Bateson had not originally included the story in the double-bind paper. _Behavioral Science_, the journal that published the paper, had initially sent it back, calling for a revision that included some attention to application. Bateson responded by adding the Fromm-Reichmann story to the draft in an act of concession he likely came to regret. Bateson would, in fact, come to regret publishing the paper in its original form altogether. It caused too many confusions, too many misunderstandings. Both the verifiability conflict and the application conflict had been factors all along. Both conflicts were condensed in the inclusion of the Fromm-Reichmann story, yet neither was settled by it but instead made worse.

As medical doctors interested above all in helping their patients, and as social scientists with a materialist orientation, readers of “Toward a Theory of Schizophrenia” naturally understood the double bind as something bad, as a bad _thing_, which could hopefully be identified, located, and removed. But double bind, the Fromm-Reichmann story implied, was not a thing, not a substance, and not necessarily even a negative. Rather, here was an instance where a talented psychiatrist had used an intuitive ploy to bind her patient into a situation where confining patterns of communication might be broken, where the claims to truth made by hallucinations might be undermined, and where productive therapy might begin. This was, Bateson had tried to clarify, a “therapeutic double bind.” It is likely and understandable, however, that the story only emphasized the association between double bind and application readers were looking for.[^26]

And why wouldn’t they read the story that way? In application was hope: that something might be done, that the bad thing might be subject to change, that the disease had a cure. This was the hope many readers would find in Joanne Greenberg’s novel, too, despite how much the author, like Niebuhr in his Serenity Prayer, tried to qualify expectation. Above all, _Rose Garden_ tells the story of Deborah Blau’s recovery. That recovery involves the painful repudiation of a lonely unreality that for Deborah is both a refuge and a torture, and the painful reclamation of a shared reality that must be accepted as flawed. That shared reality is “no rose garden,” Dr. Fried tells Deborah, the origin of the now well-known phrase. The real world is one of dishonesty and injustice, Dr. Fried says, but at best it’s one where ideals might be realized and change achieved, through a process that involves both “faith” and “fight.”[^27]

### NATURAL HISTORY OF AN INTERVIEW

Fromm-Reichmann returned to Palo Alto in 1956, not long after the publication of the double-bind paper in which she had been mentioned and her famous case discussed. On a sabbatical from Chestnut Lodge, she had been appointed as a visiting scholar at Stanford’s Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences. She wanted to do a project on body language, a new field called kinesics. Her thinking was this: If it was true that she had some talent, some special intuition in reading patient psychology, perhaps what she was reading was kinesics. If this was true, then gaining some formal knowledge in kinesics would make her a better teacher to the resident psychiatrists in her charge. That Fromm-Reichmann undertook this project at the age of sixty-seven surprised no one who knew her energy and tenacity. She realized, however, that she didn’t have the data necessary for such a study and no time to spare in obtaining it. What she needed was some substantial record of human beings communicating with each other of a kind that an observer could both hear and see. When Bateson became aware of her project, he offered up the cache of thirty-minute reels of film the double-bind group had been shooting.[^28]

Fromm-Reichmann gathered a team and began a systematic study of this material. Bateson was included, as was Ray Birdwithstall, a Vanderbilt expert in kinesics and also a visiting scholar at Stanford. The team spent hours watching the films, running certain sequences repeatedly, while Birdwithstall coached them on what to look for. Bateson appeared in a number of these films, as interviewer and therapist, and watching them was difficult for him emotionally. Hearing one’s voice on a tape recorder can elicit acute embarrassment; watching oneself on film in a room full of social scientists evaluating every word and movement was another matter altogether. Even more difficult, however, was the sheer amount of information. When postures, gestures, vocalization, and intonation were included along with words, just a few seconds of film produced pages and pages of notes and lengthy discussion.[^29]

The team soon set most of the reels aside and narrowed their attention to a particular batch, and then to a few particular sequences. In one of these sequences Bateson sits at a kitchen table chatting with Doris, the mother of a preadolescent child who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia. At one point Bateson lights Doris’s cigarette, and something of a relationship crystallizes, an exchange of agreement, of trust. The psychiatrists in the room recognized the moment immediately. It was one of those moments like the one in Joanne Greenberg’s novel, when therapy itself becomes a possibility.[^30]

This sequence, along with a few others, served as the basis of what came to be called _The Natural History of an Interview_, a massive project that would not be complete for another fifteen years. Too voluminous and unfundable to be published between book covers, it was made available only on microfilm when it was finally done. Bateson, always collaborative, was much involved early on, and the gesture to natural history in the project’s title bears the mark of his influence. But his direct participation lasted only through Fromm-Reichmann’s tenure, which was less than a year. She died in 1957. Bateson had liked and respected her. Having himself and his efforts at therapy combed over on film had been an ordeal, but her professional, dignified manner and plain sincerity made it bearable. She was a heavyweight, and he’d learned a lot from her.[^31]

To some degree, his work with Fromm-Reichmann helped Bateson understand the rifts widening within the double-bind group and the obstacles in their project of verification. The problem, in short, was the data. Six hours of transcription for a single second of interaction—this was simply too much. And not only too much but also too lush, too rich, too soaked in the complexities of human experience. How could one take it all in? Its richness was “appalling,” an “Augean muddle,” he wrote years later. Bateson favored classical references and earthy, humorous analogies: “‘_Mussen wir alles ansehen_? Must we look at _everything_?’ said the German girl as she climbed the steps of the British Museum.” What was needed was not a more rigorous and efficient method of dealing with the data but data of a different kind, cleaner and simpler. The Perceval journal, for example, was cleaner in that, having come from the early nineteenth century, it was free of the language, habits, and abstractions of a century of modern psychiatry.[^32]

Understanding better the difficulties with the data, Bateson could better appreciate the divergence between himself and some of his colleagues. Data was crucial, of course—but what really mattered was what one intended to do with it. Haley and Jackson, in their efforts to locate and clearly identify double binds, were amassing a dossier of evidentiary weight. They were trying to fill that dossier with examples of the same bits of behavior that would fit the story the double bind hypothesis had proposed. Bateson wasn’t doing that. He was trying to find out whether ideas used to perceive and understand form in one context would hold up when used in another. They were trying to build a case; he was trying to build a theory.[^33]

But if the rift was methodological, that spoke only to a larger divergence—one, Bateson would write, still “dimly apprehended.” The theory Bateson was trying to build, by applying to biology the thinking about systems, communication, and information that had come out of the Macy Conferences, would challenge an “older, realistic or thingish epistemology.” For Bateson, his team, and their work at Palo Alto, this “thingish” way of understanding framed not only their project of verification but also their very conceptual base. All the members of Bateson’s team had been drawn to Bateson and his project because they sympathized with his approach; they, too, were excited by the thinking that had come out of the Macy Conferences. They, too, were eager to apply that thinking to other problems and fields. Yet they, too—no less than the psychiatrists who read their paper—were inclined to see double binds as substances, as things. To the old way, Bateson wrote, they were “tied by the leg to a massive ball of habit,” “stupid-bound, like the protagonists in a Greek tragedy.” Only in later years would Bateson be able to grasp this with enough clarity and confidence to put it into such stark terms. Deeply sunk habits meant they saw living reality as “non-mental” and “all that stuff about ‘ideas’” as “nonsense.”[^34]

Breaking that habit meant a change in orientation, a change in where the inquirer stood in relation to the content of inquiry. It brought the scientist into the content, so to speak, not separate from but continuous with it. As Bateson struggled to grasp this change and its implications, as he struggled to negotiate conflict within his research team, the new orientation brought other seemingly disparate items together: the obstacles in the project of verification; the inability to “count double binds”; the stubborn “thingish” habit of seeing; the pressure for application and utility; the psychiatric setting in which his research project was located, and the psychiatric institutions that funded it.

Again, only in the aftermath was this plain to him. “It was from psychiatry that we got our money,” Bateson wrote in 1976, reflecting on the achievements and failures of the double-bind group, “and we let ourselves be strongly and disastrously influenced by the need to apply our science in that field. However well-intentioned the urge to cure, the very idea of ‘curing’ must always propose the idea of power.” Power, too, was one of those concepts to which they were “stupid-bound.” Power was perhaps the utmost of the old habit of perception and thinking to which the new orientation proposed change.[^35]  

## Four: Faith and Fight

In the opening scene of _Rebel without a Cause_, the troubled teenager Jim, played by James Dean, sits in a police station waiting to be booked on a charge of public drunkenness. His parents and paternal grandmother arrive in a frantic rush. They have come from a formal party at “the club,” and Jim makes a to-do about his father’s tuxedo, topcoat, and hat. Jim treats his father with exaggerated courtliness and seats him in a raised chair, as if placing him on a throne. The father chuckles uneasily at this, as well he might—his son is something of a clown. But Jim is also a master at code-switching. He turns suddenly serious and asks, hurt, “Am I funny to you?” The trap is a classic double bind. Jim has bid his father to laugh at him, and then, with his question, frames his father’s laughter as disrespect. He has distorted the metadata to turn the emotional tables on his father. As symptomatic behavior, it calls out for interpretation. Jim is in need of a powerful father, and he longs for the father to take his rightful place as king.

The drama in _Rebel_ does much to endorse the prevailing patriarchy of the postwar middle class. Double-bind theory was received within and shaped by the same patriarchy. Jim’s mother is precisely the sort of figure psychiatrists and clinicians friendly to the theory soon began to readily identify: a classic “double-binding bitch,” a term Mary Catherine Bateson would use to decry this chauvinist tendency within the clinic. The mother-as-villain scenario had roots in the modernists’ attack on the Victorian mother as keeper of a vacuous moral order. It also contained something of the more recent attack on the smothering, banal mothers of “momism,” mounted in Philip Wylie’s bestseller of 1942, _Generation of Vipers._ Bateson remarked that a common reaction among researchers observing schizophrenic families was that the father needed “a shot in the arm.” Surely viewers of _Rebel_ were intended to have a similar reaction. The “causes” of the problem in this social problem movie may well be the weakness of Jim’s father and an insecure, sharp-tongued, and controlling mother who won’t let her husband be a man.[^1]

Such is the difficulty of schizophrenia that few treatments have been wholly successful. Many have been controversial, and some have done more harm than good. Accordingly, the clinical legacy of double-bind theory is controversial and negative, and this is due in part to the degree to which its reception and application partook of the anti-mother bias. Despite the protests of Bateson and others, psychiatrists eager for a breakthrough overread double-bind theory as “the answer to etiology,” wrote psychiatrist Milton Berger of the period. They “went stalking for double-binding parents, and especially for parasitic mothers,” and they tended to find what they were looking for. “A family would be brought in,” Jay Haley summed up, some years later, “and the parents would feel they were being blamed for driving their child crazy.” Recriminations and defensiveness ensued. For many heartsick parents, even more eager for a breakthrough than the clinicians, the worst applications of double-bind theory amplified the guilt these parents already felt for their child’s condition.[^2]

It is to Bateson’s and his colleagues’ credit that the impulse to blame the mother troubled them from the beginning. They were concerned that their theory not be misunderstood as associating the double binder exclusively with the mother or as attributing the disease to bad mothering. Although they weren’t unreceptive to the concerns that would inform a book like Betty Friedan’s soon-to-be-published _The Feminine Mystique_, it was not sympathy with an emergent second-wave feminism that troubled them. It was the awareness that there was little difference, from a systems point of view, between identifying a victimizer and identifying a diseased cell. To do so was only to transfer a simplistic, linear causation from the interior to the exterior, from the soma to the relational field. Double bind could not be properly described as something one person _did_ to another. Holding to the theories of systems and information developed in the Macy Conferences on Cybernetics, Bateson and his group strived rather to describe the double-bind relationship in a way that made the circularity of systems apparent.

At the center of the difficulty was the concept of power. It was difficult to see human relations as something other than a sequence of “power plays,” like the one Jim plays on his father at the police station. Even when pathology was perceived as systemic, it was hard not to see the people within these systems as victims of some vast, oppressive force. At the same time, a purely systemic approach threatened to overlook the power differential altogether and to see, as Haley put it, the various components in the system as equal. For Haley it was intuitive that “how much power one person would allow another to have over him was central to human life.” As a result, “the moral issue” of “whether one should or should not struggle for power seemed to introject itself into the phenomena.” Haley attempted to refine what seemed a crude, linear, will-to-power understanding of human relationships by envisioning double-bind communication as a struggle over which communicative partner would control, not the other person, but the _terms_ of relationship both partners shared. For Bateson, such distinctions were slight. Yet any alternative was still hazy.[^3]

For the double-bind research group, the concept of power was the biggest obstacle to progress toward a new life sciences orientation. “Power,” like “force” and “impact,” was a metaphor that fit a Newtonian, mechanistic universe, and yet was a concept so central to the human experience that any attempt to think around it faced an enormous challenge. Meanwhile, in the broader culture, calls for a new, holistic orientation in confronting social crisis, such as that called for by Lewis Mumford, also struggled with the concept of power.

As the fifties became the sixties, the chastened mood of the postwar in general came increasingly under attack for ignoring power and its role in social justice. Radicals, liberals, and secular existentialists challenged the “tragic turn” as a bourgeois accommodation to status quo power relations. Where was the source of unjust power? There blame could be affixed. Where did power effect injustice? There solidarity with the oppressed could be lodged. How might unjust power be resisted? There was the aim of moral action. Thus an interrogation of the concept of power became an interrogation of the efficacy of human assertion to moral ends, of the kind at the center of the impossible dilemma constructions by Reinhold Niebuhr, Albert Camus, and others.

Never far from the surface in regard to these matters was the old question about the source of moral order, whether it was to be found in nature or whether it was wholly the product of human culture. To challenge “the idea of power,” in other words, was to return to first principles. For Bateson, these struggles brought an end to the double-bind group, clarified his inquiry, and took him in a new direction. What he would later call a ten-year “trip” through psychiatry ended, and a new journey began.[^4]

This is not to say that the transition was easy or foreordained. When obstacles and frustrations loomed, Bateson returned to starting places, to matters that first inspired him. Most of all, this was a return to the practice of the naturalist. In several essays written between 1958 and 1961 and presented at psychiatric forums, Bateson used mental illness as a point of departure into more abstract and theoretical matters of biology and evolution. To this material he brought the ideas that had first led to the double bind, those ideas developed at the Macy Conferences on Cybernetics.

### STALEMATE AND RUNAWAY IN THE SCHIZOPHRENIC FAMILY

Two world-class math geniuses had presided over the Macy Conferences on Cybernetics, held over a period of seven years following the war: Norbert Wiener of MIT and John von Neumann of Princeton. Like Albert Einstein, Leo Szilard, Edward Teller, and so many others who would contribute to advanced mathematics and physics in the twentieth century, Wiener and von Neumann were the product of the emigration of European Jews. Wiener’s father was born in a part of Russia now claimed by Poland and came to the United States prior to the turn of the century. Von Neumann, a Hungarian teaching in 1930 in Berlin, had himself emigrated amid rising anti-Semitism. By the time the war ended, when what would become known as the Cybernetics Group was organized and commenced, Wiener and von Neumann were recognized as among the top minds in their field. Wiener had established the mathematics for Brownian motion and had done advanced work in harmonic analysis. During the war, he had worked on the technical problems posed by antiaircraft weaponry. Von Neumann’s accomplishments were even more significant. He had developed a mathematical framework for quantum theory, had produced an axiomization of set theory, and with the economist Oskar Morgenstern had devised game theory. His wartime service was as a member of the Manhattan Project, working on detonation, target sites, and estimated death tolls. At Princeton, following the war, von Neumann began designing and building some of the first program-stored digital computers.[^5]

Recognized as intellectual prodigies from their childhoods (indeed, as “human computers”), both Wiener and von Neumann were capable of astonishing feats of numerical calculation. Both were adept at pulling together vast bodies of data from numerous disciplines and seeing the connections between them. This capacity for synthesis, along with their experience with the collaborative necessities of wartime science, marked the work of the Cybernetics Group. Its interdisciplinary character was made plain at the first official Macy Conference, held in New York at the Beekman Hotel in March 1946, seven months after V-J Day. Von Neumann was lecturing about digital computing and its similarities to the neurological networks of the human brain. Wiener wondered how paradox, specifically Russellian paradox, might factor in. The back-and-forth that followed produced a salient connection: when a digital computer faced such a paradox, it began to oscillate. It became unstable. It went into runaway. Bateson’s trajectory over the next ten years—into communication theory, the project in Palo Alto, the double bind—began largely with his presence at this exchange.[^6]

Runaway become an important conceptual tool for Bateson. As he came to see it, the phenomenon of runaway was manifested in the psychiatric clinic as a kind of paralysis. Families with a schizophrenic member were often plagued by a habit of indecision. They couldn’t arrive at appointments on time; members argued about the same things over and over; they were unable to make future plans. This was paralysis not in the sense that they were motionless. Rather, they couldn’t stop doing what they were already doing. And what they were already doing they were doing more and more.

Again, _Rebel_ provides an illustration. There at the police station, discussion of Jim’s predicament between father, mother, and grandmother becomes a round-robin of backbiting and recrimination. Any attempt to take charge of the situation is undercut: the father by the mother, the mother by the grandmother, and so on. All is further destabilized now and again by one of Jim’s absurd and anguished acts of metaplay. The nonfictional families in the clinic at Palo Alto behaved this way, too. Their relations revolved between the same old moves, oscillating between momentary states, none of which was allowed to stand. At one end, the family strived to maintain an external appearance of normalcy. At the other end, Bateson wrote, these external appearances were “under constant attack” by the identified patient who was “likely to remark in a clear conversational tone in church, ‘We haven’t had a nice crackling storm lately; have we dad?’”[^7]

Oscillation seemed to narrow and accelerate. Often it progressed toward some climaxing crisis. One of the family’s members—most often, as expected, the identified patient—would create some incident. She would undergo a breakdown, or he would have to be institutionalized or would be picked up by the police. Yet even after the punctuation of crisis, the pattern of runaway would return again to repeat its course.

A means of understanding this revolving stuck-ness in a formal way was also discussed at that first Macy Conference. In a 1959 essay called “Group Dynamics of Schizophrenia,” Bateson revisited paralysis and runaway using von Neumann’s lecture topic, game theory, as a conceptual tool. Game theory was von Neumann’s attempt to achieve mathematical precision in analyzing the formation of coalitions and their relative stability under the conditions of competition. In a zero-sum game of three players, for instance, stability could be achieved when two members formed an alliance against the third. That alliance could only become progressively stronger, with the two becoming more and more efficient in shutting out the third. Once two more players were added, however, no long-term stability was achievable. At that number a repeating sequence of alliance and breakdown ensued: four against one, three against two, four against one again (though not necessarily the same four as initially), and so on. With five players, Bateson summarized, alliances couldn’t last. For every possible coalition, there was at least one other that would “‘dominate’ it—to use von Neumann’s term.” There would “always be a circular list of alternative solutions so that the system will never cease from passing on from solution to solution, always selecting another solution which is preferable to that which preceded it.”[^8]

This model, Bateson wrote, was “reminiscent of what happens in schizophrenic families.” Even in a family as small as three, no two members were ever able to form “a coalition stable enough” to withstand intervention by the third member. Game theory was therefore a useful theoretical model to capture a pathological dynamic in which “double bind experiences must return _ad nauseum_.” The model also made it difficult to assign blame for the problem to any particular member. Like the players in one of von Neumann’s games, each was only making “the common-sense move” at any given moment, only to be proved wrong by what happened next. The model offered a way of talking about “the larger system—the family—instead of talking, as we habitually do, about the individual.” Certainly there were problems with a game theory model. But even its inaccuracies could “point to new theoretical developments.”[^9]

Thus in another essay, “The New Conceptual Frames for Behavioral Research,” Bateson focused his analysis on the inaccuracies. He began by reminding his readers of the limitations of any theoretical model. For the truth of any model’s conclusions to stand, its premises and variables had to be simplified. Game theory required many simplifications. One couldn’t, for instance, imagine the players in game theory discussing the rules of the game among themselves. They couldn’t talk about whether the game was worth playing. Such talk could lead to a change in the game itself, and if that complexity were permitted to be part of the model, the integrity of its equations would be lost. Therefore, metalevel, about-the-game statements were disallowed to the players, ex hypothesi, to protect the truthfulness of the equations.[^10]

Another simplification involved player motivation, which had to remain singular and unchanging. Players played to maximize utility or gain. Coalitions formed, in turn, to “dominate” smaller numbers so as to extract gain from them. With every change in the number of players, possibilities for and vulnerabilities to domination were subject to change, but the motivation to dominate—again, according to an ex hypothesi determination—was “monotone.” Living organisms, Bateson pointed out, were not like this at all: “Over and over again, we find organisms whose entire strategy will change from one period of time to another.” Sometimes “maximum value” was set upon food, other times upon sex, and other times upon care of the offspring. “Even among Protozoa” there were “periods of growth and fission, periods of sexual activity, periods of encystment, and so on.”[^11]

Was there any evidence in natural history at all to suggest that organisms were ever motivated by any singular utility? It was true, Bateson conceded, that rats selected “an optimum diet under experimental conditions,” but it was far from certain that they were “guided to this” by any monotone preference. Rats in the laboratory, in other words, became very wise about mazes and food pellets. “Human beings notoriously lack this basic wisdom,” Bateson wryly noted.[^12]

In contrast, game theory imagined players possessing “total intelligence.” This was another simplification of von Neumann’s model. In no way could moves in the game be affected by a lacking in knowledge, ability, or experience. Every player had to be just as smart as every other. Again, this was far from the case of living creatures, and in particular human beings. They made mistakes; they experimented and erred; they were capable of deceit and of being deceived. They also learned. By learning, creatures could adapt; they could change.[^13]

They could, in other words, evolve. In both essays, “Group Dynamics,” and “New Conceptual Frames,” Bateson extended his analysis into evolutionary theory. He wished to convey to his audience that, in the processes of life, there were two “psychological mechanisms” working in tandem. One was adaptation to “the demands of the personal environment.” The other, running counter to adaptability, was “commitments” to the past: old ways of doing and of perceiving. These commitments, Bateson asserted, were in fact the characteristics that defined organisms as stable entities. They defined persons as selves; they safeguarded identity. To prove that commitment wrong, in turn, was the negation of identity, and the result of that negation was pain. This was especially the case when that process occurred within family relationships, the very relationships within which these selves had been “called into being.” The schizophrenic was the learner whose life had become a repetitive sequence of self-negation. The schizophrenic family was a system whose stability was negated ad nauseam.[^14]

Von Neumann’s players—or “robots,” as Bateson called them—could never suffer in this way. Never having to confront conditions for which they could be proved wrong, they would never feel the pain of self-negation. As perfectly intelligent robots, they were unfeeling, never caught short, and capable of anything, so long as it conformed to the model. In “Group Dynamics,” the first essay discussed above, Bateson used the game theory model to stress the trapped, runaway, “perpetual” character of “double-bind experiences.” But in “New Conceptual Frames,” Bateson summed his case up this way: “Precisely because all organisms including man are in process of evolution, and because this process is never completed, organisms can never have the simplicity or single-mindedness of the player in a von Neumannian game. They are never equipped to solve all the problems which the rules can present and will never, by learning, achieve this complete equipment. They do not live in a universe in which the rules of the game are constant and above all they can never be motivated by simple ‘utility,’ of whatever sort.” This might be put another way: The universe of the living was an open universe. In game theory, the universe was closed.[^15]

### THE RIDDLE OF THE SPHINX

Bateson’s essays of the latter years of the double-bind group’s work do not directly address his conflict with Jay Haley over how to factor in “power.” By interrogating game theory as a mathematical model applied to natural history, however, he challenged the concept of power indirectly, and alternatives to its centrality began to appear. Game theory posited in the hearts of its players a motivation for “simple utility,” for gain at the expense of the other players. This mirrored the competition for resources and pure advantage-seeking that was central to the modern understanding of nature and social reality. Generalized, that simple utility _was_ power, an ex hypothesi assumption unspoken because it was so conventional, and presupposed in von Neumann’s use of the word “dominate.” In contrast, the characteristics of living creatures as Bateson described them—the plural character of utility, the capacity to learn, the persistence of habit, the experience of pain—offered a far more nuanced if not altogether different vision of the world of life. The creature Bateson described was one often at cross-purposes with itself, torn between the demands of present conditions and commitments to the past, susceptible to impossible binds, and yet at the same time a learner, existing within an open, indeterminate universe.[^16]

Rather than the monotone preference to dominate possessed by game theory’s robots, a living creature’s centrality was a sort of continuous riddling outward as to its “biological nature” and its “place in the universe.” In later years, Bateson would describe this ever-questioning, experimental process in humankind as an ongoing attempt to answer “the riddle of the Sphinx.” Unexplored by Bateson in his works are the correspondences in this description with the philosophy of pragmatism developed by the Americans Charles Peirce and William James, themselves heavily influenced by Darwin’s theory of evolution and the British naturalist tradition. Indeed, by using the phrase “riddle of the Sphinx,” Bateson was calling upon a famous passage by James Fitzjames Stephen, the nineteenth-century British jurist and member of the Royal Society, just as William James had at the end of his seminal essay on pragmatism, “The Will to Believe” (1897). Stephen enumerated the Sphinx’s riddles as “What do you think of yourself?” and “What do you think of the world?” Bateson didn’t stick to this wording but reformulated it to fit his own practice as a scientist and to emphasize the reflexivity of that practice: “What is a context that a man may know it, and what is a man that he may know a context?”[^17]

This double-riddle might be further tweaked to fit the kind of creature Bateson described in “New Conceptual Frames.” _Who am I to you? Who are you to me?_ What he described was primarily a social creature, perhaps a child within a family, continually testing whether its social self was viable. Its motivation was not singular but plural. Answers proved wrong put the learner in a bind. But there was no victim and no victimizer in this rendering. No one was blamed, no one excused. Here were shades of Martin Buber, another thinker with whom Bateson was in sympathy. But nowhere in this description was power appealed to explicitly or given the central role.

In this way of thinking, Bateson was also in tune with his sometime mentor Norbert Wiener. Through the years of the Macy Conferences and until Wiener’s death in 1964, Bateson and Wiener held in common an approach to inquiry that saw human choice and action as shaped not by the struggle for power but by efforts to establish identity. To the extent that a public was aware of the work of the Cybernetics Group, Wiener was the figure most associated with it. He was the one who had given the group and the field its name—cybernetics, which he coined from the Greek term _kubênêtes_, or “governor” in English. In books such as _Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine, The Human Use of Human Beings_, and other writings addressed to a wide audience, Wiener presented a picture of a world governed not by force but by information. It was a biosemiotic world where nature-shaped organisms and human-made machines existed on a continuum and would almost certainly become increasingly interfaced. Wiener was no cheerleader for the cyberworld he depicted. He harbored great fears for the world to come. Bateson also shared with Wiener a wariness about technological solutions and his apprehension about the future. Both the apprehension and the wariness were in stark contrast to the outlook of their Macy Conferences colleague John von Neumann.[^18]

Apprehension and wariness of this kind took on political valence during the Cold War. Indeed, the attitudes and actions of Wiener and von Neumann, the two mathematicians who guided the Cybernetics Group, came to represent opposing positions regarding the products of scientific genius and the social role of the scientist in the aftermath of the bomb. Hiroshima and Nagasaki shook Wiener deeply, and he had immediately vowed never again to contribute to the technologies of destruction. Although many scientists reacted with similar anxiety, there was something unguarded and perhaps intemperate in Wiener’s proclamation that was characteristic of his prickly personality. Von Neumann’s reaction to Hiroshima was, in contrast, decidedly sanguine. He declined to join his colleagues in signing the Association of Los Alamos Scientists statement advocating for an international body to regulate knowledge concerning atomic power and for the sharing of that knowledge with the Soviet Union. He was not a policy maker but a scientist, von Neumann said. It was not his role to take a political stand, to weigh in on value, but simply to supply the facts.[^19]

Yet behind the scenes von Neumann immediately began to cultivate contacts in the U.S. government, and he would spend the rest of his life at the nexus of technology, military planning, and foreign policy. He became a strong advocate for the development of the hydrogen bomb and of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and their delivery systems—technologies that would serve as the bedrock of the Cold War policy of deterrence. He would hold a number of leadership positions, including the chairmanship of the ICBM Committee and, eventually, that of commissioner of the Atomic Energy Commission. In these positions of power, von Neumann would offer information and leadership shaped by the beliefs that the proper response to the dangers of the nuclear age was not parity of arms but massive superiority and that hope in any international regulatory body was naive.[^20]

Von Neumann’s background and experience as a Hungarian was decisive in this. For him, the American wartime alliance with the Soviets was never more than temporary. Experience had taught him that Hitler and Stalin were two sides of the same coin. But more central to von Neumann’s way of thinking was a general attitude of optimism concerning human progress via advanced technology.

Von Neumann demonstrated both this optimism and his awareness of its unfashionableness (in some circles) by his proclamations concerning the appropriateness of first strikes and by the names he gave some of his projects. The computer that worked out the calculations for the H-bomb was the “Mathematical Analyzer, Numerator, Integrator, and Computer,” or MANIAC. Von Neumann, too, is said to be responsible for the phrase “Mutually Assured Destruction,” with its unapologetic acronym, MAD. There is some irony in the speculation on the part of biographers that the pancreatic cancer that killed von Neumann at the age of fifty-three was contracted during his presence at the site of the atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll, the first since the bombing of Japan. Von Neumann was famously cavalier about the dangers associated with technological advance, including that of radiation poisoning.[^21]

For Wiener, in contrast, the arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union exemplified a system in runaway. Bateson shared this view. The challenge from natural history to the reductionism of von Neumann’s game theory that Bateson mounted in “New Conceptual Frames” was something he and Wiener had worked out together, in correspondence and conversation. Both saw the stamp of von Neumann’s zero-sum games—played by all-knowing, morally flexible robots—on the calculations underlying nuclear brinksmanship. The premises upon which systems such as MAD were based required, as Bateson put it, “the presence of their own confutation.” These were systems caught in double bind, in progressive stalemate, accelerating in the direction of some punctuating crisis.[^22]

Beyond a few suggestive statements in these late-decade essays, “Group Dynamics” and “New Conceptual Frames,” Bateson made no explicit connection between von Neumann’s game theory and broader sociopolitical relations. To do so would perhaps have been going too far. He was writing, after all, for the psychiatric community. Still, one wonders how his readers reacted to these essays. As Bateson discipline-hopped from schizophrenia, to game theory, to evolution, to general assertions about the nature of reality, surely many scratched their heads. Bateson wasn’t unaware of the danger of leaving his audience bewildered. As if torn between the desire to undertake fundamental matters and, for the sake of his audience, to rein himself in, he took pains to assure them that his “wide canvas of speculation” was relevant.[^23]

He took pains, too, to be even-handed. Bateson admitted to admiration for von Neumann’s game theory. Behavioral science, he claimed, was in need of some simplified model “around which theory might crystallize,” just as modern physics had been in the seventeenth century, with Newton’s “myth” of the free-floating body. Game theory, or something like it, was a move in the right direction. But caution was necessary that the myths of science not be taken for reality. One’s “epistemological hypothesis”—those premises accepted ex hypothesi—determined all subsequent questions and procedures. These premises could be inaccurate. Central assumptions could be examined and refuted. _Who am I to you? Who are you to me?_ Scientists too were capable of evolution in answering the riddle of the Sphinx.[^24]

### THE SIREN TO BE FEARED

As the “wide canvas” of Bateson’s late-decade essays attest, he was looking for a way to move on. In the spring of 1959 he wrote Robert Oppenheimer, von Neumann’s sometime colleague, who was then director of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. Bateson was looking for a fellowship. In his letter of interest, he summarized his accomplishments, hinted at current frustrations, and described himself as at a turning point. Double-bind theory had been “received with interest and even enthusiasm” by psychiatric clinicians. Now he faced a choice “between exploiting these ideas at the narrowly clinical level or building their theoretical implications” into evolutionary theory, genetics, and “the epistemology of perception and pattern.” His “heart,” he admitted, was “in the theoretical problem.” Others could do the clinical work, but if he didn’t do the “theoretical job,” it might “not be done for another 10 or 20 years.”[^25]

Oppenheimer was one of the most well known of the Manhattan Project scientists, and his statements of ambivalence concerning nuclear technology had drawn far wider attention than had Norbert Wiener’s. Bateson and Oppenheimer were acquainted through a long-standing personal connection, however. Once in the late 1940s, Bateson was asked to give a talk to a group of physicists that included Oppenheimer, and he had spent the night at Oppenheimer’s house. The topic of the talk was the same ambivalence to which Oppenheimer had given voice, the same concern that, a few years later, would lose him his security clearance in one of the more egregious purgings of the McCarthy period. Bateson now addressed Oppenheimer with an awareness of an affinity between them. He wrote that he spent “too much time talking to applied science people, especially psychiatric audiences whose basic scientific orientation is either uncritical or unsophisticated.” He needed “some tougher sparring partners.”[^26]

Other correspondence during this period indicates Bateson was casting about for people to spar with, people open to the theoretical problems that interested him. One of these was the Princeton historian Charles Coulston Gillispie. Previously unacquainted with Gillispie, Bateson wrote him after reading an article of his in _American Scientist_ titled “Lamarck and Darwin in the History of Science.” Bateson had recently returned to the books of the French biologist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, whose theory of evolution had come fifty years before Darwin’s. Bateson was intrigued, therefore, by Gillispie’s argument that the relationship between Lamarck’s and Darwin’s theories represented not a continuity but a clean break.

Lamarck, Gillispie wrote, was the “last important scientist” to draw on the ancient insight that “the world is flux and process.” Lamarck had imbibed the romantic view that the atomistic approach of Newton and Francis Bacon, which broke down the whole into parts and rendered their interactions into mathematical formulas, worked to “denature” the objects of biology (a word Lamarck himself was the first to use). This holistic, “ancient view,” held by Lamarck and the romantics, was furthermore characterized by the nagging desire to save nature as a source of moral norms. To “make virtue rise from nature,” Lamarck and his alchemist forerunners—as well as Denis Diderot and, later, Samuel Butler—employed purpose-based explanations, which made nature somehow self-determining and thus appear to think. This persistent teleology in the life sciences caused it to lag behind physics in adopting the worldview of modern science, which rejected any notion of purpose in nature.[^27]

In contrast to Lamarck, Gillispie argued, Darwin resisted this holistic romanticism. Darwin refused to read morality into nature. Rather, he took nature “as it was given,” with no appeal to teleological or end-directed causation. In doing this, Darwin “abolished the distinction between biology and physics” and rescued biology from romantic demands that it could not meet “without ceasing to be science and becoming moral or social philosophy.” Thus Lamarck and Darwin, in Gillispie’s reading, represented two sides in the modern battle between the holistic/romantic and the atomistic/positivist. Darwin prevailed in the battle, leaving Lamarck’s philosophy a “medley of dying echoes.”[^28]

Bateson wrote Gillispie to ask for a reprint of the paper. To this request, he added a bit of commentary. Gillispie’s “analysis of the contrast of the two ways of thought” was, Bateson wrote, “very valuable.” Gillispie was “probably right in thinking that Darwin learned little from those who preceded him.” These were backhanded compliments to both Gillispie and Darwin, however congenially phrased. Bateson didn’t lecture Gillispie or pull rank on him as a working scientist, but it is clear that in regard to evolution, Bateson believed that Gillispie had taken the conventional tack and was likely unaware of the advances pioneered in the Macy Conferences on Cybernetics. By bringing “information” to a level of legitimacy at least equal to that of physical matter, the Macy work had revived the legacy of a congruence-seeking “moralistic science.” This revealed not a break but in fact a continuity running from the “pre-Darwinians,” such as Lamarck, through Butler, and into the twentieth century, to the work of zoologist Warner Clyde Allee, biologist C. H. Waddington, and the Macy mathematicians. In Bateson’s view, the “medley of dying echoes,” as Gillispie had put it, was to the contrary very much alive.[^29]

But this was mostly in the background. In his letter, Bateson directly challenged Gillispie only on the salient point of science as a body of knowledge that was somehow morally neutral. “I confess that I disagree with you,” Bateson wrote, “in some passages where you seem to prefer the Darwinian to the more unified and romantic view of the universe. Seriously, I do not see how you can expect science to be non-moral. Surely any organized exposition of human experience must in the nature of the case preach some doctrine, and it seems to me that Newtonian and Darwinian science effectively preaches a _doctrine_ of non-morality when they claim to be ‘non-moral.’ To pretend to non-morality is to preach that non-morality is the ideal. I do not see any way out of this dilemma, except to achieve some congruence between truth and morality. And this after all, is what Diderot, Lamarck and the alchemists and Samuel Butler were after.”[^30]

Gillispie wrote back expressing delight over the letter and admitted to a preference for the romantic view himself. “It is science that prefers” the Darwinian view, Gillispie wrote, “not me.” Gillispie then noted the political element that was a constant factor in what he had depicted as the romantic versus the Darwinian. To seek moral norms in nature was to “sentimentalize nature,” and history suggested this was “a siren to be feared.” This is a reference, one assumes, to the totalitarian ideologies of the twentieth century and to what they owed to German romanticism and philosophical idealism. The suggestion is that the “naturalistic fallacy,” as the attempt to read morality or ultimate meaning into nature was sometimes called, played out in history as terror and blood.[^31]

Bateson promptly responded. Again his tone was congenial but critical. On Gillispie’s claim that science itself preferred the morally neutral Darwinism, Bateson restated his argument with characteristic concision: “May I ask how this non-normative body of propositions manages to generate a preference?” As for the conflict between the romantic and the Darwinian, Bateson confessed that he “had lived most of my life in the middle of that particular battle” and was “tired of it.” He then reframed the conflict in classical terms. The roots of the argument were actually in the difference in views between two pre-Socratics: Democritus, the Laughing Philosopher, who spoke for atomism, and Heraclitus, the Weeping Philosopher, who spoke for flux. In this reframing, Bateson offered to Gillispie the gentle correction that there was not one “siren” in the contest but two: “Except on the sunniest of spring days and with a good deal of make-up, neither of these ladies is really very good looking. The Democritan is dried up, and the Heraclitan terrible with the threat that all precise discrimination, indeed all language, be carried away on the flood of that river into which no man can step twice.”[^32]

Western thought, Bateson’s suggestion is here, was stuck in an age-old oscillation between the cheerful optimism of atomists and the apprehension and hurt of an involved, contingent holism. The Greeks had Democritus and Heraclitus; postwar America had von Neumann and Wiener, among others. The promise of the new life sciences orientation—the “new frames”—that changed where the inquirer stood in relation to the content of inquiry and that sought to find alternatives to the old myths such as “power” was that the prevailing world picture might be changed and that the tired, thousands-year-old battle in Western thought might be renegotiated. Gillispie was resigned to the conventional belief that the modern divisions held, that the unbridgeable separations between mind and matter, value and fact, culture and nature, and all their kindred were ones that must be accepted, despite personal preference. Bateson answered that he was “not quite convinced.” It was surely wrong to see the “two sirens” as “utterly incompatible.” “I suspect rather,” Bateson concluded, “that neither view is tenable unless flavored with the spice of the other.”[^33]

Within a few weeks of this back-and-forth with Gillispie, Bateson wrote Oppenheimer about the Institute for Advanced Study fellowship. Oppenheimer’s response was not encouraging. The work Bateson had described, as Oppenheimer perceived it, fell into the field of psychology, logic, or information theory, which was not, Oppenheimer wrote, “regular” or “substantial activity here.” Bateson had estimated needing two to three years of theoretical concentration, and Oppenheimer noted that the current fellowships offered by the institute ran only a year. Bateson could make an application, but Oppenheimer doubted a fellowship would be forthcoming.[^34]

Bateson remained restless. The reception of the double-bind hypothesis had brought him a certain prestige. Job offers came from the Illinois State Psychiatric Institute and from the Psychiatric Institute of New York. These positions represented regular income, but they would again involve him in clinical work, in the problems of application. Bateson turned both offers down. Intent on following his heart into the theoretical problem, old practices beckoned: doing natural history.

Bateson had mentioned to Oppenheimer that the empirical side of the work he proposed might likely be in the field of animal behavior. Almost a decade earlier, Bateson had attended a Macy Conference presentation where a film was shown of an experiment involving a lobotomized octopus. The experiment was aimed at the measurement of a creature’s external reaction to particular stimuli, a typical approach. Watching the animal fail to complete the task set up for it, Bateson was struck by its apparent expression of emotion: the creature seemed depressed. Now ten years later, Bateson requested permission to set up aquariums in the basement morgue of the VA in Palo Alto. In these aquariums he prepared saltwater environments and placed in them specimens of octopi collected on trips to the coast. Colleagues were puzzled, but Bateson applied to the National Science Foundation for funding.[^35]

The late fifties were a troubled and transitional period in Bateson’s personal life, as well. His second marriage had ended in divorce. After the birth of a son, John, in 1951, Bateson’s marriage to Betty Sumner had suffered a number of blows. Twins born in 1953 had survived only a month. A series of miscarriages followed. To Mary Catherine Bateson, a young teenager living in New York with Margaret Mead, her father’s second marriage represented a conventional lifestyle at odds with his character. “Betty had called my father Greg, which symbolized a kind of domestication, an Americanization,” she wrote in her memoir. Their first house was a tract home in a new suburb. The Batesons owned a television, something of a scandal among acquaintances back east. Later they moved into a “real house” in Menlo Park, where eventually “the stamp of good housekeeping faded.” Bateson brought all kinds of animals into the house—snakes, alligators, an armadillo—for himself and for John.[^36]

After the divorce, Bateson continued to live in the house and to fill it with a naturalist’s miscellany. Eventually this included the octopi project. The grant from the National Science Foundation didn’t come through, but Bateson wanted more time for observation, so he moved the aquariums from the morgue to the house. Mary Catherine took part in the project when she visited. She remembered how the creatures “moved gracefully through the water, like gently drifting lace handkerchiefs, even when they were engaged in territorial conflict or rivalry for mates.” Her resistance to reducing their behaviors to mere struggles for power shows something of her father’s influence.[^37]

The editing of the Perceval journals had been an effort to explore schizophrenia apart from the concepts of modern psychiatry, especially that of psychoanalysis. The promise of the octopi data was that it would be even cleaner of prevailing abstractions. The octopi work signaled, too, a return to the double-bind group’s original objective, the inquiry into communicative distortion in general, and neither solely with mental illness nor even with the strictly human.

### THE CASE AGAINST INSIGHT, THE CASE AGAINST QUIETISM

When Bateson wrote in his letter to Oppenheimer that there would be other people to “exploit the clinical aspects,” he was likely thinking of the double-bind group colleague with whom he was most in conflict, Jay Haley. If Bateson’s heart was in the theoretical problem, Haley’s was in practical application. Disagreements over theory and application and disagreements over how to factor in “power” overlapped between Bateson and Haley. Haley believed, as Bateson did, that a strictly somatic approach to mental illness was deficient, but he came to feel that psychogenic approaches fed the erroneous assumption that insight was the bulk of cure. This was the assumption, as Haley later put it, “that if everyone understood why they did what they did they would never do it again.” Such thinking had handicapped psychoanalysis, the original talking cure, and it handicapped those therapists friendly to double-bind theory, as well. Double-bind theory had contributed significantly to the emerging family therapies. But in Haley’s view, the double bind was only a theory of conditions, “a hypothesis about what was happening, not a suggestion for how to change it.” What was necessary was a “theory of therapy” that focused on “real people with real problems in the real world.”[^38]

Worse, concluded Haley, was that the insight that theory provided could work against change. Insight into the family as a system tended to make “certain happenings” seem “predictable.” This removed from system participants their “individual responsibility.” That, in turn, made them victims, both of each other’s actions and of the tendencies of the system itself. Double-bind theory told families that they were “caught up helplessly in sequences which repeated and repeated despite the wish and the attempts of the members to do differently.” Such an analysis “introduced a pessimism” into the clinic and “made it difficult for the therapist to organize his thinking in a positive way.” Added to this was the way patients and their families used theory as a distraction. “The families of the mad” were expert in metaphors and paradoxes because that was “the kind of communication madness is.” They were “skillful at enticing the philosopher therapist into meaningful discussions”—all to avoid the hard work of change.[^39]

In the same way that the double-bind concept resonated with other impossible dilemma constructions in the culture at large, Haley’s charge that a systems analysis had evasive, paralyzing consequences in the clinic resonated with similar critiques in a broader cultural register. In 1945, the war in Europe over, C. Wright Mills warned that the tragic view was resulting in a “political failure of nerve.” When thinking people indulged in the contemplation of paradox, they retreated to “fantasies of impotence.” Thought became “politically trivial.” Haley’s therapists, fixated on insight, surrendered their duty “to bring about change” in the lives of hurting families. Likewise, Mills’s intellectuals, whose analysis had left them feeling powerless, resigned themselves to “simply understanding.” In doing so, intellectuals surrendered the political role society assigned them: to generate thought translatable into action. Mills’s “working politicians” were analogous to Haley’s “families of the mad” in that these politicians used theoretical jargon as “convenient” and “ethically elaborated” cover for their raw struggle to maintain the status quo and to avoid being held to account.[^40]

As historian George Cotkin has pointed out, Mills’s critique was representative of a midcentury response to the chastened mood and to “the cunning influence of Kierkegaard” and other thinkers of the religious turn. At risk, Mills and others believed, was a loss of confidence in “the power of man’s intelligence to control his destiny.” According to this critique, thought was justified when it led to action, action was linked to control, and control was the “power” to produce change. The critique amounted to a reaffirmation of the core tenet of the modern worldview, what Lewis Mumford referred to as “the new world promise” and what might also be called classical liberalism: that the application of human intelligence, freed from “fantasies of impotence,” would result in greater control over conditions as given and thus in progressive material and social change. Yet how could one _not_ affirm something so fundamental? To even contemplate such ultimate powerlessness was to cast doubt on what it meant to be human in the modern world.[^41]

Nor did Reinhold Niebuhr and Albert Camus, those constructors of the impossible dilemmas previously examined, finally abandon the promise of the modern, though their concepts of original sin and the absurd greatly lessened the appeal of that promise. Niebuhr is often associated with twentieth-century neo-orthodoxy, a reaction to modernist, human-centered liberal Christianity and a return to God-centered faith. But although a fierce critic of the “easy conscience” of modern secular liberalism, Niebuhr was at heart a staunch liberal. The line in the Serenity Prayer that bowed to conditions with graceful resignation was balanced with a line asking for “the courage to change the things which should be changed.”[^42]

Niebuhr’s true position is illustrated in a 1931 debate he held with his brother, the theologian Richard Niebuhr, in the pages of the _Christian Century._ During the uproar over how to respond to Japanese aggression in Manchukuo, Richard Niebuhr offered an eloquent case for religious quietism. In his essay “The Grace of Doing Nothing,” Richard warned the West against “chafing at the bit . . . to do something constructive.” “The actual structure of things,” he wrote, “is such that our wishes for a different result do not in the least affect the outcome.” A better response was one steeped in faith, humility, repentance, and patient preparation for God’s “lasting peace,” which would arrive in God’s own good time.[^43]

The essay irritated an enduring argument between the brothers, and Reinhold responded with an essay of his own, titled “Must We Do Nothing?” If present conflicts were instrumental in God’s ultimate plan, Reinhold asked, why should attempts to act assertively be forbidden? Surely “ethically directed coercion” on the part of human beings could also be one of God’s instruments. To retreat from self-assertion to some imagined “religious perfectionism” or “pure love ethic” was to impose moral paralysis. Reinhold reaffirmed the modern promise, writing in summary, “As long as the world of man remains a place where nature and God, the real and the ideal, meet, human progress will depend upon the judicious use of the forces of nature in the service of the ideal.”[^44]

Camus’s reaffirmation of the modern promise was more dramatic, and it became a more central component of his creed. Immediately following his definitive essays and novel _The Stranger_ came the war, and ever afterward Camus of the absurd view would be indivisible from Camus of the Resistance. The war forced Camus—as “real problems” in the clinic had forced Jay Haley—to shape a theory of conditions into a theory of action.

This development can be traced to Camus’s wartime “Letter to a German Friend.” At one time in philosophical accord with Camus, the friend had come to sympathize with Hitler’s program of aggression. “You supposed,” Camus writes, “that in the absence of any human or divine code the only values were those of the animal world—in other words, violence and cunning.” But there were other values, Camus asserts. There was the Enlightenment’s “tradition of intelligence” and its power to effect change. Mindful of his earlier essays, Camus admits that the most sophisticated intelligence perceived troubling nuances, such as the impossible dilemma insight “that no victory ever pays.” It was precisely this sensitive intelligence on the part of the French that had compromised their initial response to the Nazi invasion. But with the Resistance, the French recovered from their paralysis. The universe indeed had “no ultimate meaning,” yet by calling on the tradition of intelligence, by summoning courage, and by claiming solidarity with the oppressed, humankind could create value within this universe by rebelling against injustice and death.[^45]

Niebuhr was a believer, Camus an atheist, but both walked the same tightrope of paradox, and both arrived on the same ground of the modern promise. T. H. Huxley, too, in his “Evolution and Ethics” lecture three decades earlier, rejected the religious quietist’s “total renunciation of . . . self-assertion.” Surely, Huxley wrote, to whatever degree “we possess a power of bettering things, it is our paramount duty to use it and to train all our intellect and energy to this supreme service of our kind.” For Huxley, as for Reinhold Niebuhr and Camus, quietism was moral paralysis. It was defeatist in the face of what Huxley called “the unfathomable injustice of the nature of things,” what Camus called the “dense” and “unintelligible universe,” and what Niebuhr simply called “nature.”[^46]

In Huxley, Niebuhr, and Camus—as in so many purveyors of the modern promise—the case against religious quietism and the case against reading morality into nature merge. They merge in a human monopolization of intelligence in opposition to the “blind,” “unintelligible” amorality of nature. Huxley’s “Evolution and Ethics” defended Darwinism against the charge that it promoted a “gladiatorial” morality, and he made this defense by rejecting the romantic urge to read morality into nature, to resist, as Charles Gillispie would put it in his letter to Bateson, the siren to be feared. There was no “sanction for morality in the cosmos,” Huxley insisted. Rather, the good was a product of “ethical process,” apart from “cosmic process.” Likewise, Reinhold Niebuhr separated the “ideal” from the “real.” Niebuhr called for the “judicious use of the forces of nature,” not for Huxley’s more confident “command over the course of non-human nature,” but the dynamic was the same. Human power was “the power of bettering things.” To rise above history, to transcend nature and its vast reservoir of savage coercion, humankind required whatever could be brought by way of moral action against cosmic process, or against, as Camus had put it to his German friend, the values of the animal world, “violence and cunning.”[^47]

Richard Niebuhr stands apart here. He responded to Reinhold’s “Must We Do Nothing?” with one more essay. It was wrong, he claimed, to call the debate between him and his brother a debate between action and inaction. The argument went deeper than that. For Reinhold, the “perennial tragedy” of human history could be transcended only “by a goal which lies beyond history.” For Richard, however, human tragedy was “only a prelude” to the fulfillment to come. Whether or not “we shall see it” depended not on self-assertion but on the activity of repentance and forgiveness and on an attitude of benevolent consent: “Self-interest acts destructively in this world; it calls forth counter-assistance, nationalism breeds nationalism, class assertion summons up counter-assertion on the part of exploited classes. The result is war, economic, military, verbal; and it is judgment. But this same structure in things which is our enemy is our redeemer; ‘it means intensively and it means good’—not the good which we desire, but the good which we would desire if we were good and really wise.” For Richard, this was not a recipe for paralysis. It was not synonymous with despair. Nor did this thinking pose a theory of human action that monopolized intelligence and “the good” against an opaque, mindless nature. If his brother believed redemption to be outside nature, beyond history, Richard saw redemption as the “structure in things.”[^48]

The way one answered the riddle of the Sphinx framed all subsequent questions and procedures. The “violent and cunning” animals Camus had in mind were presumably a generalized sort of creature, not different from one of von Neumann’s robots: driven, one assumes, by the singular instinct to dominate and with nothing—not ignorance, competing motive, or moral qualm—to obstruct that monotone preference. They were not, one assumes, the sort of animals that, like Bateson’s octopi, might be perceived to feel despair. Despair, so this thinking goes, was part of the human monopoly on the nonmaterial products of mind, not something found in nature, not continuous with the “structure in things.”

### STAGES IN THE PROGRESS OF AWARENESS

When Frieda Fromm-Reichmann died in the spring of 1957, her sometime colleagues in Palo Alto organized a memorial service. Asked to speak at the service, Bateson recalled the tough hours he and several present had spent with Fromm-Reichmann watching the films of schizophrenic families and of himself working with those families. This was emotionally fraught and painful material involving parents and children whose interactions were clearly pathological. Bateson remembered how Fromm-Reichmann’s kind authority had allowed the team members to stay with the data without shutting off their own empathetic responses. The effect, Bateson said, was to raise the bar of professionalism and to create a space where members of the team could be open with each other and unafraid.[^49]

As the team watched the films over and over, Bateson recalled that it became almost impossible to avoid a “direct experience of how it felt to interact” with the families on-screen. Among his colleagues and himself, there was a tendency, as if by instinct, to close in on the location of the cause of the problem and, according to that location, assign blame. Yet what struck Bateson was how, with multiple viewings, these locations changed. He described the experience as a movement through stages, “a sort of progress in awareness.” He briefly enumerated each stage.[^50]

At first, their tendency was to blame “the identified patient for his idiosyncrasies and symptoms.” Bateson offered no further explanation. Clearly, this stage contained the somatic approach, the medical model. The young schizophrenic presented a problem, and that problem was located inside the body. Nothing primitive or unsophisticated is implied in responses at this stage. These children and young people needed treatment, and it was good that their parents had sought help. A therapist, focused primarily on providing this help, might operate most productively at this stage, and Jay Haley’s understandable impatience with mere theories of conditions aligns with responses of this kind. Parents didn’t need “helpful interpretations about the past and the present,” he would insist. They needed a way to decide conclusively on “what time their mad daughter is to come in at night” or when “their apathetic son” should “get out of bed tomorrow to look for a job.” The focus was on the victim, on the victim’s body and behavior.[^51]

At the second stage, Bateson continued, “one discovers that these symptoms are a response to—or an effect of—what others have done; and the blame shifts from the identified patient to the etiological figure.” Now Bateson and his colleagues began to realize that these victims were responding to triggers coming from parents and siblings that placed the victim in impossible emotional dilemmas and created psychological trauma. Bateson didn’t have to remind his audience that he was referring to work that many of them had been involved in or to observe that the shift from stage one to stage two was analogous to the broader shift from somatic to environmental explanations that allowed for etiology in the relational field.[^52]

Bateson’s point wasn’t to remind them of this shift, however. It was to describe the emotional experience he and the others had undergone watching the films, and at this second stage, he noted something interesting. Among the team members “there was always a tendency . . . to identify with that member of the family who was suffering trauma at a given moment, and to express that identification in the form of either kinesic or linguistic mimicking—caricature—of the person who unwittingly inflicted the trauma.” There was something automatic, in other words, in taking the side of the one being hurt against the one doing the hurting, and that instinctive solidarity had a body language of its own. This recalls Camus’s call for active solidarity against the powers of oppression. That the contempt felt for the victimizer was expressed by imitation suggests some degree of frustrated moral urgency.[^53]

Then came a third stage, when Bateson and his colleagues saw that “the hurt person and the person who inflicted the hurt were equally parts of a larger disordered process which neither could understand nor control.”[^54]

What was this third awareness, one might ask, but a chastened awareness, some holistic or systemic version of the tragic sensibility? Those whose depiction of reality was centered in the concept of power and who thus insisted on viewing human essence as political tended to see this third stage as a stage of moral paralysis. The politically committed might well make it a matter of discipline to stop at the second stage, to see the second as the proper stage for human action, the stage where actual resources can be marshaled and where people can direct “all our intellect and energy,” as Huxley put it, toward “bettering things.”

Because of the power differential between victimizer and victim, it is reasonable to stop at this stage. To feel solidarity with the oppressed is a worthy instinct. The ancient difficulty is that reformist programs tend to leave the power differential unchanged, and if any revolutionary program is successful, the powerless become the powerful and imitate the tyranny of their former oppressors. Thus, in Richard Niebuhr’s phrase, “the ceaseless cycle of assertion and counter-assertion” continues. Yet even the continuation of that cycle seems preferable to moral paralysis and despair.[^55]

Bateson and his group, however, watching these films and striving to interpret what they revealed, couldn’t help but move to stage three and feel despair. “At this point one reaches a more general anger,” Bateson recalled of stage three, “that what happens to people should not happen to dogs, and that what people do to each other the lower animals could never devise.” This is despair akin to that of Vonnegut’s Bokonon, who cannot bring himself to benevolent consent and thumbs his nose at God in anger.[^56]

Frieda Fromm-Reichmann was different, Bateson suggested. She was “a stage or two ahead of the rest of us.” He was speaking in memory of his colleague and friend, and the point was to praise her, but in doing so he was doing something else. He was describing a “progress in awareness” that advanced in a particular way, through extensions of empathy ever outward. In his last few sentences, he described that progress as progress “toward an image of God.” Again, this was a memorial lecture, and to tug at heartstrings and incorporate religious language was expected of the form. Bateson was a scientist and, he liked to boast, a “third generation atheist,” but he was rarely averse to mentioning God, even outside the conventions of eulogy. It was as if he believed one might speak of God rationally, in ways not wholly mystical. But then again, science itself, pressed past the limits of its necessary simplifications, verged on the mystical. “No one knows,” Bateson concluded, “the end of that progress which starts from uniting the perceiver and the perceived—the subject and the object—into a single universe.” The path to the further stages of awareness, to the further extension of empathy, and the path to the new life sciences orientation were the same path.[^57]

By early in the next decade, this path would take Bateson away from clinical concerns, away from psychiatry, and away from Palo Alto. The editing of the Perceval journals, essays such as “New Conceptual Frames,” and the octopi aquariums in his house were all signals of his disenchantment with the practical direction of the double-bind work and his efforts to keep his sights on theory. “Partly I have had my fill of the psychiatric, both doctors and patients and especially institutions,” he wrote a correspondent in explanation, “and partly I need to think about phenomena uncomplicated by human language.” This was the hope behind the octopi work, that in their behavior he could see what he was after more clearly, without all the abstractions of human language in between—and without, too, the press for application. Few would mistake the octopi research as an effort to cure octopi of something.[^58]

It would take a few years for the double-bind project to wind down completely and for Bateson to find his feet. Meanwhile the conflicts within the group came to include arguments over publication and over how to properly present the aim of their research. During this time, Bateson remarried. Lois Cammack was a young colleague from the hospital. She, her son, Eric, from a previous marriage, and Bateson’s son, John, had all helped with the octopi project—going camping on the coast to collect specimens, setting up and maintaining the aquariums, making observations. For Bateson, doing natural history was always a family affair.

In 1963 he moved his new family to a research facility in the Virgin Islands and then, just over a year later, to another in Waimanalo, Hawaii. The octopi hadn’t proved as promising a subject as he had hoped, and Bateson had turned his attention to another marine animal, this one more active, with more readily observable social behaviors. Now he would be studying dolphins.  

## Five: Signals from the Goal

A crew from _Life_ magazine came to Waimanalo in 1965 to shoot a story on the Oceanic Institute and Sea Life Park. The feature appeared in October of that year. A photo shows Bateson in headphones, looking out from a large underwater observation window as two of his subjects dive past. Dolphins were noisy creatures. They made many sounds and made them frequently and simultaneously. Determining which sound came from which dolphin was exceedingly difficult. In the photo, hanging from a cable outside the observation window, is the listening apparatus Bateson devised in an attempt to overcome this difficulty. It was roughly the size of a large deep-dish pizza and in the shape of a human ear.[^1]

As an invention, the giant ear was characteristic of Bateson: when he sought a solution, he looked first to nature’s design. The dolphins were hard to hear; better sound reception was required. So why not the asymmetrical curves and folds of the human ear, only larger? The look of sound equipment since the 1930s followed a machine-cut, modernist line that led to the stream-form designs of the space age. The microphone that Sinatra and Presley sung into in the fifties and sixties was a brushed steel, louvered lozenge. Bateson’s giant ear had more in common with a Victorian ear trumpet. The inspiration was organic rather than mechanical, biological rather than futuristic.[^2]

This was somewhat at odds with the forward-looking tone of the feature in _Life_. “The more men learn about dolphins,” it begins, “the higher their hopes that these intelligent creatures can be recruited as collaborators in undersea projects.” The words are set within a colorful, two-page photo of a dolphin in mid-leap. A few sentences are devoted to a technical explanation of how _Life_’s photographer achieved his sublime image. The single paragraph then concludes: “These pages show other efforts by man and dolphin toward a meeting of minds.”[^3]

Bateson hadn’t much liked posing for the photo. He knew that a story in _Life_ magazine could present only a distorted picture of his research. Bateson was aware, no matter what he said or how accurately _Life_ reported it, that most readers would assume studying dolphin communication meant trying to talk to dolphins. To that assumption, they would also likely add the routine association of science and utility. Both the assumption and the association were components of a mainstream fascination with dolphins, a kind of “dolphin mystique,” that would continue well into the next decade.[^4]

Certainly the utilitarian component can be found in _Life_’s handful of photos and paragraphs. “Collaborators” is surely a euphemism. If dolphins could collaborate, it would be in the way that horses or dogs collaborate in human projects. In any case, the utility the dolphins offered was decidedly mechanical. The article discusses the creatures’ efficiency as “sea-going mechanisms,” with a “built-in sonar” that “far surpasses the performance of man-made equipment.” The material in this passage involves one of Bateson’s colleagues, the marine biologist Ken Norris, who was working “at the behest of the Navy.” The implication was that dolphins might become sophisticated new weapons in the Cold War.[^5]

The objective justifying “a meeting of minds” is rather different. It speaks to another side of the dolphin mystique: the possibility of conversing with dolphins, if not some more general communion. Familiar during this period were news reports of dolphins who sought out human beings for special friendship or for aimless frolic or who rescued someone drowning at sea. Of course, there was _Flipper_, the long-running television series, an updating of _Lassie_, with a bottlenose dolphin in the leading role. Starting at mid-decade, and increasing into the psychedelic period, folk singers and rock groups recorded numerous songs about dolphins. In all these, the fascination with dolphins was not their potential as tools or weapons but as intelligent, wise, and benevolent friends.[^6]

The two sides of the dolphin mystique did not cohere, and the split between them reflects the broader split in modern thought between mind and matter, between the human individual and the environment. That fundamental incoherence made for dissatisfaction and contention and bred numerous divisions now familiar: the instrumental reason associated with science and its critique on humanistic grounds by such critics as Lewis Mumford; the separation of science and the humanities described by C. P. Snow; the modern conceptual separations of reason and emotion, fact and value, ought and is, and so on. Bateson knew this battle all too well, and if decisions he had made throughout his career had been efforts to evade it, the article in _Life_ shows that he had not done so in Hawaii. Studying dolphin communication didn’t automatically mean one wanted to communicate _with_ them. Nor was Bateson trying to enlist dolphins in some Cold War bioscience.

These distinctions were lost in _Life_’s breezy claim that Bateson was out to “to learn the exact meaning of everything dolphins say and do—to compile a dictionary of dolphinese.” They were lost, too, in the following sentence’s hasty assurance that dolphins had “already been trained to do simple chores.” Apparently, within the components of the dolphin mystique, no touch of whimsy (“dolphinese”) could be allowed to stand without a nod to utility. What was lost on _Life_ are important distinctions, nevertheless. They demonstrate the continuity in Bateson’s thought, beginning in his father’s household and passing through the Macy Conferences and his years in Palo Alto to arrive in 1965 at something truly novel: a naturalist employing the conceptual tools of the postwar cyberneticist.[^7]

### JOHN C. LILLY AND THE DOLPHIN MYSTIQUE

The person most associated with the dolphin mystique was the scientist John C. Lilly. Six years younger than Bateson, Lilly was trained as a physician and psychoanalyst. In the 1950s, before he became known for his dolphin work, his interest in the brain and consciousness led him to research in neurophysiology and to some renown for his invention of the isolation tank, a device that also proved resonant in the wider culture. By 1960 he had turned his attention to dolphins and to the possibility of communicating with them. What was most promising about dolphins, Lilly claimed, was the size of their brains. A dolphin’s brain was equivalent in size to a human being’s and thus potentially equivalent in intellectual and linguistic capabilities. Also promising was the fact that dolphins seemed to be well disposed to humankind. They were known to attack sharks but viewed human beings, apparently, as friends.[^8]

The message was a welcome one. Lilly’s writing found its way not only into scholarly journals across the disciplines but into mainstream periodicals as well. Critics in the scientific community would soon dismiss his work as naive and irresponsible, but among those who worked with dolphins, the attention Lilly brought to the field was considered, at least initially, a boon. Lilly’s _Man and Dolphin_ was the first of several books he would write on the topic. It was steeped in science and laboratory procedure but aimed at a general reader.[^9]

To such a reader, keen on Cold War futurism, the prospect Lilly raised was exciting. Might people learn to talk to dolphins? Given the enormous advances in postwar technology—television, satellites, rockets, and innumerable devices from spyware to kitchenware—the possibility of speaking to dolphins (or more precisely, of training them to speak to people) was intoxicating but conceivable.

Lilly appealed, too, to the “meeting of minds” side of the dolphin mystique. Formerly mysterious, never before held in captivity, dolphins were, from this perspective, beautiful, graceful, playful animals whose upturned grins made them appear to be continuously happy. “Have you ever seen a dolphin’s smile?” asked the Byrds in a 1967 recording—it was tranquil, sunlit, “free from all fear.” Atomic age science had put humankind in a terrible predicament. The promise of talking to the dolphins was the promise that they might have something wise to communicate about that predicament, some secret that would heal the sense of alienation from nature, that would encourage human beings to live peacefully with each other and with the world, as dolphins appeared to do.[^10]

At the very least, success in communicating with dolphins promised a change in “our own view of ourselves,” as Lilly claimed near the end of _Man and Dolphin_. Human-to-human communication would be “enhanced and improved,” as would “our own views of one another.” The assumption expressed here is that this change in perspective would help humanity transcend its rivalries and penchant for intraspecies destruction, which the twentieth century had raised to new heights. Thus both the instrumentalist objective and the “meeting of minds” were essentially optimistic. At Sea Life Park, Karen Pryor was one of the first to recognize the dolphin mystique and to appreciate the appeal of dolphins to the public and to the numerous young people who volunteered at the park as aides and trainers. Dolphins were “floating hobbits,” “like aliens from space” who had descended to earth and loved us, in spite of ourselves.[^11]

As Pryor’s commentary illustrates, the dolphin mystique intersected with a larger “outer space mystique,” constructed of the same dialogue between hope and anxiety. Space exploration was the ultimate example of human scientific achievement. Space also promised an escape from the complicated dangers and unintended side effects of technological achievement. People would talk with the dolphins, people would walk on the moon, planets would be explored and colonized. Likewise, space aliens would unite humanity, in defense against them if they proved to be enemies or in the wisdom they would impart if they proved to be friends.

The dolphin and outer space mystiques ran parallel and intertwined in Lilly’s _Man and Dolphin_, as well. “Within the next decade or two,” Lilly wrote in his introduction, “the human species will establish communication with another species: nonhuman, alien, possibly extraterrestrial, more probably marine.” In his conclusion, he argued for the urgency of the enterprise: “Even if we press this [dolphin] research program to its ultimate extreme speed, we shall not be far enough along if and when we meet beings from other portions of our galaxy.” Learning to communicate with dolphins was necessary, presumably, so that when humanity confronted the space alien, whether here or out there, it could count on a productive interaction and avoid a _War of the Worlds_ scenario.[^12]

Lilly was visionary and charismatic, in person and on the page. At least two fictional characters would be based on him. His appeal to a mainstream audience was that he was not a dour humanist but an unconflicted scientist, as C. P. Snow distinguished the two in his “two cultures” thesis. Lilly’s inquiry spoke to contemporary concerns with confidence. That his claims were boldly speculative only proved that he was one of those men of science who had, as Snow put it, “the future in their bones.” Mainstream culture could entertain both the hope and anxiety components of the dolphin and outer space mystiques if only by obscuring them in a froth of futurism. Others in the scientific community demanded more clarity and caution. Specialists from within the various disciplines Lilly touched upon began to see him as half a huckster and to dismiss his work as pseudoscience.[^13]

### THE RIDDLE OF THE SPHINX AS μ-FUNCTION

In 1961, shortly after the publication of _Man and Dolphin_, Bateson made contact with Lilly by letter. The two were not previously acquainted. Bateson was then still in Palo Alto, still working with the octopi but already thinking about cetaceans as a richer source of data. The letter was a friendly one but not fawning, and in it Bateson challenged Lilly on a number of his premises. In this way, the letter was akin to the one he had written nearly three years earlier to Charles Coulston Gillispie, the Princeton historian. Like Gillispie, Lilly was involved in a topic of interest to Bateson, and Bateson was looking for a little gentle sparring. Lilly wrote back, a friendship developed, and by the summer of 1963, Bateson was working with the Lilly organization on St. Thomas of the Virgin Islands.[^14]

That was the start of Bateson’s dolphin work, albeit something of a false one. He was given the title of associate director, along with a number of administrative duties, but as usual, the position was funded largely by a grant Bateson had himself obtained, and his research objectives were his own. When that funding dried up, in just over a year, Bateson was again at loose ends. As he busied himself with generating a new plan, Lilly came to his aid. On a visit to the Oceanic Institute in Waimanalo, Lilly persuaded Karen Pryor and her husband, Tap, to provide Bateson a home for his research.[^15]

For Bateson there was perhaps some good fortune in this timing, despite the difficulties of having to move the family again. By now Lilly’s stock had largely fallen among the most serious of marine mammologists, and he was having funding problems of his own. The Pryors’ Oceanic Institute was new, however, and in need of attention, and Lilly’s fame gave him entrée. Bateson would remain friends with Lilly and his family for the rest of his life. Lilly, too, would continue to speak of Bateson’s influence on him. And yet Bateson has to be included among Lilly’s early critics. From the beginning, he thought the “big brain” angle was irrelevant and that Lilly’s approach was off the mark. Both Bateson and Lilly saw value in dolphins as research subjects, but what they were after had little in common otherwise.[^16]

Simply put, Bateson was not interested in communicating with dolphins. Nor did he entertain the possibility as a serious goal. “The point is not either to discover that dolphins have complex language or to teach them English,” Bateson made clear during his year with Lilly, “but to close gaps in our theoretical knowledge of _communication_.”[^17]

In other words, this was another stage in Bateson’s ongoing inquiry. He had been building a body of theory concerning communication for at least fifteen years, and in important ways, from the very beginning. There was the work with the Iatmul as a young anthropologist, coming at the matter of human behavior with the naturalist’s morphological perspective. Then there was his work toward understanding learning as the development of habits of perception and how those habits became expectations about the structure of one’s world. There was the testing of those expectations by the asking and answering of what Bateson came to call riddle of the Sphinx questions. Out of this came the double bind.

All mammals, Bateson had come to believe, asked riddle of the Sphinx questions of each other continually and, to a large degree, unconsciously. Answers contained the information most important to them: information about relationship. Who am I to you? Who are you to me? Bateson was not shy about coining terms, and in one of his first essays about his dolphin work, he called the part of any message received by a mammal that communicated data about relationship the “μ-function” of that message.[^18]

Most μ-function was communicated between human beings via body language (kinesics). People gestured; they struck postures and positioned themselves. Eyes were especially adept at not only perceiving but also conveying μ-function. Most μ-function was also analogic. Closeness was communicated by physical closeness, disinterest by a vacant expression, and so on. In terms of μ-function, human beings still had much in common with the lower mammals. But unlike the lower mammals, human beings had added a _digital_ mode of communicating—words. Words were arbitrary symbols. They had neither the physical nor the quantitative correspondence of analogic language. It was irrelevant, for instance, that the word “little” was twice the size of the word “big.”[^19]

Productive thinking for Bateson along these lines had begun more than a decade earlier, prior even to the double-bind project. In early 1952, he had brought concepts of communication theory to the observation of monkeys at the Fleishmann Zoo in San Francisco and of otters in the wild. The otters and monkeys communicated analogically, transmitting meanings through “mood signs,” not “word signs,” which is to say, they signaled anger by being angry rather than by using anger-representing words. It was a matter of evolution: the lower mammals hadn’t added the digital to the analogic; they hadn’t yet learned that “signals were signals”—something _other than_ what they denoted.[^20]

Whether analogic or digital, all communication suffered corrosion and confusion. The formal term for this among information theorists was “noise.” But analogic language had special limitations. It could communicate presences but not absences, positives but not negatives. In analogic language, there was no such thing as “not.” This inability to generate a “not” became especially suggestive to Bateson when he watched the monkeys and otters at play. Young monkeys were always play-fighting. How did a monkey convey to another monkey that a bite was a play bite and not a real bite? How did one monkey convey to another that the fight they were involved in was not real? They pulled punches, so to speak; they bit softly, in pretend. This could be stated as a Russellian paradox, in which a statement contradicted the metastatement that framed its meaning: “These actions in which we now engage [statement] do not denote what those actions _for which they stand_ [metastatement] would denote were we really fighting.”[^21]

In fact, Bateson asserted, this was the very meaning of play. This was its μ-function, to use the later term. Who are we to each other?, the monkeys and otters were asking. We aren’t enemies; we’re playmates. Because if we were enemies, the actions we are engaged in now would denote the aggression _for which they stand_. Play was information about the disparity or contradiction between statements and the metastatements that framed them. Play was information about the kind of disparity that schizophrenics and their families had become habitually unable to convey. Play between animals was in this way a form of irony, which, as human beings know, can be not only a way to sort out difficult and uncomfortable information but also a source of amusement and joy.

If analogic communication was subject to noise between the message and the metamessage, digital communication was perhaps worse. Human beings were well aware of the noncorrespondence between symbol and physical quantity in digital language, and they expected certain sorts of confusions. It was relatively easy not to confuse a real elephant with a remark about elephants, but it was much more difficult not to confuse a command such as “Shut the door” with a metacommand, such as “Follow my orders.” Yet formally (consisting of an imperative verb and an object), the two messages were exactly the same. All this, in addition to the arbitrary character of digital language, made it easily used for deception and thus to generate contradictions and binds. A parent’s hostile body language, paired with words expressing affection, was the basis of a typical double-binding message.[^22]

Human beings, the talking animals, communicated μ-function through analogic positioning, posture, and gesture and meanwhile used words to talk about things, typically things they could point at and hold in their hands. This was where dolphins were so different. Dolphins didn’t have hands. They couldn’t hold or manipulate things. Thus, it didn’t seem efficient to Bateson that dolphins would have evolved a digital language in which sounds referred symbolically to things. Without a background in information and communication theory, Lilly hadn’t taken this key fact into consideration. Moreover, the faces of dolphins were smooth and streamlined for swift movement through water. This reduced their ability to produce facial gestures. Finally, being underwater made subtle kinesic expression difficult to detect visually. Water itself was full of noise.[^23]

Yet at the same time, dolphins were mammals. If it were true that, as mammals, their communication primarily signaled μ-function, how did they do it? Bateson’s assumption was that they used their voices, that they did this with sound, but because sounds containing μ-functions would almost certainly be analogic rather than digital, he assumed that “dolphinese” was nothing like human language and was perhaps more akin to music. Who am I to you? Who are you to me? Perhaps dolphins sang their answers to each other.[^24]

“Cherish your exceptions,” Bateson’s father had taught him. What promised to make dolphins excellent subjects of study was not how they might be the same as human beings but how they differed. Bateson was neither studying dolphins to domesticate them for instrumental purposes nor striving for a “meeting of minds.” Rather, he hoped that the exceptional aspects of their way of communicating (relative to that of humans) was so great that it would provide insight into the communication of mammals in general. This, in turn, would help close gaps in a general theory of communication, of which both deutero-learning and the double bind were corollaries.[^25]

As the writers of the article in _Life_ presented it, there was no distinction between the inquiries of a Lilly and a Bateson. It’s not likely that Bateson expected _Life_ to get it right. But it did tell him something about how he was perceived by the wider world: at worst a whimsical Dr. Doolittle, at best one of those fuzzy-brained men of science who shouldn’t be taken too seriously—not the kind of scientist like Ken Norris, in other words, the marine biologist with the navy contract. One wonders if the depiction might not have added to his frustration with the slow-going nature of the dolphin work. One wonders if the article might not have seemed another instance, like that of his wartime experience, of the “combustion of his image” helping to fuel an agenda to which he was opposed. Or perhaps it was merely one more isolating instance of people, like his colleagues there in Waimanalo, not understanding “a thing he said.”

### HISTORIANS OF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE

One welcome distraction during this period came in the form of letters of inquiry from William Coleman, a historian at Johns Hopkins University. Coleman was researching late nineteenth-century British science and had an interest in Bateson’s father. Looking into W. B.’s work both before and after the rediscovery of Mendel and the establishment of genetics, Coleman had found something interesting. Prior to Mendel, W. B. had been pigeonholed as among the vitalists and the Lamarckians. After Mendel, he won a place with the Darwinists. Thenceforth, whenever anyone attacked the concept of the gene, W. B. was the first to defend it. Late in his career, however, W. B. argued _against_ the concept of the chromosome. To the Darwinian atomists, W. B.’s resistance to the chromosome seemed a return to the heresies of Lamarck and the vitalists, and so again his work fell out of favor. The historian Coleman was intrigued: W. B. had changed camps, twice. Over a period of several years, Coleman wrote Gregory repeatedly with questions.[^26]

Bateson welcomed the opportunity to address the topic. His letters to Coleman, especially the later ones, were generous, lengthy, and full of prose as rich as any found in his published essays. Coleman asked about W. B.’s relationship with the mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead at Cambridge while the Batesons lived in the nearby village of Grantchester. This was during the time W. B.’s star had risen, before he accepted the directorship of the Innes Horticultural Institution and moved the family to Merton Park. Bateson wrote: “I was only six when he left Grantchester and I cannot remember ever seeing W. B. and Whitehead together. Living at Merton, we had a sort of family myth which lent a crystal halo to Cambridge and especially Grantchester. I grew up feeling in a gentle way that we had been turned out of, or perhaps deserted, the Garden of Eden. Above all, the Whiteheads were retrospectively the most conspicuous tenants with whom the garden had been shared.”[^27]

Coleman asked questions about W. B.’s influences. Was it true he was enamored of Samuel Butler, Darwin’s most vocal secular critic? This was a decisive question. Butler had attacked both the church and the Darwinists, the former for its dogmatism, the latter for its strictly mechanistic account of evolution. Like W. B. himself, before Mendel redeemed him, Butler was dismissed by the Darwinists as an unreconstructed Lamarckian, irrationally clinging to end-directed causality (teleology) and the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Butler exemplified for W. B. the integrity of an individual thinker: isolated, self-contained, an atheist but not a reductionist. Coleman wanted to know if W. B. had been personally acquainted with Butler or with Butler’s biographer Henry Festing Jones. Coleman asked also about W. B.’s views on politics, religion, and art. He was especially curious about W. B.’s interest in William Blake.

These questions, Bateson well knew, were key to understanding his father, and he clearly took pleasure in answering them. He explained that Butler’s works held a special place in the Bateson household. The utopian satires _Erewhon_ (1872) and _Erewhon Revisited_ (1901) had been Bateson family favorites. W. B. had met Butler; Jones was a regular visitor and confidant. Moreover, W. B. loved and collected the drawings of Blake. In art and music, Gregory described his father as a classicist, “for Mozart and against Beethoven,” with a Victorian disdain for modern movements. Once at a museum, W. B. had taken umbrage over a collection of van Gogh paintings, dismissing the artist loudly as syphilitic. One senses in Bateson’s piquant responses the distillation of many years of dinner party stories. These were the stories in which, for him, his father remained alive.[^28]

Coleman, for his part, kept his cards close to his chest, but he was evidently endeavoring to uncover some connection between W. B.’s approach to science and a particular temperament or political belief, a connection many scientists found it wise to hide. Bateson picked up on this, found it neither threatening nor untoward, and yet turned Coleman’s gambit back around on him: “I suppose whatever scientific figure one looks at, one would find that the history of science is only superficially guided by scientific research and disciplined thinking. Behind this superficial façade there is always a heaving mass of inchoate mysticism which the scientific figures themselves never put into words.” Bateson recalled how Isaac Newton, while a student at Trinity College, kept “alchemistic manuscripts, deistic tracts and other occult materials” locked up in a “big wooden box” in his rooms. “Do historians have no such boxes?” Bateson asked.[^29]

The correspondence continued. Clearly, there was a story here, and Bateson recognized that Coleman was onto it. W. B. had had a great triumph and then came to repudiate it. Bateson admitted to Coleman that with Mendel, W. B. was “preaching a gospel which really did not fit his inner philosophies.” By the twenties, after the war, W. B. confessed to his son that Mendel had been a “blind alley.” Later, in the fight against chromosomes, he again attacked “the windmills of Darwinism.” W. B.’s professional decisions, tragic events in his personal life, and the direction society was heading in general had brought him to a state of despair. He died in 1926 at the age of sixty-four.[^30]

As Coleman honed in on his thesis, Bateson began to sense that the scholar’s view of his father was less than sympathetic and that the article would likely be another salvo in the ongoing battle between the vitalists and Darwinists, the Heraclitans and the Democritans, the holists and the atomists, and that behind Coleman’s coyness was partisanship in that battle. Coleman shared a few draft paragraphs in which he discussed what he viewed as W. B.’s “romanticism.” This word, especially, was a clue to Coleman’s position on science with a humanistic taint. Bateson declined to treat the word in its partisan connotation outright and yet called Coleman to acknowledge the stance he was taking: “I think that all [your] points . . . about his romanticism are correct . . . and can only hear with amazement your statement that this attitude is uncongenial to you.”[^31]

In this sentence is an echo of the correspondence Bateson had initiated some years back with Charles Coulston Gillispie of Princeton. That exchange of letters, too, had concerned the modern battle between the romantics and the Darwinists, a battle Bateson had confessed to being “tired of.” It was largely through his father’s experience that Bateson had “lived in the middle of that particular battle,” as he had put it to Gillispie. Bateson had come to see W. B. as ahead of his time, not for proving one side right and the other wrong but in striving for new ways to reframe the conflict.[^32]

The main obstacle to that striving was a matter of history. In this Gregory had had an advantage over W. B. That advantage was of course the Macy Conferences on Cybernetics, those ten interdisciplinary gatherings led by Norbert Wiener and John von Neumann that had changed Bateson’s life. The Macy Conferences provided the thinking and language to reframe the debate that W. B. had lacked. What came out of the Macy Conferences, as Bateson would repeatedly claim, was “the biggest bite out of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge that man has taken in the last 2000 years.” That bite, in Bateson’s view, was in the process of changing the world. If these historians from two of the most prestigious universities in the United States were any indication, the world didn’t know it yet. Rather, the world was barely listening, still fixated on the politics of the old debate.[^33]

### THE MACY CONFERENCES ON CYBERNETICS AND THE NATURALIZATION OF PURPOSE

The best way to understand how and why the Macy Conferences were so influential on Bateson’s thought is to go back to the idea that gave them birth. That is, to go back even earlier than the first official Macy Conference when Wiener and von Neumann had discussed computers and paradox, and von Neumann had offered his primer on game theory, to the late spring after the attack on Pearl Harbor. At another conference, in the same hotel where the Macy Conferences would be held, Bateson and Margaret Mead were initiated into a way of thinking that put one of modern science’s most stubborn points of contention in a new light.

The subject of the conference was “cerebral inhibition,” a term most social scientists understood to refer to hypnotism. For Bateson and Mead, this was not an illegitimate topic. At the Symposium on Science, Philosophy and Religion, where they had delivered papers the previous summer, they had described the application of social science by the Fascists as a kind of mass hypnotism. At this later conference, however, the talk that most moved them came from a more literal take on the topic: brain disease. The presentation concerned the recent collaboration between three men: Norbert Wiener, then at MIT, working on antiaircraft technology; Julian Bigelow, an electrical engineer and Wiener’s partner in the MIT project; and the presenter, Arturo Rosenblueth, a physician and physiologist working on illnesses associated with the brain. The doctor and the engineer-mathematicians had noticed an odd parallel in their research. It was a small connection, insignificant compared to the larger argument it implied, but it would spark the creation of cybernetics, a whole new field of thought.[^34]

The summary Rosenblueth offered at the conference that day would be detailed by his colleagues and himself in a paper published the following year called “Behavior, Purpose and Teleology.” The central image in this paper was that of a person reaching for a glass of water. If that person was suffering from a disease of the cerebellum, the authors explained, her arm moved toward the glass in wide back-and-forth oscillations, in big sweeping circles. The implication was that when a person with a healthy cerebellum reached for a glass, her arm also oscillated, but the side-to-side movements were so narrow, the circles so small, that they were undetectable. The hand appeared to move in a straight line, but this was only an appearance. To grasp this is to grasp the notion of “feedback”—information that travels around a circuit—and thus the difference between a Newtonian linear explanation of causality and a “cybernetic” circuit-based explanation.[^35]

Here, too, was the connection to the antiaircraft work. Shooting a missile at an airplane was analogous to reaching for a glass. The glass was stationary, unlike the airplane, and unlike the thirsty person, the shooter made use not only of an arm but also of a piece of artillery. In formal terms, however, the basics were the same. The authors knew this because failures in their antiaircraft mechanism looked a lot like the failures of a sick cerebellum: big, sweeping oscillations. In fact, Wiener and Bigelow’s unsuccessful proto-antimissile devices worked far worse than sick cerebellums did. They oscillated violently and sent projectiles wildly about the room. In “Behavior, Purpose and Teleology,” however, Rosenblueth, Wiener, and Bigelow were not aiming to teach people how to build better weapons or treat diseased brains. They wanted to define, through a careful process of classification, an area of study: “the behavioristic study of natural events.”[^36]

The _functional_ study of natural events was well established. An entity was analyzed by breaking it down into parts and providing an interpretation of how each part functioned. The behavioristic approach Rosenblueth, Wiener, and Bigelow proposed did not break the entity down into parts but investigated it as a whole, with the variable being any change in that entity, as the authors put it, “with respect to its surroundings.” An entity changed with respect to its surroundings depending on “output” or “input.” The authors took care to define these terms precisely. Output was change the entity produced. Input was change produced by events external to the entity. Thus “behavior” was classified as any change in an entity with respect to its surroundings, either produced by the entity as output, or received as input externally.[^37]

The authors further classified behavior by considering the source of energy behind the behavior. “Passive behavior” was very much dependent on input alone. If the entity was a ball and that ball was thrown, its behavior was passive. Certain living things or mechanisms, however, provided the energy behind their own “active behavior.” Of active behavior, there were two kinds, “random” and “purposeful.” Random behavior had no goal. Purposeful or “teleological” behavior had a goal—the reaching of the glass, the striking of the plane with a missile—and almost always involved some sort of “feedback.”[^38]

Feedback was information; it was input from the goal. This information answered questions such as, “Is my arm moving in the right direction?” “Positive feedback” answered yes and called for no correction. It led to continuity in the course of behavior. “Negative feedback” answered no and prompted a change in the course of behavior. Negative feedback was vital to purposeful behavior because some directing signals were necessary if a goal was to be achieved. This was especially true when purposeful behaviors were very complex or, for instance, when a goal was not stationary. Behaviors such as these, the authors reasoned, were governed by continuous negative feedback.[^39]

Think again of the thirsty person. She wants a drink and reaches for the glass. Her behavior, from its beginning to its end, is governed by information, by feedback, telling her how well she is succeeding. Information comes in the form of sensory data, mostly concerning the moment-by-moment spatial relationship between hand and glass. Her behavior is largely automatic, which is to say, the information exchange calls on habitual operations and takes place within her unconscious. If her hand moves off course, too far to the right, that information is processed as negative feedback and a correction is made. Her hand moves to the left. If the correction overcompensates, and her hand veers off course too far to the left, a rightward adjustment is made, and so on, over and over, until her behavior terminates and her goal is fulfilled.[^40]

Normal brain-arm coordination operates so efficiently that the corrections are tiny almost to the point of nonexistence. But the circles are still there, if only in the sensory data continually running the circuit, as the relation between hand and glass continually varies. But if the operation is not working smoothly, if the negative feedback is restrained or dampened, by illness or otherwise poorly working sense receptors, overcompensation becomes common, and the oscillations become more and more apparent. Cherish your exceptions, W. B. might have said. Wiener and Bigelow learned with their early antiaircraft failures that an overshoot in one direction could lead to a worse overshoot in the other direction and on to “increasingly larger oscillations.” This was evidence of pathology, of errors of communication within the system, of noise blocking or distorting signals from the goal.[^41]

Rosenblueth, Wiener, and Bigelow treaded cautiously with this notion of goal. Modern physics and chemistry had rejected the concept of teleology. In Newtonian physics, cause worked in a linear fashion, along an axis of time. One billiard ball hit another, and so on. Any consideration of purpose was therefore thought to be a reading backwards against the axis of time, arguing for a final cause. As the hard sciences rejected purpose, stressing the billiard ball universe of linear causality, they imagined a causal world of force and impact rather than of intention. The humanist impulse, and later tendencies in the soft sciences, had clung to purpose in the form of individual agency in opposition to the material determinism of the billiard ball world. The hard sciences, in turn, associated this clinging with sentimentality.[^42]

As is evident in Charles Gillispie’s article, a disagreement over purpose and agency was also at the center of the debate between the holistic Lamarckians and the atomistic Darwinists. The Lamarckians wanted the individual to have some say over the long-term adaptive success of its offspring. The Mendelian Darwinists said no; the individual had no say. The gene determined success, as nature randomly selected it. The hard Darwinists accused the soft Lamarckians of demanding from nature, as Gillispie put it, more than nature could give. Hardness and softness thus related to sentiment. The soft were cowardly and clung to sentiment; the hard bravely gave it up. Softness was the sentimental longing for _ought_ and hardness the refusal to permit this longing to distract from the illumination of _is_.[^43]

Understandably, as practitioners of the hard sciences, Rosenblueth, Wiener, and Bigelow didn’t wish to open themselves up to suspicion of softness and sentimentality. Understandably, they tried to contain “teleology” to a strict classification: “behavior controlled by negative feedback.” Teleology, as they defined it, was still subject to material determinism. Entities were determined materially by the quality of their receptors to receive and respond to negative feedback. As the authors defined it, teleology didn’t occur apart from linear causality’s axis of time, nor did it deny the transfer of energy in the impact of one billiard ball upon another.[^44]

Yet if the focus was the behavior of an entity “with respect to its surroundings,” the authors’ argument was that teleology was not only a valid but also a necessary concept. Behavior meant the presence of information exchange and therefore a goal-oriented, circuit-based approach to causality. Could behavior be coded mathematically? It could. It had. The math involved in servomechanisms, such as Wiener and Bigelow’s antiaircraft device, was far more sophisticated than any math used in linear calculations. Because purposeful behavior, as a class of phenomena carefully defined, was not beyond mathematic description, it was legitimate content for a hard, exact science. Rosenblueth, Wiener, and Bigelow had, in other words, naturalized purpose. They had made it a part of nature again and not merely a part of mind.[^45]

### A BROKEN TOOTH

Servomechanisms—mechanisms with purposeful or self-governing attributes— were nothing new. The steam engine with a governor, invented in the late eighteenth century by James Watt and which James Clerk Maxwell had discussed in 1867, was the classic example. Another later, oft-used example was the home thermostat. All such mechanisms had built-in circuits that allowed them to conserve some constant through the continuous adjustment of other variables. If a thermostat was set, for example, at 78° in the summer, the “78° or below” was the constant. The moment the house heated up and this constant was threatened with 79°, the mechanism switched the variable from “no” (no, the air conditioning is not on) to “yes” (yes, the air conditioning is on). Under the governance of the thermostat, the house oscillated between yes and no, protecting the constant of “78° or below” from the threat of change.[^46]

What was new in the Rosenblueth-Wiener-Bigelow paper was the emphasis on information and meaning: the yes and the no, and the “constant” at which the system was calibrated. In the case of the thermostat, “78° or below” was the system’s persisting purpose or truth. What was attractive to the social scientists was the analogical fecundity of the circuit model. Negative feedback sensitized the organism/mechanism to the degree that it had strayed from its purpose. Negative feedback was news of failure, of falling short. These were analogues with moral implications.

In the room at the Beekman Hotel in May 1942, Bateson and Mead listened to Dr. Rosenblueth’s summary presentation of these ideas with great interest. Both were well aware of the disrepute held for the terms “purpose” and “teleology,” of the way these terms stigmatized their users as soft and sentimental, and of the inferior status of the social sciences, in no small part on account of these terms. At the science, philosophy, and religion symposium the previous summer, Mead had bravely marched onto the teleology minefield in her talk of mental blueprints and physical applications. She had spoken of somehow collapsing means and ends into a single “direction.” Similarly, in his talk of circular causality, Rosenblueth brought ends and means into a continuous process. But unlike Mead, Rosenblueth and his collaborators were hard scientists, in effect offering the soft social scientists the rigor of mathematics and the promise of backbone. One of Mead’s most fervent hopes for interdisciplinary exchange was hope for a set of rigorous new terms with which the physicists and the chemists might communicate with the psychologists and the anthropologists (and perhaps even the humanists) in order to share knowledge and advance. Of course, the advance she envisioned was not a technological one but an advance in the good and in the health of the greater social body. She had listened to Rosenblueth so intently and with such fascination that it was not until afterward that she realized she’d broken a tooth.[^47]

Yet the influence of these ideas on Bateson proved, in time, even greater. Raised himself in the hard(er) science of natural history, Bateson had long held beliefs about the weakness of the social sciences. It wasn’t that they were incapable of producing empirical data, or that this data was some sort of epiphenomena, unworthy of rigorous analysis. The problem was that the analysis was too often stillborn because it lacked grounding in usable theory. Marxism and Freudianism, like Darwinism, borrowed too heavily on concretized abstractions from an obsolete physics. Terms such as “drive” or “instinct” were versions of Newtonian “force”: explanatory principles meant to stand for what was never actually explained. Building new theory required the step-by-step definition of terms and principles, stated with a commonsense clarity that defied misunderstanding and refutation. This was precisely what Rosenblueth, Wiener, and Bigelow were up to in their teleology paper. Although two of them were engineers, they weren’t trying to invent anything. Although the third was a doctor, he wasn’t trying to cure anybody. The three were doing something more abstract—and to the thinking of someone like Gregory Bateson, more ambitious and more necessary. They were, in short, laying down theory and doing so with rigor and care.[^48]

The terms the authors provided were at a level of generality that Bateson found immediately suggestive. The circuit model was a more complex and sophisticated way of envisioning causality than was the linear transfer of energy from one billiard ball to another. In the way they laid it out, the Newtonian explanation covered only what the authors had called passive behavior. The circuit model provided for active behavior, change in behavior triggered by circulating information and drawing on sources of energy from within the organism itself. “If I kick a stone,” Bateson would write in an often used illustration, “the movement of the stone is energized by the act [passive behavior], but if I kick a dog . . . he may turn and bite [active behavior].” This difference showed how the circuit model opened up for investigation much of the phenomena of the living world: goals, intentions, feelings-about, and so on. It opened up to a hard science such as biology the nonmaterial contents of mind.[^49]

Bateson also noted close correspondences with his own work. There was the focus on behavior as form. Positive feedback sounded a lot like schismogenesis: progressive change in a single direction, the familiar pattern of self-maximization he saw in the Iatmul and in the arms-racing West. Negative feedback resembled the careful internal balance of variables in the pattern of the Balinese: tightrope walkers continually making adjustments to present an artful performance. Information running around a circuit yet not divorced from the axis of time related closely to his learning theory: contexts of experience in chronological sequence.

Not least of all, the information/circuit concept gave Bateson an answer to the Iatmul question that he had had to leave hanging in his book _Naven._ What kept the Iatmul from splitting apart? A circuit-based causality revealed communicational pathways of self-corrective feedback that a linear Newtonian explanation obscured. The naven ritual was corrective data to a community facing threat to its meaning, its truth. The cross-dressing naven ritual was play in some sense like the play of monkeys and otters, providing information about the disparity, discord, and contradiction between message and metamessage, between real-time actions and goals: _Our actions do not denote what they would denote were we really the aggressive boasters and cringing toadies we are now pretending to be_. Data about disparity, discord, and contradiction was another class of data: data about communication. It was metacommunicative data.

The concept under investigation here was by no means remote or mysterious. In everyday living, people constantly dealt not only with messages and their contexts but also with messages somehow at odds with their contexts. People typically handled such confusions with another class of messages: metacommunicative messages that were _about the confusion_. “Are you kidding?” was a commonplace example of this kind of message. Disparity between messages and contexts, however, could also pertain to major premises—paradoxes generated by disparate or contradictory answers to, for example, the riddle of the Sphinx. Ways of dealing with profound contradictions were more complicated and included those complex cultural structures of play, humor, ritual, religion, and art.

Whether commonplace or profound, metacommunicative messages about the disparity at the center of paradox were meant to have some corrective bearing on the potential pathology generated by confusion. This class of messages, metacommunicative messages, could be reckoned as negative feedback. Negative feedback, it must be remembered, was not a bad thing. It was a necessary factor in guiding purposeful behavior, whether reaching for a glass of water, trying to knock down a missile in the sky, determining the status of relationship, or managing the moral quandaries involved in means and ends.

### LILLY AND THE DOLPHIN MYSTIQUE REVISITED

Fundamental to the double-bind concept was the insight that in a double-bind situation, the communicative behavior of families with schizophrenic members was characterized by the banning of precisely this type of metacommunicative message. The double bind was not simply that disparities and contradictions in μ-function arose commonly but that they could not be spoken of. Schizophrenics were those who had developed habits of dealing with the pain of informational contradiction _without access_ to more typical methods because the making of metaconnections was forbidden. “An alcoholic parent,” as Bateson explained, “may punish a child for showing that he knows that he should look out for storms whenever the parent gets the bottle out of the cupboard.” Schizophrenics had trained themselves _not_ to make the metaconnection, or not to show they had made the connection. They were unable to discriminate between _any_ message and its context and so became unable to know “what sort of message a message is.” As a result, they were forced to resort to other ways of processing unacknowledgeable disparity: by speaking in coded “word salads”; by developing complex and self-torturing inner worlds; by withdrawing into catatonia. In institutional settings, these adaptations were labeled symptoms and were the signs of the pathology within the family system. Lacking the ability to process disparities of message, this family became stuck in pathological oscillation.[^50]

Disparities were present with the dolphin mystique as well. Who were the dolphins to us? Who were we to them? Would they become our instruments in underwater projects, or would we achieve with them a “meeting of minds”? Whatever visionary claims John Lilly made in his early work toward establishing some foundation toward a future “bilateral kindness” between dolphins and human beings, his efforts toward that end in 1961 involved conventional laboratory work, with the dolphins as subjects in stimulus-response experiments.

Much of the material in _Man and Dolphin_ narrates this experimental work and depicts dolphins strapped to laboratory tables with wires connected to their brains. The electrodes allowed “either intense rewarding or intense punishing experiences,” a technique of delivering stimuli more expedient to Lilly’s purposes than rewarding the creatures with snacks of fish. In order to connect the electrodes, a sleeve guide—a thin tube—had to be hammered into the dolphin’s skull. At first Lilly used a small hammer but then changed to a carpenter’s hammer to “speed up the rate” of penetration. “The process was not too distressful to the animal,” Lilly claimed. The dolphin “jumped every time the hammer hit the mandrel of the sleeve guide, because this made a very loud noise inside his head. We could find no evidence that there was much, if any, pain associated with this procedure. However, for a sensitive animal this could be psychologically traumatic without being painful.” Lilly defended this claim on the basis that he had tried “this kind of hammering” on his own skull. He found the pain “not great” but the noise “extremely loud and rather startling.” Lilly registered here and elsewhere concern for the comfort of the animals, though he clearly gave less weight to psychological than to physical pain. It helped that the dolphins were alive, Lilly noted. Unlike the skulls of dead animals, which were brittle and splintered easily, those of living animals were like “green wood.” The sleeve went in cleanly and smoothly.[^51]

Experimentation on living animals in scientific research had long been a matter of ethical controversy. H. G. Wells used the anti-vivisectionist movement in turn-of-the-century Britain as a springboard for a philosophical exploration of Darwinism in his 1896 science fiction novel, _The Island of Dr. Moreau._ Fleeing from a country whose population has risen up against his methods, the scientist Moreau exiles himself to an island where he is free to conduct his experiments without the interference of what he regards as misplaced sentimentality. Using a variety of animal species as subjects, Moreau develops a procedure that combines reconstructive surgery and the grafting of human tissue. What he creates are hybrid creatures, often hideous, some capable of human speech.

Moreau is in many ways the same sort of “mad scientist” Mary Shelley created in her character Victor Frankenstein: a driven man who increasingly isolates himself in his work. Any moral qualms he entertains pale beside the heroic task of scientific advance. Note, however, the differences between Dr. Frankenstein, a product of early nineteenth-century romanticism, and fin de siècle Moreau. Frankenstein comes from an especially close and loving family. His work is motivated by grief over his mother’s death; his period of isolation and madness is short. Pity for his creature and moral revulsion over his actions are immediate once his work is complete. Moreau, in contrast, is thoroughly and consistently isolated and amoral. He has no clear instrumentalist goal, no “intelligible object” beyond “mad, aimless investigations.” When the narrator Prendick challenges Moreau on moral grounds about the terrible pain the animals undergo during his procedures, Moreau weighs that pain against “the strange colorless delight” of “intellectual desires” and finds it trifling in comparison: “A mind truly opened to what science has to teach must see that [pain] is a little thing.”[^52]

In _Man and Dolphin_, Lilly is not nearly so cold. He readily admits that he feels remorse over the way his work put the animals at risk. A number of his dolphins died in the course of his work with them, and Lilly claims that he and his associates were greatly saddened by these deaths. They had come to love and admire the dolphins they worked with. Here the disparities of the dolphin mystique confront each other. Are the dolphins to be treated as matériel, or are they to be treated as equals? “Despite disappointment and sadness,” Lilly writes about the dolphin deaths, “we had to go on with our research: our responsibilities lie with finding the truth.”[^53]

Lilly echoes Moreau in weighing sentiment against a greater goal, and in this way, any extended discussion about the disparities of premise behind his work are neatly evaded. Or to put it in terms of the double bind: messages about that disparity are not allowed. There would be no meeting of minds on this matter. “Finding the truth” is a higher justification, and next to that, the moral question is not germane.

Wells’s narrator Prendick is disturbed by Moreau’s rationale. The “cry of the panther” under vivisection is unbearable to him. But how can Prendick, a student of Huxley and a convinced Darwinist, place this sentiment against Moreau’s devotion to “what science has to teach”? At the same time, the de-evolution he witnesses among Moreau’s creatures seems to mock a clear separation between a human/ethical and an animal/natural realm. In the end, nevertheless, despondent and verging on nihilism, Prendick sides uneasily with Huxley and division. If humankind is to hope to retain value, it could look only to “whatever is _more_ than animal within us,” to ethical, not cosmic process.[^54]

The controversies Wells engaged in at the turn of the century were, by the middle 1960s, hardly quaint. Jacques Monod, the Nobel Prize winner for biology in 1965, formulated an echo of Huxley by the end of the decade, which he called the “postulate of objectivity.” According to this postulate, there was “no intention in the universe” and therefore “no harmony between man and the universe.” Sentiment and teleology had no place in science. The discoveries of the life sciences could lead only to the resignation that the human moral system was “the kingdom above” and nature “the darkness below.” What pertained to one side of the line was not germane to what pertained to the other side, and thus any metadiscussion about the disparity or contradiction between them was unadvised, and often disallowed.[^55]

The year _Man and Dolphin_ was published, 1961, was also the year of the first widely reported alien abduction. Betty and Barney Hill of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, claimed to have been taken by aliens into a spaceship and subjected to a number of experiments. The details of the abduction were those of what would become, with subsequent abduction claims, a standard story. The Hills found themselves in a laboratory setting. Devices were wired to their body parts; they were prodded and probed. They experienced both physical pain and psychological terror. To stipulate, for the sake of argument, that the Hills described an actual event (and neither made it up nor indulged in some shared paranoiac fantasy or schizophrenic hallucination), one wonders what the goals of the aliens might have been. Were their efforts aimed toward the achievement of some bilateral kindness? Were the Hills being trained to speak? One might imagine the aliens feeling sympathy for the Hills as they squirmed and screamed, and then bracketing—evading, disallowing, banning—this sentiment on the grounds that it wasn’t germane to their greater purpose of “finding the truth.” From this perspective, the standard abduction story, not unlike Wells’s novel, is itself metadata about disparity and contradiction at the level of premise, perhaps germane to a humanities or a social science context, but to the hard sciences dedicated to the investigation of reality, banned.[^56]

### THE JUSTIFICATIONS OF SCIENCE

The giant ear was not working. When the audio device pictured in _Life_ was lowered into the water of the oceanarium, it did indeed amplify the dolphins’ chatter, as Bateson had hoped. But it wasn’t supplying the crucial data. Which dolphin was making what trill or chortle, and to which other dolphin or dolphins was that trill or chortle intended? That information remained inaccessible. Meanwhile, Bateson did what he could and had garnered novel insights. He was charting how the status within the dolphin group related to their respective sleeping positions: the alpha creatures slept higher, nearer the surface, closer to air. But until he could answer the important questions about their communicative interaction—the principal object of his study—it was unclear how real progress could be made.[^57]

Bateson began to wonder how much time he would need to find a way into the data. The better part of a decade? For a man in his early sixties, this was no insignificant amount of time. His own father had died at sixty-four. Writing to Lilly during the period, Bateson confessed that he enjoyed the research less than the “occasional theoretical essays” he wrote from time to time. Might better sparring partners have helped? During those final years in Palo Alto, he had longed for, as Lois would put it, “a quiet corner to think.” Waimanalo was certainly that. Yet in terms of the sort of “top minds” he had told Robert Oppenheimer he needed, it was also rather isolated.[^58]

During that first full year in Hawaii, Bateson revived a correspondence with Nora Barlow, his oldest friend. Barlow had known Bateson literally since his birth, when she was nineteen and a student and research assistant of W. B.’s. She was also the granddaughter of Charles Darwin and a member, along with the Batesons, of what one historian has called Britain’s “aristocracy of intellect,” the Cambridge-centered branch. After Nora married Alan Barlow, son to the queen’s physician, she became Lady Barlow and now occupied the country house at Boswells, her husband’s family estate. With privileged access to her grandfather’s diaries and journals, she had published three important books of Darwin scholarship, the first in 1934. Now entering her ninth decade, she was working on a fourth. In their letters to each other, Gregory shared his frustrations with the dolphin work and told her about Lois and the boys; she sent him items she had read on points of theory. Nora’s grandfather and Gregory’s father had supplied the major pieces to what had come to be called “the modern synthesis.” For Bateson and Barlow, family news and matters of evolutionary biology were, in an important sense, one and the same.[^59]

One letter from Nora contained a passage she had come across from the writings of the seventeenth-century philosopher and naturalist Sir Thomas Browne. One sentence in particular appeared to presage something of modern genetics: “Parts of the seed do seem to contain the Idea and power of the whole.” Browne was writing in 1658, before the materialism of later centuries had abandoned the classical notions of _telos_ and _nous_, the divine mind. W. B., Nora knew, would have appreciated the insight. Bateson responded, reinterpreting the sentence via cybernetics. He didn’t like Browne’s use of the word “power,” but communication theorists would certainly smile on Browne’s view of “ideas as causative agencies.”[^60]

In early 1966, Bateson sat down to write one of the occasional pieces that distracted him from the slowness of the dolphin work. The subject was the same one H. G. Wells had explored in _The Island of Dr. Moreau_—the defense and justification of modern science. Although the topic was an old one, it betrayed a contemporary sensitivity Bateson felt toward the article in _Life_, now less than a couple of months old. Dolphin research and science in general were defended and justified by the same premises, the same unthinking assumptions and claims to which Bateson’s work, both theoretically and empirically, were building an opposing case.

In his essay, Bateson enumerated the two primary justifications of science. First was the justification on the grounds of utility: “If it be claimed as a major premise that science is _useful_ and if this claim be sound, we can look forward to a pragmatic but comfortable future. If, on the other hand, the premise is unsound and we try to live with it we must expect endless and complex frustration, seasoned with larger and larger doses of hypocrisy as the premise wears thin and the scientists and manufacturers defend it with more and more vigor.”[^61]

Bateson posed the problem as a hypothetical, but it wasn’t hypothetical to him. The justification of science as “what works” was abhorrent to Bateson. In his judgment, the premise _was_ unsound, and “endless and complex frustration” was an accurate description of current conditions. There was, of course, a second way to justify science, just as conventional and perhaps even more authoritative. This was the way Moreau, Lilly, and Monod justified it. Its effect on civilization was for Bateson, if anything, even grimmer: “If it is claimed that science is the pursuit of objective truth . . . philosophic and epistemologic extrapolations from scientific fact should strictly be banned (as they are by many practicing scientists) and our civilization will suffer correspondingly. Art, humor and religion will become unfashionable.”[^62]

This was no hypothetical, either. Again, Bateson was describing his view of current conditions. Art, humor, and religion, those complex cultural constructs human beings had developed to process metamessages and deal with disparities and contradictions in their most fundamental accounts of reality, were relegated to their own “unfashionable” disciplines, and any authority they enjoyed was unthinkingly trumped by the authority of the hard sciences. Philosophic and epistemologic extrapolations (moral judgments, for instance) were strictly banned.[^63]

Bateson set the essay aside, filed it away, and never finished it. But as in so many of his writings since his last years in Palo Alto, the basics of the Batesonian vision are present and clear. The strict banning of metacommunicative data was a fundamental error. Art, especially, couldn’t be banned or deemed irrelevant. Wells’s novel, a work of fiction—itself an aesthetic technique based on the play between the real and unreal—was precisely communication about difficulties at the metalevel. All that Bateson had come to understand because of the Macy Conferences; all the ideas he gathered, contributed, exchanged, and combined about learning theory, about logical types, about the significance of information and feedback to goal-oriented, self-correcting organisms; all that had led to the double-bind hypothesis supported his conclusion that no class of information could rightly be isolated, that no class of messages could rightly be banned. To do so within a family’s habits of communication was potentially pathological. To do so as a scientist drawing conclusions about nature and its laws was no less dangerous.

At the core of this conclusion was a series of analogues. The relationship between one learning context and a subsequent context was analogous to the relationship between the name of a class and one of its members. The relationship between a class and one of its members was analogous to the relationship between a bit of information traveling around a circuit and that bit of information after it was modified by passing through a switch. These relationships were “meta” or “about” relationships, and just as every event or message had a context, every context had a metacontext. This relational pattern of event/message, context/metacontext was the very knit in the informational fabric of the living world. It went all the way up and all the way down, in an “infinite regress” of class-member, whole-part relations. The infinite regress of linked messages in metarelationship meant that all events were framed and influenced by the context in which they occurred. It meant that no contexts were “isolable.” That meant, in turn, that the observer had to be included in the observation of phenomena and the data drawn from that relationship had to be taken into account.[^64]

Wells’s narrator Prendick is driven to despair over his inability to accept the separation of _ought_ and _is_ that a reductionist Darwinism seemed to enforce. In turn, he is haunted by the dread that there _was_ no separation and thus by the nihilistic conclusion that humanity was as mindless and amoral as nature was. Prendick’s final resignation remains uneasy because he has seen that Moreau’s embrace of a Monod-like objectivity postulate does _not_ set him safely in the kingdom above. It is curious to Moreau, though completely extraneous to his investigations, that his work has not convinced him of the need to establish and protect some higher ethical kingdom but has instead knitted him into that “darkness below” upon which he conducts his researches. In what may serve as Wells’s thesis statement, Moreau sums it up this way: “The study of Nature makes man at least as remorseless as Nature.”[^65]

Bateson’s point in his unfinished essay was similar. It was not that nature was remorseless but that Moreau’s approach to studying nature had shaped and characterized him, had made him the man he was. He had developed habits of seeing the world in a certain way, and now all his perceptions were framed by that habit, and what he looked for, he saw. Likewise, Bateson argued, justifications of science, whether on utilitarian or “objective truth” grounds, had “deeply changed our attitudes toward the universe in which we live.” They had changed “our ethics, our educational systems, our ideas about the nature of mythology and religion, and our picture of ourselves.”[^66]

Bateson made much the same point in the most searching essay he wrote during his last years at Palo Alto. His goal in “The Minimal Requirements of a Theory of Schizophrenia” was not to define the double bind or expand on what it meant to mental illness but to explore how the premises of the scientific disciplines would need to change, most minimally, if the premises underlying the double bind were accepted as true. If a circuit-based understanding of causality were accepted, if the naturalization of teleology were accepted, if an informational fabric of metarelations in “infinite regress” were accepted, if the understanding that no contexts were isolable were accepted—how then would scientists be required to change their accounting of reality, their way of seeing the world?

In the remarkable last section of that essay, under the subtitle “What Is Man?,” Bateson laid out his vision, merging the protoscience of thinkers such as Thomas Browne with the Wieners and von Neumanns of the postwar, as clearly as he ever had before. When contexts were not isolable, he argued, alliances in the long and tiresome battle between the hard-hearted materialists and the tender-minded romantics shifted. Moral data again became germane. Now the meaning of materialism was not that moral and aesthetic data were irrelevant but rather the opposite: that they were relevant to the degree that false premises had potentially dire consequences. As Bateson wrote, in perhaps his most concise ethical statement, “There is much connection certainly between scientific truth, on the one hand, and beauty and morality, on the other: that if man entertain false opinions regarding his own nature, he will be led thereby to courses of action which will be in some profound sense immoral or ugly.”[^67]

The latter was the fate of Moreau and his works. It was a curious but extraneous observation of Moreau’s that he had become as remorseless as the nature he studied. But what was extraneous to Moreau was central to Bateson. Any investigation of nature, at some point, made a picture of nature and self. Who are you to me? Who am I to you? All scientists asked these questions of nature, and it was the nature of things that all their answers, right or wrong, elegant or inelegant, tended to be reinforced. It was in the nature of things also that no answer could ever be purely accurate or free of error or go unchallenged in time. This was the essence of the bind.

Bateson, too, was in something of a bind. The dolphins were fascinating and intelligent creatures, but how could he test his hypothesis about the exchange of μ-functions if he could not trace dolphin-to-dolphin communication with confidence? He would need five more years, if he was lucky. Meanwhile, his peers at the Oceanic Institute—the trainers, zoologists, and marine biologists—found him a likable but elderly eccentric. In Waimanalo, Bateson had succeeded in finding himself a quiet corner, but that corner could be lonely. He needed sparring partners, topflight sounding boards, perhaps another Mead. He was sixty-one; his father had lived only three years longer. What had all his work amounted to? It was “a terrible feeling to have when you are nearing the end of your life,” Lois said of her husband during this period. The giant ear wasn’t working. Who understood a thing he said?[^68]

Bateson had begun to think again about a book. Too many years had gone by without a monograph, a work that would serve to culminate and anchor his thought. This was a time when the books of public intellectuals still garnered serious interest, especially if they had a scientific slant. Mead and Benedict were models here. Lilly’s book had attracted attention; Wiener’s books had been influential. Then there was the book by Rachel Carson, _Silent Spring_, and one of Bateson’s personal favorites, _King Solomon’s Ring_, by the gifted German ethologist Konrad Lorenz. Through Karen Pryor, Bateson had met her father, the prolific writer and science buff Philip Wylie, who kept a vacation home in Waimanalo. His wartime book, _Generation of Vipers_, was received with respect and sold well. Bateson wondered whether he might find a more receptive audience outside the academic journals. The biologists who were “not specialists in evolution, hear what I say with pleasure,” Bateson wrote his old friend Nora Barlow. “The pros don’t know what to make of it.”[^69]

In other ways, of course, life in Hawaii in the mid-1960s was rich. The island and its creatures were omnipresent at the beach house and in the Batesons’ lives. There were two young teenagers in the household now, John and Eric, and an atmosphere of openness and informality that Gregory and Lois encouraged. This policy was extended to the young people at the institute, Karen Pryor’s trainers and the other volunteers. Bateson taught a class in anthropology at the University of Hawaii, and as always, he made himself and his home available to students. The Batesons’ hospitality was characterized by a tolerance for the enthusiasms of youth.[^70]

They, too—these young people—tended to hear what Bateson said with pleasure. They liked to gather at the beach house to relax and talk, especially the beatniks among them, with the longish hair, the esoteric interests, and holistic leanings. Bateson related to their concerns. To put this in terms friendly to cybernetics and the double bind, they were open to the idea of a more unified universe and impatient with a materialism of isolable contexts. They were sensitive to contradictions in messages regarding their “own nature.” They were picking up on this information. It was a kind of feedback. It signaled a need for change.[^71]  

## Six: Double-Bind Generation

In the spring of 1966, Gregory Bateson would have a broader exposure to the sort of youth he had come to know in Hawaii. In April he returned to California to speak to students at Sacramento State College. The event was occasioned by a “unique phenomenon”: half of all Americans were presently twenty-five years old or younger. Thus the event was called “Two Worlds: A Symposium,” to suggest that those above and below that median were inhabitants of separate worlds. The “generation gap” wasn’t yet a common phrase. It appeared in the _New York Times_ only once during all of 1966, though that number would jump to fifty-three times in 1967 and would quadruple again in 1968. This suggests some prescience on the part of the college’s Cultural Programs Committee, the event’s sponsoring organization. There in Northern California, some two hours distant from Berkeley and San Francisco, perhaps the committee members had a clearer view of what was coming.[^1]

Participants gathered to hear Bateson in the gymnasium. Here was an elderly man, very much an inhabitant of what was to them “the other world.” Yet in a time when faculty and university administrators still favored a clean military look, with hair clipped short and shellacked to the skull, Bateson’s appearance—informal, rumpled, very tall but standing a little stooped, fingers and teeth nicotine-stained, his hair not long but not groomed to regulation—likely made him seem benign and grandfatherly. If participants knew anything of Bateson, it may have been through his connection to Margaret Mead. After nearly four decades, _Coming of Age in Samoa_ was still no stranger to undergraduate reading lists. Certainly, Mead’s argument in that book that the transition from adolescence to adulthood needn’t be associated with strict sexual policing was one with which students sympathized. That Bateson currently lived in Hawaii, a kind of American Samoa, and that he worked with dolphins and had a connection to John Lilly may have served as endorsements.

Other affinities between Bateson and this audience belied the “two world” premise. Bateson’s willingness to cross disciplines had set him apart as a scientist. What was suspect in professional circles, however, was a plus to this younger demographic. Students were open to the possibility of drawing useful data from a variety of sources. Not being professionals themselves, they had no turf to protect. This, along with the necessity the event placed upon Bateson to speak to nonexperts, challenged him to bring the many disciplinary threads of his thought together and to make it accessible. This challenge was not only substantive but rhetorical. Bateson rose to it.[^2]

The source of Bateson’s discipline hopping had to do not only with a devotion to his personal inquiry or to his beliefs about “the justification of science”; personality and life experience also contributed. Bateson had resisted the constraints of working within a single discipline. He had resisted institutionalizing himself and paid a price. The discontentment with which he had emerged from the war influenced his refusal to join in the postwar collaboration between the government and the social sciences and to reject, with some hostility, the conventional binaries of the Cold War. This was another affinity between Bateson and both those students in the gymnasium in Sacramento and the larger demographic of which they were representative. In the essay that first applied the term “counterculture” to this demographic (itself a subgroup to a much more massive postwar “baby boom”), Theodore Roszak would describe the group’s rejection of mainstream culture as “the Great Refusal.” Something of this refusal, described also as “inner alienation” and discontentment, had been a topic of concern, sometimes referred to as “the youth problem,” for at least a decade, when the current crop of sophomores were nine-year-olds. But now a variety of conditions was coalescing: their sheer numbers; the attention paid them by a media ravenous for novelty and sensation; a model of moral inspiration in ten years or more of civil rights activism; and most of all, a cause around which general resistance could unify, the U.S. military policy in Vietnam.[^3]

Bateson sympathized with these youth because he had also refused and disengaged. He sympathized with them because their discontentment was of a piece with his own, both in substance and in its heritage in the Age of Catastrophe. These affinities made possible a particular fit between what this group was listening for and what Bateson had to say.

Bateson couldn’t know the extent to which the activities and concerns of these youth would lead to a time of social upheaval, of critical self-awareness and change. No one could know that as early as the spring of 1966, though some hoped and others suspected. But in his lecture, which he called “From Versailles to Cybernetics,” Bateson would address this audience directly, as a body in crisis, at a particular moment in time, suffering from the psychic pains of a rather massive double bind. He would acknowledge this pain. He would attempt to explain it to them. By explaining it, he would treat it, and by treating it, offer hope.

In this, of course, Bateson was not alone. Many would catch the ears of these discontented youth. Some were persons of expertise, like Bateson, refining long-held beliefs. Others were self-styled prophets, boots-on-the-ground activists, subversives, ministers, artists, and celebrities. For Bateson, however, the exposure to this audience and the interest of this audience in his thought would bring new life to his project as a scientist and intellectual. The strands of his thought would begin to culminate in articulations that brought fundamental laws of science together with an analysis of human development, richly illustrated with analogies drawn from Western civilization’s familiar themes. Yet this audience had its own agenda. Sensitized to the need for change, it was increasingly compelled by an urgency to act. This would press Bateson’s thought where it had always been most sensitive: the question of application.

### THE OTHER WORLD

Not a few interpretations of the cultural revolution that would come to be called “the Sixties” begin with the iconic exchange from the 1953 film _The Wild One._ When Johnny, the motorcycle gang leader played by Marlon Brando, is asked, “What are you rebelling against?,” he answers, “Whaddaya got?” The answer evokes the prospect of danger, of nihilist abandon reminiscent of Camus’s stranger. Johnny’s gang is called “The Black Rebels,” but they aren’t rebelling against anything in particular. They are simply in it for the thrill.[^4]

One might read the infamous exchange another way. Yes, Johnny is rebelling against something, but he is simply at a loss to say what it is. By asking, “Whaddaya got?,” he wants the question answered himself. Two years after _The Wild One,_ another film about a young delinquent echoed the exchange of the earlier film in its title: _Rebel without a Cause_. This time, Brando’s working-class Johnny was James Dean’s middle-class Jim. But again, the basic question remained the same, an attitude of rebellion seeking an explanation, a cause.[^5]

At the outset of the period in question, actors such as Brando and Dean brought to the screen a charismatic new openness, an emotionality more physical than verbal. When Dean in _Rebel_ is asked the same sort of question Brando was asked, he bends and twists his face and body in a failed effort at articulation. What he offers instead of an answer in words is a bodily description of pain. His parents are at a loss to understand. “Don’t I buy everything you want?” his father asks. “A bicycle, a car?” The failure of American material abundance to provide emotional well-being has already become a cliché. The car, too, as the symbol of that abundance, plays a key role in the film’s plot. A high school classmate challenges Jim to a game of chicken, a fast-crowd pastime the classmate himself recognizes as pointless. The two race, each in his own stolen car, toward the edge of a cliff. Jim jumps out at the last minute, but the classmate, whose sleeve has caught on the door handle, plunges over.[^6]

Later that night, Jim wants to go to the police to tell what he knows about the accident, and when he asks for his parents’ support in this, they balk. “Don’t be idealistic,” they tell him. “A foolish decision could wreck your whole life.” The confrontation moves Jim toward articulation, toward a naming of the cause.

“For years” he has “never done anything right”; he is tired of “pretending to be tough” and emotionally uninvolved. He doesn’t want to escape from the problem but to confront it and face the consequences. He longs for meaningfulness and right action, to “tell the truth” and behave honorably. His mother pushes hard for denial and evasion. Jim pleads with his father to help him hold himself responsible.[^7]

Other commentators, books, and films attempted to put the cause of the “youth problem” into words and arrived at similar articulations. In his influential book of 1960, _Growing Up Absurd_, the gestalt psychologist and social critic Paul Goodman offered an explanation for the “disaffected” young delinquents and Beats of the period. The term “absurd” associated his critique with that of the midcentury existentialists, but for Goodman, the source of the problem was not some tragic paradox of the human condition but the economic, social, and cultural conditions of a contemporary generation of American males. Boys were not being socialized into the kind of manhood that satisfied their desire “for knowledge, noble ideals, honest effort, and some kind of worthwhile achievement.” Instead, they were being trained for the “Rat Race.” Some refused, Goodman explained, with acts of rebellion. Most simply suffered without realizing why. Likewise, Betty Friedan’s description of the lives of middle-class women in _The Feminine Mystique_ summarized these conditions as a disturbing contradiction, as a “strange discrepancy between the reality of our lives as women and the image to which we were trying to conform.” Discontentment, she argued, was pervasive, and its cause resisted articulation. It was “the problem that has no name.”[^8]

To those seeking relief in rebellion, the “saintly bravery” of the civil rights activists, especially the young members of the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and the Congress for Racial Equality, provided a bracing example. For someone like Jim in _Rebel without a Cause,_ the black students who demonstrated at lunch counter sit-ins had solved the meaning problem. They were not being coddled and protected; they weren’t finding complacency in material abundance; they were participating in a real cause.

Many young people were inspired to join SNCC or the newer organization founded partly on SNCC’s model, Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). The experience of young participants in the Freedom Summer project of 1964 worked as kindling for the free speech movement at the University of California–Berkeley that fall. In his speeches, movement leader Mario Savio, reaching James Dean–like pitches of moral agony, famously urged students to throw themselves “on the gears” of a system that pitted moral yearnings against the “chrome-plated consumer’s paradise.” To answer the same question asked of Brando in _The Wild One_, Savio and others drew on a now familiar complex: a grasping for meaningfulness and purpose, the opportunity to act as a moral being, and pain whose source was contradiction and paradox, most prominently the one concerning the “strange discrepancy” between pervasive discontentment amid material abundance.[^9]

Then came the American military escalation in Vietnam. In the 1964 presidential election, President Lyndon Johnson had run on a platform of restraint in foreign relations. He portrayed his opponent as a nuclear hawk and claimed to seek “no wider war” in Vietnam. Yet starting in late 1965, he doubled the number of American troops sent to Vietnam to 200,000, and by the end of 1966 almost 400,000 young Americans were inducted into the military through Selective Service. Escalation and the draft galvanized student activism. By January 1966, both SNCC and SDS had stated their formal opposition to the war, and much of the activism they and other groups organized—sit-ins, teach-ins, marches, and demonstrations—were now centered on university campuses. What are you rebelling against? The answer came easier now.[^10]

Despite this focus, articulation of cause continued to fold discontentment into a broader critique. Carl Oglesby, SDS president, was encouraged by a coactivist to “name the system” that could produce a war like Vietnam. Oglesby supplied an answer in a speech that echoed Lewis Mumford’s 1940 analysis of “the two liberalisms.” Whereas one was “authentically humanist,” Oglesby said, the other was “not so human at all.” The “illiberal liberalism” produced contradictions so absurd that “even . . . the napalm in Vietnam” became “only another aspect of our humanitarian love.” In his most memorable flourish, Oglesby personalized the paradox revealed by Vietnam policy into a kind of deceit, a trick played on his love of country, that “broke my American heart.”[^11]

It was a stance later struck in veterans’ memoirs, such as Ron Kovic’s _Born on the Fourth of July_ and Philip Caputo’s _A Rumor of War_: the true believer, disillusioned. Caputo had been one of the early volunteers, inspired by the call to national service in Kennedy’s inaugural address. By the time of Oglesby’s speech in November 1965, Caputo had been in Vietnam for eight months and “no longer believed in our own publicity.” Within a few more months, and certainly by the following spring, Caputo and his platoon mates had become the stone killers skirting madness well known to moviegoers in later decades.[^12]

The starker the paradox, the more agonized the experience of a painful psychic bind. Here the critique of Vietnam was more broadly applied. As Oglesby confessed, “Perhaps many of us feel a bit uneasy in our sleep. We are not, after all, a cruel people. . . . But what can we do? . . . Our system exists. One is swept up into it. How intolerable—to be born moral, but addicted to a stolen and maybe surplus luxury.” To “name the system” was to see the problem in systemic terms, and here Oglesby again echoed not only Mumford but also Savio, mixing traditional economic analysis with depictions of systemic pathology and its effect on the individual psyche. The system Oglesby named was “an awesome organism,” binding individuals in moral paralysis, a “colossus,” of which the war was only a piece. Oglesby’s “colossus” recalled Allen Ginsberg’s Moloch in less poetic garb. “Moloch! Moloch! Robot apartments! invisible suburbs! skeleton treasuries! blind capitals! demonic industries! spectral nations! invincible madhouses! granite cocks! monstrous bombs!” With almost 100,000 copies of “Howl” in circulation, Ginsberg was by now a celebrity among this generation of discontented youth, a model of disengagement. Moloch was colossal, but it could be refused—“Moloch whom I abandon!” Ginsberg proclaimed.[^13]

Confronting a system perceived as so vast and malicious, Ginsberg and others believed that conventional political organization and protest was not a sufficiently radical response. In January 1966, the same month SNCC and SDS had come out against the war, Ken Kesey and Stewart Brand held the largest of their “Acid Tests” in Palo Alto. Their hope was that through simulated environments and a wide distribution of LSD, participants might transcend systemic programming. It was an idea widely propagated in the nation’s bohemian enclaves by the newspapers of a burgeoning underground press. Drawn by news of such events and others in these publications and by the lore of psychic experimentation, thousands of young people, many of them runaways, began to stream into the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco; 15,000 were living there by midyear. This group of “culturals,” centered in the Haight, was converging with the veteran “politicals,” centered across the bay at UC–Berkeley. This merger of culturals and politicals became the leading edge of what would be a widespread and historic “surge” in youth activism. This was the vanguard of the “movement.”[^14]

Much of the scene’s look and cultural expression—its dress, its gatherings, its poster art—had been forged over the past months, not only by Kesey and his Merry Pranksters but also by another group of culturals, in retreat across the state line, at the Red Dog Saloon in Virginia City, Nevada. Psychedelic style was an eclectic blending of the mystic iconography of the East and of the nineteenth-century Wild West. The road from Virginia City to San Francisco passed through Sacramento. Travelers along this road must have looked, to some observers, like inhabitants of another world.[^15]

By the time Bateson gave his lecture at Sacramento State, the decade was more than halfway gone. The news media, whose aim was to hit the same sort of emotional buttons as did the makers of _The Wild One,_ had only recently coined the term “hippie.” Few had their tongues around the word yet. Nevertheless, by April 1966 all the visual and conceptual components now popularly associated with the sixties were both relatively new and firmly in place. At the same time, after a decade of civil rights activism and more recent urban unrest, the merging of campus antiwar demonstrations with the provocative antics of the culturals prompted a backlash, a _counter_-countercultural complex of revulsion, hostility, and resentment.

In both rebellion and backlash, California led the trend. Reaction against antiwar protest by Bay Area students had been immediate and violent. Demonstrators were beaten; antiwar facilities were bombed. One historian calls that spring in California a “season of moral panic.” The upheaval in Watts, deemed “riots” by the press, was less than a year old. Tension, however, was focused on students. As one witness to the political temperature of the moment put it, “The biggest single reactive word in California then was not ‘blacks’ or ‘Watts’ or ‘Vietnam,’ but ‘Berkeley.’” Former actor and corporate spokesman Ronald Reagan was in the midst of a campaign to be the Republican nominee in the race for governor. He and his campaign team of advertising executives and behavioral psychologists solidified a winning constituency by pressing the issue of “beatnik picketing,” by depicting the student protesters as an alien cadre—dirty, treasonous, and depraved—and by promising to swiftly contain them. Reagan’s campaign struck a nerve, not least among a contingent of this same large demographic of youths who easily outnumbered their more discontented siblings.[^16]

California had come to resemble Bateson’s description of a family containing a schizophrenic member. As father, mother, and siblings strived ever more desperately to keep up appearances, the identified patient, with his or her outrageous modes of verbal and physical expression, kept the facade “under constant attack.” What are you rebelling against? The schizophrenic could not always say and was in fact forbidden to say directly. Symptomatic behaviors were often obscure and metaphorical. He or she was “likely to remark in a clear conversational tone in church, ‘We haven’t had a nice crackling storm lately; have we dad?’”[^17]

### A PAINFUL BIRTHRIGHT

The analogy is a broad one. It runs all the risks that come with trying to see many people as one. But the analogy—that this “one” is equivalent in form to the double bind’s identified patient in a family with a schizophrenic member—is useful, at the very least, in grasping what Gregory Bateson had in mind when he returned to Northern California in April 1966 and spoke to the students filling the gymnasium at Sacramento State. According to the event’s two world premise, they made up a unified group, inhabiting a separate world, and Bateson addressed them as such. He addressed them en masse, as a unity, sharing like conditions and a like experience. The conditions he perceived drew from the same postwar complex: the seeking for meaningfulness as a remedy to “inner alienation,” the response to contradiction and to logical paradox that manifested as an anguished pain that was difficult to articulate if not forbidden to speak of. The double bind was an acknowledgment of that pain and an explanation for it. This is what Bateson had offered as a sometime therapist, and this was what he offered, more recently, as a teacher and “resident guru” at Waimanalo. Now he would offer it to the student audience: concepts that explained the pain they felt as a kind of historical and demographic birthright.

The introduction to Bateson’s lecture, three paragraphs long and worth quoting in full, is a compendium of rhetorical technique. It offers a few provocative quotations and invokes personal experience. It commends the participation of listeners with the assurance that “we are talking about serious things.” It refers directly to what is very much on the cultural mind—this seeming rift between generations:

I have to talk about recent history as it appears to me in my generation and to you in yours and, as I flew in this morning, words began to echo in my mind. These were phrases more thunderous than any I might be able to compose. One of these groups of words was, “The fathers have eaten bitter fruit and the children’s teeth are set on edge.” Another was the statement of Joyce that “history is that nightmare from which there is no awakening.” Another was, “The sins of the fathers shall be visited on the children even to the third and fourth generation of those that hate me.” And lastly, not so immediately relevant, but still I think relevant to the problem of social mechanism, “He who would do good to another must do it in Minute Particulars. General Good is the plea of the scoundrel, hypocrite, and flatterer.”

We are talking about serious things. I call this lecture “From Versailles to Cybernetics,” naming the two historic events of the twentieth century. The word “cybernetics” is familiar, is it not? But how many of you know what happened at Versailles in 1919?

The question is, What is going to count as important in the history of the last sixty years? I am sixty-two, and, as I began to think about what I have seen of history in my lifetime, it seemed to me that I had really only seen two moments that would rate as really important from an anthropologist’s point of view. One was the events that led up to the Treaty of Versailles, and the other was the cybernetic breakthrough. You may be surprised or shocked that I have not mentioned the A-bomb, or even World War II. I have not mentioned the spread of the automobile, nor of the radio and TV, nor many other things that have occurred in the last sixty years.[^18]

The Treaty of Versailles and cybernetics made for an odd pairing to pique curiosity, another rhetorical hook. Why were these the only two moments that rated? As mammals, Bateson explained, what people most cared about were not “episodes” but “patterns of their relationships.” Patterns of relationships told people where they stood “in love, hate, respect, dependency, and similar abstractions.” Humans cared about these answers so much, at least in part, because this was “where it hurts us to be put in the wrong. If we trust and find that that which we have trusted was untrustworthy; or if we distrust, and find that that which we distrusted was in fact trustworthy, we feel _bad_. The pain that human beings and all other mammals can suffer from this type of error is extreme.”[^19]

Bateson didn’t use the term “μ-function,” coined for his recent journal article about cetaceans. Rather, he offered, in plainspoken terms, a definition of psychic pain and its connection to matters of moral value. Extreme pain came from being put in the wrong; it came from the discovery of a delusion, a deceit, or perhaps a betrayal of that in which “value” had resided, of the type Caputo and Oglesby described. This pain marked a change in “attitude.” Significance in history, Bateson explained, was not in the events themselves but in those “moments” when “attitudes were changed.”[^20]

Bateson then laid this ethologist’s observation about the behavior of animals into the lattice of cybernetic theory. Change in attitude in a dolphin or an otter or a human being, he implied, was formally identical to change in the “setting” or “bias” of a cybernetic system. To illustrate, he offered the established example: the home thermostat. When the temperature of the house cooled, the furnace kicked on; when it heated, the furnace kicked off. These were events, mere episodes, oscillations, falling within a range that was governed by the setting or bias of “the little box” on the living room wall. Changing the bias or setting on that box was a change in systemic “attitude.” If a house with a thermostat were a mammal, presumably, this change in attitude would be experienced as pain.[^21]

In the case of the Treaty of Versailles, the change in bias was experienced by a whole society of mammals. The treaty, as Bateson summarized it, was a bait-and-switch, perpetrated on a massive scale. After years of stalemate in the war, the idea was proposed that the Germans might surrender if offered a “soft armistice . . . to which there would be no punitive measures.” These terms were drawn up and given to President Wilson to sell to the world, because “if you are going to deceive somebody, you had better get an honest man to carry the message.” The Germans agreed to surrender with the promise of a peace without “annexations,” without “contributions” or punishments.[^22]

If the Fourteen Points were the bait, the switch was the treaty in its final form. In Bateson’s telling, British prime minister David Lloyd George and French prime minister Georges Clemenceau were coconspirators in the fraud. At the treaty table, they “bamboozled” Wilson along. Whenever he would “wonder about those Fourteen Points of his,” they “took him out to the war cemeteries and made him feel ashamed of not being angry with the Germans.” In the end, the promise of soft terms was broken. The treaty called for harsh punishments and humiliations, monetary reparations, and annexations carved out with a free hand.[^23]

Bateson’s depiction of events had allowed him to illustrate, via narrative indirection, μ-function and homeostatic systems. Now he moved to the theory of logical types and its connection to the double bind. The Fourteen Points had been offered not only to the Germans but also to the world under the sign of peacemaking. That sign was not an act of war but a message about war and thus not only different from an act of war but also of a different and more abstract logical type: “The message ‘Let’s make peace on such and such terms’ is not within the same ethical system as the deceits and tricks of battle.” With Versailles, however, the peacemaking concealed a surprise attack; it made “a message _about_ war” into a “part _of_ the war.” Again, Bateson didn’t use the term double bind. But here it was, as historical event: contradictory messages at two levels of abstraction, delivered as one.[^24]

As a result, German politics experienced “total demoralization.” “If you promise your boy something,” Bateson explained, “and renege on him, framing the whole thing on a high ethical plane, you will probably find that not only is he very angry with you, but that _his_ moral attitudes deteriorate.” And so too, Bateson stressed, did the attitudes of the deceiver. This was what he meant by an “attitudinal turning point.” The reneging on the Fourteen Points was a change in attitude about what was acceptable in treaty negotiations, where ethical matters and standards of behavior were supreme. One didn’t wave a white flag and then attack when the enemy gathered to parley. To do so was to create the conditions for systemic cynicism. Value was replaced by absence of value, and pain filled the vacated space. Demoralization, felt as pain, spread through the system, down through the years, “even to the third and fourth generation,” even until “the children’s teeth are set on edge.”[^25]

If those above and those below the age of twenty-five indeed inhabited separate worlds, now Bateson offered an explanation. This time he drew his illustration not from recent history but from Greek myth. According to the story of the House of Atreus, a father, invited to a “peace-making feast,” was tricked into eating the cooked flesh of his own butchered sons. That act set forth a sequence of revenge murders, a blood feud moving down through the generations, a “tragedy of oscillating and self-propagating distrust, hate, and destruction.” Having been born after the pattern was set, the children of the middle generation “find themselves in a crazy universe, and find themselves crazy, precisely because they do not know how they got that way.” This was the kind of condition and world in which the students and their peers now found themselves.[^26]

Bateson furthered his illustration with a bit of mild pandering: “To take a dose of LSD is all right, and you will have the experience of being more or less crazy, but this will make quite good sense because you know you took the dose of LSD. If, on the other hand, you took the LSD by accident, and then find yourself going crazy, not knowing how you got there, this is a terrifying and horrible experience.”[^27]

The special pathos of this particular generation of daughters and sons was that they hadn’t been around at the time of the initial deceit. Both the older and the younger lived in “the same crazy universe,” but “we older ones know how we got here. I can remember my father reading the Fourteen Points at the breakfast table and saying, ‘By golly, they’re going to give them a decent armistice, a decent peace,’ or something of the kind. And I can remember, but I will not attempt to verbalize it, the sort of thing he said when the Treaty of Versailles came out. It wasn’t printable.”[^28]

The personal note was a telling one. It put Vietnam and LSD, World War I and Versailles in the same “crazy universe.” It also emphasized Bateson’s point that he was not just talking about episodes along a timeline but about a shift in attitude that he had been involved in, about a pain he had felt himself.[^29]

### THE CRIMES OF THE FATHER AND THE CHILDREN’S TEETH

The Great War devastated the Bateson family, almost destroying it, as it did so many other families. By 1914, when the fighting commenced, William Bateson was at the height of his career. He and his circle of intellectual elites did not favor Britain’s involvement in the war. They believed in the promise of science. For knowledge to advance, research had to be shared across borders, and international discord threatened that exchange. Class bias played a role, as well. In the view of W. B. and those closest to him, the commercialism and political expediency that pushed pure science toward instrumental application, and that were vulgarizing British society in general, were those interests most responsible for the conflict. To respond to the war with dissent or pacifism was, however, also disfavored. Once war was declared and the country in danger, W. B. saw little choice but to support it. The general expectation was that the fighting would be brief. John and Martin, Gregory’s older brothers, were teenagers, both top science students at their respective prep schools, both bound for St. John’s College at Cambridge to carry on the family tradition. W. B. and Beatrice hoped it would all be over before the boys reached the age of service.[^30]

John and Martin had always been close. They were nevertheless different people. John, the elder by sixteen months, took after his mother. Good-natured, mild, uncomplaining, he fit in well with his peers, took part in school rituals and sports, and even marched (to his parents’ objection) in the rifle corps. He graduated in the spring of 1916, winning the senior prize in biology. That fall, with his degree in hand, he accepted a commission as second lieutenant and began training for the artillery. The war had been going on almost three years and, in the aftermath of Verdun, was now in bloody stalemate. John was sent to France the following April.

Martin, two years behind John at school, was more like his father, more tightly wound, more showy and outspoken, both about his enthusiasms and his vexations. Martin, too, shined as a student of the life sciences but also began to dabble in poetry, some of which explored, in a tentative way, antiwar sentiment. Like his father, he saw the war as a bow to the “commercial classes.” Martin considered becoming a conscientious objector, a choice that remained unacceptable to W. B. Also weighing in against formal resistance was his brother’s uncomplaining devotion to duty, displayed in stoic letters from the front. John’s letters home betrayed little of the danger he was in. Rather, they recorded observations of natural history, of beetles found crawling across strafed ground or emerging between the planks of a trench wall. Species he couldn’t identify, he dutifully illustrated. In the fall of 1917, he received a minor wound and was decorated for bravery.[^31]

The following December, while John was recovering at home, Martin left school and enlisted in the Royal Air Force. Military life only heightened his cynicism and antiauthoritarian tendencies. Such attitudes were becoming more pervasive, and Martin adopted a bitter, ironic mode. He trained in photographic reconnaissance but would get no closer to the fighting than his base on the Isle of Wight.[^32]

By July 1918, now twenty years old, John was back on the front in France with his battalion, involved in an offensive. He wrote home of the hard work: the continual movement of the battery, the digging of new entrenchments. Where the battery went, artillery fire was sure to follow, but the advance was steady, and always the naturalist, John noted his delight in the exposure to “clean, unshelled country.” He was killed by a shell that October, a month before the armistice.[^33]

Bateson didn’t tell the students at Sacramento State that he had lost a brother in World War I, but his version of the war and the peace that followed had a certain idiosyncratic quality. He called the Treaty of Versailles “one of the great sell-outs in the history of civilization.” The fraud was instigated, Bateson claimed, by George Creel, a man few of his listeners had likely heard of. Bateson described the chairman of President Wilson’s wartime Committee on Public Information simply as “a public relations man.” Creel was, in other words, one of those policy makers who took the work of behavioral scientists and sought utilitarian uses for it. Creel was the type Bateson had warned of at the Second Symposium on Science, Philosophy and Religion twenty-five years earlier. People like Creel were, at worst, ruthless, like the Nazis, creating a society of automatons, as Bateson had said in his talk at the symposium. At best, they were, as he said now to his present audience, well-intentioned instrumentalists, too eager to apply what they had learned from social science “before the science was ripe.”[^34]

Of course Bateson himself had been one of these instrumentalists. Briefly, during his war, he had served as a public relations man of the black ops variety. It was a sore spot for him. But in urging his listeners “not to forget” that Creel was “a granddaddy of modern public relations,” Bateson was doing more than venting his bitterness. Science, good or bad, moral or nonmoral, could be dangerous when put to work. The notion wasn’t foreign to them, these children who had grown up “in the shadow of the bomb,” as the phrase went. It wasn’t foreign to them, either, to be wary of the manipulative capacity of advertising. Bateson encouraged them to weave their wariness of technology and their wariness of consumerist propaganda into a broader concern.[^35]

Idiosyncratic, too, was the way Bateson characterized Wilson’s being made to “feel ashamed of not being angry with the Germans.” The remark recalls Bateson’s prickly 1949 letter to Margaret Mead in which he chafed at being pushed to feel animosity toward the Russians. One wonders, however, how this sentiment might have played to the students in the gymnasium. For years, the literature of popular sociology had been warning them against conformity to the totalizing tendencies of a consumer culture. Yet resistance to Vietnam, if not to containment culture in general, would likely have been experienced by this group, vis-à-vis their elders and authority figures, as shame. For not properly regarding the North Vietnamese as the enemy, for not feeling more threatened by international communism, young dissenters stood accused of being softheaded and naive. Their misconceived protests put the country in danger. Indeed, accusations such of these, intertwined with accusations of unappreciated privilege and moral impurity, was the central thrust in the current gubernatorial primary campaign. For Ronald Reagan and his team of public relations experts, shaming of the “kids at Berkeley” was a winning political strategy.[^36]

Grandfatherly like Reagan (only six years Reagan’s senior), Bateson also placed the gap at the center of his lecture. “I am sixty-two,” he told them. But to point out that he was older than they were, that he had seen and experienced things they hadn’t seen and experienced, wasn’t to accuse them of naïveté. It wasn’t to accuse them, as so many of their elders and peers were doing, of being unpatriotic. Rather, as children of the “middle generation,” they were victims. There were reasons why they felt the way they felt—not merely sentimental reasons but logical, scientific reasons. Some may have welcomed this news.

Now, however, came a crucial turn in his lecture. For equally scientific reasons, victimhood didn’t mean dispensation. Yes, Bateson assured them, they were “perfectly correct” in their sense that the universe was crazy, that something was wrong. That didn’t make them innocent. It didn’t place them above the corruption. This wasn’t so different from the point Oglesby had made about being swept up in the system, but Bateson wanted to express something other than anguish. For the sons and daughters of the middle generation, “living in the midst of corruption,” the deceit of Versailles had created an intolerance for all deceits, even those harmless, beneficial ones that might otherwise “oil the wheels” of sociability. “Of course, your natural responses are puritanical,” Bateson told them. Not puritanical in sex—the nature of the deceit had not been sexual—but puritanical in the “big integrated structures of life,” in domestic and international political relations. This “extreme puritanism against compromise” and “hypocrisy” had reduced their lives “to little pieces.” This could make them strident and self-righteous in regard to the “big integrated structures of life,” what Bateson referred to in his introductory quote from William Blake as matters of the “General Good.” Considering the direction student protest took in the coming years, Bateson displayed some prescience here.[^37]

Even so, his point was not to scold them. “Of course,” their natural responses were puritanical, he said. It is important to understand Bateson’s implication here. Intolerance was not the mark of innocence. It didn’t separate or liberate the children of the middle generation from the bind of corruption, however correctly they identified it. Rather, intolerance marked a reduction of range. Despite their insight and sensitivity, in an environment always vulnerable to further stress, their spectrum of possible behaviors was not widened but narrowed. “I don’t doubt,” Bateson told them, “that if you asked George Creel to justify the Fourteen Points, he would urge the general good. It is possible that that little operation of his saved a few thousand American lives in 1918. I don’t know how many it cost in World War II, and since in Korea and Vietnam. I recall that Hiroshima and Nagasaki were justified by the general good and saving American lives. There was a lot of talk about ‘unconditional surrender,’ perhaps because we could not trust ourselves to honor a conditional surrender. Was the fate of Hiroshima determined at Versailles?”[^38]

This wasn’t to imply that history was fated. When trust, even self-trust, was removed from the spectrum of available behaviors, the number of possible responses was reduced, and that had made the use of the bomb more likely. Likewise, in terms of individual behavior, “natural responses” were not liberated but squeezed. One wonders how clearly the members of his audience heard this part of Bateson’s message. By calling them out as puritans, he was not rebuking them but warning them. History was a nightmare. Options on the table were fewer than perhaps they imagined.[^39]

### ANNIVERSARIES

When Bateson warned the students of their puritanism and the narrowing path it set them on, he must have had Martin in mind. Martin Bateson never recovered from the death of his older brother. After being demobilized, Martin enrolled in Cambridge, and though he began, as expected, a curriculum in the life sciences, he was drawn more and more to literature. Seeking an outlet for his grief and rage, he wrote poetry and plays about the war. In these, his antiwar sentiments returned full force, and despair vied with a heightened politicization.

The topic entered into letters home to his father. Although W. B. had always been against the war in principle, in all other ways he had accommodated it, and Martin’s letters indirectly obliged W. B. to justify this accommodation, or else to admit some culpability in the sacrifice of John. W. B., also grieving, defended himself on pragmatic grounds. England was no tyrant state; democratic nations and their governments were “honor bound to follow pretty closely to accepted courses.” The country had been under threat. “A skipper _has_ to put his ship’s safety first,” and “the only chance in the long run is for the objector to subordinate his opinions and do what he is ordered to do.” The war, W. B. admitted to Martin, made him “sick and ashamed. . . . _To think for oneself in most societies is a crime_. But there it is! One has just to make the best of the situation and be thankful we are allowed our niche.”[^40]

That niche, of course, was science. Of the two brothers, Martin had displayed the more academic brilliance, and the unspoken expectation was that he would carry on the Bateson legacy. But as Martin continued his studies at St. John’s, he became ambivalent about science as a vocation. He dropped out and enrolled in the Royal Academy for the Dramatic Arts, nursing doubts about the decision all the while.

In the past, W. B. and Beatrice had encouraged Martin’s literary endeavors, but now the latitude they allowed him was tested. It wasn’t as if scientific research was a solid, practical vocation, especially not the kind that W. B. did, research without commercial sponsorship and that was hostile to commercial application. But to propose a serious career in the arts was something else entirely. The counsel the Batesons offered Martin now became more measured and was interlaced with financial concerns. It was true that the war had halved W. B.’s income. Now the correlation between this economic pragmatism in response to Martin’s decision to drop out of science and pursue the arts and the political pragmatism W. B. had invoked in response to Martin’s anger over the war became an undercurrent in the relationship. When this was added to the long-held expectation, felt by W. B. and Martin alike, that the son mount an attempt to carry on the father’s achievements, the rift between them widened.

Samuel Butler came between them, too. The novelist and philosopher Butler, along with William Blake, had been a sort of patron saint of the Bateson household. During the period following John’s death, Martin worked up a late-adolescent mania for Butler, especially for Butler as maligned outsider. He embraced especially Butler’s posthumous novel, and the one more remembered today, _The Way of All Flesh._ It is the semiautobiographical account of Ernest Pontifex, a boy almost destroyed by his parents’ timid conventionalism. Martin identified with Ernest Pontifex and in turn cast W. B. in the role of the boy’s status-obsessed father. Martin wrote a play centered on a similar father-son relationship. He shared the play with Beatrice but didn’t seem to recognize that W. B. might take its autobiographical overtones as an attack.

The attack, too, was surely narrow and unfair. W. B. was no radical, but neither was he a Father Pontifex. He had suffered many years of professional exclusion and financial instability. He had won his place—“our niche,” as he called it—with much hard work and not a little luck, and it is understandable that he would be wary of putting his professional standing at political or economic risk. Yet whereas much of the wrangling between Martin and W. B. was prompted by money matters, the real difficulty was Martin’s proposal to leave science for the study of art, and on this point, W. B.’s true feelings went largely unspoken. And it was here, too, that W. B. was more vulnerable to the kind of charges Martin was making. Other fathers might have been against their sons’ pursuing a career in art because these fathers were philistines. W. B., however, believed in art. Indeed, he worshipped works of art—of the classical or Renaissance variety—as near-sacred achievements. This was precisely the difficulty. Artists to W. B. were men of holy genius. They were not one’s sons.[^41]

Whether or not so bald a statement was ever made directly to Martin, he may well have sensed its meaning. Frustrated and plagued by doubts, Martin took up with a crowd among whom he played the hard-hearted cynic. It was a group, at least in the judgment of his parents, more interested in road trips than in working hard to lay the groundwork for future careers. Martin took to the road with these friends, traveling to Spain, to Ireland, and elsewhere. He gambled. He bought a motorcycle.

He also fell in love. The young lady was the daughter of a successful businessman, of the striving commercial class that Martin, along with his father, blamed for the war. She gave Martin no encouragement. In fact, the relationship between them, the evidence suggests, was largely one of Martin’s own imagining. He wrote poems for the young woman and sent them to her with gifts. She shrank from his intensity and artistic posturing. He wrote a play and gave the heroine her name, and then burned it in an act of penance over the embarrassment it caused her. Martin was floundering emotionally. At times he seemed reconciled to rejection. He met with instructors at the academy and made plans for future projects and coursework. Then one day he took a pistol to Piccadilly Square, and in a garish act of public suicide, he stood beneath the statue of Eros and shot himself in the head.

The coroner’s report recorded Martin’s case as one of temporary insanity. That morning Martin had gone again to the young lady’s house. She had left him with another rejection, this time in the harshest terms yet that her sense of propriety could manage. Martin Bateson was an overwrought boy, a young drama student, suffering an unrequited love. This was all true, and sufficient explanation, but some further data must be added to the account. The date and time that Martin pulled the trigger was April 22, 1922, about three o’clock in the afternoon. That was the twenty-fourth anniversary of his late brother’s birth, almost to the minute.

It makes sense, then, that Gregory would be thinking of Martin on the plane that morning of April 21, 1966, on the verge of the same anniversary, as he gathered his thoughts for his afternoon lecture. It makes sense that James Joyce, the Bible, and William Blake would ring in him with resonance and meaning. The nightmare of history, the children’s teeth, and the temptation of the General Good; his brothers, these students, the Great War, Vietnam—these contexts were not isolable. He knew this because of the second historic change in attitude that he was talking about: the development of cybernetics that had followed the fruit of Versailles.

### CYBERNETICS: A DIM HOPE

When an individual’s past experience is examined to provide an explanation for that individual’s mental pathology, that is a psychiatric diagnosis. When the same approach is applied not to an individual but to a class of individuals, the diagnosis merges with historical interpretation. As historical interpretations go, the one Bateson offered in “From Versailles to Cybernetics” is idiosyncratic and thin. It is by no means outrageous to see the seeds of World War II in the Treaty of Versailles, the Cold War in World War II’s endgame, and the U.S. debacle in Vietnam as the result of too rigid a Cold War mentality. To press Bateson too hard, however, on the sophistication of his historical interpretation is to mistake his purpose.

In “From Versailles to Cybernetics,” the historical events surrounding the Treaty of Versailles served Bateson as a vehicle, a central metaphor. The metaphor allowed him to speak, in a nontechnical way, directly to the concerns of his audience and to offer them a kind of insight-based therapy. It was the sort of therapy he was used to offering, the kind he had always offered students and patients alike: he sought to engage them with the concerns of his own scientific inquiry as a way of showing that their problems and his concerns converged on some centrality of ideas. These ideas interacted analogously. Homeostatic systems, μ-function, logical types, and the double bind—Bateson held these notions up to situations of vastly different scale, from the quantum, to the personal, to the societal, to the environmental. The gesture was holistic: as above, so below.

Implicit in this holism was the merger of fact and value, manifesting itself in Bateson’s insistence that descriptions of reality and ethical matters were reflexive. The discoveries and refinements of the Macy Conferences, as a new body of scientific fundamentals, had made the difference here. Bateson termed these discoveries “cybernetics,” again for rhetorical purposes. It was a term he thought his audience knew. But the name was not as important as the change in attitude. Because of the new fundamentals of cybernetics, “ethics can now be looked at with formality, rigor, logic, mathematics, and all that,” Bateson claimed. Ethics now stood “on a different sort of basis from mere invocational preachments. We do not have to feel our way; we can sometimes _know_ right from wrong.”[^42]

The new knowledge and orientation made possible by cybernetics didn’t merely mean an attitudinal change, as that change brought about by the Treaty of Versailles. It was, Bateson said, “a change in the understanding of what an attitude is.” This was a change at a different level of abstraction, and so, for Bateson, vastly more significant. It gave him “at least a dim hope that we can bring ourselves to use this new understanding with some honesty. If we understand a little bit of what we’re doing, maybe it will help us to find our way out of the maze of hallucinations that we have created around ourselves.”[^43]

The ideas themselves were not where the hope lay. For Bateson, the hope lay in the apparent fact that this was an audience open to those ideas, open because of their discontentment and therefore poised, and perhaps even prepared, to understand them.

Unlike Greek tragedians, historians defend their interpretations from charges of fatal determinism by stressing the persistence of human agency. There are causes, there are major trends, but within these causes and trends, the individual maintains some freedom of action. This is the central belief, too, in progressive political theory. To deny the efficacy of human agency, because the human being was fatally flawed, was to take an essentially religious view of what was properly a political problem. It was to surrender to quietism, to risk moral paralysis, as Reinhold Niebuhr had warned his brother Richard. Where was that agency to take place: in the arena of conventional political agitation, as the politicals of the movement advocated, or in individual thinking and lifestyles, as the culturals advised? Or would a new place for agency be shaped in some merger of the two? More and more in the late sixties, among that discontented subculture to whom Bateson believed he was speaking, these questions intensified. It was within this debate and eventual uproar that Bateson’s message would play.

How did it play to the students listening to him that day in the gymnasium? Some may have experienced a moment of recognition at his scientific-historical-literary description of their discontentment and pain. Some may have been reassured by his holistic account of their condition. Others may have squirmed a little at his suggestion that the range of agency that lay before them was slim. Bateson stressed this latter point not only in his remarks about history and the House of Atreus but also when he illustrated cybernetic theory with the discussion of the thermostat. The weather changed, and the furnace changed, too—it went on and off accordingly. But the system’s bias, Bateson emphasized, could never be “changed by those changes.” The bias could be changed only when someone went to the little box on the wall and chose a new setting and thus a new spectrum of responses, a new oscillatory range.[^44]

How would one achieve that new setting? Surely this was what the students were asking themselves. Surely some version of this question was what had motivated them to attend the symposium to begin with. Could they, the discontented youth, get a hand on that little box on the wall?  

## Seven: Animal Stories

One of the books Bateson took with him on his April 1966 trip to California was his teenage son John’s copy of T. H. White’s _The Sword in the Stone._ The novel, in print since its initial publication in 1939, is the first of White’s classic four-part retelling of Malory’s _Le Morte d’Arthur._ It recounts the boyhood of Arthur, known as “the Wart,” and his tutelage by Merlyn, a wizard living backwards in time.

As Bateson addressed the students at the symposium in Sacramento, might it have amused him to see something of himself in Merlyn? To think so is not much of a stretch. Rumpled and unkempt, frequently abstracted, full of esoteric knowledge, Merlyn seems both out of touch and somehow more in touch with the present moment. Merlyn is a magician, an alchemist, but he is also a natural historian. He lives in a naturalist’s paradise, surrounded by animals of all kinds, some of which converse with him, some that nest in his hair. Nor is it much of a stretch to imagine that Bateson saw something of Arthur in the students. The Wart is a big-hearted youth, loyal and sensitive, full of goodwill and loving, even pained concern for the living beings that populate his world. Bateson knew, from the interest in dolphins held by the young volunteers and trainees at the Oceanic Institute, that this group was as open as any to lessons from the animal world. The Wart, too, is a seeker, both of knowledge and adventure. In fact, what leads the Wart to Merlyn in the first place is a quest, initiated by a troubled conscience. Merlyn doesn’t seek out the Wart. The Wart discovers him.[^1]

Bateson had been haunted by uncertainty. He was unsure whether or not anyone was listening to him and what his life’s work amounted to. Now he had found an audience. They listened with an open heart, a troubled conscience, keen for negative feedback, sensitive to the need for change. The validation was energizing. In the flush of his success in connecting with a lay audience receptive to his thought, Bateson would reach out in the direction of expertise, to potentially sympathetic peers he admired. One was the prominent expert in animal behavior and author of books of popular ethology Konrad Lorenz.

Bateson’s engagement with both the students and Lorenz gather together a number of by-now familiar threads: anxiety over human aggression in the aftermath of a half century of war; the threat of atomic annihilation; a disenchanted modernity. As demonstrated in Bateson’s thought and in the thought of others, the holistic impulse to heal the modern breach between nature and culture called on extrapolations from the realm of the life sciences. Efforts were made to “biologize” the problem, to fuse aesthetic and natural processes, to tap into the Freudian id. Modern civilization had taken control of nature and tamed the beast in humankind. Maybe the natural and the beast were not as bad as all that; maybe there was something in nature and the beast that was instructive, even wise. Romantic gestures disparaged the rational; instinct was favored over self-conscious inhibition. Like Bateson, Lorenz was a scientist, and rationality was his métier. At mainstream registers, however, the primary import of his message was a rehabilitation of instinct and the beast.[^2]

All threads hummed with an increasing urgency. “The question is not what is the best thing to do within the rules as they are at the moment,” Bateson had told the students in Sacramento. “The question is how can we get away from the rules within which we have been operating.” Bateson’s message to Lorenz was essentially the same. The old rules were the problem. Bateson offered some insight into the new.[^3]

### BEHAVIORISTS VERSUS INNATISTS

Could people change the rules they were playing by? Could they, to use Bateson’s analogy, recalibrate the system, get a hand on the little box on the wall? This question might be folded into the one negotiated in Reinhold Niebuhr’s and Kurt Vonnegut’s Serenity Prayer. Did rules and box fall into the category of those items requiring “the courage to change,” or of those requiring some form of graceful consent or resignation?

In the life sciences proper, echoes of these general considerations are found in postwar controversies popularly known as the nature-nurture debate. To what extent was humankind ruled by instinct, and to what extent might new ways be learned? The broad usage of the term “instinct,” then as now, suggests that it stands for a concept widely accepted: that there are unconscious “drives” that determine behavior. This, in turn, suggests the wide acceptance of Darwinist and Freudian views of nature, of the animal world, and of the human as a species of animal, over and above long-running cultural controversies between religious and scientific perspectives. To put this another way, persons who rejected evolutionary explanations of human origins and persons who recoiled from Freud’s reductionist descriptions of the structure of the human psyche still commonly used the word “instinct.” Instinct was innate, basic. But what did it consist of, exactly? Was it a material something, perhaps a chemical? Or was it more akin to a “life force”? Certainly animals were ruled by instincts, but could instinct in human animals be overcome by the “force” of human will or a civilizing culture? Then as now, most accepted the notion of instinct and rested upon conventional assumptions without wrestling with the more technical questions.[^4]

For behavioral scientists of the postwar period, however, the concepts of instinct and the innate were matters of great controversy. There was a faction who doubted whether “innate” as a description of the behaviors of living animals was any longer a useful word. It was thought that the concept of innate characteristics obscured the complexity of how any given individual developed in interaction with its environment. That development, representing the ever-present potential for change, was what was most important, believed this faction, and it was in this direction that scientific inquiry should be focused. To simplify the matter and put it in terms of a nature-nurture debate, this was the “nurture” faction. It stressed the interaction between individual and environment and had its roots in Enlightenment tabula rasa epistemology. This faction was most representative of American behavioral scientists working in the subdiscipline of comparative psychology. These behaviorists tended to do their research in laboratories with white rats and mazes, with buzzers and levers that administered electric shocks. The most well known of the behaviorists, because of his talent and passion and because of his prolific output, which included at least one successful book aimed at a readership outside the discipline, was B. F. Skinner. The book was _Walden Two_ (1948).[^5]

The nature faction was most associated with European zoology and ethology. This faction preferred to study the behavior of animals not in the experimental setting of maze and buzzer but in the wild, or at least in simulated natural habitats. Instinct and the innate were important and very real concepts to this faction, the “innatists,” because they saw in animals multiple behaviors that seemed to be inherited rather than learned, stereotypically performed, and invulnerable to further change through interaction with the environment. To the innatists, innate behaviors were as fixed as bodily organs, served social functions in the same way organs served physiological functions, and, also like the organs of the body, were equally the product of evolutionary processes. The most well known of the innatists, because of his talent and passion and because of his prodigious output, which included at least one successful book aimed at a readership outside the discipline, was the Austrian father of modern ethology, Konrad Lorenz. The book was _Erredetemitdem Vieh, den Vögeln und den Fischen_ (1949). The title, translated “He talked to animals, birds and fishes,” was a biblical reference to King Solomon. The book was published in English in 1952 as _King Solomon’s Ring_.[^6]

Not surprisingly, Bateson didn’t fit easily into either of these camps. In one sense, he was certainly a behaviorist. His study of behavior took a morphological approach, centered on the processes of learning and the insistence that living creatures were subject to continuous learning. But he despised Skinner and the positivist-materialist approach that Skinner stood for. In Bateson’s view, Skinner and the behaviorists didn’t extend their conception of learning to the laboratory context itself or to the contextual relationship between experimenter and experimentee. They didn’t take into account that contexts, not even those of the controlled laboratory, were not isolable. When innatists wanted to be disparaging, they described behaviorists as “ultra-environmentalists,” but for Bateson, it was as if the Skinnerian behaviorists were wrongheaded, and even dangerous, because they weren’t environmentalist enough.

At the same time, Bateson related to and respected Lorenz. They shared a grounding in natural history. As a student at St. John’s, Bateson had first majored in zoology; Lorenz had created modern ethology as an offshoot of zoology; and if any label at all could be applied to Bateson at present, in his current position at the Oceanic Institute, it was that of ethologist. Bateson had met Lorenz once, at a conference in upstate New York in the early 1950s. A Macy-sponsored conference, this was not one of those organized around the Wiener–von Neumann–Bateson cybernetics group but was not altogether without overlap. Bateson and others who held Lorenz in high esteem believed he could see things in animals other people couldn’t see—expressions, postures, movements—and this extended to an ability to capture them in pantomime and in pen and ink. Interspersed in the text of _King Solomon’s Ring_ were Lorenz’s own line drawings of fish, geese, and wolves. Bateson admired the book and regularly recommended it to his undergraduates.[^7]

From this unique in-between position, and in his own small way, Bateson entered into the fray between innatists and behaviorists with a letter to Lorenz in the late spring of 1966. He had just returned from his trip to California. During that same spring that he’d read _The Sword in the Stone_, he’d also read Lorenz’s recent book, _Evolution and Modification of Behavior_. This extended essay, about a hundred pages in length, was Lorenz’s defense of innate characteristics against his American behaviorist critics, a book aimed not at a general audience but at that slim group of professionals who understood the complexities of the argument.

Bateson’s letter was a warm one, with a touch in its tone of the respectful fan. Bateson reminded Lorenz that they had met years before at the conference in Ithaca. He summarized his ideas about habit formation, logical types, and “propositions about form” versus “propositions about content.” He didn’t use the term “cybernetics” but did write of systemic bias as illustrated in the home thermostat. Clearly, Bateson wished to engage Lorenz with ideas from the Macy Conferences, just as he had the students in California, this time framing them in terms relevant to Lorenz.[^8]

Also in the letter, written less than two weeks after his Sacramento lecture, is an awareness of the urgency of his audience there on the matter of action. Lorenz’s argument with the behaviorists, as Bateson put it, centered on “the degree of voluntariness” in the actions of animals. How much agency did they have, one might say, and how much was it limited? The questions parallel the students’ concerns about their own voluntary agency. For innatists like Lorenz, behaviorist resistance to the concept of innate characteristics had something of the vitalist refusal to recognize that evolution was a matter of mechanics, of the vitalist refusal to let go of Lamarckian inheritance. To engage Lorenz, Bateson had to show him, in a few short paragraphs, that he understood the issues involved, that he held information important to the argument, but that he shouldn’t be dismissed as a secret vitalist. The individual “must never be allowed to tamper with the genome,” Bateson emphasized. “The Lamarckians dream that a homeostatic circuit might change its own calibration!”—might, in other words, get a hand on the box on the wall. The students’ dreams were not so different.[^9]

### GEESE VERSUS RATS

Lorenz’s reply to Bateson’s letter was prompt and equally congenial. He didn’t recall having met Bateson at the Ithaca conference, but he’d read the letter carefully, and if he wasn’t completely accepting of Bateson’s claims, he hedged warmly. He thought Bateson’s rejection of Lamarckian inheritance lucidly put. In regard to the question of information passing from the individual organism to its genome, Lorenz thought Bateson’s phrase “tamper with” captured not only the impossibility but the danger with precision.[^10]

If Lorenz was generous with his praise, he had a reason to be. His career and influence over the world of the behavioral sciences were at their peak. His latest book would appear in English the following month under the title _On Aggression._ It would prove to be an immediate best seller and, for a time at least, recognized as a masterpiece. “Epoch-making,” the _New York Times_ pronounced it, in one of two laudatory reviews. Lorenz enclosed with his reply an advance copy of the book for Bateson.[^11]

_On Aggression_ took up where _King Solomon’s Ring_ left off. “Morals and Weapons,” the last chapter of the earlier book, was about wolves. Lorenz had reminded his readers that in human myth, wolves symbolized “cruelty and voraciousness.” They were fast and cunning and had evolved a fierce weapon in their mouths. Yet wolves rarely hurt each other, Lorenz pointed out, and when they did, it was usually accidental. Unlike the instinctive attacking and killing of prey, the instinct to attack members of one’s own species did not end in death among wolves. Certainly alpha wolves fought each other over pack dominance. But at the moment of victory, when the winner was on the verge of killing the loser, the loser rolled on its back and exposed its neck and belly. At that point, the fight was over. The winning wolf was suddenly unable to attack and was struck instead with the need to urinate. This gave the loser the chance to slink away.[^12]

Lorenz’s description of this interaction had intrigued Bateson, for it seemed to demonstrate the classic behavior patterns among the Iatmul that he had discussed in _Naven._ Symmetrical behaviors, in which aggression provoked aggression, had started the fight to begin with and brought it to its climactic conclusion. But when the losing wolf rolled over, suddenly the complementary behaviors of dominance and submission came into play. Just as the naven ritual diffused the symmetrical tensions that drove the Iatmul community toward schism, feedback mechanisms had saved the wolf community by stopping alpha wolves from destroying each other, which would have weakened the pack as a whole.

In 1952, the year _King Solomon’s Ring_ was published, readers fresh from the experience of war, anxious about human-on-human aggression, and now living under the novel conditions of the atomic age found Lorenz’s wolf material to be relevant. More than a decade later, with at least a couple of nuclear near-misses under civilization’s belt and the United States in the midst of an aggressive bombing campaign in Vietnam, Lorenz again broached the topic, this time at book length. _On Aggression_ argued that the prospect of devastating, potentially terminal destruction of the species was not representative of the “animal” or the “natural” in humankind. Freud had been a “good monist and mechanistically thinking natural scientist,” Lorenz wrote in his introduction, but his infamous “death instinct” was “unnecessary,” “false,” and “foreign to biology.” Certainly, intraspecies aggression emerged from the natural instincts for sex and territory, but its typical expression in behavior had been shaped by evolution not to snuff life out but to maintain life, to make life more efficient, more specialized, and ecologically integrated.[^13]

As Lorenz revealed it in the behavior of animals, aggression bore almost no resemblance to the massive human violence and collective extermination committed during the Age of Catastrophe. The incessant sparring, for example, of the male cichlids, with their silky, fanlike fins, was showy and ferocious, but it rarely led to serious injury. Rather, aggression in these fighting fish were behavioral displays in which the core drives of “fight and flight” within each individual found balance in an intricate dance, where all the moves were performed to the very edge of destruction but no further. “This territorial aggression” was “really a very simple mechanism of behavior-psychology,” Lorenz claimed. Behaviors redirected conflict into ritualized movements ingeniously designed by evolution’s “great constructors” (natural selection and random mutation). When competition arose over territory, aggressive behavior became “an ideal solution,” allowing animals to share that territory between them in a way “favorable to the species as a whole.”[^14]

Lorenz’s argument in _On Aggression_ turned what T. H. Huxley had called “the gladiator principle” on its head. The strong didn’t by necessity exterminate the weak and less fit, in the terms of popular Darwinism. “Even the weaker specimens,” Lorenz claimed, “can exist and reproduce, if only in a very small space.” As behaviors between wolves and between cichlids demonstrated, aggression was better understood not as a facilitator but as an inhibitor of actual violence and destruction. The climax of aggressive behavior relieved tension not only without weakening or destroying the system but often by making it more elegant and beautiful. If the movements of the cichlids could be time-condensed and solidified, one might imagine them tracing the graceful lines of some exotic flower. “What a peaceful issue of the ‘evil principle’!” Lorenz exclaimed.[^15]

If all this seemed counterintuitive to atomic age readers, Lorenz took the argument even further. Among the higher animals, where individuals related to each other as other individuals, the behavioral forms shaped by aggression served as the basis for bonding. Lorenz’s examples here were ducks and geese, and foremost the greylag goose, a species long beloved by Lorenz. Unlike the flocks of most birds, in which each individual was just another member, greylags were highly socialized. They were loyal friends, incapable of deceit, and as mates unconditionally faithful. To human eyes, their ceremonial performances, in which they bobbed and waved their long, curved necks, evoked an earnest imperiousness, both comic and noble. Lorenz had observed that the ritualized dances of aggression between greylag rivals—complex gestures of triumph and appeasement—closely resembled rituals of greeting or oft-repeated celebrations of reunion between emotionally bonded partners and friends. None of this was an accident, Lorenz claimed, but yet another expression of the ingenuity of evolution’s great constructors, protecting the survival of the genus by transforming aggression into something touching and beautiful. Rivalry became dance and dance became love.[^16]

To readers anxious about a society directed toward a constant state of war, the message of the greylag suggested that it wasn’t the beast in men that made them want to kill each other. To put this in Huxleyan terms, ethical process and cosmic process were not necessarily at odds. Men need not despair over their bestial instincts but could embrace their evolutionary birthright in the animal world. (Perhaps if we could, like Solomon, talk to the dolphins, this was what they would say.)[^17]

Alas, the data was not completely reassuring. There _were_ animals—not many, but a few—who carried out lethal, warlike assaults against each other. Bees, termites, and ants, living in massive hives and recognizing fellow members by smell, had long been known to “murder” foreign-smelling interlopers. Recent studies of rodent communities, specifically brown rats, had revealed similar patterns in mammals. Lorenz described the findings of these studies with palpable distaste: “What rats do when a member of a strange clan enters their territory or is put in there by a human experimenter is one of the most horrible and repulsive things which can be observed in animals.” Once the smell of the alien was detected, the information traveled through the colony “like an electric shock,” via body language—angry, bulging eyes or hair standing on end—or via “sharp, shrill, satanic” cries which were “taken up by all members of the tribe.” Lorenz termed this process “mood transmission.” The intruder, running in desperation, never defending itself, typically died of shock and exhaustion, if not “slowly torn to pieces by its fellows.”[^18]

This was, Lorenz wrote, an expression of “group hate,” of “evil, in the real sense of the word.” How was one to read the design of evolution’s great constructors here? Lorenz didn’t rule out a discovery of some “species-preserving function.” Perhaps the evolution of rats into highly skilled “murder-specialists” gave advantages to those clans with greater populations. Perhaps this served some “spatial distribution” or defense of offspring. But it didn’t appear so, Lorenz admitted. As a scientist, he had to be willing to accept the possibility of a “diabolical invention” that served “no purpose” at all. He confessed that the prospect disturbed him. Evolutionary processes sometimes produced pathological detours where “demented competition” took over. Lorenz’s recourse, again and again, to the vocabulary of religion and mental illness is telling. The great constructors weren’t always so elegant, presumably. This undercut the general argument elsewhere. The great constructors weren’t always good.[^19]

### ANTS VERSUS GEESE

Any readers of _On Aggression_ who, like Bateson, had recently read or remembered reading T. H. White’s _The Sword in the Stone_ may have noted the similarities in the two works, the one of scientific fact, the other of fiction. As a tutor to the Wart, Merlyn’s pedagogical method amplifies the benefits of Lorenz-style ethology to the highest imaginable degree. Through some sort of magic that has been meted out to him (why or from what source he is unaware), Merlyn is able to transform the Wart into various animals. He turns the Wart into a fish, a falcon, an owl, a goose. Thus, with only a few bits of advice from Merlyn to aid him, the Wart learns not from books or even from mere observation but from intense personal experience.

Wart’s experiences in animal form are conditioned by the shape of his body, its particular facilities and limitations, as well as by the social relations of whatever species among which he finds himself. Each experience offers a lesson. Old Jack, the King fish—“remorseless, disillusioned, logical, predatory”— with “his American expression, like that of Uncle Sam,” gives the Wart a glimpse of the despotism that comes of absolute power. “Only Might is Right,” the old fish tells him. From the birds of prey kept hooded in the mews, the Wart sees the toll that confinement and militarist conformism takes on sanity. Although he doesn’t know this himself, the Wart is in training to become a commander in chief. The pathologies of power and hierarchic militarism that he experiences in the animal world are precisely those he will strive to moderate with his transformative notions of chivalry and the round table, taken up in the latter parts of the _Once and Future King_ series.[^20]

This is a work written very much in the thick of the Age of Catastrophe and in the sober mood of its aftermath. In a section White added in his 1958 revision, the Wart is transformed into a goose, and the lessons this experience offers are the ones Lorenz would later draw from his greylag material. The Wart’s life with the geese exposes him to the grace and peacefulness of a nomadic species, with no claim on territory, no property laws, no oppressive order enforced from above. Among the geese, order has an aesthetic base and manifests itself in the graceful movements of their swanlike necks. They have “a comradeship, free discipline and _joie de vivre_.” When the Wart is posted as sentry and he broaches to his goose companion the spectacle of war, she doesn’t understand at first. When she does, she’s revolted. “What a horrible mind you have!” she tells him. “Of course there are sentries. There are the jer-falcons and the peregrines, aren’t there: the foxes and the ermines and the humans with their nets? These are natural enemies. But what creature could be so low as to go about in bands, to murder others of its own blood?”[^21]

The Wart is never transformed into a brown rat, but again in scenes added to the 1958 revision, he does live as a worker ant who is called to war against an alien colony. In what White clearly intends as a warning of the existential horrors of totalitarianism, he gives the Wart a frightening, nauseating experience of collectivism. “Everything Not Forbidden is Compulsory,” a sign above the ant cave reads. Orders from the queen are transmitted to the Wart and his fellow ants by some incessant, pulse-like music—a version of Lorenz’s “mood transmission”—which makes Wart “feel sick inside.” The Wart’s first duty as a worker ant is to produce “mash” for feeding, but when a rival ant colony (“Other”) is identified, the Wart begins to receive a new broadcast. It consists of a series of propositions that echo the paradoxes of nuclear deterrence and the logic of a first strike: “We must attack them in self-defense.” “They are attacking us by defending themselves.” “If we do not attack them today, they will attack us tomorrow.”[^22]

The Wart’s horrifying experience as an ant takes place between the glass plates of the ant farm in Merlyn’s room. Just as the battle breaks out, Merlyn “magicked” the nauseous Wart “back to bed, and glad enough he was to be there.” Magic is not only possible in White’s novel; it is met by the novel’s characters without surprise. The world of Merlyn and the Wart is a medieval one, prior to the Cartesian-Newtonian paradigm, and not yet drained by modernity of its enchantment.[^23]

### A SIREN TO BE FEARED

The charming prose of T. H. White’s fantasy fiction and of Lorenz’s popular science aside, these books spoke to the same anxieties of the postwar period and put before their readers the same questions: Were human beings more like geese, or were they more like ants and rats? And if indeed they were more like rats, could they change their instincts and become more geese-like? In common also between the two books was that the analogy itself was based in a naturalist extrapolation. Insofar as Westerners might, in terms of their social order, emulate the goose or avoid the rat, the moral content was biologized. Each proposed a moral sanction in nature, shaped by and found immanent in the natural world. The underlying premise contained a romantic touch that challenged the old Huxleyan dichotomy. Ethical process and cosmic process were not necessarily at odds, at least not when it came to geese.

It is here, however, where a few distinctions between White and Lorenz can be drawn. For White, Arthur’s fight is a fight against barbarism, whether Hitlerite or Stalinist, and his challenge as Arthur the future king is to build and protect an advanced order of civilization. He has seen the ugly and the beautiful, and he will strive to use his power to effect the latter. He has that agency. For Lorenz, beauty was not shaped by human agency but by the great constructors of evolution, and advanced human civilization worked at cross-purposes to the great constructors’ skills. Civilization buffered the pressures of natural selection, and this is what allowed instinctual drives to run off aimlessly and get lost in “diabolical,” purposeless design.

Human destructiveness, especially as revealed in the two world wars, was just such an example of an aggressive drive “derailed under conditions of civilization,” as Lorenz put it. Sheltered by these conditions, drives were free to find expression without the simultaneous development of adaptive inhibitors that stop the victorious wolf from tearing out the throat of his rival. When a missile was fired from miles away, the artilleryman could not see the submissive behaviors of his enemies, behaviors that might have given him pause. As Lorenz saw it, the instinct to fight over territory in humans flourished all out of proportion to natural necessity, without the development of instinctive inhibitors that would transform this fight into sharing. Instead the instinct threatened what it might have saved: the ongoing viability of the species as a whole.[^24]

One can see the appeal in this thinking to a romantic sensibility, a reading of moral values into the mechanisms of nature over and against civilization as the corruptor and “derailer” of those mechanisms. This had been the sort of thinking that had always gotten Lorenz into trouble. As a talented young scientist in the early 1930s, eager to make a name for himself and to secure a position that would fund research, Lorenz wrote papers advancing what was later called his “domestication theory.” Wild geese were much more beautiful than geese raised in captivity, he had observed, and not only geese but other animals, too. Worse still, it was not only that animals got uglier under conditions of domestication, but they got uglier in the same way: flabby muscles, pug faces, bowed legs, pot bellies.[^25]

The human species, too, Lorenz had argued in the 1930s, suffered the same lessening of beauty and grace under the effects of civilization. Their chins became weaker, their faces and bellies more pudgy and round. As form degenerated, so did ethics. In urban settings, sexual selection and behaviors were skewed, wrongheaded, or overblown, like the feathers of the argus pheasant, extravagant to the point of farce. Thinking like this was friendly to eugenics and came perilously close to “race hygiene.” The Austrian scientific community, still in the sway of Jesuit scholarship and its antimaterialist and vitalist preferences, did not look favorably on Lorenz’s hard-shell Darwinism. Scientists and would-be policy makers sympathetic to National Socialist philosophy, however, welcomed Lorenz’s thesis, and as the Nazis took power in the 1930s, Lorenz’s professional prospects improved.[^26]

The long-awaited research post came, but then shortly after, so did the war. Lorenz was conscripted to western Poland, territory claimed by Hitler as _Lebensraum_. This was a matter of “living space,” in other words—just as with the fighting cichlids. In Poland Lorenz saw firsthand the enforced segregation, the rounding-up of Gypsies and Jews, and the systematic robbing of the Polish intelligentsia. This was when he realized, he later claimed, what the Nazis were really up to and renounced them.

Of course this claim became important once Lorenz’s star again rose after the war. The question became not only when and whether he renounced the Nazis’ actions but also whether he acknowledged how his domestication theory and other scientific writings endorsed Nazi ideology. Had he, even in some small way, given intellectual support to the pseudoscientific edifice of Nordic supremacy? “I never had been a Nazi at all,” Lorenz would assure sponsors such as Julian Huxley in the years after the war; he was “only fighting for the theory of evolution.” This became the basis for Lorenz’s defense: a mixture of devotion to scientific principle and political naïveté. In Lorenz’s case, that proved to be enough. He was too important, his talent too immense. To shut him out as a Nazi sympathizer would be to doom the fledgling field of ethology. By the 1960s, with Lorenz’s successes, his rehabilitation was largely complete.[^27]

Among Lorenz’s behaviorist critics, however, he and his theories were still suspect. The American Daniel Lehrman had led the charge a decade earlier. Lehrman attacked Lorenz’s strict dichotomy between innate and learned behaviors and accused Lorenz of being too quick to rest in fixed entities. Lehrman was a Jew, and present but unspoken in his challenge to Lorenz was the charge that Lorenz failed to think critically about his own moral assumptions, in the present as in the past. “Lorenz’s motives are, to himself, inaccessible,” wrote another critic in an unsympathetic review of _King Solomon’s Ring_. Again, Lorenz came under attack for failing to recognize the complexity of the matters involved. But the real indictment was in the review’s title: “Behold, My Child, the Nordic Dog.”[^28]

Even supporters and admirers had advised Lorenz to stick to what he was good at, observation and description, and to steer away from philosophical extrapolations. Their wariness is understandable. A morality extrapolated from a Darwinian chain of causation potentially trumped conventional codes of ethics that regulated personal conduct and social relations. It was a short step from a biologized ethics to a biologized body politic, a step that the Nazis had taken. Of course Hitler was far from the first to view war as a helpmeet to evolutionary processes, as a way to improve both physique and moral character. This sort of thinking had supplied much of the intellectual impetus behind the Great War. Hitler had only taken these sorts of calculations to further extremes.[^29]

But what was the Age of Catastrophe if not a lifting, for a few decades, of civilization’s shelter and the full exposure of massive populations to “selection pressure,” as Lorenz put it? For those who believed that the political disasters of the twentieth century were fueled by a overrunning of romantic fervor, the prospect of a biologized morality was irresponsible and dangerous. Just as T. H. Huxley had warned, the age-old desire to find a moral sanction in nature was dangerous. People like Lorenz needed to be watched. This was what the historian Charles Gillispie meant, in his exchange with Bateson over competing perspectives on science and nature. The holistic, romantic vision was “a siren to be feared.”[^30]

### _MONA LISA_’S SMILE

It’s hard to imagine that Bateson was unaware of Lorenz’s Nazi taint, but he likely saw it as a trivial distraction. Bateson’s distaste for scientific application, his contempt for the nationalization of science, and his belief in the wrongheadedness of the romantic-materialist divide are by now well established. If asked about Lorenz and the danger of the siren of romanticism, his response might well have echoed his response to Gillispie: “I see it as a choice between _two_ sirens,” between the Democritan’s tendency to mistake concepts for fixed realities and the Heraclitan’s tendency to let the possibility of anything fixed in reality “be carried away by that river into which no man can step twice.” Bateson, as he had told Gillispie, was “tired” of the insistence that the two views were incompatible. Both sides were right, both sides were wrong, and without the new Macy-inspired ideas, neither could see exactly how.[^31]

For Bateson, this was likely the best thing to say about the innatist-behaviorist debate, as well. What was it, after all, but a subdisciplinary version of the same larger epistemological argument that had been going on in Western thought from the beginning? Bateson had made the point in the epilogue he wrote for the 1958 edition of _Naven_. The Macy material, whether it was properly called cybernetics or something else, offered “a new structuring of the balance” between the Democritans and the Heraclitans. This was why he reached out to Lorenz to begin with, to intervene in this matter, to offer ideas that spoke to problems important to both of them. Bateson sought out “top minds” as “sparring partners,” and he considered Lorenz a top mind.[^32]

_On Aggression_ emphasized again how much they shared in common. Lorenz was another Merlyn type, an inveterate animal keeper, comfortable in the out-of-doors, a naturalist at heart, with his open collar and kindly squint, his unkempt bush of hair and snow-white chin beard. Like Bateson, Lorenz was disdainful of Skinnerian lab work. As for moral extrapolation, Bateson, too, ranged widely and was relatively unrestrained. In some synthesis of the sciences and the humanities, both saw a desirable end. It was clear to Bateson that _On Aggression_ was a work of great coherence, erudite but accessible, and in touch, no less than the discontented students, with the postwar zeitgeist: How was the wolf to survive?

In answer to this question, T. H. White, like Huxley, called for better civilization and a stronger ethical process to provide a better sheltering from an amoral cosmos. According to Lorenz’s argument, in contrast, sheltering from the great constructors led to moral decay and uninhibited, purposeless destruction. It was domestication that made people into unfeeling killers. What was the solution, then? Lorenz’s answer was unsurprising but ultimately fuzzy. He urged a better grasp and acceptance of the Darwinist “chain of natural causation.” A better understanding of instinctive drives under the conditions of natural selection, he claimed, could “endow our moral responsibility with the power to control” those drives. But what did that “control” mean, if not more civilization, more shelter? There is truth in the critique that Lorenz was uncritical if not out of touch with his own motivations.[^33]

By falling back on the old faith that better knowing led to better control, Lorenz seemed to get himself into something of a bind. And this was also where Bateson knew that he and Lorenz differed. In a July 1966 letter, Bateson thanked Lorenz for sending his book. “There is so much that I agree with and the subject is so important that it is almost a duty to state criticisms,” he added. One point of agreement was on Freud and the death instinct. “Of course” it was “nonsense,” Bateson wrote. When all life processes were explained by innate desires below the level of consciousness, a desire for death was implied as a corollary. The death instinct was therefore “the _reductio ad absurdum_ of the whole system.”[^34]

But there was a moment, Bateson suggested to Lorenz, when Freud may have been truly innovative, a moment—recorded in the Fleiss letters, Bateson thought he recalled—when Freud was struggling to put his theory into words. Freud had hesitated on how to describe those unconscious inner motivators, pausing between “something like energy” and “something like spatial patterning.” He decided on “energy.” Thus he used the German word _Trieben_, which might be translated as “pushes” or “drives.” _Trieben_ fit well into the paradigm of Newtonian physics. _Trieben_ could be understood as physically interacting with other _Trieben_, pushing up against them, some stronger than others. Strengths implied quantity, and quantitative explanations were always tempting to those social scientists who wished to partake of the authority of physics. The result of Freud’s choice, however, was to leave out much biological phenomena that the logic of pushes and measurements left unexplained. Bateson offered Lorenz an example of such phenomena: “the Mona Lisa.” Bateson chose his example from the realm of art, but he might have chosen one from religion, from humor, or perhaps from schizophrenia, since these were realms within which human beings negotiated their deepest paradoxes and binds. The move was similar to one Bateson had made in his Sacramento lecture. A science that could speak about _Mona Lisa_’s smile was the same sort of science that could “sometimes know right from wrong.”[^35]

Bateson mailed the letter with a copy of _Naven_. Again Lorenz wrote back, quickly and with warm interest. He took the _Mona Lisa_ reference in stride. Both were enjoying the back and forth. With his next reply, Bateson sent an essay he had written three years before, just as he was leaving Palo Alto to go and work at the Lilly facilities, and placed in the journal _Evolution._ It was one Bateson was particularly proud of, and he sent it out quite a lot, from a stack of reprints he kept in his office. Because it spoke directly to the basic problems he and Lorenz were discussing, it was likely what Bateson had wanted to send Lorenz all along. His first letter to Lorenz used some of the essay’s language and imagery. But he had waited until now to send the whole piece. To a committed Darwinist like Lorenz, “The Role of Somatic Change in Evolution” could be off-putting to the point of dismissal. But if it compelled, it might do so at a radical level. Perhaps now the ground was prepared.  

## Eight: The Good Son

Bateson liked to refer to the essay he sent to Konrad Lorenz, “The Role of Somatic Change in Evolution,” as an act of filial piety. Understanding that statement requires not only a close look at the essay but also a consideration of the final stage of his father’s life and career. In “The Role of Somatic Change in Evolution,” Bateson took on some of the most fundamental problems in William Bateson’s field of expertise, evolutionary biology. In the essay, he mounted a challenge to the theory of evolution as conventionally understood, and in doing so, he justified and embraced his father’s legacy.[^1]

The legacy referred to here is not the one that rose out of W. B.’s insight into Mendel on that fateful train ride in the year 1900, four years before Gregory was born. That legacy didn’t require justification. Genetics, the field of study W. B. had fought to establish and had named, was so entrenched it reached even into elementary school curriculums. Rather, the part that required justification was what Gregory must have considered his father’s true legacy—associated with W. B.’s book _Materials for the Study of Variation Treated with Especial Regard to Discontinuity in the Origin of Species,_ published to no acclaim in 1894, and with W. B.’s quixotic opposition to the concept of chromosomes after the Great War. It was the part that linked him with nineteenth-century anti-Darwinists such as Samuel Butler, that placed him outside the circle of conventional thinking, and that branded him by some as a heretic. Attacks on Konrad Lorenz for naive and uncritical moral extrapolation were not so different from those W. B. had received. Both were framed by the old debate between materialists and romantics.

Seven years had passed since Bateson had written in his letter to the Princeton historian Charles Gillispie that he was “tired” of that debate. Now, in the spring of 1966, the Sacramento students still on his mind and the cultivation of Lorenz ongoing, it was as if being tired of the old debate would no longer do. If Bateson’s overall objective—with both the students and with Lorenz—was to bring the many threads of his thought together into some sort of productive culmination, perhaps confronting the debate was what culmination would require. “I continue to combine communication theory with evolution,” he had written to his old friend Nora Barlow seven days before he wrote Lorenz. Bateson’s efforts to reach out to Lorenz thus occurred in the immediate context of these efforts to embrace and further his father’s legacy. That legacy was an intellectual one, but not entirely so. It touched on unfinished emotional business, as well.[^2]

### THE SPLENDID AND PURIFYING PURPOSE

The weeks and months following Martin Bateson’s suicide in 1922 were terrible for his parents. W. B. and Beatrice had grim business to attend to—the body, the inquest, the clarification of events, the sorting through and disposing of Martin’s effects while painfully sorting through their own emotional inventory. Suicide in some general way is an act of rebellion against life itself, and those most touched by such an act can be thrown back on first principles. For Martin’s parents there was also the question of reading into what he had done a message of recrimination. What had Martin needed that they had not supplied? How might they have done better? Not surprisingly, much of their attention, concern, and hopes for the future now turned toward Gregory, their last surviving son. Gregory was nearly eighteen. He would soon be going to Cambridge himself.[^3]

In a letter to Gregory, written the day after Martin’s death, W. B. confronted many of these difficulties—the return to first principles, the explanations and self-accusations, and the sudden focus on his youngest son—all in a few remarkable paragraphs. Of all the questions that could not be answered, this much was clear to W. B.: Martin’s loss was of a piece with John’s. “Looking back,” W. B. wrote, “I can see that Martin had a certain instability—not much but a little. If John had lived, possibly [it would have been] enough that the two together would have got to work and the interest which I feel sure they both genuinely had in science would have steadied Martin through trouble. What exactly had been happening to him we don’t know, but it seems that he had looked for affection where it could not be returned, and in sudden melancholy he did this. He had lost faith in science and also his old confidence in us, as so often happens when a young man grows up and has nothing to steady him through.” The implication here concerned Gregory. He was now a young man. What would he do when _he_ needed something to “steady him through”?[^4]

W. B. granted that from time to time, “almost all human hearts” suffered existential despair and were tempted to “question whether anything is worth doing.” But unlike most, men of science, the Batesons—“people like us”—had an edge. Men of science were less tempted by despair and less in need of a distracting “stimulant,” unlike the “common man” who “craves it all the time.” “_The faith in great work is the nearest to religion that I have ever got_,” W. B. wrote, underlining his words, “_and it supplies what religious people get from superstition_.” The pursuit of art, W. B. conceded, was great work, too. In fact, compared to science, it was “perhaps greater still.” This was where Martin had strayed. His move from science to art had “come from weakness not strength.” W. B. wondered if he might have tried harder to change Martin’s mind but believed that “such an attempt would have been too late.”[^5]

Here W. B. was reassuring himself, justifying past actions, perhaps staving off doubts. Here was another implication aimed at Gregory, as well—for Gregory it was _not_ too late. If the pursuit of great art was “for the rarest” and “scarcely in the reach of people like ourselves,” W. B. was “certain” that science “comes next and that is well within our reach, at least I am sure it is within yours.” Science was, W. B. reiterated, “the splendid and purifying purpose into which you can always withdraw in the periods of suffering that every man must pass through.”[^6]

This was surely heartfelt advice, but in giving it, W. B. had also folded Martin’s tragedy into W. B.’s own existential calculation. Without John to support his faith in science, without science to support his will to live, Martin no longer knew who he was. In this vulnerable state, he had stepped out of his proper place—science, “our niche,” as W. B. had previously characterized it—and into the sacred realm of art. Art was sublime—at least the Mozart (but not Beethoven) type of which W. B. approved. Its creation was out of the reach of anyone but the angelic geniuses of a previous age. Yet he placed pure science in the second-tier position and claimed it as the Batesons’ turf. This gave himself, and now Gregory, a “splendid and purifying purpose,” a reason to live above the superstitions and endless cravings of the common man. At the same time, it protected him, and now Gregory, from the dangers of overreach. It was a narrow existential strip on which to stand, a neat trick W. B. had worked out for himself and his sons, but which Martin, feeling squeezed, couldn’t manage. When Bateson, writing to the historian Stephen Heims in 1970, associated his brothers’ problems “and my own” with the double-bind hypothesis, this was surely the squeeze he had in mind.[^7]

But if Martin couldn’t manage, W. B. faltered, too. Bateson was reminded of this in the fall of 1966, as a number of letters began to arrive from the Johns Hopkins historian William Coleman. After years of working on his paper about W. B., now Coleman was getting to the nitty-gritty. He was asking about the final years of W. B.’s life, during which he “collapsed into obscurities” and both his health and reputation were diminished. Yes, Gregory would explain to Coleman, his father had “devoted” his remaining years to publicly “nourishing . . . a viper in his bosom.” The public “nourishing” was his resistance, in a number of papers and public pronouncements, to the idea of chromosomes as the transmitters of hereditary material. Since chromosomes and genes were part of the same atomistic approach to understanding heredity, W. B.’s opposition amounted to a kind of recantation of much of the work he had done for the last twenty years. This put him again on the fringes of accepted scientific opinion. The “viper in his bosom” was the viper of regret, that W. B. had let his success in Mendel draw him away from his most cherished insights, the glimpses of spatial patterning in biological forms.[^8]

To put this in the terms of W. B.’s letter to Gregory after Martin’s death, it was as if science—or at least the genetic science W. B. pioneered—had proved lacking as an antidote to despair, as a substitute religion, and W. B. had wandered off, a heretic still seeking the true faith. Was the wandering aimless? Or had it led somewhere, in Gregory? When Bateson asked himself, as he had of late, whether anyone was listening to him after all these years, he was asking himself some version of that question. In his lecture at Sacramento, as well as his reaching out to Lorenz, Bateson was attempting to answer.

### LAMARCK RECODED

In “The Role of Somatic Change in Evolution,” Bateson addressed Lamarckian inheritance, the wheel upon which his father’s career turned. The appeal of Lamarckian inheritance to a certain kind of scientist was that it made space in a theory of evolution for teleology. It made space for the intentionality and purposive intelligence that seemed evident in the symmetry, elegance, and efficacy of form. When, by the 1890s, the German biologist August Weismann showed that the environmental changes to the cells of the body had no effect on a cell’s “hereditary substance,” thus disproving the inheritance of acquired characteristics, that space disappeared. Bateson knew W. B. had never been, as some critics assumed, a stubborn Lamarckian vitalist. Yet W. B. still pursued an explanation for form. Darwinian mechanics were brilliant but inadequate. Purpose, intention, intelligence, the unmeasurable phenomena of the _Mona Lisa_’s smile—Darwinism left too much unaccounted for. Thus, as Gregory would describe it, Lamarckian inheritance became for W. B. the “tabooed pot of jam” he wasn’t allowed to dip his hand into, and whenever the topic was mentioned in the household, “the coffee cups rattled on the table.” Lamarckian inheritance wasn’t possible. Yet, in some sense, it had to be true. Gregory’s essay “The Role of Somatic Change in Evolution” made a case for what that sense might be.[^9]

He began it with a basic question: What did a theory of evolution have to explain? It had to provide, he answered, for three types of change:

1. change in the genotype (usually understood as being caused by random mutation);

2. change in the conditions of a given environment; and

3. change in the body, or “soma,” under the pressure of genotypic or environmental changes.

In addition, the accounting for these changes needed to be rendered as “an on-going process,” which through natural selection would provide for the natural history of a species. Finally, the theory had to do all this without resorting to Lamarckian inheritance. The Weismann barrier between somatic variation and the cells’ hereditary substance, Bateson insisted, held true. The genotype could transmit information to the individual body, but it didn’t work the other way around.[^10]

Bateson’s innovation was to recode the Weismann barrier in terms of the new Macy-inspired fundamentals. The genotype could determine, for example, the potential for an individual to tan. But the actual tanning of any given individual was a result of an instance of real-time exposure to the sun. Stated in Macy’s terms, the genotype was a statement of truth about range of variability, not an observable instance of actual variability. The statement and the instance were two logical types, class and member, the first more abstract than the second. Truth statement and instance were two circuits running on different time sequences, the first generational, the second real-time, the second circuit nesting within the first in a logical, class-member relationship. Restated with the parsimonious rigor of cybernetic logic, the Weismann barrier meant that “the principles which order phenomena shall not themselves be supposed changed by those phenomena which they order.”[^11]

Having summed up the requirements of a theory of evolution (the three types of change, the continuous process) and then accounted for the Weismann barrier in cybernetic terms, Bateson made his first claim. The relations between the three types of change could be understood in budgetary terms. Both genotype and environmental changes exacted a “price” that any given body had to pay. Payment was made in a reduction of flexibility. The soma was flexible only within a certain range, and any demands made on it by genetic mutation or environmental stress would consume a portion of that range. If and when the budget was depleted, the individual was dead.[^12]

Bateson called this an economics of somatic flexibility. An economics of flexibility was different from the more familiar economics of subtraction. Bateson described the difference largely through mathematics, but one might consider the difference by way of illustration. A grocery bill of $150 and a utility bill of $150 reduce the dollars in a bank account by equal amounts. That’s a simple economics of subtraction. An economics of flexibility is reduced, not by measurable units, like dollars, but by capacities of range. Suppose a person climbed a mountain. That placed a demand on his body’s respiratory capacity. So he sat under a tree to rest. Suppose then a poisonous spider landed on his shoulder. He would probably survive these dual demands on his flexibility budget. He could continue to rest, to restore his respiratory capacity, while sitting perfectly still until the spider crawled away. But suppose, when he reached the mountaintop and sat down to rest, not a spider but a tiger appeared. Sitting still was no longer adequate to meet the current demand. It was necessary now to run. The tiger demand and the spider demand, in other words, were not like two equal bills. The price now demanded (running from the tiger, a demand on the lungs) was not taken out of some general account but out of the lung debt already owed from the climb.[^13]

Thus, Bateson’s economics of flexibility was not subtractive but “multiplicative.” To make a demand on an economics of flexibility was to “fractionate” the account, depending on what form of behavior was demanded. Variability of form (whether behavioral or material) was not quantifiable into units like dollars, and thus one called-for variation was not equal to another, as are $150 grocery and utility bills, even if these demands for variation arrived on the same day. A called-for somatic variation didn’t simply subtract, in interchangeable units (dollars, calories, kilowatts), from the overall range of somatic flexibility. It divided that budget into ever-smaller subranges of possibility. The person facing the tiger demand might have outrun the tiger had he not been winded from the climb.[^14]

The called-for demands on the flexibility of the soma didn’t even have to appear to be threatening. A marked abundance of available food, for example, due to some seemingly advantageous environmental change, would rule out “stunted” growth patterns in a community of individuals. But if concurrent genotypic mutation was _demanding_ that growth be stunted, then the individuals who possessed that mutation, feasting and counting themselves lucky, were in very serious trouble, indeed.[^15]

This was the point of criticism Bateson had tried to communicate to Lorenz about Freud’s _Trieben_ error. Freud assumed a Newtonian energy economics, a subtractive economics of kilowatts or money. This basic error of perception and representation had sent Freud down a false road at the very start of his journey. It would have been impolitic for Bateson, in his communication with Lorenz, to extend this criticism to Darwin, but Bateson’s belief was that Darwin had taken the same false road. Darwinists _also_ assumed a Newtonian subtractive economics of energy. Darwinists hadn’t accounted for fractionization. Did this mean that conventional evolutionary theory was in error? It would have been likewise impolitic to make so blunt a claim to Lorenz. But in the essay, Bateson did so, without fanfare: “According to these considerations, if evolution proceeded in accordance with conventional theory, its process would be blocked.” An evolution could not be ongoing “_only_ from externally adaptive genotypic changes since these must, in combination, become lethal, demanding combinations of internal somatic adjustments of which the soma is incapable.”[^16]

The conventional theory of evolution provided for the three types of change, and it took the necessary Weismann barrier into account. But in view of the economics of flexibility, the conventional theory did _not_ provide for an explanation of how these factors could be rendered as a continuous process. Successive withdrawals from the flexibility budget “must, in combination, become lethal.” It wasn’t that the tiger demand was bigger than the spider demand. It wasn’t that the demand for stunted growth was bigger or smaller than the demand that people eat less of what was currently abundant. It was that these demands came in combination and thus fractionated the finite range of somatic adjustment. Since these combinations were inevitable, there had to be something else going on. Alone, Lorenz’s great constructors, natural selection and random mutation, could not build anything to last.

### A WISE LEGISLATOR

If the conventional model of evolution was untenable, Bateson proposed a better model. To provide for a continuous process, a “balanced theory of evolution” would require genotypic changes that did not fractionate but increased “the available range of somatic flexibility.” If the great constructors fractionated the “total range of living states” for any given individual, something had to “compensate for this limitation.” What might do so?[^17]

Before Bateson could answer that question, he again had to recode the problem into cybernetic terms. The illustration Bateson drew on next is similar to the one employed above to understand the economics of flexibility: a respiratory adjustment to high altitude. When a person who lived in a low altitude came to a high altitude, she panted and her heart raced. This somatic response resulted in a temporary reduction in flexibility. If she stayed long enough at the higher altitude, however, her body would eventually acclimate, restoring some of the lost flexibility. Acclimation was thus a boon to the flexibility budget. Bateson called this a “defense in depth.” Now came the recoding: “A similar ‘defense in depth’ is clearly recognizable in the field of behavior. When we encounter a new problem for the first time, we deal with it either by trial and error or possibly by insight. Later, and more or less gradually, we form the ‘habit’ of acting in the way which earlier experience rewarded. To continue to use insight or trial and error upon this class of problem would be wasteful. These mechanisms can now be saved for _other_ problems.” This was learning theory and habit formation, which he had worked out in essays from the 1940s and 1950s, and for anyone (and there weren’t many) familiar with Bateson’s ideas, the correspondences now ran fast and thick. Panting and heartbeat were trial and error, were Learning 1. Acclimation was habit formation, was deutero-learning, was Learning 2. “Defense in depth” was “learning to learn.”[^18]

Recall, however, the class-member relationship between Learning 1 and Learning 2. Learning 2 was Learning 1 sunk deeper, was meta-learning. This step gave acclimation, habit, and Learning 2 their relatively fixed quality. This was, in turn, why pain was typically involved in the sudden challenge to acclimation, when, say, the altitude change occurred rapidly, or when a truth formerly trusted proved untrustworthy.

Once again, differentiation between time sequences was crucial. How long did it take information of the change to travel around the circuit? Changes at Learning 1 occurred in real time and thus were easily reversible, whereas changes in acclimation were slower and took more time to reverse. The more deeply sunk the habit, the harder it was to break. Thus, the behavioral adjustments at the level of trial and error were in a sense _protective_ of the more fixed and abstract truths at the level of Learning 2, habit, and acclimation. The more deeply sunk the habit, the more decisive the time differential, which was to say, the more wide-ranging—and potentially chaotic—any attempt at reversal would be to the system as a whole.

This was the point Bateson had emphasized in his first letter to Lorenz. Real-time experiments in trial and error could not be allowed to _tamper with_ generation-time truths. “The Lamarckians dream that a homeostatic circuit might change its own calibration!” Information circuits and their relative time sequences had to be respected, to protect the greater system from chaos. There was something here, too, of what Bateson had tried to convey to the students in Sacramento, when he’d spoken of the setting of the thermostat on the wall. The weather would change, the yes-no of the furnace would oscillate, but the setting would “not be changed by those changes.” Between the rules and the ruled, too, at least at some level, there was a Weismann barrier.[^19]

Were the rules, then, not changeable? Were those deepest rules governing the human condition—hungers, cravings; tendencies for and against aggression; being more like geese or more like rats—subject to human modification? Or were they among those realities to which human beings had to be resigned? The discontented youths dreamed of changing their own calibration. “But what can we do?” Carl Oglesby had asked in anguish. “Our system exists. One is swept up into it.”[^20]

Genetic tampering, self-calibration—these were not possible, and even if they were, it would be too dangerous. The barrier had to be accounted for. And yet there was still the problem of random mutation and of constant challenges present in the environment in fractionating and lethal combinations. If all this were true, if this were an accurate description of conditions, then how could evolution be continuous? This was the question Bateson had left hanging. How might “the available range of somatic flexibility” be increased?[^21]

The essay turned on the issue of reversibility. Environmental stress called for somatic variations. In order for the variation (the provisional truth, the habit, the bit of learning) to remain reversible, informational pathways had to be open and at the ready. Pathways had to remain occupied not only to induce the variation but also to stop inducing it, when a reversal was called for. Thus long-term reversibility was uneconomical. It stressed a system, fractionated its economics of flexibility, overloaded its circuits. The system would eventually break down, unless the variation was fixed by a genotypic resetting of the system’s bias in a way that did not stress the system further but restored its range of flexibility.

The only way to restore flexibility to those circuits would be to eliminate, at the level of genotype, the reversibility of the somatically achieved variation: to sink, in other words, the habit deeper still. This proposed change was a change of another order. It was a change not in the phenomena but in the principles that order phenomena. It was not a change in any given instance of oscillation within a range but a fixing of the range itself. That was what irreversibility meant: the setting of bias, of a Weismann-like protective barrier between genotype and organism, across which information would not be allowed.

To protect against chaotic repercussions, however, this genotypic resetting could not be an innovative one but one that affirmed the variations the soma had already achieved. Again, the resetting being described here was not caused by the soma. That was self-calibration, that was Lamarckian inheritance—that was impossible. Bateson’s claim, rather, was that a theory of evolution, taking all the types of change into account, could be rendered continuous “if there were a class of mutations or other genotypic changes which would simulate Lamarckian inheritance. The function of these changes would be to achieve by genotypic fiat those characteristics which the organism at the given time is already achieving by the uneconomical model of somatic change.”[^22]

Simulated Lamarckian inheritance, genotypic fiat—Bateson compared these processes to that of “wise” social legislation. There was no telling what sorts of chaos might be unleashed by the sudden, random imposition of an innovative law from above. It would spread through the system willy-nilly, affecting unpredictable and potentially lethal changes of all kinds. But “the wise legislator will only rarely initiate a new rule of behavior; more usually he will confine himself to affirming in law that which has already become the custom of the people.” Biologically and systemically speaking, when the legislative affirmation was passed, all those informational pathways that had been working to sustain the adjustment would then be freed up to meet new demands. The fiat would mean a “bonus of somatic flexibility.”[^23]

It would be difficult, Bateson admitted, to test this theory of simulated Lamarckian inheritance via wise legislation. Since the genotypic fiat affirmed something that had already been achieved somatically, that fiat would almost always be invisible. How could a scientist separate where the cause was genotypic from where it was an instance of somatic variation? The best proof, in a sense, was in the very fact that evolution was ongoing, despite the constant demands of environmental stress and random mutation.[^24]

Thus the “bonus of somatic flexibility” that allowed evolution to continue, that restored an individual’s range of flexibility, that was conferred by the genotypic fiat of simulated Lamarckian inheritance, was—to speak metaphorically—a sort of blessing. It was a blessing not triggered from some lower mechanics but bestowed from above—a restorative blessing, perhaps unprovable except in theory, a blessing hidden from sight. The individual organism couldn’t tamper with its own genome and pass that tampering down to its children, not without unleashing unpredictable chaos. Yet its real-time efforts might be affirmed, as if by some greater intelligence, as if by a wise legislator.[^25]

### THE MYSTERY OF FORM

It is doubtful that Konrad Lorenz read Bateson’s essay at the metaphorical level suggested in the paragraph above. Neither did Bateson encourage this sort of reading. Bateson was, he liked to say, a third-generation atheist. He wasn’t trying to persuade Lorenz to entertain a belief in some wise legislating God. Rather, he was trying to persuade Lorenz to ask a question that, based on a reading of _On Aggression_, Lorenz hadn’t asked. It was some version of the question Bateson had asked, early on, about the naven ritual. No linear causal explanation of naven was discernible, rising up mechanically from below, from the lesser to the greater, as demanded by the premises of modern reductionism. How to explain, therefore, the source of that ritual? Why should an entity not explode? Likewise, what was the source of the elegance and “peaceful issue” produced by the great constructors, natural selection and random mutation? Why didn’t the world explode, schism upon schism? Why did it instead evidence tendencies toward wolf mercy and goose love? Stated most generally, what was the source of form? Freud wasn’t the only one who proposed an “instinct” for death—so had the second law of thermodynamics. It was called heat death, the relentless breakdown of order into entropy, the total random. What explained, despite this, the persistence of form?[^26]

W. B.’s project, stripped down to essentials, had been the pursuit of this question. When he was alive it made him vulnerable to exclusion. Now dead, it still made him vulnerable to charges of romanticism, of having “collapsed into obscurities,” of having asked more from science than science could provide. “Yes, of course, form was the mystery he was after,” Bateson would admit to William Coleman, the historian trying to flush out W. B.’s secrets and to frame them within the tiresome old debate. The pursuit of form was W. B.’s vocation, the “great work” that served as the substance of his faith, that provided him what “religious people get from superstition.”[^27]

That faith was not necessarily more stable than any other variety. W. B., who for all of his life was a person of vigorous industry, deteriorated fairly quickly in the years following Martin’s death. In 1926, less than four years after the incident, his career and reputation in disrepair, W. B. fought a bout with acute bronchitis and soon after suffered a second heart attack. “He was, as you know,” Bateson explained to Coleman, “quite depressed in those years by my brother’s suicide and by the directions in which occidental culture was developing post World War I. I think he was quite glad to get out of the world which Lloyd George and Clemenceau had created.” Gregory, then at Cambridge, was called home. He found his father in his deathbed in a state of delirium, as Gregory described the scene to his biographer, “muttering, muttering mainly about Mendelian ratios.” In the end, as Gregory put it to Coleman, the “nasty little binary units discovered by Mendel” had not solved the mystery of form.[^28]

When W. B. died, Gregory, at his bedside, wiped his father’s nose and closed his eyes, touching his father’s body for the first time in his life. Whenever Gregory spoke of W. B.’s death, he rarely failed to exclude this detail. It says something not only about the family ways of the Victorian-Edwardian gentry but also of some aspects of an inheritance Gregory was eager to let go. In intellectual matters, however, W. B.’s legacy was something Gregory was increasingly conscious of taking on.[^29]

In the numerous letters exchanged with Coleman, starting in the fall of 1966, after Bateson had begun to sense the negative slant the historian intended to take in his article, Bateson mounted a defense that was in many ways a defense of his own scientific project. He stressed to Coleman that deep down his father had rejected the conventional Newtonian thinking that gave primacy to quantification and force. Yet he admitted, as much to Coleman as to himself, that even in his own discussion of his father’s work, there remained “the submerged question” of what W. B. had “left unsaid.” Bateson attempted to articulate it: “If you want to put salt on a bird’s tail, you will be well advised not to look at the bird while you approach it. [W. B.] was always trying to put salt on the tail of nature and particularly to catch that component of nature which we might as well call Mind. It was of course obvious that ‘Force’ could not contain Mind, because Force is only a measurable abstraction and that is all it is.” One detects here a touch of impatience. His remarks about force echo old arguments with Jay Haley about power.[^30]

By the spring, Coleman had sent a few draft paragraphs, and if it hadn’t been before, it was now fully clear what he was doing. “I do not know whether it is relevant to your historical studies,” Bateson responded, a little testily, “to suggest that there might be matters in which W. B. was _right_.” Gregory followed this suggestion with a list of beliefs about the “systemic nature of the universe,” which were by that time completely Bateson’s own. W. B.’s tragedy had been that he couldn’t say what he wanted to say because he had lacked the language. He had to leave things “unsaid” because “nothing like this could be said 50 years ago, except with mysticism.” In “The Role of Somatic Change in Evolution,” his act of filial piety, Gregory tried to complete this task, to say what W. B. was “right” about, without mysticism.[^31]

It was, of course, the language and ideas provided by the Macy Conferences that allowed Bateson to do that. His use in the earlier letter to Coleman of the phrase “which we might as well call Mind” is a telling one. This was a way of phrasing the issue that he hadn’t been bold or perhaps reckless enough to use with either the students on his visit to Sacramento or with Lorenz. In the context of natural processes, when one spoke of “Mind,” one seemed to be speaking of a Creator, which is to say theologically or mystically, and the thrust of Darwinism and modern science in general was to make appeals to the supernatural unnecessary. The word had to be bracketed, and the phenomena it evoked had to be discounted or relegated to deauthorized disciplines. The Macy Conferences had changed that. Now, without resorting to the language of theology or speculative metaphysics, one could speak of a larger relevance, a greater systemic intelligence, some cohering complexity acting against entropy from above, in recursive and downward causation. Before the Macy Conferences, the dangerous word “Mind” had had to be avoided. Now it “might as well” be used.

### CONVERSIONS

In May 1966, just back to Waimanalo from his April trip to California, nine days after first writing Lorenz, Bateson wrote to Margaret Mead. In the letter is some measure of his mood. The occasion was a publishing matter concerning the work they had done together in Bali. The letter was largely a tending to that business. But in concluding he added a few paragraphs about his trip to California the month before, to the Bay Area and his old haunts. “Do you remember,” he asked Mead, “a little leprechaun Irishman named John McCaffrey?” Bateson had run into McCaffrey in San Francisco. An anthropologist, an old colleague, McCaffrey was recently back from Australia “with beautiful material on the ethos of totemism.” It put Bateson in mind of an old fairy story he had forgotten. He looked for it and found it in the James Stephens collection of Irish folklore. Its similarities to _On Aggression_ and _The Sword in the Stone_ were unmistakable. Bateson read it and now urged Mead to read it, too.[^32]

“The Conversion of Tuan MacCairill” is a charming and unsentimental fable, full of mild blasphemy and dry wit. Finnian, the abbott of Moville, receives word about a provincial man who is refusing to observe the Sabbath. The man is a well-respected and influential “magician” called Tuan MacCairill. The abbott determines to visit Tuan, to share the Gospel with him, “to preach and prove the new God,” and thus to convert him from the old paganism.[^33]

Tuan takes the abbott in and listens for days to his proselytizing. The abbott finally tires of talking and asks Tuan to tell something of himself. Tuan responds, reluctantly at first, with the story of his life. He is, he admits, centuries old, having arrived in Ireland “not long after the Flood.” Ireland was then an “unending forest,” full of “wild and shy and monstrous creatures.” An epidemic came, killing everyone but Tuan. In the “battering” storm that followed, Tuan is transformed into a series of animals. His experiences are not brief spells like those of the Wart but many strenuous animal lifetimes. Tuan is a stag, a boar, a hawk, and finally a salmon. As with T. H. White and Konrad Lorenz, Tuan’s descriptions of animal life and behavior demonstrate a deep familiarity. “In all my changes,” Tuan says, “I had joy and fullness of life. But in the water joy lay deeper, life pulsed deeper.” Land animals, Tuan explains, always have appendages they must tend to. Men have swinging arms, stags have legs “to be tucked away for sleep,” and birds have wings to be folded, pecked, and cared for. “But the fish has but one piece from his nose to his tail. He is complete, single and unencumbered. He turns in one turn, and goes up and down and round in one sole movement.” Tuan the salmon is finally caught by the king of Ulster, then cooked up and eaten for dinner by the king and his wife. Tuan returns to human form when the wife gives birth to him as a son.[^34]

“The Conversion of Tuan MacCairill” ends with the abbott baptizing Tuan into the new faith. Yet no indication is given that the abbott had rejected Tuan’s story, that he dismissed it as pagan claptrap unworthy of the “modern” faith, or that Tuan himself had stopped believing it. In the absence of this judgment is the sly suggestion of merger between the old gods and the new, as if the conversion referred to in the story’s title is as much the abbott’s as it is Tuan’s.[^35]

Bateson was excited by the story, and not only by the story but by the coincidences involved in his rediscovery of it: the Irishman McCaffrey, his material on totemism, Bateson’s own recent reading of _The Sword in the Stone_—all of which he detailed in his letter to Mead. “You should take a look at it,” Bateson told her. “It is a subjective hypno-eidetic account of totemic initiation. Very beautiful in itself and it makes the hair on one’s head stand up to discover that this myth has come down to us in the form of the original anthropological interview in which it was narrated.”[^36]

The mood expressed here is in marked contrast to the mood of the letter Bateson wrote to Mead in 1949 after he had come back from the war. They were still married then, although more or less estranged. Bateson was refusing to join her in the new institutions she was spearheading, new partnerships between the government and the social sciences. Bateson also mentioned in that earlier letter what he had been reading lately—not T. H. White but T. S. Eliot, and he was full of the dark foreboding of that disappointed classicist. Bateson claimed he would not join Mead in the “culture-cracking” business, as he derisively described it. He wouldn’t be made ashamed of not hating the Russians. He wouldn’t use science for national defense, even if he risked ostracism and isolation, even if he was wrong. At the core of Bateson’s bitterness and refusal was his repugnance for what he called social science’s outright acceptance of “_inevitable_ dog-eat-doggery.” That was a false construction, based on bad premises. The “dog-eat-dog qualities of the human world” were largely “deutero-learned,” Bateson wrote. They were reinforced by every “pious” statement about what was “realistic.”[^37]

Bateson would not be “realistic” in that way. He wouldn’t accept that view of evolution. For Bateson, evolution was not a life-or-death struggle for survival within a mindless biosphere. With the discoveries of the Macy Conferences he had conceived an alternative picture of evolution that involved learning paired with wise guidance, an affirmation from above, and the bestowal of genetic blessings upon individuals under stress, facing the dire need for recalibration. This wasn’t a reactionary argument for creationism. Bateson wasn’t making a case for a benevolent deity. Something affirmed seems to imply an affirmer, as a flexibility-restoring law implies a wise legislator, but that may be a mere consequence of language, with its syntactical requirement that subject and predicate be divided. There is nothing in “The Role of Somatic Change in Evolution” itself that suggests Bateson, an avowed atheist, was thinking in those terms. He was, however, making a case against evolution conceived as a mindless mechanism and in favor of evolution conceived as some anti-entropic principle at work in the world, information-based and complex, and which “we might as well call Mind.”

It would not, moreover, do a disservice to Bateson to describe what happened to him that spring in California as religious. Something happened on that trip, with his talk to the students and in his chance meeting with the old comrade McCaffrey, rich with coincidence. Bateson had an insight, the spark of an idea. In his letter to Mead, he didn’t spell it out. Perhaps it wasn’t clear to him yet. More than a year would pass before he would put something of the idea in a letter to Warren McCulloch, the most trusted of his Macy Conference colleagues. “I begin to wonder whether I am mad,” Bateson wrote, “or have hit on an idea which is much bigger than I am.” The idea was connected to the totems McCaffrey spoke of and perhaps showed Bateson photographs of: the animal _resources/books//Runaway_ Gregory Bateson, the Double Bind, - Anthony Chaney aborigines created to help them understand descent and to inform their connection to the natural world. Could these “personified totemic animals,” along with other religious _resources/books//Runaway_ Gregory Bateson, the Double Bind, - Anthony Chaney and concepts, be understood as indirect, cybernetic correctives to false roads, to blind alleys, to ranges of flexibility reduced to their minimum? He speculated to McCulloch about how the essential job of the therapist was to provide something of this same corrective: to connect or demonstrate to patients and their families the processes going on around them, to clue them in to the larger cybernetic systems in which they lived.[^38]

In method and in message, this therapist’s role as Bateson conceived it was what he had attempted to do in Sacramento. The discontented youth he spoke to also sought some corrective—one might even say atonement—because the basic things had gone so wrong. It would be perhaps too romantic to claim that, in terms of the Bateson family tragedy—a kind of catastrophe nesting within a far greater catastrophe—Bateson too glimpsed some possibility of atonement. In Sacramento, it was more than an appreciative, sympathetic audience, more than simple validation. The faith in science Bateson had inherited from his father told him that he might somehow help these youth. That they were there to be helped was a boost to that faith. Gregory was the old man now, tutoring the Warts, counseling the Martins. What he didn’t know, returning from California, was that he would soon be asked to speak to a far larger contingent of that audience again, and also to many of its leaders.  

## Nine: Schismogenesis

As the summer of 1967 approached, the postwar baby boom population was cresting, and the number of American troops deployed to Vietnam was nearing half a million. By a long margin, the majority of Americans supported President Johnson’s policy of intervention. However, a surge in antiwar activity was well underway. Both trends continued: war escalation; antiwar activity and domestic unrest. A movement had emerged, bolstered by the insurgent participation of a “nation” of youth, bringing together new coalitions among existing protest organizations and convergences between different ways of thinking about sources of discontent.

A January event publicly marked one such convergence. Held in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, the Human Be-In (also known as the Pow-Wow, or the Gathering of the Tribes) was meant to bring together the various threads of the area’s cultural underground in a unified, daylong, open-house consortium of psychedelic style. Its program proved iconic: music by a cavalcade of local bands, spontaneous dancing, demonstrations of esoteric spiritual practice, poetry, and body painting. During the planning stages, Allen Ginsberg and others had recommended reaching out to the tribe across the bay, the political activists at Berkeley. Posters advertising the event underscored a hoped-for “hippie-radical fusion” between these activists and the “spiritual generation.”[^1]

Understood in abstract terms, this alliance proposed a joining of two strains of radicalism with an uneasy history between them. Both strains advocated change, but they differed in where this change should be located: in culture or in structure; in ways of thinking or in collective action against the institutions of power. Understood in their most radical configurations, the difference amounted to an argument over praxis. The culturalists located the problem in ways of thinking and so recommended a praxis aimed at hearts and minds. The structuralists located the problem in sociopolitical relations and so recommended a praxis of political revolution.[^2]

Of course, these categories are too simplistic. They suggest clear boundaries between modes of analysis that were in actuality blurred and intermixed. Most people didn’t think in such a clearly delineated way. Yet during the period in question, like categories were commonly indicated by a variety of terms, some of which are familiar: the New Left and the counterculture; the socialists and the existentialists; the traditional Left and the libertarian Left; the radicals and the hippies; the politicos and the spiritual generation.

Still, the point should not be digested too quickly. To young American men, and to young women as their peers, the situation was urgent and personal. Their country was asking them to put their lives at risk and do violence. This alone raised questions of one’s willingness to participate in violence at all and in what circumstances and on whose behalf. Such questions rankled. They held real consequences. The debate over the locus of change between culturalist and structuralist positions, so-called, was an ancient argument, going back to the dawn of civilization. It was intensified during this particular period, however, because it represented painful questions of individual conscience and matters of life and death.[^3]

The most celebrated play of 1966 laid out the debate in much the same fashion described above, using terms familiar to the history and culture of the modern West. The play’s unwieldy title, _The Persecution and Assassination of Jean-Paul Marat as Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum of Charenton under the Direction of the Marquis de Sade_, signaled its avant-garde character, its play-within-a-play conceit, and summarized the action succinctly. But the better-known, unofficial abbreviation, _Marat/Sade_, better captured the essence of director Peter Brook’s production. “Under the direction” of de Sade and using the “inmates” of the asylum as players, the stage play presented a structuralist-culturalist argument with each of the historical figures, Marat and de Sade, taking a particular position.[^4]

Marat was a political actor in the French Revolution, an infighter in the factional disputes that led to the Reign of Terror. Marat didn’t survive the Terror, as Jacques-Louis David’s famous painting depicts. De Sade, living in the age of Napoleon, brings Marat back to life for his play. Despite the Revolution’s apparent failure, Marat remains committed to a strong structuralist position. Social wrongs must be altered and conditions improved, and the people must fight, “with axes and knives,” for their freedom.[^5]

De Sade, the aristocrat, is also a revolutionary, though not in terms of politics but in what might be called “lifestyle.” His blasphemous and disturbing writings and his extralegal escapades have landed him in the Charenton asylum. De Sade sees the Revolution differently than Marat. For de Sade, the Revolution submerged the individual into the murderous collective, which finally broke down into an “orgy of revenge.” To Marat’s call for militant political action, de Sade answers: “Marat, these cells of the inner self are worse than the deepest stone dungeon, and as long as they are locked, all of your revolution remains only a prison mutiny to be put down by corrupted fellow prisoners.” For de Sade, freedom can be achieved only inside the individual psyche. His is the culturalist position.[^6]

The same conditions of unrest and moral urgency that called for an alliance between culturalist and structuralist positions were also those that brought the perceived differences between them into relief. A dynamic that both drew together and pushed apart turned on the same axis. As American troop casualties rose (along with reports of far higher casualties among the Vietnamese population), as violence came forward as a cultural theme, and as the committed and the unaligned surged together into a large, amorphous movement, the urgency to do something also increased. As Todd Gitlin, a participant in and historian of the movement put it, “Protest moved toward resistance.” This pressed the leadership, insofar as a leadership could be identified, for specific programs of action. A rising urgency to act, in turn, applied pressure to the coalitions and convergences all along their seams. Leading the way as usual, civil rights groups splintered and frayed as past strategies aimed at an appeal to white conscience via nonviolent demonstration were challenged by methods aimed at claiming and using political power “by any means necessary.”[^7]

This is not to say that hopes weren’t high. To activist veterans and the New Left leadership, and to those such as Ginsberg, who had taken positions of responsibility among the culturalists, the groundswell must have seemed a vindication. Mixed in was the temptation of celebrity. This was especially destructive to groups such as the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee, Students for a Democratic Society, and San Francisco’s Diggers, all of whom had established leadership customs of deference and anonymity. The question wasn’t only who would do the leading but also how and in what direction. Especially for a self-styled leader such as Emmett Grogan of the Diggers, these questions were not academic. A contemporary’s description of the Digger program as “bohemian consensus plus new left politics reconsidered through psychedelic ideas” is representative of Grogan’s uneasy efforts to shape a practical program out of divergent critiques. Even as he strived to create an elusive, largely fictional persona, Grogan was a living person and had both Marat and de Sade inside him.[^8]

Well before the Human Be-In, an event similarly aimed at some new merger between culturalist and structuralist positions was in the works in England. That country’s leading culturalist was the psychiatrist R. D. Laing. Laing and colleagues were planning a gathering for July 1967 that would bring together an array of leftist, radical thinkers—philosophers, artists, social scientists, theoreticians, and other scholars—to speak publicly to the issue of widespread violence and unrest. Its goal would be to “demystify violence” by better understanding both its more and less recognizable forms. It was to be called the Congress on the Dialectics of Liberation.

Laing had specialized in the study of schizophrenics and had been strongly influenced by double-bind theory. He considered Gregory Bateson a mentor and friend. During the months leading up to the summer of 1967, Bateson held onto the insights he would later describe in his December letter to Warren McCulloch. But the needs of his new audience, and more directly, his connection to Laing, required him to think about praxis and the locus of change and to enter into the debate.

### LAING, KINGSLEY HALL, AND SWINGING LONDON

The success of R. D. Laing’s books of the early sixties, including _The Divided Self_ (1960) and _Sanity, Madness, and the Family_ (1964), had made him a kind of social science celebrity in Britain. He was as erudite as the classicist Paul Goodman and had the literary flair of Ken Kesey, but he was British during a time when Great Britain was emerging, after years of postwar economic recovery, as a source of new cultural authority and innovation. Like many of the pop stars of the British Invasion, the psychiatrist from Glasgow, with his own distinctive brogue, became a denizen of “Swinging London” and a leader in the psychedelic turn. Laing’s _The Politics of Experience_, if not his best book then certainly his most au courant, was published in early 1967, preceding _Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band_ by a matter of months.

Born to a working-class and emotionally dysfunctional family, Laing had been a brilliant and driven student both of science and the humanities. After earning a degree in medicine, he did his military service in the early 1950s working with psychiatric patients in a British army hospital. He continued clinical work in the city mental hospital in Glasgow and later at the Tavistock Clinic in London. His special interest was schizophrenia. In Britain as in the United States, schizophrenia was a little-understood disease with a wide, catchall assortment of symptoms. Yet Laing’s empathy for his patients was such that he was often unable to see them as psychotic or to detect their behavior as symptomatic, and so the typical treatments (heavy sedation, electric shock, surgery) struck him as alarming and cruel. Laing didn’t see schizophrenia as an organic disease but as a complex of intelligible strategies to deal with certain kinds of psychic stress and believed that the “words salads” of schizophrenics were not gibberish but should be understood metaphorically. Although developed in parallel, Laing and Bateson’s double-bind group had arrived at similar insights. But each had come from a different direction. Whereas Bateson was drawing on anthropology and animal behavior filtered through cybernetics, Laing was reading deeply in Freud, Martin Heidegger, Søren Kierkegaard, and Franz Kafka.[^9]

Laing’s approach goes a long way toward explaining the popular acclaim that met his first book, _The Divided Self_. Readers of modern literature and existential philosophy were familiar with presentations of the human dilemma via analogies to mental illness. In _The Divided Self_, Laing turned that method around. In a series of case studies of schizophrenic patients, all but a few of whom were members of the postwar young, Laing interpreted mental illness through writings from the existentialist canon. Laing was also innovative in tone: eloquent, poetic, but empirical and nondidactic. Laing made no distinction between the religious and secular writers he drew on, and his prose was free of the language of mysticism. By mid-decade, _The Divided Self_ had found a place on the shelves of the discontented, alongside books such as Colin Wilson’s _The Outsider_, William Burgess’s _A Clockwork Orange_, and the American books by Kesey, Goodman, Joseph Heller, and Kurt Vonnegut.

Laing’s thesis was accessible and persuasive. Schizophrenics were “schizoid” personalities, split by the depersonalization of modern life. Modern perception was grounded not in dialectical relationship as described by Martin Buber, which connected living persons to a reality they shared, but in the analytically distancing objectification of wholes into parts. Thus people experienced their reality “as automata, robots, as bits of machinery.” To be an object in a world of separate objects was felt as helplessness against constant threat, and victims sought refuge in further separation, in “scission between the self and the body.” In a vicious circle, the “disembodied self” advanced from hyperconsciousness to fantasy, and from fantasy to hallucination. In Laing, schizophrenia became a matter of degree along a “schizoid” continuum across which every modern person held a place.[^10]

Laing made indirect reference to the double-bind hypothesis in _The Divided Self_, but Bateson’s influence was more important to his next stage of development. In 1962, Laing traveled to Palo Alto to consult with the double-bind group. Laing and Bateson met, and based in part on a common appreciation for the creativity and humor their patients displayed, the two formed an immediate and lasting bond. Double-bind theory’s proposition that schizophrenia could be attributed to “disturbed communication” compelled Laing to turn his attention from individuals to families. His sense of the disease moved from the strategic processes of the individual out into social space. At the same time, Laing was involved in a systematic study of Jean-Paul Sartre’s _Critique of Dialectical Reason_. He took Sartre’s concept of mystification, applied it to schizophrenia’s etiology, and then extended it further to institutional diagnosis. The coercive actions taken to shape and oppress the development of a child’s psyche were obscured and made to seem natural and then reinforced by power’s monopoly on language. What resisted power was “sick,” was “mad”; what assented was “healthy,” was “normal.” The use of Sartre’s political analysis reveals how a thinker as purportedly culturalist as Laing also interwove structuralist positions. Summing up this new stage in his thinking, Laing wrote, “There is no such ‘condition’ as ‘schizophrenia,’ but the label is a social fact and the social fact is a _political event_.”[^11]

Laing’s merger of double-bind theory and Sartre pressed his critique of human relations onto hard emotional terrain. Schizophrenia became for him the extreme manifestation of the existential dilemma. It blurred the line between love and exploitation by revealing to its victims that those who loved them also used them for their own emotional ends. To face this blinding fact of existence was doubly dangerous: it threatened inner disintegration but was subversive to social order, as well. For Laing, as Peter Sedgwick has put it, the double-bind mechanism became “a mode of violence and fraud,” and all symptoms dissolved into the dynamics of social oppression and resistance, “ploy and counterploy.” Human relationship became a nihilistic exercise in mutual manipulation. Such bleak territory was hard to hold. Some retreat was necessary.[^12]

The retreat Laing fashioned abandoned none of his vision’s existentialist edge. Again, he took a cue from Bateson, this time from the introduction to _Perceval’s Narrative_, the book of John Perceval’s journals that Bateson edited. Perceval, the nineteenth-century aristocrat, had lost and regained his sanity, all prior to any intervention by modern psychiatry. For Bateson, Perceval’s account helped to clarify a point of double-bind theory that many interested psychiatrists had been unable to grasp. As with “many of the so-called symptoms of organic disease,” Bateson wrote in his introduction, double-bind symptoms not only provided the content of sickness but also might contain its own “curative properties.” Perceval had, “as it were, embarked upon a voyage of discovery which is only completed by his return to the normal world, to which he comes back with insights different from those of the inhabitants who never embarked on such a voyage.”[^13]

In _The Politics of Experience_, Laing extended the “journey” metaphor to present the schizophrenic as an existential hero whose disease offered the opportunity of a creative, healing journey into inner space. The journey was a dangerous one, and it was possible a hero might never return. Danger indicated the greater value of the journey. As with heroes of myth, a successful completion promised not only individual healing but also something healing to society at large. This took matters somewhat further than Bateson intended. For Bateson, the value of Perceval’s journal was its early descriptions of mental states, which shored up aspects of double-bind theory: the binding “false thesis” in the content of auditory hallucination, the curative properties of dream material, the metaphorical meaning of “schizophrenese,” and more. This was the useful information Perceval had brought back from his voyage, “as it were.” Bateson’s “as it were” was important. As always, he refrained from outright flights of fancy. Then again, he likewise refrained from the bleak airlessness of Laing’s social vision.[^14]

In contrast, Laing, having plumbed such depths, perhaps required more ether when he resurfaced. In _The Politics of Experience_, his empiricist’s reserve gave way. Madness was the opportunity to become “the actual medium for a continual process of creation . . . past all depression or persecution or vain glory, past, even, chaos or emptiness, into the very mystery of that continual flip of nonbeing into being.” The hero’s journey into madness and back ran “beyond the veils of mystification,” into “eonic time,” “back to the womb of all things,” “from a cosmic fetalization to an existential rebirth.” Certainly, the authority and sophistication of Laing’s prose was far above the typical metaphysical riff found in the columns of the underground papers, such as the _Oracle_ and the _East Village Other._ However, most Laing scholars, and certainly his critics, regret his turn toward psychedelia and mysticism. Some who had made hard-won recoveries resented what they perceived as Laing’s romanticization of mental illness, as Joanne Greenberg had resented the celebration of madness by the Beats. It should also be noted that Laing was using LSD and other pharmaceuticals regularly during this period, although unlike the former Harvard psychologist Timothy Leary, he didn’t advertise his enthusiasm for the drug.[^15]

Yet for all this, Laing remained a working clinician. _The Divided Self_ had implied the destructiveness of even the most benign conventional psychiatric therapies. Now writing about these therapies as instruments of social oppression pushed Laing further out of sympathy with the discipline in which he was trained. Laing had admired Bateson’s status outside the field of psychiatry but at the same time felt an obligation to his medical role. Now, in accordance with this latest stage in his thinking, that role too was romanticized. The psychiatrist’s task was to act as guide and facilitator to the schizophrenic’s interior journey. To do so, the guide had to be willing to risk danger, too, and to tap into his or her own “psychotic potentiality.”[^16]

These were not merely abstract notions. Laing worked them into his practice. He opened an experimental clinic in Kingsley Hall, an abandoned public house in an East London neighborhood. There the mentally disturbed could live and embark on their inner journeys, free from sedation, physical restraints, shock treatments, schedules, or any kind of institutional restriction. Kingsley Hall’s most famous inmate was Mary Barnes, whom Laing wrote about in _The Politics of Experience_. Barnes dressed in diapers and smeared the walls of her room with her own feces. Later, she moved from walls to canvases, from feces to paint, and eventually produced works that earned acclaim. Guests regularly passed through to take in the Kingsley Hall experience—some of them counterculturalists, some Swinging London celebrities. Inhabitants and guests would gather around a large table for dinner. These dinners featured interactive lectures and spontaneous performances and sometimes lasted long into the night. Laing acted as host and master of ceremonies. There was nothing new in the concept of the “deeper lunacy of the sane,” as a reviewer of _Marat/Sade_ had put it. Laing seemed to take the idea a step further. It wasn’t that the sane were crazier than the lunatics. It was that the lunatics were healthier than the sane.[^17]

Kingsley Hall colleague Joe Berke, an American, was the psychiatrist who had acted as guide for Mary Barnes’s psychic journey. In the spring of 1966 he came to Laing and suggested the idea of what came to be called the Congress on the Dialectics of Liberation. What Berke had in mind was a radical experiment in education, similar to what they were doing in Kingsley Hall, where traditional symbols of authority were dismantled. In the same way that avant-garde theater broke down the fourth wall, Berke aimed to radicalize the process of education by erasing, however possible, its conventional hierarchies. Berke had been involved in the Free University of New York. The congress would attempt a time-limited London version. He and other planners didn’t initially perceive it as occurring at any particular place but as spontaneously moving into whatever spaces the needs of participants dictated.[^18]

Berke consulted Laing for a list of potential speakers. As originally compiled, Laing’s list included thinkers, scholars, and artists who had influenced him or who had clear connections to his work: Bateson, Sartre, Goodman, Ginsberg, Erving Goffman of _Asylums_, Michel Foucault. Also included were the German Marxist Herbert Marcuse; Werner Heisenberg of the “uncertainty principle”; the anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss; the religionist Mircea Eliade; Joseph Campbell of _Hero with a Thousand Faces_; the novelists Günter Grass and Carlos Fuentes; Julian Beck of the Living Theater; and Peter Brook, the director of _Marat/Sade_.[^19]

Laing had since left Kingsley Hall. Always in tune with the period’s dynamic, he now sought a larger stage. But if there had ever been a real-life equivalent to _Marat/Sade_’s play-within-a-play, it may well be the epic dinners Laing had presided over in the old brick public house, with everyone gathered around a common table, the low and the high, and Laing in the role of de Sade, directing the action but also acting, in a script of his own improvisation.

### PHARMACOPOEIA AND DIET

Bateson’s official invitation to speak at the congress came with a personal note from Laing in July 1966. Bateson had returned from his California trip and was in the midst of his early exchanges with Konrad Lorenz. The dates for the congress had been scheduled for the last two weeks of July 1967. No specific location had been selected; gatherings might be held “in various parts of London in halls and in the open air.” At this early stage, Berke’s vision was still intact. Also enclosed in the invitation was a three-page statement of principles by the Institute of Phenomenological Studies, another of the organizations led by Laing and under whose auspices the congress was being organized. The statement was written by David Cooper, a South African psychiatrist and colleague of Laing’s. On matters of psychiatry and mental illness, Laing and Cooper shared beliefs. They had written a book on Sartre together. But Cooper and Berke and others of the event planners were more politicized than their leader and more sympathetic to the leftist radicalism on the Continent.[^20]

Bateson was quite fond of Laing, whom he called “Ronnie.” He was honored by the invitation. “Of course I _want_ to come,” he wrote Laing in response. But he “disagreed with many crucial points in the phenomenological position.” Bateson was using the term “phenomenology” the way the Laing group used it—to convey how they had brought the philosophies of Edmund Husserl, the existentialists, and others into psychiatry in order to extend its reach to society at large. The focus was on the subjective experience of the psyche, free of all “preconceptual schemata.” Bateson did not outright reject the approach but was concerned he not be perceived as endorsing the institute’s program. If he spoke at a public event, he wanted it to be clear he would be representing his views alone. “Marx and Freud were great men,” Bateson wrote, “but neither contributed anything that could be used for social doctrine.” He further detailed his disagreements. Bateson was typically mild in expressing criticism, but Cooper had written the mission statement, not Laing. Bateson’s three-page dismantling of what he called “Cooper’s Manifesto” lacks some of his usual temperance. More important, it shows how Bateson set himself apart from the politically radical uses of his ideas by some of those who were most inspired by them.[^21]

It was not that Bateson disagreed with Cooper’s premises. His problem was with the conclusions Cooper thought they implied. “From our earliest beginnings,” the statement read, “we are conditioned by systems of influence that converge on us . . . even to the chemistry of our bodies.” This clearly reflected Bateson’s insistence that contexts were not isolable, be they social or biological. The result, Cooper claimed, was “a state of alienation” from “the original source of our personal being.” Here Bateson had a problem.[^22]

“Yes—of course,” he wrote, “all human beings are deeply shaped by cultural influences of all kinds and of course this reaches into our biochemistry. This will always be so and is not to be regretted.” But what were the “sources of personal being”? Did anyone actually know? Bateson granted Cooper’s claim that human cultural conditioning was often hurtful and based on untruths “regarding the good, the beautiful, the desirable.” The error was to assume that evidence existed for any pure or “always right” state that conditioning corrupted. That most generalizations were untrue didn’t automatically prove the rightness of “their contraries.”[^23]

Rather, most contraries were also untrue, Bateson asserted. This was the case in nature as well as in culture. He illustrated his point with some comparative physiology. The evolutionary development of the human nose, unlike that of the dolphin’s blowhole, for instance, was based on the “truth” that oxygen was always present around the nostrils. Here Bateson hinted at the sort of data he would bring to the congress: “modern-day environments” were beginning to be those in which “built-in premises are no longer true.” Disruptions of that kind were likely to be “unpleasant.” If the prospect evoked dread, at the same time there was “always humor,” Bateson wrote, and then added, in a mild dig, “for some of us.”[^24]

Having criticized the phenomenologists’ analysis, Bateson next moved to their program. If most generalities and their contraries were likely wrong, then some “necessary state of man,” as Cooper had put it, could not be assumed. Thus it became dangerous to fashion a remedy meant to move man toward that “necessary state.” The phenomenologists viewed the mass of humankind as mystified by power into a “contrived _Stasis_” of confused numbness. What was needed, Cooper had claimed, was to disturb that stasis by awakening people to all forms of conditioning, “even, ultimately, to the most chaotogenic disturbance of all—the vision of the final paradoxes of our condition.” This, wrote Bateson, was “the nub of the matter”: “How much ‘stasis’ do you want? And how much ‘disturbance’? As I see it, we live in an age and culture—a cultural epoch—more disturbed and more deeply disturbed than any other in the history of man. . . . Now, the phenomenologists [propose] . . . that the cure is _more_ disturbance. You may be right—but your conclusion is by no means self-evident.”[^25]

For Bateson, Cooper’s concepts—“the original source of our personal being” and “the necessary state of man”—were not rigorous enough categories to risk a program of disturbance. The science wasn’t “ripe,” as Bateson liked to say. “Frankly, I do not believe that we know enough about the natural history of the ‘final paradoxes’ to draw any clear conclusions about the _necessary_ state of man.” On the sorry state of things, social and otherwise, Bateson and the phenomenologists were in agreement. “But then to go out and preach phenomenology,” he wrote to Laing, was “perhaps contrary to the doctrine itself.”[^26]

Bateson was sincere in wanting to attend the congress. Simply on a personal level, it would work out well with the arrangements he was already making for the summer of 1967. He was to be in Austria in late June. The Wenner-Gren Foundation for anthropological studies, which had been helping to fund Bateson’s work, held summer symposiums in the Austrian countryside, and Bateson was going to attend. To combine that with a London booking would not be difficult. Besides, Bateson hadn’t been to England in thirty years. He could give Lois and the boys a tour of his old haunts. The opportunity to show them the place where he was raised, while taking part in an event of such topical buzz—the prospect must have been exciting. The invitation also included a copy of Laing’s entire wish list of speakers. To have Ronnie include him with such notables was surely gratifying.

In some ways, Laing was Bateson’s best student. He was certainly the most celebrated. Few had been more inspired by double-bind theory, and none had taken it to a place of higher prominence. The double bind was already resonant throughout the culture. But Laing had been the one to bring the concept to attention in its purest form and, at the same time, more clearly than anyone, to extrapolate it to society at large. Cooper’s manifesto put that extrapolation into concise words, employing the paradox that the double bind so aptly expressed. Western society was characterized by a “conspicuous success in failing,” Cooper wrote, and its “failure is in the very creation of the field of possibility of the Bomb; of actual wars to suppress movements for the autonomous self-assertion of colonial peoples; of the systematic invalidation of a wide category of people who do not conform and are labeled psychotic or delinquent or some other convenient label.”[^27]

On the face of it, Bateson didn’t disagree. But here again he marked a limit to what the extrapolation implied. In terms of application, to jump from the clinic into the universal was too simplistic. As he acknowledged to Laing, from one therapist to another, a psychoanalyst might indeed try to disturb the stasis of symptoms that a schizophrenic had settled into. Doing so could force the patient onto uncertain psychic ground. If that danger was properly managed by the therapist, the tactic could prove beneficial. Frieda Fromm-Reichmann had snared Joanne Greenberg in a therapeutic double bind. That action, however, to reference the William Blake quote that Bateson used in Sacramento, was action at the “Minute Particular.” When it came to the “General Good,” how would the danger be managed? Who would manage it and for how long? Or did the phenomenologists foresee coerced disturbance as an ongoing state of affairs?[^28]

It was July 1966, and revolution was in the air, as the saying goes. In its own way, Cooper’s manifesto raised the prospect of revolution, and in a very direct way (and one likely not foreseen by its initiators) revolution would be the topic of the congress the following summer. Now, at the outset, in _his_ own way, Bateson weighed in on the topic of revolution. “There is a difference between pharmacopoeia and diet,” Bateson wrote to Laing, “or should be.” Bateson closed his letter on the matter of honoraria, asking for $2,000.[^29]

### EMMETT GROGAN: FREEDOM ASSUMED

January’s Human Be-In drew thousands to San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park and was widely reported by the national news media. The event had been put together by a committee consisting largely of a group of neighborhood entrepreneurs—psychedelic shop owners, underground publishers, and event promoters—who called themselves the “Haight Independent Proprietors” (HIP). They were concerned with the media’s growing interest in the Haight-Ashbury scene, especially in view of the social stresses the constant stream of young newcomers placed on community resources. The members of HIP, foreseeing an even greater invasion once school was out in June, hoped to take control of events and to inaugurate the cultural phenomenon of which they were part in a way that established a positive tone.[^30]

To a large degree, HIP’s efforts served the interests of the media, as well. The general narrative presented was one of a younger generation offering a model to the older of a celebratory human collective, free of bigotry and aggression. That this peacefulness was accompanied by a greater permissiveness in grooming and sexual behavior and in the use of new recreational drugs added to the narrative the obligatory touch of sensation. Those who opened the photo spread on the Human Be-In in _Newsweek_ or who watched the snippets of film footage shown on the television news programs witnessed _resources/books//Runaway_ Gregory Bateson, the Double Bind, - Anthony Chaney of hippiedom that would fossilize: Allen Ginsberg, bald and full-bearded, sitting cross-legged in a white robe, playing finger cymbals; beside him on the low stage, Timothy Leary with a strand of beads around his neck and a flower tucked behind each ear; the multitude of younger participants, most sitting rapt, shoulder to shoulder, some looking not so different from their more conservatively dressed late-1950s equivalents but others in outlandish adornments, dancing to rock music in movements suggesting ecstatic intoxication. Leary’s intonation to “Turn on, tune in, drop out” condensed ends and means into an easily grasped, lasting prescription, a succinct restatement of the Great Refusal combined with a pharmaceutical technique.

The _Oracle_ editors and HIP members who planned the event had reached out to the Berkeley activists. Jerry Rubin and Dick Gregory were slated to attend, to represent student and civil rights activism, respectively. Their names appeared on posters advertising the event alongside those of Leary, Ginsberg, and the Buddhist poet Gary Snyder. If the sort of cultural revolution the Be-In planners envisioned was actually taking place, the activist student Left was the first and most obvious alliance. Others must have seen it that way, too. The structuralist-culturalist merger was already inherent in the typical pejorative description of the Berkeley demonstrators as “campus beatniks.” What mainstream observers saw then was not novel but more a stylistic elaboration of an association already assumed. Thus, news stories and _resources/books//Runaway_ Gregory Bateson, the Double Bind, - Anthony Chaney of the Human Be-In only reinforced the perception of a united front.[^31]

Beneath the surface, however, discord was simmering, even within the Haight-Ashbury community. Emmett Grogan of the Diggers, the edgiest and most influential of the area’s radical groups, took a dim view of the Human Be-In. He distrusted the motivations of HIP. What the neighborhood proprietors saw as preemptive public relations, Grogan saw as an effort to create a national market for the psychedelic clothing, accessories, and lifestyle products that they sold in their shops. The event was a “lie,” according to Grogan, a “fashion show” meant to co-opt the underground’s symbolics. In coming years, many would employ a similar analysis to explain the failure of sixties radicalism in general: consumerist capitalism eagerly embraced the novelty of psychedelic style and sold it to the public while bleeding it of its subversive potential. Even so, the Diggers, as an established community presence, took part in the Be-In, distributing bowls of turkey stew along with several hundred tabs of LSD. But Grogan and the Diggers may have felt somewhat co-opted themselves.[^32]

The prescience of Grogan’s analysis, along with all the claims made in his 1972 autobiography, _Ringolevio_, must be carefully weighed. Memoirs give their authors the advantage of hindsight to reconstruct attitudes and settle scores. But self-mythology and posturing were always a part of the Grogan program. He was born, his book claims, “Kenny Wisdom” into a working-class Irish American family. He grew up in a rough Brooklyn neighborhood, where the gangs of boys played a game called Ringolevio. No rules existed to buffer the game’s blunt objective: to occupy turf by eliminating, through capture and containment, the members of the rival gang. A successful player was smart, brave, fast, and ruthless but, above all, loyal. As the title of Grogan’s memoir suggests, Ringolevio became the lens through which Grogan/Wisdom viewed reality and his place in it.

As a teen, Kenny Wisdom lived a double life: a promising student and athlete to school authorities and parents and a neighborhood character and petty thief to the street crowd. Hooked on heroin at an early age, he kicked it cold turkey while jailed for joyriding. Explaining his withdrawal symptoms as those of epilepsy, Wisdom gamed the system and not only won release but also was placed by the court in a prestigious prep school. There his double life continued. After a sojourn among working-class and revolutionary communities in Europe (that may have been a total fabrication), Wisdom returned to America in 1965. At twenty-one, intrigued by the burgeoning counterculture, he took his first hit of LSD. His experience, as for countless others, was decisive. In _Ringolevio_, written entirely in the third person, Grogan describes the trip: “Inanimate objects and irrelevancies melt-twisted free of importance and drip-faded into the waterfall of pretension. Remembered _resources/books//Runaway_ Gregory Bateson, the Double Bind, - Anthony Chaney invoked from the past exploded into a kaleidoscope burst of day-glo spirochetes wistfully dancing in a chaotic, nostalgic, timeless cascade of moment, like a drowning man’s thoughts.” Wisdom saw that “what was and will be—only is.”[^33]

The “psychedelic storm” did not change but reinforced his core beliefs. He had always seen himself as a hero, a survivor in the hardscrabble Ringolevio of life. In his post-trip calm, Wisdom now knew that “there were some things even more important than being alive and one of them was being alive that way you want to be alive.” His politics were intuitive and deeply ingrained: his sympathies were with the poor and powerless, the honorable thieves of the street. He had a wide streak of antiauthoritarianism, which he attributed to his Irish blood. The LSD experience now revealed to him that the value placed on things was arbitrary, assigned by the masters and enforced by the police. The premises of “private property” were socially constructed, and to demonstrate this revelation, Wisdom took an empty soda bottle, worth five cents upon return, and shattered it on the floor.[^34]

Wisdom moved to San Francisco, his hair still cut in a Presley-style pompadour. There Selective Service caught up with him and inducted him into the army. By now the double game had become his stock in trade. To his drill instructors he played the model soldier. But this was only to give credence to the mental breakdown he staged one day on the shooting range. Diagnosed with schizophrenia, he spent a few weeks in the psychiatric wing of the army hospital, where he observed the truly disturbed vets fresh from Vietnam. Among the casualties were “boys” who had “shot down women and babies because they were terrified, and who later collapsed with overwhelming guilt—their minds blown by the horror of what they’d done.” How much of this actually happened to Grogan, and how much was invented for his book? In one sense, it doesn’t matter. Even if this was self-mythology, it was a mythology built to make that self representative and so drew on those components that were most resonant. Grogan in the army and the army hospital is a character out of Heller, Vonnegut, or Kesey; an emotional evocation out of Mario Savio and Carl Oglesby; a case study in Bateson or Laing.[^35]

Discharged, Wisdom now called himself “Emmett Grogan,” renaming himself in the way of other radicals. His “political awareness had grown into a need for action,” and he formed a group with friends drawn largely from the politically minded San Francisco Mime Troupe. They called themselves “Diggers,” after a group of seventeenth-century English communalists. The original Diggers had claimed land in protest against private property. The new Diggers sought to claim their own material and conceptual turf. Grogan perceived his new group as a brotherhood. It was his new Ringolevio gang.[^36]

With the Diggers, Grogan aimed to make real the insights LSD had clarified. The first step was to “assume freedom.” Conventional expectations were no less arbitrary than the value of an empty Coke bottle. Therefore, one must cease playing “life-roles” and become an authentic “life actor.” With their background in street theater, the Diggers staged elaborate pieces of performance art. One of their props was the “Free Frame of Reference,” a giant wooden frame that they invited people to step through to suggest to them the arbitrariness inherent in the organization of perception and thus the socially constructed nature of reality. The Diggers disseminated their ideas and their playful, Beat-inspired style in a series of writings they called _The Digger Papers_, mimeographed and distributed throughout the neighborhood. In one piece, titled “Trip without a Ticket,” readers were encouraged to “Do your own thing”—as enduring a sixties phrase as any.[^37]

The Diggers’ liberationist vision represented a countercultural aim to remake culture from the inside, by changing perception. This was, in other words, a culturalist position. But for Grogan, with his working-class background and respect for low-level hustling, raising consciousness was never enough. In him, there was always a useful tension between bald-faced utopianism and hard-nosed realism. Grogan didn’t believe in political collectives built on abstract ideals but in tribes, gangs, brotherhoods. His vision required what he called “the code of anonymity.” Under no circumstances were outsiders supposed to know exactly who the Diggers were. This guarded against the temptation any member might feel to win individual fame. Anonymity also served as protection. If the authorities didn’t know who the Diggers were, they couldn’t be targeted. Grogan’s pragmatism was reflected, too, in his insistence on service to the Haight’s original working-class community. Providing free food (massive stews served in the park every afternoon) and other material services to the needy of the community distinguished the Diggers from Leary and the utopian “cloud dwellers.”[^38]

Yet on the day of the Human Be-In, Grogan was incensed to see Leary sitting cross-legged, with his “shit-eating grin,” on all the televisions of America. The event was offered free—an inspired marketing ploy. But the Diggers were the ones who had pioneered the concept of “free.” The Be-In would only lead to thousands more youngsters falling for the “Love Hoax” and flocking to a district whose resources were already overburdened. Grogan wondered whether he should tell the press what Leary and the HIP profit-mongers were up to. But that would compromise his anonymity. It also might sound like sour grapes. In terms of Ringolevio, the HIP gang had contained the Diggers gang and won for themselves a good deal of turf.[^39]

Months passed, and as summer approached, the young kept arriving in droves. At the same time, hostility between the Diggers began to surface. At the root of the problem was the difficulty of maintaining the code of anonymity as media attention grew ravenous. In a seeming affront to the code, Grogan figured prominently in a Digger profile in _Ramparts_, the slickest of the underground publications. But part of the problem for Grogan was that he could not help but play the double game, even with his closest companions. As fellow Digger Peter Coyote would write in his own memoir, “Emmett’s personal relationship to the concepts of ‘anonymous’ and ‘free’ were always complex and ambiguous.” Coyote “was never sure precisely where the hair might be split.”[^40]

To escape the tension, Grogan spent a few weeks in New York, where he acted as a consultant to grassroots radical groups. He spoke on the concept of “free” and on the necessity of hustling to meet the real needs of one’s community, sidestepping the fact that hustling usually meant stealing. Abbie Hoffman was one of the neighborhood activists who heard Grogan. A victim of SNCC’s recent purging of whites from positions of leadership at all levels, Hoffman was looking for a new outlet, and his interest was piqued. When Grogan returned to the Haight, he found it in a state of further deterioration. A predatory mood was descending, with a growing trade in hard drugs. The “Summer of Love” was just around the corner. A friend mentioned an upcoming SDS meeting to which the Diggers were “invited.” Again came the temptation to flee. Four of the group’s founding members packed into a car and left for Michigan, driving at top speed.[^41]

### ALIVE TO IT

Since the escalation began in late 1965, 10,000 Americans had died in Vietnam, and the average monthly number of deaths was climbing toward a June peak of 770. During the same period, the home front experienced a kind of spillover. Martin Luther King Jr. moved his activities to Chicago to protest racial bias in housing. The result was not only a setback for King’s nonviolent approach but also showed the nation that violent racism was not exclusive to the South. Since the three days of violence in Watts in 1965, where frustration over inner-city conditions, police racism, and brutality, riots had broken out in other cities, such as San Francisco, Cleveland, and Atlanta. A few weeks after the Human Be-In, _Ramparts_ featured an essay with photographs titled “The Children of Vietnam.” It featured photos of children hungry, maimed, and burned as victims of “napalm raids.” A quarter million of Vietnamese casualties, it claimed, were children. That data drove moral anguish over the war to a pitch that would prove corrosive. In the six months since its publication, Lorenz’s _On Aggression_ was selling briskly, as was Truman Capote’s _In Cold Blood._ The success of these nonfiction works can be seen as a sign of the times.[^42]

Lorenz visited Bateson in Hawaii in March. He looked over the operations at the Oceanic Institute, consulted with Karen Pryor and her husband, Tap, and gave a lecture or two to the staff. He demonstrated his ability to capture the nuances of expression in an animal’s movement in quick sketches on the board. Lorenz and Bateson spent a lot of time talking and got on well. Plans were made for Bateson to visit Lorenz in Europe in the summer, when Bateson came for the conferences in Austria and London.[^43]

While Lorenz was in Waimanalo, Bateson touched base with Nora Barlow. In firming up his London plans, Bateson had arranged for the family to spend a few days with her at Boswells, the country house on the Barlow family estate. This would allow Gregory to visit Cambridge and Grantchester, to return to the old Eden where the Batesons had lived when he was born. Writing to Nora to work out logistics, Bateson mentioned the London event. “The Phenomenologists” were “a rather wild bunch,” he wrote. He had been asked “to represent the ‘hard science end of the spectrum.’” “It all seems a little incredible,” he told her, “and I suspect that the ‘incredibility gap’ will increase when we arrive and take a first look at the members of the Conference and especially our audience.” Although they had written to each other regularly, Nora and Gregory hadn’t seen each other in decades. Bateson perhaps sensed that connecting himself to R. D. Laing and Kingsley Hall would raise eyebrows. These were times in which old friends over a certain age might think it advisable to assure each other they hadn’t gone off the deep end.[^44]

A few weeks after his visit, Lorenz wrote Karen Pryor in support of Bateson’s work. In his letter he described Bateson as “one of the greatest biological theorists of our time.” Pryor shared the letter with Bateson. “Such noble praise I never hoped from such a noble source,” Bateson replied to Lorenz. “Your visit to Hawaii was . . . enormously valuable to me. I feel reaffirmed in what I am trying to do.”[^45]

Bateson’s letters to Lorenz later in the spring indicate a deeper friendship. Bateson let himself vent a little to Lorenz about the old irritation—the expectation that his work demonstrate some utilitarian value. Applied research had “no continuity,” Bateson charged. “When the practical problem is solved, the research ceases. We have the solution to the ‘problem’ of poliomyelitis but still know nothing about the disease or the responses of the body to it. The same thought applies to the whole of medical science. What gets dropped out is the _wisdom_ which might have been developed if medicine had looked at the body as a _system_. . . . It becomes exceedingly dangerous for our whole civilization to possess enormous technological skills but no insight into the total biological system or eco-system upon which these skills are let loose.”[^46]

As he had in the letter to Laing, he gave voice to sensitivity about the environment. This was a new way to express his ideas. “Ecosystem” was a term fairly new to cultural discourse and relatively new to Bateson himself. It had emerged in the mid-1930s from the science of ecology, a discipline itself struggling for legitimacy. After the war, the ecosystem concept drew on cybernetic thought. Although it remained grounded in a mechanistic approach that thought in material flows of chemicals or energy rather than that of information, for many the concept helped “maintain their holistic faith.”[^47]

Bateson’s use of the term “ecosystem” partook of both these aspects. “Wisdom” about an ecosystem seemed to be where the many threads of his thinking came together, where his discipline hopping made cumulative sense. The “let loose” phrase marks an exception to Bateson’s usual restraint with Lorenz and perhaps a rising alarm in his own attitudes. In this construction, the “technological skills” in question were unleashed animals, running wild and wreaking havoc. In his letter to Laing, Bateson had placed himself well to the right of Cooper on the question of revolution. His letter to Lorenz reveals a touch of radical heat.

Since the previous summer, when Bateson first started writing Lorenz, new and frightening forms of violent destruction, both actual and symbolic, had seeped into the body politic. A cadre of Black Panthers was photographed, rifles resting on their hips, in the state capitol building in Sacramento, as if holding it by force of arms. Other acts—a nurse killer, a tower shooter—lacked even the sense of that structural violence that arose from economics or race. New forms of violence appeared in expressive culture, too. The most controversial motion picture of 1967 was _Bonnie and Clyde_. The outlaw story introduced visual techniques that would become standard in the graphic depiction of mayhem. A variety of components of the cultural mood met in the spectacle of bullets penetrating young bodies in slow motion. Americans, especially young Americans, were becoming more intimate with violence as a discourse. Violence was the “meaning” of _Bonnie and Clyde_, critic Pauline Kael wrote in praise of the film. The audience was “alive to it.”[^48]

### THE MICHIGAN COUP

SDS president Todd Gitlin had little sympathy for the San Francisco culturalist program. “Love should be ashamed when it was founded on privilege,” was his view. A New Yorker like Grogan, he had become an activist in the late 1950s through the antinuclear movement. The fact of the bomb had “wigged me out,” he remembered, and deterrence policy seemed sheer “craziness.” As a student in Ann Arbor, he had fallen in with a group that included Tom Hayden and was drawn to its atmosphere of “moral seriousness and intellectual rigor.” The group’s 1962 founding document, the “Port Huron Statement,” mixed culturalist with structuralist strains, as had Ginsberg’s “Howl.” The group members’ leftist socioeconomic analysis was not strictly quantitative, their epistemology not strictly positivist. “We regard men as infinitely precious,” they wrote, “and possessed of unfulfilled capacities for reason, freedom, and love.”[^49]

Now, five years later, as SDS gathered in Michigan for a meeting of the central planning committee, the group that signed the “Port Huron Statement” was seen as the “Old Guard.” Group members, like the Diggers, were working with the poor, organizing in urban neighborhoods in the North. Other programs to tap the skills of artists and professionals were attempts to make good on the flexible and inclusive vision put forth in the “Port Huron Statement.” Yet the surge in antiwar activism and the explosion in SDS membership made such programs seem timid. With the surge came the “spirit of One Big Movement,” Gitlin remembered. This spirit favored national programs, forming alliances, harnessing the momentum. The leadership was amenable to extending the group’s reach but felt that a pause was necessary to revisit its core ideals. They referred to their meeting in Michigan, half in jest, as “Back to the Drawing Boards.”[^50]

The meeting was held in a remote, wooded retreat. According to Gitlin, it was not intended to be an open meeting. The Diggers hadn’t been invited. Yet there may have been some confusion among the meeting’s planners, for a greater number of the SDS general membership was in attendance, including newer contingents of doctrinaire Marxists and Maoists and some small vanguard of the militants who would, two years later, stage a coup. For now, however, Gitlin and the longtime leadership held sway. They were an earnest, practical, and experienced group, with nothing “hippie-dippie” about them. Gitlin doubted that any of the Old Guard had yet sampled LSD. Even the use of marijuana they viewed as a disciplinary lapse.[^51]

Grogan and the Diggers burst into the room amid Hayden’s keynote address, interrupting with cries of “Is there a fucking lawyer here?” They had run their car into a ditch, and one of their party had been arrested. Having captured the attention of the group, they proceeded to engage in a series of antics designed to charge the group’s agenda as not only futile but also stylistically bland. Each Digger introduced himself as Emmett Grogan. “Don’t organize students, teachers, Negroes,” they said, “organize your head.” One wore a fur hat and played a tambourine. Another crawled around, moaning for sex. A third knocked over a chair, jumped up on a table, and pushed or stage-pushed several people around. This turned out to be the real Emmett Grogan. “Faggots! Fags! Take off your ties, they are chains around your necks. You haven’t got the balls to go mad. You’re gonna make a revolution?—you’ll piss your pants when the violence erupts.”[^52]

The quote comes from Gitlin’s memoir, but Grogan’s account of the speech in _Ringolevio_ differs not at all in spirit. If anything, it’s more elaborate, hostile, bigoted, and profane: “Most of you suckers would give your rectums to get yourselves plastered all over the cover of any one of them magazines as the _Big, Bad Radical_! Huh, wouldn’t ya! And now you’re all looking at me—me who’s more beautiful ’n heavier than any motherfuckin’ man or woman in this room! And you’re wondering why I don’t let ’em take my picture ’n become the big, bad radical of the year to all America, ain’tya! . . . _Why? ’Cause I ain’t kiddin’, you ugly, motherfuckin’, lyin’ cocksuckin’, punk-faced, pussy-whipped assholes!_’” Here, Grogan’s reference to the code of anonymity works, ironically, as self-aggrandizement. His boasting is as bold and provocative as that of an Iatmul elder clansman, taunting a rival patriarch.[^53]

Gitlin’s and Grogan’s versions of the speech align most closely on Grogan’s appalling address of the blacks in attendance. “You, spade—you’re a nigger, what are you doing here? Your people need you. There’s a war on,” Grogan said in Gitlin’s version. In his own, he said, “You goddamn nigger, you shouldn’t be _here_! Your people need you! There’s a war on, so get your fucking black ass back to your black brothers and sisters where you belong!” Certainly Grogan was aware of how the politics of race and identity had entered the civil rights movement and perhaps how it had splintered SNCC. That group’s new president, Stokely Carmichael, had been speaking for months on “Black Power.” But Grogan’s intent, too, was clearly shock and provocation, the presentation of mental and physical toughness, of the hard, pragmatic real over the soft, cloud-dweller utopian. If the neighbors within a community were tribes, brotherhoods, or Ringolevio gangs, ethnicity was a crucial factor in their natural constitution.[^54]

Among the Old Guard, reaction to the spectacle was mixed. Some were repulsed, others shocked into temporary paralysis. “More than one person in the audience thought of _The Wild One_,” Gitlin remembered. There were those, not of the Old Guard, who were enthralled. Abbie Hoffman, still an unknown in the movement and something of a meeting crasher himself, had been primed by his experience of Grogan in New York. He now became a true believer. What was most appealing was the shortcut to action. Why politely debate matters of method and points of theory when you could take direct, spontaneous action, based on the needs and creativity of the moment? Hoffman would make the approach his own.[^55]

Of course, disturbance was the Diggers’ plan. The theater of irreverence was a skill in which these mime troupe veterans were well seasoned, and they had had the whole drive to Michigan to script their piece. Long-haired, beaded, earringed, and high, the Diggers jumped around and speechified, claiming authority through the sheer joy and authenticity of their existence. To Gitlin, they were “countercultural toughs.” But the SDS Old Guard recognized that these performers were merely inhabiting some version of life that the “Port Huron Statement” itself called for: one independent and “personally authentic” with “a quality of mind not compulsively driven by a sense of powerlessness,” not repressing “all threats to its habits” but spontaneous, intuitive, and with “an ability and willingness to learn.”[^56]

What was decisive to Gitlin, in regard to SDS as an institution and its goals for “Back to the Drawing Boards,” was that the Old Guard had permitted the Diggers to “derail” the meeting, and in the days following the surprise performance, energy for making plans was unavailable. “No organization was founded,” he recalled, “no further plans sketched.” If the Diggers’ brand of direct action was, in the end, “farcical,” at least they seemed to endorse the growing opinion that under the conditions of the surge, conventional politics was unnecessary. The youth had the numbers to “go it alone.” Now wasn’t the time for alliance building; now was the time for “upping the ante of militancy.” The Old Guard was unable to harness that urgency, and members’ failure of authority “prefigured a larger chasm between political and cultural radicals.” The two modes of analysis diverged. As Gitlin put it, the New Left was now “the Old New Left,” and “its seams were showing.”[^57]

But the Michigan experience caused schism within the Digger brotherhood, too. Early on, Grogan had proposed that to frustrate the press, all Digger activities be attributed to his name, and that the story be floated that it was all a put-on, that no Emmett Grogan actually existed. It was another inspired ploy, but by now the mystery had attached to the name a kind of Bonnie-and-Clyde outlaw status. To call on the name Emmett Grogan was to be a member of the cognoscenti, whether you lived in the Haight or in some midwestern college town. On the drive back to California, the others seemed to grasp this consequence. Grogan felt the chill. For him, it marked the end of the brotherhood. Again the Gitlin and Grogan memories align. Grogan’s “family” was “coming apart at the seams.”[^58]

By the time the Diggers arrived back in San Francisco, the Summer of Love was upon them. School was out, and the “hordes” of flower children were descending. Grogan dismissed most of them as middle-class poseurs, “experimenting with hunger,” and yet by showing up, they were now part of the community. Where would these newcomers sleep? What would they eat? Who would care for the acid casualties? The Diggers had claimed this sort of material responsibility for the Haight, and Grogan was overwhelmed by the prospect. Again he escaped to New York, where he hustled a plane ticket to London to attend the Congress on the Dialectics of Liberation.[^59]

### MENTAL TURF

Whatever expectations were held for the London congress and whether its aim to “demystify” societal violence was taken seriously in less radical circles, few could question the currency of the topic itself. The gathering was to be held in July, and in June the nation of Israel took quasi-preemptive military action against its hostile neighbors in what would come to be called the Six-Day War. A few days later, China conducted its first successful test of a hydrogen bomb. In early July, a military takeover was carried out against the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In the United States, more cities erupted in race-based violence: Tampa, Buffalo, Newark. Meanwhile, the war in Vietnam and protests against it continued to serve as the larger backdrop. Some responses to this climate of violence emphasized unity and inclusion, drawing upon and endorsing aspects of the sexual revolution. In Britain, homosexuality was decriminalized, and in the United States, laws against interracial marriage were deemed unconstitutional. On June 25, a television program called _Our World_ was the first to be broadcast internationally by satellite and was viewed by hundreds of millions. It ended with the Beatles performing their new song, “All You Need Is Love.”

As Bateson readied himself for his trip to Europe, his reading continued along the theme established with _The Sword in the Stone_ and _On Aggression_. His Waimanalo friend the writer Philip Wylie had sent Bateson a draft copy of his latest book. Like Lorenz’s book, and like T. H. White’s, Wylie’s work extrapolated from natural history to societal violence and was caught up in the same current of topical concern that the Congress on the Dialectics of Liberation intended to address. The manuscript, to be published the following year, was called _The Magic Animal_.

Wylie was Karen Pryor’s father. The Wylies, Pryors, and Batesons all lived within blocks of each other and often socialized. For more than three decades, Wylie had been a journeyman writer of astounding range: magazine short stories, two dozen genre novels, screenplays and teleplays, and works of social commentary. His most famous book was 1942’s _Generation of Vipers_. Written in six weeks and selling many thousands of copies, the book was a nonfiction screed against American mediocrity. It brought the concept of “momism” into the cultural discourse and so partook of the same patriarchal bias that had bled into the initial constructions of the double bind. Wylie and Bateson were nearly the same age, both lively talkers who enjoyed each other’s company. Wylie was especially interested in Bateson’s response to _The Magic Animal_ since it argued from biology and evolutionary theory, areas of Bateson’s expertise. Wylie’s influences included the nature writing of Loren Eiseley and Joseph Wood Krutch, but his latest manuscript was most indebted to the work of Konrad Lorenz.[^60]

In _The Magic Animal,_ Wylie argued that civilization’s current moral crisis, and the doomsday perils of modern warfare, had sprung from humankind’s refusal to reconcile itself to its animal nature. Especially problematic was the relationship between sex and death. The original division of an organism into male and female meant a great evolutionary advance. The offspring of separate rather than single organisms provided a much greater palette of genetic variety from which nature could select. Yet because no environment could bear such explosive procreation, the gift of sex required the death of individuals. Unable to accept death, human beings, the magic animals, responded with magical thinking.[^61]

To illustrate, Wylie offered a reworking of the Garden of Eden story. In his version, admittedly an “outrageous parody,” Adam and Eve got drunk on fermented apples and discovered sex. The overwhelming experience gave them a vision of Paradise, “a wild dream of eternal life.” In the sick hangover that followed, they were ashamed of the creaturely pleasures they enjoyed while intoxicated: “the sense of omnipotence of their own wonder and splendor—that heightening of reality sought today in pot and LSD.” Despite their shame, they were unable to let go of the dream. To compensate they spun stories that cast sexual activity as sinful. This was their mistake, Wylie said. The real sin was the dream of eternal life.[^62]

Like many of his generation, Wylie was dismissive of the political and intellectual aspirations of the insurgent youth nation and yet favorable to the part of its program that concerned the loosening of sexual restrictions. In this, he was representative of a particularly American response to Freud—the belief that the solution to neurosis was less sexual shame and more sexual freedom. To this Wylie added the influence of Lorenz. Humanity’s false _resources/books//Runaway_ Gregory Bateson, the Double Bind, - Anthony Chaney of eternal life were “territories,” Wylie explained, and instinct demanded that they be defended, as if they were actual living space. The source of human-on-human aggression, therefore—the aggression that now imperiled the world—was born of the instinctive demand to defend magical thinking as a kind of mental turf. That turf included most of the world religions, the keepers of belief in eternal life, as well as the secular religion of Marxism. Wylie was the angry son of a Presbyterian minister who had embraced Darwin and Freud. For Wylie, as for many modern people, religion was the source of human warfare. The Presbyterians, the Jews, the Muslims, and the Marxists were separate gangs, each out to prove, by any means necessary, that its illusion was the true one.[^63]

Wylie’s solution to the problem was likewise familiar: to reject all religious illusions and to adopt without flinching scientific truth. It was the old cultural lag argument. Certain segments of society clung to the old myths and resisted conversion. Wylie called for new myths grounded in a naturalist morality based on respect for the great constructors and the survival of the human species as a whole. This commitment to reality would allow “man,” without shying away from technological applications, to “take command of his evolution.”[^64]

Bateson was fond of Wylie. He approved of the importance Wylie placed on the practice of natural history and the ethological insights of Lorenz. The implications Wylie drew from this material, however, were antithetical to Bateson’s views in a number of ways. His differences with Wylie reflected his differences with Lorenz: the term “instinct” made to carry too much water; the foursquare rejection of Lamarck on antivitalist grounds; the inadequate grasp of the post-Macy systemic. At the end of _The Magic Animal,_ Wylie made a case for genetic engineering that must have made Bateson shudder. Still, this was a work that shared in the broader resonance, a resonance shared too by “The Conversion of Tuan MacCairill” and the dolphin mystique. As Bateson thought about what he would say to his audience in London, Wylie’s book too would shape his message there.[^65]  

## Ten: The Curious Twist

Americans arriving in London for the Congress on the Dialectics of Liberation were lucky in the weather. The last two weeks of July 1967 were sunny and warm. The congress was held in an immense yellow brick Victorian railway shed on the north side of London called the Roundhouse, “a gigantic, fantastic dome of a building,” in Emmett Grogan’s description. Abandoned for years, the Roundhouse had lately become a venue for the sort of “happenings” then being staged in old theaters and warehouses in San Francisco and New York: avant-garde arts events and the occasional performance of one of the new rock groups. The central space was a circle, more than fifty yards in diameter, capable of holding almost 2,000 people.[^1]

Attendance was heavy at the congress’s opening. The floor of the Roundhouse was covered with rows of wooden folding chairs along with the remnants of the rails of the original turntable, where train cars were once stored and repaired. Far above was a cone-shaped, louvered ceiling of curved cast-iron ribs and spotlights, which shone down through dust and cigarette smoke into the vast, crowded space. Change was brewing; that was clear. Would this gathering be the moment of ignition? Rumors circulated that, to mark the occasion, London’s water supply would be dosed with LSD.

The program of speakers had changed significantly from R. D. Laing’s initial wish list. Many of the most prominent figures (Jean-Paul Sartre, Werner Heisenberg, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Günter Grass, and Carlos Fuentes), as well as figures more well known today, such as Michal Foucault and Joseph Campbell, had been unwilling or unable to come. Herbert Marcuse, Allen Ginsberg, and Paul Goodman were scheduled as originally planned, as was the director Julian Beck (though not _Marat/Sade_’s Peter Brook). Laing colleagues David Cooper, Joe Berke, and Leon Redler remained the primary organizers. Sensitive to the mood of increasing urgency in light of the past year’s events, they laced the schedule with speakers who shared their more radical Left sympathies: the economist Paul Sweezy, the political scientist and journalist John Gerassi, and the Yugoslavian theorist Gajo Petrović. Some weeks before the opening night, Mircea Eliade canceled his appearance, and arrangements were made for the SNCC activist Stokely Carmichael to take his place. Berke had been trying to enlist Carmichael’s participation for some time, and this late-hour success was applauded. Having Carmichael meant not only greater press attention but also greater relevance. Bateson was scheduled to appear on the first full day of the congress, and Carmichael was scheduled for the second.

Posters, advertisements, and press announcements described the twofold aim of the congress: it would “demystify violence in all its forms” and “explore new forms of action.” The idea was to strike a balance between theory and practice. Although several of Laing’s colleagues had a more direct interest in political activism, all continued to conceive of the event as a drawing together of culturalist and structuralist positions in the debate over the locus of change. A revolution might succeed where others had failed, they proposed, by attending to both “inner” and “outer” realities.[^2]

Despite these hopes for a merger, if there is any single public event where the conflict _between_ perceived structuralist and culturalist positions was played out, it may well have been the Congress on the Dialectics of Liberation. This was partly due to the restlessness of the historical moment. For a host of reasons, the congress became the site where, as one participant put it, “the revolutionary left met the mindblowers.” That meeting was less a merger than a showdown.[^3]

Within its atmosphere urgent for “new programs of action,” whether aimed at culture, at structure, or at both, the congress was also where Gregory Bateson delivered a critique of action itself, of action as a product of conscious purpose. Synthesizing and extending ideas he had worked on throughout his career—most prominently the double bind—Bateson offered a culturalist position made distinct by its mixture of hard science and humanist constructions. It drew both on science’s submerged holistic traditions and on the new Macy Conferences–inspired systemic view. The holism appealed to this audience, and listeners were familiar with talk of oppressive systems. At the same time, Bateson’s intimations of a larger relevance, a greater mind, appealed to the spiritual aspirations of the emerging counterculture. Its Great Refusal was based in no small degree on the incoherence between the inner richness they desired to cultivate and the outer meaninglessness with which an authoritative modern science had surrounded them.

Pressed by his audience’s sensitivity to crisis, Bateson shifted focus from broad social relations to relations between humankind and the environment. The prospects Bateson raised included the likelihood of ecocatastrophe, a relatively new concept to many. For those who answered moral pain with hope in the efficacy of moral action, Bateson’s message was affirming and troubling by turns.

### NAME THE SYSTEM

Aside from Laing’s plenary speech the night previous, Bateson was the first to address the congress in regular session. Standing behind a lectern upon a low dais along one arc of the great round room, Bateson acknowledged the earnest sense of significance that many of the participants, seated before him, brought to the occasion. Here, he said, the very direction of Western civilization would be “on the block . . . for investigation and evaluation.” As in his lecture before the students in Sacramento, Bateson opened with a historical perspective. “Our civilization,” he said, “has its roots in three main ancient civilizations: the Roman, the Hebrew, and the Greek; and it would seem that many of our problems are related to the fact that we have an imperialist civilization leavened or yeasted by a downtrodden, exploited colony in Palestine. In this conference, we are again going to be fighting out the conflict between the Romans and the Palestinians.”[^4]

It cannot be known to what extent these words put audience members in mind of the fighting in the Levant, a month earlier. At about the same time Grogan and his Digger brothers were crashing the SDS meeting in the woods in Michigan, fighting between the state of Israel and its neighbors broke out on the other side of the world. The result of the Six-Day War was an Israeli seizure of new territory—the Sinai Peninsula, the West Bank of the Jordan, and the Golan Heights. Perhaps the events were too recent for their full implications to be grasped, and Bateson didn’t reference the hostilities directly. But they played to the point he was moving toward: whether “that battle [between the Palestinians and the Romans] can be resolved by backing the downtrodden or by backing the imperialists.” If one was going to take up the fight, one had to choose a side, Bateson said.[^5]

But which side? That was what would make things so difficult. In the case of the Six-Day War, who were the Romans and who were the Palestinians? Who the downtrodden and who the imperialists? The United States backed Israel. The Soviets backed Gamal Nasser and Egypt. Among radicals and antiwar activists, however, the conflict couldn’t be viewed solely through a Cold War lens. Support for the state of Israel was traditionally strong among the Old Left, who had also found common cause with the Soviets. The Jewish presence in the peace, antinuclear, and civil rights movements was formidable, and yet despite these movements’ support in general of nonviolence and passivism, it would be hard for many Jews not to celebrate the Israeli victory. At the same time, politicized and increasing militant blacks identified with the Arab inhabitants of the newly seized lands. They were an oppressed caste, not unlike the Vietnamese and other nonwhites fighting against their colonizers. If the Michigan SDS meeting serves as an example of the schismatic pressure on radical and antiwar groups in America, the Six-Day War not only would apply further pressure but also would confuse, irritate, and stymie international relations for many decades to come. In the more immediate aftermath, liberals, leftists, and various radicals faced complicated questions of loyalty.[^6]

As Bateson saw it, however, the problem was deeper than choosing sides, especially in view of the critical expectations surrounding the congress. Certainly, sympathies in the Roundhouse would be with the downtrodden, yet “the ambition of the downtrodden is always to get on the side of the imperialists and to become middle-class imperialists themselves, and it is doubtful whether creating more members of the civilization which we are here criticizing is a very great creative success.”[^7]

In coming years, the Left would view Israel as an imperialist aggressor and condemn the colonization of present-day Palestinians and any settlement of “living spaces” newly seized. But not so many years before, it was the Jews of Europe who were the downtrodden, and the West’s support for the establishment of the state of Israel had been, in some degree, an act of compensation. Again, without referencing any of these matters directly, Bateson pointed out how quickly roles might be exchanged. Therefore, he said, he didn’t want to defend “either the upper dogs or the underdogs.” Rather, he wanted to talk about “the bigger problem”: “the problem of the pathologies and peculiarities of the whole Romano-Palestinian system.” If the side championed one year would be the side confronted the next, surely a fix at some deeper level was called for.[^8]

Bateson’s recommendation to focus on the “bigger problem” resembles in form the move he and his double-bind colleagues made, watching the films of schizophrenics interacting with their families so long ago, from one “stage of awareness” to another. Fixation on taking a side in the Romano-Palestinian battle and identifying emotionally with the Palestinian downtrodden corresponded to stage two, when Bateson and his colleagues began to see the schizophrenics as victims and their family members as victimizers. But the bigger problem arose at stage three, where both Romans and Palestinians were perceived as “equally parts of a larger disordered process.” Bateson’s language, too, recalls Richard Niebuhr’s in his debate with his brother over the question of quietism at the time of the Manchurian invasion. Richard had characterized liberal idealism in matters of war as a futile involvement in “the ceaseless cycle of assertion and counter-assertion.” Unless the bigger problem was addressed, Bateson now said, “our civilization” would only continue to fight on one side or the other, and the battle would “just go round and round.”[^9]

Turning to the more important, “bigger problem,” then, required moving away from politics and into science, or at least into natural history, for the bigger problem also had a historical component. Here Bateson reiterated part of the argument he had made in Sacramento and drew on thinking he had worked out in his correspondence with the historians Charles Gillispie and William Coleman. Lamarck, he said, “probably the greatest biologist in history,” had turned the biological world upside down. Before Lamarck, all species were explained as fixed steps in a ladder that descended from “the Supreme Mind.” Lamarck’s theory of evolution had reversed that taxonomy and proposed instead that explanations start from below. Rather than mind explaining matter, now “the study of evolution might provide an explanation of mind.” Darwin came about fifty years later, Bateson continued, but he was more an obstacle than an advance on Lamarck’s achievement. To defend against attacks from the biblical literalists and semisecular vitalists, Darwinists had to completely exclude “the nature of mind.”[^10]

Only around World War II could the question of mind again be considered. Bateson didn’t mention the Macy Conferences on Cybernetics, but as he had said in Sacramento, he believed its historical moment to be crucial. The science of interrelatedness—the systems, communication, and information theories that came together in cybernetics—again allowed inquiry into the nature of mind. Now, whenever a scientist found information running causal circuits or whenever a scientist found interdependent “loop arrangements,” protecting, conserving, and perpetuating certain truths through communicative processes of self-correction, that scientist had found evidence of “mental phenomena” or of mind.[^11]

Bateson hastened to let his audience know what he meant by “mind.” Although he would work technical terms into his published revision of the lecture, for now he avoided them. He didn’t use the word “cybernetics” but did use the classic illustration. “The steam engine with a governor” demonstrated the mental phenomena he was talking about: “simply a circular train of events, causal events,” triggered by information. The system found balance by self-correcting against “disturbance.” When a disturbance was particularly threatening, the “self-corrective mechanisms” would “work to side-track it, to hide it, even to the extent of shutting the eyes . . . or framing it like a pearl so that it doesn’t make a nuisance of itself.” Yet that notion of what a nuisance was, according to the system’s understanding at the moment, was itself “something which is learned and then becomes perpetuated.”[^12]

The details were beginning to run heavy, and it is doubtful that many were following Bateson with great clarity. Surely, however, certain terms and broader symbolics were registering. Some in the room may have required adjustment to the notion of “system” as neutral. When Carl Oglesby attempted to “name the system,” it was the enemy. Ginsberg’s Moloch and Ken Kesey’s “Combine” were likewise systems to be renounced and resisted. But Bateson was describing a system that could be “self-corrective” and achieve balance. It was as if, by describing systems as characteristic of mind, they could be perceived as congenial and need not necessarily be resisted. Listeners may not have fully grasped the cybernetics, they may not have caught the Lamarck reference, but they surely grasped the romantic gesture. They grasped the holism.

Bateson detailed this holistic vision in a way he hadn’t done before but that the occasion seemed to demand. Three of these “enormously complicated systems,” each of them similarly structured and interrelated, were the fundamental concern of the congress, he said. The first was that of the human individual, and it didn’t matter whether one was referring to “body or soul.” The body was better understood than the psyche, but there was “absolutely no reason to doubt” their systemic similarity and interrelatedness. This was true also for the other two systems: “the society in which that individual lives” and “the eco-system, the natural biological surroundings of these animals.”[^13]

Surely many welcomed this holistic integration. The recursive, circuit-structured, self-correcting information systems that Bateson was describing made for a reality where body and soul were structured by the same processes, and not only body and soul but also family, also society, and also—and here was the relatively new word—ecosystem. The postwar discontented, some of whom called themselves the spiritual generation, were disposed to this sort of holism. So much painful data—so much negative feedback—was coming in from across the board: individual psychosis, the shallowness of material abundance, the persistence of racism, the persistence of poverty, the unrest in the cities, the war in Vietnam, and this new prospect of ecosystem. None of these were isolable.

To those sensitive to the conflict over action that would grip the congress, Bateson sent another broad signal. His was a culturalist position, or so it seemed. The “bigger problem” lay in the inner realm of perception. This seemed in accord with Laing, the leading “mindblower.” Unlike Laing, however, Bateson didn’t restrict himself to psychiatry or the social sciences. He offered the “hard science end of the spectrum,” as he had told Nora Barlow he believed was his charge. Hard science had a compelling authority, but it was one of the authorities “on the chopping block” there in London. Materialist, mechanistic, amoral: hard science was tied to the imperialist powers, the military-industrial complex. It was responsible for napalm and the bomb. Some surely took a stance against a scientific perspective simply on general principle. By offering his audience access to this science of interrelatedness, this science for which “the nature of mind” was legitimate content, with roots in both the distant and the recent past, Bateson permitted his audience to tap the authority of hard science for their own emotional and analytical purposes.

The essential thrust of the criticism of the postwar discontented was congruent with criticism of the modern worldview in general. It distrusted the modern dichotomies—fact and value, ends and means, nature and culture. It longed to reweave these dichotomies in a way that both restored enchantment and commanded legitimacy. Bateson’s way of thinking opened the door to this possibility. In his letter to Coleman, he had spoken of what “we might as well call Mind.” To the audience at the Roundhouse and its spiritual contingent, he was more expansive: “I am inclined to regard the total systemic creature, you see, as mind, and the total systemic ecology as mind, and the culture as mind.” Each had the circuit structure as he had described it. “Call it God, if you like,” he said.[^14]

If Bateson’s holistic message was affirming to many in the audience, he didn’t intend to let them rest long in affirmation. One might be nihilistic about a mindless cosmos, but a cosmos of interconnected systems in which mind was immanent, in which mind was “God, if you like,” rather raised the stakes. To these stakes Bateson now turned.

### THE PARTIAL VIEW

All three systems—the individual, the social, and the ecological—maintained an “uneasy balance between dependency and competition,” Bateson continued. Any “monkeying with the system” was likely to “disrupt the equilibrium,” causing the competitive capacities to reveal themselves in sharp, Malthusian curves. “Something will become a weed,” he explained, “other things will be exterminated, and the system as a system is likely to fall to pieces.” As he had written in his letter to Laing, human society teemed with disruption and disturbance as never before. Evidence of these exponential curves—and the reason for the congress was surely the sensitivity to this evidence—was a sign of a system out of balance. Such signs meant “in some degree a slipping of the system at some point along the curve. . . . It may not go very far, or it may go to disaster. But in principle . . . the balance will run along its exponential curve to a new stopping place, if there is one. And the question is, is there one?”[^15]

Was disaster, in other words, inevitable? Could these exponential curves go into unstoppable runaway? One wonders if any among the listeners shifted in their seats at this note of apocalypse. If disaster was unstoppable, why attend the congress at all? Sensitivity to the need for change and belief in the possibility of change was the zeitgeist that had brought events such as the Human Be-In and the Congress on the Dialectics of Liberation into being. The question that would soon seize the congress was not about the possibility of change but what sort of change was called for at this juncture—culturalist or structuralist, nonviolent or militant, inner or outer. To this zeitgeist, it may have been something of an affront on Bateson’s part to even pose the problem momentarily in such terms. Or perhaps this was a zeitgeist on the verge of a shift. Bateson came to his main point.

“Now let me begin to talk about the mind,” he proposed, the mind of the individual and its relationship to the greater systemic, “the _total_ mind.” That relationship was one of “compartmentalization,” of linkages through which certain information was necessarily unavailable. Consciousness could never have full informational access to the “total mind.” This, Bateson said, was to be expected. In the same way that a television screen could give only a partial and never a full report of all the interior and exterior functions related to it, individual consciousness did not and could not have access to the “total mind.” A single television screen could not report on the inner mechanics of the set, nor could it report on all the functions of the many networks around the world to which it was connected. Likewise, consciousness screened only an arc of what was a much more complex and complete circuital system. In the way a television screen was organized to report on the signals it received from waves picked up by an antenna, human consciousness was organized around something, too: conscious purposeful action.[^16]

Consciousness of purpose, of getting “what you next want”—whether it be “dinner,” “a Beethoven sonata,” or solving a problem—pulled out arcs or “sequences” that did not have the “loop structure” characteristic of the system as a whole. That gave the creature a false impression of its nature. It closed off any awareness of the larger relevance, an awareness Bateson defined as systemic “wisdom.” Thus, the partial view was a blindness to this wisdom. Partiality “proposed” an error that the greater system had to somehow absorb.[^17]

In Sacramento, on the problem of action, Bateson had quoted William Blake: “He who would do good to another must do it in Minute Particulars.” The quote suggested a distinction between sizes of actions, minute particular actions and general actions, actions of scale. Here in London, Bateson retained the distinction between sizes of action. Small errors were more easily absorbed. The lack of wisdom was less destructive. Small actions didn’t worry Bateson so much—“we’ve lived that way for a million years” and perhaps “a great deal longer than that.” What worried Bateson were actions of scale: “Today the purposes of consciousness are implemented by more and more effective machinery, transportation systems, airplanes, weaponry, medicine, pesticides, and so forth. Conscious purpose is now empowered to upset the balances of the body, of society, and of the biological world around us. A pathology—a loss of balance—is threatened.” Actions of scale begot pathologies of scale that tipped the systemic balances in the direction of exponential curves and of a potential “slippage” beyond which any new balance might be struck. Actions of scale could send the system into unstoppable runaway. Thus, on the matter of action, Bateson didn’t propose a general program. Rather, he indicted such programs of scale as the source of the most dangerous systemic pathologies.[^18]

### THE BADGER’S TALE

Much of the thinking in Bateson’s lecture had been worked out in interactions during the previous year with Konrad Lorenz and others. One of these others was Barry Commoner, a biologist and World War II veteran, currently a professor at Washington University in St. Louis. Commoner would become a major figure in the modern environmentalist movement with a 1971 book called _The Closing Circle_. Bateson had recently read his slim first book of 1966, _Science and Survival_.

Commoner was one of the many environmentalists who came out of the antinuclear movement. Since the late 1950s, he had headed the St. Louis Committee for Nuclear Information, an organization devoted to making data concerning the effects of nuclear testing available to the public. _Science and Survival_ brought these concerns together with the kind of ecological concerns Rachel Carson had raised in her seminal work, _Silent Spring_, a few years earlier. Nuclear fallout was no different from pesticides, detergents, and other products in that they all led to unintended damage to the “complex fabric of the biosphere.” The West, Commoner argued, could no longer be so “innocent” in its “faith in science and technology” or so cavalier in scientific applications. As Carson had before him, Commoner advised a more sophisticated and far-sighted science that grasped nature as “an integrated whole” so that scientists and the public could strike a better balance when weighing the risks and benefits associated with a new technology or technological fix.[^19]

Bateson wrote Commoner in May, praising the book. In one section, Commoner had discussed science as “dogma.” The direction of research and the perpetuation of belief were driven at least as much by political and institutional realities as by the pure practice of the scientific method, Commoner claimed. Bateson found this analysis astute. He was heartened by Commoner’s familiarity with Norbert Wiener and cybernetics. Yet despite the troubling prospects the book raised, Bateson judged it too “optimistic.” The presentation was still too linear. “There is a certain implication,” Bateson wrote Commoner, “that all we have to do is to look more steps ahead along the chains of causation with which our technology interferes. The fact that these are circular systems of contingency and that they must always and necessarily return to plague the inventor is not clearly said.” It wasn’t the failure of but rather the “recurrent _success_ of empirical applications” that Bateson believed was “in the end, pathogenic.”[^20]

One consequence of this “recurrent success” was that once a technique was found to work, scientists left the problem and moved on to other matters. This perpetuated within the system of science itself a turning away from knowledge of systemic processes (what Bateson would call in his congress speech “wisdom”): “Trial-and-error repeatedly wins the race against theory because the goals of theory are unlimited and longtime. This sort of thing has happened so repeatedly in the history of medicine that today medical science is almost totally empirical and almost totally without theory. A bag of tricks for dealing with specific diseases.”[^21]

The same process had occurred in evolutionary theory, Bateson wrote Commoner. Here the organism was understood as “a bag of separable tricks” for adapting to the challenges of the environment. Now it wasn’t the scientist who was “supposed to be the applied empiricist” but the organism itself. After a “trick” was analyzed for its utility, it was deemed “adaptive” and explained by natural selection. Research ended there. The result was “a wonderful collection of the devices of different organisms—each more mysterious than the other.”[^22]

Commoner, like Carson before him, was correct to alert readers to the interrelatedness of human activity and the environment, but beyond heightened awareness, both Carson and Commoner called merely for smarter devices and better tricks. In consequence, the “truth” that human beings were bags of separable tricks was reinforced, if in more sophisticated terms. The goal of greater control through applied programs of purposive action hadn’t changed. That goal, to the contrary, was perpetuated.

Indeed, the prospect that human beings were _not_ creatures of this kind was disturbing. The prospect that human beings were not creatures capable of change for the greater good through purposive action was so disturbing as to be a nuisance, one might say, and therefore a prospect to be avoided, shut out of sight, framed “like a pearl,” because, indeed, such a prospect was almost unbearable.

That truth was a kind of pearl, a treasure, and to consider its vulnerability in this moment—this moment of Bateson’s lecture in London—it must be appreciated in its larger context. The conception of the human being as an evolutionary “bag of tricks” had run deep in Western culture for centuries. It endorsed the cult of progress and was further corroborated by the success of the industrial order. It had given Darwin’s theory of evolution the authority of a self-evident truth. Life was depicted, in the most basic accounts, as an evolutionary process of adaptation, a “survival of the fittest,” with humankind as the epitome of that process. A point of pride prior to the catastrophic twentieth century, the view afterward was too deeply ingrained and too deeply cherished to be abandoned. This depiction of life, however, along with the notions of social and political progress it underwrote, had undergone a sober chastening and was more recently in a vulnerable state.

Both this chastening and the degree to which the view was part of the cultural bedrock is illustrated in the book Bateson had read the year previous, T. H. White’s _The Sword in the Stone_. As the novel approaches its final act, the Wart undergoes a final transformation: Merlyn changes him into a badger. In this form, the Wart meets the wise old badger in the woods, and the badger tells him a tale. At the beginning of creation all the embryos stood before God “with their feeble hands clasped politely over their stomachs and their heavy heads hanging down respectfully.” God told them he would grant each a gift: the ability to change their bodies into any sort of tool that they thought would become useful to them “in after life.” Whatever tool they chose they would have to keep because that would be the form each body would take. Each group of embryos was allowed two or three specializations. Arms could be changed for “flying machines,” mouths for “drillers or spoons,” bodies for “boats,” and so on. The badgers asked “to change our skins for shields, our mouths for weapons, and our arms for garden forks.”[^23]

Only the human embryo asked to stay just as it was. It would not alter its body but would “stay a defenseless embryo,” relying on what it could do with the resources of the environment instead. “If I want a boat I will endeavor to construct it out of trees,” the human said, “and if I want to fly I will put together a chariot to do it for me.” God was well pleased and called all the other embryos over to pay tribute to the human for its cleverness: “Now let the rest of you get along, and love and multiply, for it is time to knock off for the weekend. As for you, Man, you will be a naked tool all your life, though a user of tools: you will look like an embryo till they bury you, but all others will be embryos before your might.”[^24]

White’s fabling of human neoteny holds an important place in his novel. It isn’t only the Wart’s last experience as an animal but also Merlyn’s last lesson before his student’s destiny is revealed. But again White made a telling change in his postwar revision. In the 1939 version, the badger’s story ends with God saying, “We are partly sorry for you, Man, and partly happy, but always proud.” He then blesses the embryo and sends it on its way.[^25]

In White’s 1958 revision, the Wart receives the badger’s story with a reverent familiarity. For the Wart, the concept that humankind occupied a special position, between God and the Earth’s other creatures, is one that reached down to fundamentals. Students of Western civilization will recognize in the badger’s tale a reference to Giovanni Pico della Mirandola’s _Oration on the Dignity of Man_, the 1486 testimonial to the power of human freedom and self-transformation that ushered in the modern age. The Wart’s grave reverence for these notions in the 1958 version was precisely what White’s 1939 version had underscored. God was a little sorry, a little happy, but “always proud.” Now, in the 1958 version, God’s pride has evaporated. The badger, too, is unimpressed. Thinking the story to be “a trifle optimistic,” he remarks on the consequences of the human embryo’s choice. Whenever even the kindest of men “was to go for a walk beside a river, not only would the birds fly from him and the beasts run away from him, but the very fish would dart to the other side.” With this change, White injected into his story a bit of what Bateson in London called “wisdom.” Now the Wart’s lesson becomes one of tragic paradox: that the gift of the Creator, and humankind’s crowning glory—the vast adaptability of the species, its powers of consciousness, its status as technical innovator, problem solver, and master toolmaker—comes at the price of estrangement from the natural world.[^26]

At the Congress on the Dialectics of Liberation, Bateson upped this ante with his critique of humankind as an actor of conscious purpose. There was “a trap in this whole business,” he told the audience in the Roundhouse, a “curious twist.” A system was built to maintain equilibrium around certain truths, which had been learned, habituated, sunk down, and perpetuated through the natural history of that system. Those truths were “conserved,” systematically sidetracked, hidden, as it were, from sight. In the human being, one of those truths was the very effectiveness of linear, purposeful action. The curious twist “in the systemic nature of the individual man” was that his consciousness was, “almost of necessity, blinded to the systemic nature of the man himself.” When this partial view was played out in medical science, the discipline shaped itself around utilitarian application. Medical science became “a bag of tricks.” Played out in evolutionary theory, the partial view became Darwinism and the human organism a “bag of tricks.” In none of these realms was human understanding guided by knowledge of the total system, the total mind. The organism adapted, but it was not wise.[^27]

Here the career of the double-bind concept reached a final transformation. Bateson’s “curious twist” was a substitute phrase for the old double bind. It referred not to a mother unable to let her child either believe or disbelieve in her love, and thus punishing the child for responses to either. The double bind now referred to the biological individual and, as it were, Mother Nature. She had raised the human species to think and act as individual organisms with a blindness “almost of necessity” to their systemic nature. Then she punished humankind for that blindness—with pathologies, slippages along exponential, and runaway curves, which may or may not find a stopping place.

What was the escape from such a bind? There was none in theory. Yet Bateson was aware of the concerns of his audience, of the congress’s goal of exploring “new forms of action,” of the great hunger for the wrongs to be righted and something to be done. Could a trick be found in the bag of tricks to solve the “bag of tricks” problem? It was another version of the question about the hand and the little box on the wall, a question Bateson had been pondering for a year. He hadn’t changed his answer; he had only refined it. After more than a century of pathological programs of action at industrial levels of scale, “I think we are beginning to achieve,” he said, “a little humility.”[^28]

Calling upon humility, calling _for_ humility, was a safe bet, most times. These were not most times.

### LAY ON STOKELY

Fourteen months earlier, SNCC had divided over concepts like that of “humility.” This wasn’t the first time SNCC had led the way in matters of movement dynamics. In a May 1966 meeting in Nashville, more than a year before SDS’s Drawing Boards meeting, SNCC had likewise “labored to remember and revise the founding assumptions.” The student group, established as a wing of Martin Luther King Jr.’s Southern Christian Leadership Council, had always perceived itself as more pragmatic than its sponsoring organization, and lately King’s approach struck some in SNCC as too humble.[^29]

In radical political thought, at least since the time of Voltaire, concepts like “humility” were tainted by their association with the church. In the face of vexing hardship, priests and ministers counseled humility, symbolized by Christ on the cross. They encouraged parishioners “to pray to that image of their helplessness,” as Marat says in _Marat/Sade_. If human rights were “natural,” so the thinking of some SNCC members went, winning rights was not a matter of supplication. It was a matter of claiming and taking. So at the meeting in Nashville, in a surprise ousting, SNCC president John Lewis, a southerner and pastor in King’s mold, was replaced as president by someone more secular and who represented the more aggressive thinking. That person was Stokely Carmichael.[^30]

Born in Trinidad and raised in New York City, Carmichael revered King, but to Carmichael nonviolence was merely a strategy and not a spiritual principle. In changed times, strategies changed. Since that Nashville meeting, however, SNCC had only continued to splinter. Just a year later, Carmichael resigned from SNCC. His association with the term “Black Power” had become too problematic and his sudden prominence too disruptive of SNCC’s tradition of democratic leadership.

Carmichael’s account of his initial “Black Power” speech, in his 2003 memoir, _Ready for Revolution_, captures the intensity of the period. During six years of organizing for SNCC in the South, Carmichael had endured danger, beatings, and multiple incarcerations. The “March against Fear” in June 1966 brought Carmichael the opportunity to work with King more closely than ever before. The atmosphere of the march into Mississippi was particularly ominous. Carmichael was enraged to hear that among the troopers whom the state had assigned the task of security included the man who had shot Medgar Evers in June 1963 as well as the suspected murderers of the three civil rights workers killed in June 1964. Now it was June again, and these men were lawfully authorized to keep the marchers safe.[^31]

The goal of integration must have seemed repugnant under such conditions. During the march, when King came under threat from onlookers, Carmichael had to be restrained from defending him. “Lay on Stokely!” King had cried out. Not since he had been with SNCC had Carmichael come so close to breaking the discipline of nonviolence. Later he was jailed for a trespassing offense, and upon release the next evening he spoke at a rally and “dropped” the new slogan: “Black Power.” The crowd welcomed the term with celebration.[^32]

Carmichael would deny that Black Power was a call for violent revolution. Rather, Black Power meant the building of legally recognized political constituencies, made of black voters and led by blacks. It meant blacks determining their own goals and controlling their own resources, apart from the patronage of white liberals. In his memoir, Carmichael insists that King never disagreed with this understanding of the term but only believed the phrase itself was too incendiary. The press immediately focused on the term, creating a false picture of Carmichael as the militant foil to King, the peaceful integrationist. Carmichael’s instant notoriety brought him a deluge of speaking engagements. Increasingly frustrated by an unwillingness of the press and others to accept his explanations and increasingly fraught by the attempts of authorities to jail or deport him, Carmichael grew more strident, which further enflamed reactions.[^33]

This was the Carmichael who arrived in London for the Congress on the Dialectics of Liberation. In his memoir, where the congress appearance emerges as a central story, Carmichael explains that he felt a duty, as the most significant activist and nonwhite among the primary speakers, to liberate the theory-heavy European leftists with “a healthy dose of reality.” Records of his performance support the claim. Influenced by Afro-Caribbean thinker Frantz Fanon’s _The Wretched of the Earth,_ Carmichael had come to believe that the colonization of “people of color” in Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the ghettoization of blacks in American cities were the like results of the same Western imperialism. In both cases, the critical category was race. The insight moved Carmichael from a domestic strategy of racial independence to a strategy of international coalition with Third World revolutionaries. In Europe, and particularly at the congress, he had hoped to make the contacts necessary to build alliances. Seeing the roster of speakers, however, and hearing Laing’s opening address, Carmichael soon intuited that he was merely the token civil rights activist whom the event organizers had selected in their late-term efforts to bridge theory and practice. The speech Carmichael delivered, which he titled “Black Power,” was defensive, thick with invective, and had something in it of dashed expectation.[^34]

“I’m not a psychologist or psychiatrist,” Carmichael remarked, signaling a structuralist stance. “I think it’s a cop out when people deal with the individual.” Most of his talk was an outline of the concept of institutional racism as understood by Fanon and early postcolonialist discourse. Echoing Bateson, however unwittingly, Carmichael identified the Roman Empire as the seedbed for imperialist exploitation. It was the British Empire, however, that had added the racialist component. Western civilization, under British sway, “let color be the sole choice of the people they would exploit,” Carmichael charged.[^35]

The Roundhouse was full to capacity for Carmichael’s speech, the crowd supplemented by a large contingent associated with Michael X, Britain’s equivalent to the late Malcolm X. Much in the speech was designed to play to this contingent and, at the same time, to make his cospeakers and white listeners squirm. Carmichael spoke of being a boy in Trinidad, dreaming of coming to London to burn it down. He quoted Che Guevara on the necessity of hatred to transform rebels into “cold killing machines.” Carmichael “demystified” violence in the sense that he exposed its justification in a racism deeply entrenched, but he ridiculed the notion that nonviolent means could ever bend power toward justice.[^36]

Much in Carmichael’s analysis, however, overlapped into perceived culturalist positions, such as Laing’s. The concept that power was manifested in the ability to construct and control language was central to Carmichael’s discussion of institutionalized racism. To control language was to control psyche. When identity and desire were defined by “the masters,” the consciousness of people of color was distorted. The result was “psychological murder.” Carmichael didn’t make the point directly, but it was well supported in Fanon that this distortion was particularly damaging to the male’s ability to embrace his manhood. “Only when one’s _true self_ . . . is exposed,” Carmichael said, “can society proceed to deal from a position of clarity, and not from one of misunderstanding.” The line might have come from David Cooper’s manifesto.[^37]

These overlaps between phenomenological and postcolonial analysis point to difficulties in framing the conflict in a culturalist-structuralist scheme. If the selves of people of color were constructed of imposed definitions, what made the construction of white selves any less imposed? If one set material-structural iniquities aside and entertained the psychological, the more privileged were just as programmed as the less. Orthodox Marxists would insist that analysis stay focused on the distribution of material resources so as to avoid precisely these confusions. One needed to be clear on where the line was drawn between victim and victimizer. The overlap between approaches made that less clear. Carmichael’s focus on race, supported by the abundant facts of race-based injustice, permitted him to blame on institutionalized racism what Laing and Cooper—and Carl Oglesby, for that matter—blamed on more general conditions. The question remained whether this more general blaming was, as Carmichael charged, a “cop out.”[^38]

Not a few were disturbed and even repulsed by Carmichael’s speech. Yet it was hard to avoid Carmichael’s implication that disagreement was a sure sign of unconscious “patterns of white racism.” The reason the congress convened “to talk about violence,” Carmichael charged, was “because the West is always upset by violence when the black man uses it.” An unsympathetic commentator later described Carmichael’s talk as “charismatic but derivative and machine-like,” but that conclusion required a degree of moral certainty not easily summoned under the conditions of the day.[^39]

The agonized conditions that surrounded the congress put culturalist positions on the defensive. Later in the week, Herbert Marcuse would speak. At the start of his lecture, Marcuse, the German social philosopher who mixed Marx and Freud even more prominently than Laing mixed Freud and Sartre, was careful to remind the audience that “flowers by themselves have no power whatsoever.” Marcuse was addressing those in the hall who were wearing or carrying flowers, but he was also responding to the gauntlet Carmichael had thrown down. American cities were burning, most recently Newark and soon Detroit. Third World revolutionaries in Vietnam and elsewhere were fighting against the imperialist superpowers for their lives. Now was not the time for theorizing. Now was not the time, as Carmichael had put it in another speech, for “intellectual masturbation.” Now was the time to join the fight.[^40]

The congress’s marquee event was held on the Saturday night following Carmichael’s Tuesday speech. It was a panel discussion consisting, one might say, of the gathering’s alpha wolves: Carmichael, Allen Ginsberg, R. D. Laing, and, in a last-minute addition, Emmett Grogan. Carmichael had set the tone. In a lamé shirt and dark glasses to dim the harsh camera lights, he continued to play the role of provocateur. He boasted of being recently jailed for trying to kill a policeman. When an audience member asked whether he had had a rifle, Carmichael leaned over and whispered, sotto voce, “I always have my stuff with me.” At one point, Ginsberg was pressed to explain what “real” actions hippies were taking to combat current problems. He spoke of efforts to raise awareness and “to leave the money wheel.” In response Carmichael dismissed hippies as “confused little kids who have run away from home and will return to their culture within a year or two.” When an audience member accused Carmichael of advocating violence rather than working to stop it, Carmichael shouted him down. “Have _you_ stopped it? It’s my survival I’m fighting for, white boy! . . . _You_ are the descendants of the violent society! What have _you_ done to stop it?”[^41]

In addition to underscoring his point about institutional racism, here Carmichael touched a nerve in the culturalist position: to refuse to recognize that one had to take a side in an existing conflict amounted to an evasion of that conflict. According to a structuralist position such as Carmichael’s, what Bateson had called stage two in the “progress of awareness” was the proper stage of human political action. What he had called stage three was an error of abstraction, and those who favored it showed their true colors, for its result was a bourgeois collaboration with the overlords.

Laing are not shown) and audience reactions. _Peter Davis,_ _www.villonfilms.com]]._

Grogan and Laing, each of them also wearing black shades, added little to the discussion. Grogan rolled a joint on the table and smoked it. He made a short speech about the necessity of taking violent action against one’s own interior “to tear away the shreds of myth and absurdity that we’ve been encased in since we were born.” Laing sat apart from the rest, on the far side of Cooper, the moderator. This was Carmichael’s show. His audience was boisterous, with pockets of hostility, pockets of support. Against charges of hate-mongering and reverse racism, Carmichael chopped at the air with a pointed finger, shouting over and over, “Have _you_ stopped the violence? What have _you_ done?”[^42]

Ginsberg’s position on the stage that night, in the context of his recent experience, reflects the dynamics of the period. At the Human Be-In, six months earlier, he had cast himself as the holy fool, chanting, dancing, lost to joy. On the stage in present company, Ginsberg was forced to play the voice of reason, and his face showed his discomfort with the role. He offered the point that in regard to stopping the violence “both in this hall and in Vietnam,” no one had done anything, neither the “white boys” nor “black power.” The remark did little to calm the general restlessness.[^43]

### GARDEN STORY

Many later accused Carmichael of hijacking the congress with his own agenda. But it wasn’t Carmichael alone, so much as a deeper fissure dividing the radical camp. The summer was seeped in an urgent reckoning with violence and the expectation of momentous change. The result was a culturalist-structuralist face-off that Carmichael did not create but enacted. Bateson spoke to the congress the day before Carmichael did, and in the question-and-answer period that followed Bateson’s talk, he faced the same structuralist challenge that Carmichael would soon dramatize. Structuralists such as Carmichael saw themselves as the superior realists against the self-deluding, culturalist “confused little kids” and cloud-dwellers. Bateson met this challenge by raising the prospect of ecocatastrophe and in doing so met realism with realism.

He had been talking for about an hour. All of his substantive points had been made. He had spoken of systems as characteristic of mental phenomena. He had spoken of Malthusian curves, purposive action, and the curious twist that “almost by necessity” diverted human individuals from systemic wisdom and the total mind. He now moved to shore up his theme.

“You know, there’s a story about a garden,” he began. Bateson never shied from illustrating his points with biblical passages, lines of poetry, and snatches of myth, and now Philip Wylie’s manuscript was fresh in his mind. Bateson hadn’t agreed with Wylie’s extrapolations, but he must have delighted in the rhetorical possibilities of the Garden of Eden retelling. To those present in the Roundhouse, Bateson now offered a garden story of his own. The garden he had in mind, he said, “wasn’t really a garden, it was more like an eco-system. It had many hundreds of species . . . living in great fertility and balance, with nice fertile soil, and so on. And in that garden there were two anthropoids who were, as such things go, rather brighter than the others. And on one of the trees there was a fruit which was rather high.”[^44]

Adam and Eve put their minds to the problem. They gathered bricks, boxes, and logs and began to stack them. Finally, the stack was high enough for them to climb up and reach the fruit: “Then they became almost drunk with excitement: by God, this was the way to do it, you make a plan, A B C, and you get it. They then began to specialize in doing things this sort of way, you know, which was essentially casting out from the garden the concept of their total systemic nature, and its total systemic nature. And after they had cast God out of the garden, they really went to work on this purposive business and pretty soon, you know, they lost the topsoil. When they’d lost the topsoil, Adam found that gardening was much harder work, and he had to get bread by the sweat of his brow, and he said, ‘Oh, it’s a vengeful God.’”[^45]

Bateson continued to elaborate. He was working toward a depiction of the “free enterprise system” and the “Industrial Revolution” as purposive action at levels of scale having reached a sort of progressive zenith. But suddenly he broke off from his story: “You know, I don’t believe President Johnson is really happy,” he said. It wasn’t “just a lot of beatniks” who knew things were very wrong. “A much wider spread of the population” thought so too, “consciously or unconsciously.” Bateson doubted that Johnson really believed “he can get out of Vietnam a solution that will last him more than a couple of years, maybe three years if he can keep it going.”[^46]

It was an odd but telling digression. What was the connection between the garden story and Lyndon Johnson? Two years into the initial escalation and already the truth seemed clear: there was no stack of boxes high enough to reach the apple in Vietnam.

More than that was going on, however. Certainly there were those in the audience who were disposed to such a conclusion. But the first audience member to take the hall microphone to ask a question of Bateson, a young American man, referred to Bateson’s talk as “the most unwise of discussions.” He rejected Bateson’s argument that the system was “degenerating.” What looked like degeneration to the ruling classes was, from a Marxist standpoint, evidence of “success.” Bateson’s error was the “gestalt analysis” that sought “the largest field,” blinding him to the “history of conflict of two groups.” Struggling to make his point—and suffering catcalls from the crowd at his stops and starts—the questioner, too, broke off and said, “I _don’t_ believe that Johnson is having a painful time, I think Johnson is enjoying himself, actually.” The room erupted into applause of the sort that Carmichael would elicit a day later.[^47]

The comment had tapped an unwillingness in the room to extend to Johnson the empathy Bateson had. Perhaps this was an instance of the puritan intolerance he had spoken of in Sacramento, the narrowing of responses available to the children of the House of Atreus. That is to say, perhaps it wasn’t so much a matter of unwillingness but of inability. Such intolerance is understandable, and the questioner’s point was a serious one. Johnson’s policies were resulting in the deaths of untold numbers of Vietnamese, not only combatants but also women and children. Outrage shook the voice of the young man at the microphone. By framing his concept in a familiar biblical narrative, Bateson may indeed have brought the point home to his listeners, and yet in the structuralist-culturalist divisions that permeated the mood of the gathering, such a rhetorical flourish also put him on vulnerable ground.

Universalizing myths that depicted the source of the problems under consideration as the natural consequence of a flaw intrinsic to human partiality was just the sort of culturalist move structuralists derided. Placing blame on “mankind” in general promoted pious passivity, moral paralysis, an indulgence only the privileged could afford. The error of abstraction, of seeking, as the young man put it, “the largest field,” made it hard to see the real conflict and consequently to admit who the real enemy was. A decade earlier, in Palo Alto, Jay Haley had raised a similar argument. The systemic approach overlooked the fact that power was “central to human life.” Power and force were central to the most fundamental accounts of reality, and so “the moral issue” concerning the struggle for power would always, as Haley put it, “introject itself into the phenomena.”[^48]

Once again, Bateson resisted accounts of reality that centered on force and power. He favored, instead, a new orientation, centered not on force but on information. In responding to the young man at the microphone, Bateson didn’t refute Marx. Marx had “made a considerable contribution” to systemic thinking, Bateson said. But the approach that Bateson was taking now was not possible in Marx’s time. Now, so many decades later, development in thinking about systems suggested that joining the fight, no matter whether one fought for the Romans or the Palestinians, could result only in a short-term solution. Bateson didn’t entertain the fact that what he seemed to be suggesting on this issue of “joining the fight” was a quietism with a long history in philosophical and theological thought. As he had said in Sacramento, he wasn’t depending on moral “preachments.” He was arguing from the post-Macy science of interrelatedness.[^49]

Bateson’s point bears review because it is a difficult one. The “bigger,” more abstract problem was a matter of habit based on fundamental premises about reality—how reality was thought to be known, how reality was perceived. These habitual premises were continually reinforced, heavily invested with emotion, and deeply sunk into the unconscious processes of mind and body. They were the truths that defined humankind, that humankind protected, and that, when they were shown to be falsehoods, caused pain. What was causing pain now, to Johnson but also to society in general, was that the deep truth of purposive action, the truth foregrounded in the badger’s tale, was proving to be a falsehood. Clearly, changing the premises that supported this truth, if it were even possible, would be no simple matter. Yet in Bateson’s view, the potential for change or replacement of erroneous habits of perception lay in the processes that had formed them to begin with: processes of learning that occurred at a remove of greater abstraction. For this new learning to take place, awareness needed to be aimed not directly at the mechanisms of the habit itself but at the more abstract processes of habit formation.

Bateson’s response to the angry young man, then, was to make a point he had been making for almost a decade. It was the place to which Bateson had taken cybernetics since the Macy Conferences, and it was what set him apart from both culturalists and structuralists at the 1967 congress: the foregrounding of life as mental activity, as learning; the forms and patterns of the material world as the natural history of mind. The difficulty was that the contents of the “bigger” or “meta” problem (mind, mental process, habit formation, learning to learn) seemed so distant from the contents of the less abstract or concrete problem (exploitation, oppression, poverty, racism, psychosis, and war). Thus, in the atmosphere of the congress, one that would only be heightened by Carmichael’s talk the following day, a structuralist impatience with Bateson’s argument is not only understandable but expected. Structuralist positions didn’t tend to see the meta and the concrete as linked in a class-member relationship. Rather, structuralists saw them as isolable phenomena. In the structuralist view, there were inner religious problems and outer political problems, and these problems were non-overlapping. There were the problems humanists dealt with and the problems empiricists dealt with, and these problems were non-overlapping. Even when structuralists granted that the human interior was a legitimate locus for change, that locus fell in priority far below the exterior locus of material conflict between the rulers and the oppressed.

Another audience member, waiting his turn at the microphone, challenged Bateson on precisely this point. He grasped Bateson’s “dichotomy between problem-solving” and the “wisdom of total systems” but added, “The majority of people in the world right now cannot have the luxury of trying to reach the wisdom of the total system.” Nor could the people in the Roundhouse “allow ourselves this sort of luxury.” “If we are going to reach a knowledge of the higher system,” he said, “this knowledge will have to be reached while working through these [other] problems, and if the [systemic] knowledge is less complete because of that, it will have to be that way.”[^50]

Objecting “only to the word luxury,” Bateson then introduced a concept that few were aware of but that many would remember. The phrases “climate change” and “global warming” would not come into use for many years. The “greenhouse effect” was first reported in the mid-1950s, but the notion of an atmospheric blanket formed by the burning of fossil fuels that let light through but held heat in was far from familiar. A recent issue of the journal _Science_ had mentioned it, but Bateson probably had it in mind because Barry Commoner devoted a couple of paragraphs to the topic in _Science and Survival_. To his audience in the Roundhouse, Bateson explained the greenhouse effect and the potential consequences of a rise in global temperature, even of a few degrees: the melting of polar ice, a rise in sea level, agriculture devastated. To this he added “three or four more major destructive possibilities” and gave odds for major ecological catastrophe at “something between ten and thirty years.” Bateson readily acknowledged the point that people were suffering now. But thinking about the more abstract problem wasn’t a matter of luxury. It was a real and urgent necessity, too.[^51]

The specter of sudden apocalypse through nuclear war had certainly been contemplated by the postwar generation. But an apocalypse due to “a slow poisoning of the atmosphere,” as Allen Ginsberg would put it years later when he was remembering Bateson at the congress, was a concept many were yet to process. Given what Bateson had said about purposive action, there is some irony in his raising the possibility of ecocatastrophe. Doing so only added to the mood of urgency and, in turn, to the anxiety that sought relief in the demand for programs of action to begin with. At the same time, it made Bateson’s notion of purposeful action as human tragedy and human treasure all the more persuasive. Even Wylie had offered a solution to his scenario of nuclear doomsday: the magical animal needed to reject magical thinking, truly embrace what science revealed, and then take control of its evolution. Bateson didn’t hold out as a solution the old prospect of greater control. Rather, that was the premise he indicted. Here was the double-bind dynamic as it verged on panic. Here was the feeling of slippage, of runaway, accelerating. Here was Yossarian’s world closing in on him. Here were Camus’s enclosing walls. The more one turned to the trusted old truth, the more painfully it was refuted, and the more the terms of the paradox converged.[^52]  

## Eleven: Love and Trust

The Congress on the Dialectics of Liberation was scheduled to last through July 30, a total of sixteen days. It must have been tempting for Bateson to say his piece and then remove himself and his family from the disorderly scene. A number of the principal speakers and prominent attendees were lodged in a row house in Hampstead, seven blocks away from the conference site. Bateson, Lois, and John were supplied rooms. (Eric was spending the summer with his biological father.) Allen Ginsberg was there, as was Emmett Grogan, who arrived in London with a crossbow. Brandishing it around the Hampstead row house, he claimed he had been “sniping for cops” in Newark, where the latest rioting was in progress. In the evenings, after congress sessions ended, lodgers and other guests gathered in the common rooms for talk. They sat in circles and passed around jugs of wine. John Bateson, at sixteen, drank from a jug that was dosed with LSD and spent a night of anxious terror. Bateson delivered him the next day to Boswells, the Barlow estate, and placed him in the care of his old friend Nora Barlow. Bateson then returned to London where he and Lois remained in the thick of it. Not everyone who attended had heard him speak, but coming first among the keynoters meant that his talk had a heightened impact. By staying at the congress as a participant himself, Bateson would continue to shape that impact and to gain a sense of how his message was received.[^1]

Bateson had taken up the challenge many had in this era. He had, so to speak, “named the system.” Without giving up his charge to provide the hard science, without surrendering the critical faculties, he had called it “the total mind.” In a boon to the spiritual contingent, he had even bid his listeners to think of the greater system theologically if they preferred, to “call it God, if you like.” But what Bateson gave with one hand, he seemed to take away with the other. There was “a trap in this whole business,” a “curious twist,” an almost necessary blindness that put people at the mercy of ecological calculations beyond their control. In Bateson’s reworking of the Garden of Eden story, purposeful action—not pretension or disobedience, not savage aggression, but conscious, purposeful action—was the original sin.

Bateson’s extension of the double-bind concept brought to an earnest, anguished, and utopian sixties conversation a late-forties and fifties postwar sense of paradox, tragedy, and limitation. Human beings were able to transcend their situation enough to perceive the trouble they were in. But they could not transcend their situation enough to remove themselves from the trouble. Reinhold Niebuhr had provided a definition of the “nature of man” in strikingly similar terms. Secular writers such as Albert Camus, Joseph Heller, and Kurt Vonnegut had offered comparable impossible-dilemma constructions. Human beings could transcend and not transcend; they could remove themselves and yet never be removed.

How did Bateson’s construction differ? A revision Bateson made to the published version of his congress speech offers a partial answer to that question. The weakest moment in his talk had been his story of the garden. He had chuckled a few times while telling it, but the mildly irreverent piece of speechcraft may have amused him more than it should have. All those who stood in line at the microphone and questioned him afterward grasped his basic point, but their criticisms pointed to the traditional weaknesses in the quietist position that Bateson seemed to be taking. Perhaps the criticism he received prompted his revision. Perhaps he had intended to say more but ran out of time. But a paragraph added later to his speech in publication took the analysis a step further.

“A parable, of course,” Bateson observed, “is not data about human behavior. It is only an explanatory device.” The device revealed, in traditional narrative terms, the sin, so to speak, of human partiality. But it also revealed something further. The story itself proposed an act of “what is called by psychiatrists ‘projection.’ The man, after all, has acted according to what he thought was common sense and now finds himself in a mess. He does not quite know what caused the mess and he feels that what has happened is somehow unfair. He still does not see himself as part of the system in which the mess exists, and he either blames the rest of the system or he blames himself. In my parable Adam combines two sorts of nonsense: the notion ‘I have sinned’ and the notion ‘God is vengeful.’” Both the concept of self and the concept of God so projected were “fundamentally arrogant. Either alternative assumes that the individual human being has total power over the system of which he or she is a part.”[^2]

This provided the last piece in Bateson’s depiction of the double bind in which humankind found itself, in terms of its relationship with the total system. To organize awareness in accord with purposeful action was “a truth” that perpetuated itself through the very contours of perception. It was a response long rewarded, a habit deeply sunk. It was the gift in the badger’s story, the proof of dominion over all the other species. It was also a fallacy, an illusion, a rebellious affront. It was the fount of pathology, whether aimed at problems on the inside or on the outside. Humankind would be held accountable for it, more than likely by disaster and eventual doom. Finally, there was no escaping the field, not even through some sophisticated philosophical, psychological, or theological “projection” that identified Mother Nature/God as vengeful and the human species as fatally flawed. That projection, Bateson claimed, was only a continuation of human partiality: “We can in some degree set ourselves to learn even such abstract characteristics as arrogance or humility, but we are not by any means the captains of our souls.” If accepting this depiction was what Bateson meant by systemic “wisdom,” then one must ask how this wisdom differs, if at all, from defeatism and despair.[^3]

### CARMICHAEL, LAING, GINSBERG, AND GROGAN

It is probably inevitable that an event such as the Congress on the Dialectics of Liberation, surrounded by such anticipation, would be followed, for many, by a sense of anticlimax. No great historical change immediately ensued. Memories of participants, looking back from multiple decades, are shot through with fond nostalgia and the knowledge of subsequent developments. Several remark on the congress’s lack of female voices, the overtly “masculine” mode of presentation, and the preening egoism among the all-male bill of speakers. “Nor was there any serious account of the domination of nature or issues of sustainability,” remarks another. These comments serve as a reminder of how incipient were the environmental and feminist movements in the summer of 1967. One participant recalls a group of six “incensed” working-class women, with nothing of the vogue of Swinging London about them, who took over the stage and “raged and swore.” Their grievances had more than a little in common with the “separatist politics” of Stokely Carmichael, which alarmed so many, women included. The term “sustainability” would not be used, as it is today in the discourse of environmentalism, for some years to come. In regard to concerns about “the domination of nature,” however, apparently there were those who took part in the congress but did not attend Bateson’s presentation.[^4]

In other ways, the decades-old memories of participants jibe with commentary recorded closer to the congress and its aftermath. Several remember how discussions at the congress, not only in the Roundhouse but in the streets outside, turned on a confrontation between “the libertarian left and the mainstream left” and questions of “activism versus education and persuasion,” the “personal versus the political.” Some sensed that Carmichael had divided the congress with his fiery second-morning speech. Certainly, he attracted the bulk of attention the congress received from the mainstream press. During his time in London, Carmichael addressed audiences at venues outside the congress, too, including a crowd at Hyde Park. Amid accusations that he was fomenting violent revolution, authorities moved toward deportation, and Carmichael’s passport was revoked.[^5]

Carmichael would continue in his efforts to build alliances in the Third World. He would also deepen his association with the year-old Oakland group, the Black Panthers. Within a few years, however, when its leadership proved willing to accept aid from white sympathizers, Carmichael would repudiate the Panthers, too. Eventually he settled in the African nation of Guinea-Conakry and changed his name to Kwame Ture. He would come to admit that Martin Luther King Jr. had been right about the phrase Black Power and would describe that period of his life as “a ride on the tail of a comet.” It had never been something he could control. The concept of Black Power to Stokely Carmichael was a microcosm of the movement in general to its purported leadership. So vast and amorphous was the rising up in the wake of war escalation, atop two decades of post-atomic trauma and a decade of riveting civil rights activism, that it defeated attempts to shape or direct it.[^6]

Something similar can be said about R. D. Laing and the congress. The feasibility of the event had been conceived upon the foundation of Laing’s renown. Surely many who came did so because of him, because of a favorable impression of his work and thought. Certainly, he cut a provocative figure at the Roundhouse, “dressed in black like a pop star.” This was a period of transition for Laing. Philosophically, he had moved to a position too much at odds with clinical psychiatry to ever return to it. In future years, he would continue to experiment. His early 1970s musical performances (Laing was an accomplished pianist) would not be well received. If Laing had perceived the congress as a platform upon which to extend his viability as a public intellectual, he must have been disappointed. His thought did not dominate the agenda. More than one participant noted the immediate dislike Laing took for Carmichael. One oft-told anecdote concerns a dinner Laing held for the gathering’s biggest stars. To Carmichael, Laing remarked, “You know, Stokely, I like black people but I could never stand their smell.” Those who overheard were embarrassed and appalled. Choosing action, Carmichael got up from the table and walked out.[^7]

In his published overview of the congress, David Cooper described an “oscillation” between “activist” and “theoretical, contemplative” poles, represented not by Carmichael and Laing but by Carmichael and Bateson. Cooper congratulated participants for “living out this dialectic.” A more astute commentary was offered by an educator, activist, and sometime journalist named Roger Barnard, writing for _New Society_, a month after the congress ended. Like Cooper and so many others, Barnard recognized the event’s primary confrontation. Attention was divided between “aggressive and exploitative violence” perpetrated upon the psyches of the inhabitants of the “affluent West” and “revolutionary violence by the deprived peoples of the Third World.” The latter prevailed at the congress by winning the moral high ground. The speakers who followed Carmichael were careful to register their realism, and a certain impatience with theory took hold. Despite the lessons of history—as Barnard described them, “the dismal record of attempts to take control of institutions”—and despite the repeated ways in which charismatic militant leaders were “done in by the demon of power,” the structuralists persisted in making their “strong case.” As a result, “violence was not demystified.” Rather, mystification progressed.[^8]

Barnard’s analysis also invoked a third position, near to that of the culturalists but also distinct. This position saw a problem where few others saw one because this position described a reality in opposition to what the majority took pride in and praised: the very range of human freedom and the possibilities it proposed. Barnard admitted that this position, too, had a strong case. It did no good to reassert “the traditional liberal belief in progress” in the face of society’s multifold and interrelated crises. “We seem to be at the mercy of forces that are radically out of control,” Barnard stated. The problem with the third position, as Barnard saw it, was that it could only lead to a “sense of powerlessness” against forces “gigantic, abstract, impersonal, and pervasive.” This was the old moral paralysis that Reinhold Niebuhr had complained about in his debate with his brother Richard over the invasion of Manchuria. As a result, Barnard asserted, the congress failed “from the word go.” It was unable to put forth any “new politics,” any prescription to answer diagnosis. Barnard himself hoped for “the beautiful potentialities of scientific reason” and “the humanistic sense of purpose that could set men free.” His rhetorical merger of ends and means recalls that of Margaret Mead and Lewis Mumford at the outset of world war. Perhaps, Barnard speculated, there was hope in “some kind of social engineering.” The only alternative seemed to be a quietist resignation to doom.[^9]

Barnard had heard Bateson speak and described the presentation as “excellent.” Barnard did not, however, connect to Bateson by name the third position he perceived or claim that any singular voice had articulated it. Certainly, paralysis of will, resulting from a systemic snipping off of resistance at the bud, was a primary characteristic of Herbert Marcuse’s “one-dimensional man,” the blend of Marx and Freud that was so influential to the thinking of the New Left. And a few other speakers evoked apocalypse. But only Bateson offered an extended discussion of the kind of situation and implied response that Barnard’s commentary portrayed.[^10]

When Ginsberg wrote about the congress, in a piece published anonymously some months later in _The Digger Papers_, he did mention Bateson by name, and what he took away from London and brooded over afterward closely matches Barnard’s assessment. Bateson had impressed upon him the “scientifical apocalyptic aspect of the anxiety syndrome that we’re suffering from.” Ginsberg spoke, too, of the consequences that would follow “a carbon dioxide layer over the atmosphere”—“a temperature rise of 5 degrees,” the melting of the polar ice caps, an inundation along the continents of seawater—in a trend irreversible “after 30 years.” The prospect, he admitted, weighed him down and made him wonder whether it was worthwhile to go on. The tone of this _Digger Papers_ piece could not contrast more starkly with those published the year previous, such as “Trip without a Ticket,” in which true-life actors assume their freedom and break out in ecstatic play.[^11]

Emmett Grogan’s time in London initiated a low period in his life. In _Ringolevio_, he describes a speech he made to the congress, a few days after his appearance on the Saturday evening panel. On the surface, the speech was an inspiring one. An “environmental revolution” was “swelling like a storm among the youth of the West.” The youth had an “inner unity of will” and a “unity of spirit,” Grogan declaimed, concluding with a rousing, “Power to the people!” When the standing ovation his listeners gave him ebbed, however, he informed them that the speech they had just heard was one Adolf Hitler had delivered “at the Reichstag in, I believe, 1937.” The crowd was still for a moment, then burst into a clamor of outrage. Grogan smiled, waved, and exited the room: “Thank you ’n be seein’ you,” he said.[^12]

Did this actually happen? Probably not. But why would Grogan invent such a story? Perhaps he had an important point to make about how the spiritual collectivity imagined by the hippie contingent tapped historical currents in fascism. Perhaps he meant to demonstrate, once again, the trickster side of his persona. Or had the double game become for him a temptation he couldn’t resist? _Ringolevio_ recounts Grogan succumbing to another temptation during his time in London. In the company of William Burroughs, he shot heroin for the first time since kicking the habit at the age of fourteen.[^13]

Grogan returned to the Haight and again took up the free food service, making daily deliveries in the truck. He had enjoyed the work before, but now he found it lonely and thankless. He pushed on, but it was “the nearest Emmett had ever come to making himself insane.” By the time the Summer of Love was over, the Haight was a “tension-filled, terror-stricken ghetto” where, as another witness put it, the lambs were picked off by the “wounded coyotes.” It was during that season that one of these wounded coyotes collected a few lambs, formed a “family,” and moved to Los Angeles. The August 1969 Tate-LaBianca murders would come to symbolize the all-too-real horror of the counterculture’s radical program and its perceived failure to bridle the utopian.[^14]

Certainly, Grogan was looking for a family, too. Throughout his memoir, he frames his social program in terms of practical action on a small scale—at the level of “Minute Particulars,” as it were. He loved the “brotherhood,” the flesh-pressing interaction of community work, but was so fiercely competitive that he ran into trouble whenever matters of status came into play, which was always. Although in London he had promised himself “never again,” Grogan was unable to control his addiction. He would die a junkie twelve years later on a subway train in New York.[^15]

### THE RIDDLE OF THE SPHINX

The following year, the Institute of Phenomenological Studies published a collection of the major speeches delivered at the congress, edited by David Cooper. Bateson revised his contribution, which he titled “Conscious Purpose versus Nature.” In his shaping of what had been an extemporaneous talk, Bateson added the paragraph to his Garden of Eden story that illustrated the concept of projection. He also built in a new ending. In fact, the lecture as given hadn’t had a proper ending. Bateson had strayed into a digression that he ceased abruptly when Laing, in the role of moderator, called him for time. In the published version, Bateson addressed in more detail the question of “new modes of action.”

Because actions organized around conscious purpose and lacking systemic wisdom were pathological, Bateson suggested instead a different class of action. These were actions not only small-scale but indirect. They were actions open to “what Freud called the royal road to the unconscious.” Although he didn’t use it here, Bateson preferred another Freudian term to express his meaning more accurately: primary process. Primary process was the sole realm of experience that much of the animal world inhabited, though perhaps not the higher mammals, and certainly not the human species, with its highly developed skills of symbolic communication. Primary process was the timeless realm of experience prior to conscious thought, prior to any digital mode of linguistic signification, and thus empty of the class-member paradoxes that so easily generated double binds. Primary process spoke, as it were, the language of dreams, where all events existed simultaneously and without contradiction.[^16]

In therapy, Bateson explained, dream material was often curative because it tapped into primary process. Access to primary process aided in systemic correction by promoting systemic wisdom. But dreams were not the only curative creations: “I think we should lump together with dreams . . . the creativity of art, or the perception of art, and poetry and such things.” In subsequent discussions, Bateson would add to this list nonutilitarian scientific inquiry—his own practice—as well as what might be called communing with nature. Like dreams, these activities weren’t organized around conscious purpose. Less narrow and goal-focused, they incorporated data from the “total self.” The “whole individual is involved.”[^17]

In that sense, Bateson’s prescription was culturalist. He recommended interior change to individual consciousness. But the practices he advocated to effect this change didn’t propose a direct, linear solution to a problem. Nor did they propose an ideal state of being and then devise a program to reach that state. Rather, these were activities more reflective of religious practice. Indeed, in his list of remedial activities, Bateson included with dreams and art a class of phenomena he called “the best of religion.”[^18]

Ever since his unexpected meeting with John McCaffrey in San Francisco, Bateson had understood totemism as a mode of systemic correction. Totemism put people in touch with their animal “pasts” and gave them a way, to use the phrasing of Bateson’s Adam and Eve story, to let God back into “the garden.” Evident in his early descriptions of the double bind in consultation with Alan Watts was the suggestion that Zen Buddhism offered avenues toward systemic wisdom. For Bateson, elements of the Christian ethos might also be included in “the best of religion”—probably not its dogmatisms, but likely, for instance, the parables of Jesus: open-ended, nonimperative, indirect.[^19]

Bateson was more forthcoming on this point about religious practice in a letter to Philip Wylie written shortly before the congress. He had read Wylie’s _The Magic Animal_ and his friend’s condemnation of religion. Religion generated the imaginary “territories of time” that persuaded the human being that it was not an animal but a transcendent, magical being. In instinctive defense of these territories, human collectives had evolved to the point where they now threatened each other with nuclear destruction. Bateson agreed with Wylie on the seriousness of the threat, but Wylie’s argument, Bateson wrote, was “surely wrong.”[^20]

In Bateson’s view, the original sin and behavioral cul-de-sac was not magical thinking but conscious purpose. Modern technology amplified that sin, but “even before modern technology, something had to be done about the innate split between consciousness and the rest of the mind, because the unaided consciousness would always wreck human relations.” What had to be done, Bateson wrote, was religion. Religion propagated love, love of the larger system of which all organisms were a part, love for and between organisms within the system. Religion was “whatever they could devise to beat into man the fact that most of him . . . was systemic in nature and imperceptible to his consciousness.” This included dreams and trances, intoxication, castration rituals, human sacrifices, myths of all sorts, invocation of death, art, poetry, music, and so on.[^21]

In this passage, all of Bateson’s disciplinary interests—biology, anthropology, information and communication theory, cybernetics, psychiatry, and ethology—come together to offer a scientific explanation of religious practice that did not reduce religious belief to the sublimation of instinctive “forces” or to a defensive cultural concoction laid over material reality like an epiphenomenal glaze. There was better and worse religious practice, just as there was better and worse scientific practice. All such bodies of belief were full of heresies. But the “best of religion,” of art, and of science were not distancing practices but efforts toward loving integration. By addressing the “semi-permeable” division between consciousness and the total mind, these practices helped to put the organism in league with its larger relevance and the ways of systemic correction.[^22]

In July of the so-called Summer of Love, Bateson hadn’t used the word “love” in his lecture. Perhaps there was too much easy talk of love going around already, what with the ubiquity of the Beatles’ musical argument and its like that love was “all you need.” But in his May letter to his friend Philip Wylie, Bateson was less restrained: “Love is contrary to conscious common sense because love involves the total _systemic_ mind . . . love is precisely that to which the pragmatic, headstrong, purposive consciousness must always be allergic.”[^23]

There was another moment Bateson let down his guard, two days after his congress lecture. On that day was a screening of a documentary by a young British filmmaker, Roy Battersby, and Bateson led the panel discussion that followed. The documentary, titled _The Challenge_, presented material that readers of _Silent Spring_ would have found familiar, material that would grow familiar in the coming years as attention to ecological matters became increasingly intertwined with the other concerns of the discontented. Battersby, Ginsberg, Laing, and Francis Huxley were there with Bateson on the stage, fielding questions.

The mood was grim, the questions pained, as participants struggled to come to grips with overpopulation, pollution, and ecological disintegration. Bateson compared the film to Barry Commoner’s _Science and Survival_, useful in raising a systemic analysis but overly optimistic in not taking that analysis far enough. Twice Bateson was asked whether he was completely hopeless and twice he denied it: “Things don’t have to be as bad as they are.” The congress and the constituencies it represented were reasons themselves for hope. Yet the “pigs are not going to run around ready roasted even when we’ve put the pieces together.” Bateson used the same odd metaphor in Sacramento. What he meant was that though important discoveries had been made about the systemic characteristics of nature, there was still a lot of thinking to do.[^24]

But what sort of thinking would it be, if not the thinking of a solution-oriented, utilitarian science? “Well we face, I think,” Bateson said, “a basic division in this room, one that perhaps ought to be brought out.” Was the challenge “a matter for thought,” he asked, “or is there a point at which thought has to let go?” This was Bateson at his most self-critical. He was a scientist, after all. Rigorous, rational thought was his forte. But was that rigorous rationalism itself partly an obstacle? He continued: “I think it’s reasonable, with the mess we’re in, to say we ought to think a little bit about what steps would set free the heart. But there may be a point at which we have to let loose one’s thinking and let the heart do its thinking with its systems of reasons, which the reason knows not of. I don’t know, but I think one of the things that we are heaving and pushing around, and one of the differences of opinion in this room, is at what level thought should surrender to the processes of the heart.”[^25]

Here Bateson made reference to another favorite quote of his, one by Blaise Pascal: “The heart has its reasons which the reason does not at all perceive.” It sounded sentimental, but Bateson didn’t mean it that way. He liked to think that Pascal’s conception of the heart’s reasons were not “inchoate forces” but some manner of algorithm “as precise and complex as those of consciousness.” Surrender to the processes of the heart was not surrender to irrationalism but surrender to trust in those processes as pathways to the larger relevance, the total mind.[^26]

This final point about trust might be approached in another way. Among the main speakers at the congress, Bateson alone brought the ecological question to the center of the debate over the locus of change. And alone among the main speakers at the congress, he called to meet the necessity of change with humility. Evident in this is an important distinction between Bateson and the other congress participants discussed. Laing, Carmichael, Grogan: none of these called for humility but rather a marshaling of individual will. They urged the social self to answer its ancient call for heroism. For Laing, the heroic act was to journey into a dangerous interior, to perhaps find some new way of being beyond the exploitative, emotional nexus of social conflict. For Carmichael, the revolutionary hero was called to fight, violently if necessary, for structural and institutional power on behalf of people of color and in doing so define his own masculine identity, apart from the definitions of even the most benign of his would-be colonizers. Grogan provided a telling mixture of these two approaches. His idea of cultural heroism included the quest to “make real what you imagine” alongside a devotion to face-to-face service to his community of brothers and sisters, his tribe, his Ringolevio team. There were many points of resonance and commonality between all these thinkers at the congress, and Bateson doesn’t stand completely apart. But alone among them Bateson refrained from calling for an act of will on the part of the heroic individual self. Rather, by shifting focus from the relationship between human and human, between “sinful,” earth-bound human and transcendent, “vengeful” God, to the relationship between the human and the larger, immanent ecology of its existence, Bateson challenged and complicated self as a fixed category.

The terms “transcendent” and “immanent” here recall once again the “fraternal war” between Richard Niebuhr and Reinhold Niebuhr over the moral significance of human agency. In the final essay of their three-part debate, Richard argued that transcendence and immanence were what distinguished his brother and himself as theologians. For Reinhold, history was “perennial tragedy” because atonement lay outside history in a transcendent realm. If this was true, Richard reasoned, then action on behalf of moral ideals could never be more than “hopeless compromise,” the sole benefit of which was to salve the consciences of the strong, that the order it imposed upon the weak might be made less savage. But if the good was immanent, was “the structure in things,” then history was not perennial tragedy but a tragic prelude to an atonement that was “better than human selfhood but at bitter cost to that selfhood.” On this “road to fulfillment,” humankind might help to clear the way, not through the marshaling of will and self-assertion but through love, repentance, and forgiveness. Humankind’s gifts were not gifts of willed goodness or force but were communicative acts of discernment.[^27]

Here Richard Niebuhr’s Christian terminology overlaps with that of Bateson’s science of interrelatedness. When the modern line drawn between self and environment was not sacrosanct but permeable—when contexts were not isolable—all inquiry was self-inquiry. The data that it generated indicted the purposeful, instrumental self. Yet that self was central, definitive, enshrined not only in myth but in perception, and to conceive otherwise was unbearable if not impossible.

Both Niebuhrs were in agreement that the point of religion was to dismantle humankind’s moral conceit. For Bateson, this was the point of science, too. At the Congress on the Dialectics of Liberation, among the social theorists and political actors, he offered the “hard science end of the spectrum.” His scientific-naturalist critique of action foregrounded the limitations of the active, heroic, purposive self and counseled a humble, chastened recognition of the determined and dependent aspects of all behavior. That was the content of “systemic wisdom.”

But if systemic wisdom was the wisdom people sought, then what became suddenly important was their emotional response to that which they were determined by and dependent upon. What attitude to strike before the fact of utter dependency? The question is a crucial one and haunts all holistic views of nature. If people could not wholly trust their rational minds to answer that question, could they trust their hearts?[^28]

This too was a matter of critical discernment. Bateson’s belief was that the new science of complexity and interrelatedness allowed people to think and talk about things such as their relationship with their ecology, war, psychological pain, and right and wrong with scientific rigor, without resorting to mysticism or moral preachments. Bateson insisted that depictions of reality were self-reflective and reinforcing, and so if people accounted for the reality beyond themselves as material, amoral, and mindless, then they would account for themselves as amoral mindless machines. But if people attributed to the reality beyond themselves the complexities of mind, they would not strip out from their analysis issues of right and wrong, and an account of themselves as moral beings would follow suit. Epistemological questions—questions about how reality was known, perceived, and accounted for—were not different from religious questions. Who are you to me? Who am I to you? They converged at the riddle of the Sphinx.  

## Epilogue: The Back End of the Probe

For Allen Ginsberg, what was most decisive about the Congress on the Dialectics of Liberation was his exposure to Gregory Bateson. On one of the event’s last few days, Ginsberg gave his own lecture. In it, he spoke of Bateson and climate change, material he would later work into his _Digger Papers_ piece. The rising of ocean levels might benefit “Porpoise Power,” he surmised. It would surely be devastating for the “human mammal.” Bateson’s message had unsettled Ginsberg, and he struggled to shape a response. The ramifications were too complex to be stated concisely, but Ginsberg offered something of his emotional reaction: “The universe doesn’t need our execrable yowling.” There was much talk in London about the benefits of LSD, and now Ginsberg remarked he had had six bad trips. “I’m having one right now,” he said.[^1]

Soon many more would begin to know what Ginsberg was talking about. Writing a decade and a half later, Richard Falk would describe “the apocalyptic encounter” as “being at the brink (ecologically, geopolitically, and epistemologically).” It was, Falk said, the essential postmodern social experience.[^2] Falk’s apocalyptic encounter shared something of the third position Roger Barnard had described at the congress and dismissed as too hopeless. I have used the phrase “emerging ecological consciousness,” but that term doesn’t capture the dynamics of the confrontation. This was a learning that hurt. In his talk memorializing the eminent psychologist Frieda Fromm-Reichmann, Bateson had spoken of the emotional dynamics of inquiry: “When the investigator starts to probe unknown areas of the universe, the back end of the probe is always driven into his own vital parts.”[^3]

The encounter with Bateson contributed to the creation of one of Ginsberg’s most anthologized poems. Written a few days after leaving London, “Wales Visitation” is a contemplation of nature as mental phenomena and larger relevance. The poem came, Ginsberg explained later, from a new “ecological perspective” Bateson had triggered in him. It incorporates Bateson’s concepts of mind and wisdom and, in matters of action, the importance of attending to “Particulars.” Ginsberg’s efforts to process Bateson’s message reconfirmed his belief that moral purpose had its endpoint in atonement, in “unitive experience” and the “friendly extension of self outwards,” as he would put it in more practical terms in _The Digger Papers_. To achieve that, Ginsberg fell back on familiar ground: aesthetic craft, Eastern religious practice, and experimentation in the routines and rituals of “tribal wisdom.”[^4]

These gestures were not so different from those Bateson was making. The language, too, was similar. The “systemic wisdom” Bateson counseled, however, was not presented as an esoteric, speculative system of belief. Rather, it came of a natural history analysis that partook of the authority of science. At the same time, the universe he was describing naturalistically was not the billiard ball universe of forces and impacts but one that allowed for relations between humankind and a higher order—what William James, making a similar effort, had called “the immanent divinity in things.” In this way, Bateson fits nicely into a period of “spiritual” yearning. His thought compares to broader efforts across many fronts to generate accounts of reality that allow for some livable coherence between nature and culture, matter and mind. Bateson stands out in that he did not rely on discussion of transcendent “spirit” but worked rationally toward a revelation of mind immanent in material structure. At a general level, Bateson’s thought pointed toward the same sort of “third way” or “compromise position” between metaphysical/aesthetic and physical/naturalist accounts of the world that liberal theologians had been seeking since the early nineteenth century. But rather than attempt to reconcile religion to scientific naturalism, Bateson suggested how scientific naturalism might be reconciled to religion, broadly understood.[^5]

In other ways, Bateson was at odds with the zeitgeist. His double-bind concept troubled the waters of a period when the goals of radicals could be classed as goals of greater liberation. If the broad Jamesian “religion” that Bateson’s science made room for was despiritualized, it was neither coddling nor complacent. It included grim equivalents to original sin and—not least in the early warning of a greenhouse effect—the prophetic tradition. Certainly, the resonance of the double bind was derived in no small way from ancient data about the human condition. It evoked what William Barrett, in a book published shortly after the first double-bind paper, called “the law of opposites, the oldest tragic wisdom of the race,” to discover “at the height of power . . . absolute impotence.” But again, Bateson’s theory, refined and extended to the reaches of evolution and ecology, gave this wisdom a natural history setting. Bateson’s appeal to Ginsberg and the radical culturalists was his naturalist’s alternative to, in Jacques Monod’s later phrase, “the frozen universe of solitude.” This was a re-enchanted, open, soulful universe—which is to say, whereas the universe was required heretofore to be empty of mind, now it could be perceived as full. Yet there “was a trap in this whole business,” the double bind.[^6]

It is here, in the double-bind concept, where Bateson’s thought both affirms and resists the longings of the times and where one can grasp Bateson’s historical significance and relevance today. The rising awareness of environmental deterioration, sensitivity to dwindling natural resources, pollution, and exploding human population have typically been set alongside the various liberation movements of the period, antiwar activism, and the brief resurgence of militant Marxism. But to do so is to mistake as parallel a difference of greater dimension. The ecological consciousness in a Batesonian frame said that the source of difficulties was not merely the old problem of human predation, animated in constructions of class, race, and gender. Nor was the source of the problem some baser territorial instinct lagging behind a narrow scientism, fixated on technique and culminating in the absurdity (or evolutionary cul-de-sac) of the nuclear arms race. The ecological consciousness in a Batesonian frame said these terrible problems were contained within a larger epistemological error. They were the result of truths, premises, and habits of perception long cherished and protected, perhaps even fatally fossilized. “Purposeful action” was perhaps the deepest of these human truths, and without change at the level of epistemology, even the most critical responses would only take the form of greater instrumentalism, renewed calls for heroism, more complete self-sovereignty, more uncompromising mastery of individual and collective will. This was because purposeful action itself was the pearl in the oyster, the invisible truth cherished and guarded, and this protection came at the cost of a moral pathology that spread into the system at large. Ginsberg’s “Wales Visitation” is a celebratory poem, and yet a wounded, chastened acknowledgment resides in its lines. Amid the “One Being” with its “myriad” history of forms, Ginsberg notes the human presence, a “satanic thistle.”[^7]

Some may have left the congress uneasy, feeling paralyzed, but the time in London heartened Bateson. Unlike many others among the elder generations, his reading of the “spiritual” generation did not portend chaos and societal breakdown. Rather, current discontentment suggested to Bateson the negative feedback required for correction. He would state as much in the published version of his congress speech. He said that although his experience of LSD was thin (the topic was unavoidable), he distrusted it as a technical shortcut to “systemic wisdom.” Yet he judged the current interest in psychedelic experience to be symptomatic of an epochal “attempt to compensate” for human partiality and the destructive errors of scale that had made for, as he would put it in a later phrase, “the epistemological nightmare of the twentieth century.” Although Bateson was no stranger to depression, although he was a man liable, in his daughter Mary Catherine’s view, to “fatalism and futility,” two things about the nascent counterculture encouraged Bateson to hope: its detachment as a kind of default position and its interest in what he had to say. For the alpha wolves at the Congress on the Dialectics of Liberation—R. D. Laing, Stokely Carmichael, and Emmett Grogan—the London event was largely a disappointment, and in its aftermath their lives as public figures would diminish. Bateson’s life as a public intellectual had, in a sense, just begun.[^8]

At the anthropology conference he attended in Austria just prior to the congress in London, Bateson delivered a paper called “Style, Grace, and Information in Primitive Art.” In this essay, with a clarity he had not achieved before, Bateson was able to synthesize a part of his thought that this book has only touched on: semiotics. The paper was well received, and the facilitator of the Wenner-Gren Foundation approached Bateson afterward. Would he be interested in leading his own conference the following summer, there at Burg Wartenstein? Leading a conference meant selecting a theme, choosing and inviting the participants, and facilitating their work together. Bateson welcomed the idea.[^9]

The prospect of his own conference and what it might achieve was surely on his mind during his time in London and may partially explain his relative sanguinity. This wasn’t a time to be hopeless. In recent years, he had been haunted about whether anybody was listening to him. Now he would have his own miniature Macy Conference, shaped by his own agenda. It would give him a chance to bring together the ideas he had been testing and refining for years but in their most recent configurations and infused with the passion and excitement that had surrounded them since the spring of 1966. He would handpick the attendees, just as Laing had. But Bateson’s gathering would not be open to the public, as the congress in London had been. Nor would it be, as the congress was perceived to be, an attempt to intervene in a particular historic moment. It wouldn’t be located in a major city, like London, and its purpose wouldn’t be to disseminate information, to persuade, to strategize, or to mobilize. Rather, Bateson’s conference would be located in a remote twelfth-century castle in the eastern Alps. Its participants would be experts from almost all of the fields Bateson’s work touched on—mathematics, engineering, psychology, anthropology, education, and more—and they would meet alone, live together, and eat together, without distractions. “The pigs are not going to run around ready roasted,” Bateson had told his London audience. At his conference, perhaps he and these select few would be able to roast some of those pigs.[^10]

The essay that came out of the 1968 Austria conference, “The Cybernetics of ‘Self’: A Theory of Alcoholism,” along with a subsequent essay that marked the last major synthesis of his thought, “Form, Substance, and Difference,” written in late 1969, gave Bateson the “ending” necessary for the collection of essays he had long been pondering. The collection was eventually published in 1972 as _Steps to an Ecology of Mind_. The book went through numerous printings in paperback, and subsequent editions were brought out by various international presses in translation. It is regarded as his masterpiece and still serves as the primary resource from which audiences, both lay and expert, continue to know his thought.[^11]

_Steps_ sold well for a book of its kind. Invitations to speak came regularly, but the 1970s was a challenging time for Bateson, in regard to both his finances and his health. An inveterate chain-smoker, he was diagnosed with lung cancer early in the decade. Against the odds, the cancer went into remission, but his research life was over and thus his access to grants. Bateson taught at Kresge College in Santa Cruz and involved himself in writing projects, but never having institutionalized himself, Bateson faced periods of “singing for his supper.” Stewart Brand’s _Co-evolution Quarterly_ and the Lindisfarne Association offered Bateson welcome and occasional sources of income. The cancer returned in 1978. As Bateson recovered from surgery, the leadership at Esalen, the center for New Age thought in Big Sur, took him and Lois in. One senses in Bateson, during his final decade, surrounded by the New Age enthusiasts who helped sustain him, an impatience with the exuberant anti-intellectualism that sometimes characterized the milieu. Perhaps in reaction to this, Bateson’s last book has a pedagogical bent, and though brilliant and full of his usual gifts of expression, it betrayed a few touches of the impatience and condescension he had always strived to avoid. He had wanted to call the book _What Every Schoolchild Should Know_ but called it, instead, _Mind and Nature_; it was published in 1979. Bateson died from his illness at the Zen Center in San Francisco in 1980. He had been at work on a final book. _Angels Fear_ was published in 1987, with editing and added chapters supplied by Mary Catherine.[^12]

All of these books (still in print after decades), and the last one especially, address questions that emerged in the summer of 1967 with what I have called the ecological consciousness. These would be the questions—still quite unsettled—that would characterize the coming decade. How would that consciousness play out emotionally? What would it be like to live that learning? If atonement was called for, what forms might it take?

The ecological consciousness hadn’t been stumbled upon but had come from decades of critical inquiry, not performed by one person but by a great many. Associated with it would be transformations in the cultural politics of the period. Analyses based on economies of abundance would give way to analyses based on economies of scarcity; utopian visions of the “cybernetic Eden” would vie with “cyberpunk” visions of the dystopia to come. In terms of the immediate experience of many, the sixties would take a dark turn, a turn mirrored in political events. For many, atonement would take a “back to the garden” theme: efforts in thought, aesthetics, and lifestyle to return to a state prior to the sin of epistemological error. The communitarian movement would explore the practicalities of detachment and an ethics attuned to “Minute Particulars” and psychedelic insights. Artists and writers working in the interrelated new genres of underground comix and science fiction would process their apocalyptic encounters with raw frankness. Others sought atonement in a political realm. The Weathermen, and their infamous “gut check,” would be one of many such experiments in flexibility where morality met emotion. A young college student named Stephanie Mills, giving the commencement address to her graduating class at the end of the decade, vowed publicly not to have children.

After the summer of 1967, throughout the second half of what historians have called the Long Sixties, many more from across the political spectrum would be drawn to the advocacies of modern environmentalism. The culturalist-structuralist division alive at the congress would find its way into this movement, too, as “social” ecologists debated “deep” ecologists against a backdrop of sometimes militant activism. In science, the cognitive revolution, of which the Macy Conferences were only a part, shaped the new fields of neuroscience, biosemiotics, and more. The age of the personal computer was in gestation. Feminist critiques challenged and shaped responses in all areas of exploration. To give these matters the attention they deserve would double the length of this book. But if the first half of the Long Sixties saw the emergence of the ecological consciousness—a new way to imagine the human relationship with the environment—then one way to approach the second half would be to examine the discomforts caused by “the back end of the probe.”

The paralysis Roger Barnard warned of, however, along with many other varieties of denial, was the far more prominent response. The apocalyptic encounter—the “epistemological panic” caused by the prospect of runaway—undermined what it meant to be a modern liberal humanist, classically understood. It undermined the long-defended line between a subjective “in there” and an objective “out there,” but more than that, it indicted the efficacy of individual and collective human will. This effected a recalibration, across political divisions, of the contours between what is thought to be changeable and what must be resigned to. The former lost ground; the latter gained. The consequences were enormous. Varieties of despair and denial proliferated. The collective movements for change that distinguished the sixties gave way to fracture and a nurturing of the private, and the utopian and libertarian currents of the period flowed toward the other side of the political spectrum. What ensued was a doubling down on precisely those premises the ecological consciousness called into question. The Right had in principle distrusted collective idealism. Now it ceased to chasten assertion, even on an individual level. Its interpretation of humankind in the reductive, economic terms of strong materialism moved into the realm of magical thinking. This is the far larger story. This is the ocean we are swimming in. To encourage individuals to gorge themselves materially and starve themselves spiritually is a dangerous modus operandi. Meanwhile, the hazards threatening human and other life on this planet have exponentially increased.[^13]

As early as 1958, Bateson had imagined a culture in a double bind: “From its own point of view, the culture faces either external extermination or internal disruption, and the dilemma is so constructed as to be a dilemma of _self_-preservation in the most literal sense.” When the culture responds to the dilemma with a plan to action, it preserves a self that can plan and act. Against this most reliable recourse is posed the sheer inescapabilty of double bind. One thinks one has slipped the loop, then perceives that the walls have closed in.[^14]

The human record is rich with witness of something mysterious and joyous in the trap, the enclosing walls. It is there in grace’s gift to the undeserving, in Sisyphus at the bottom of the mountain, putting his shoulder again to the task. William James described the invigorating joy on the other side of the trauma of second birth. He called it “self-surrender.” Consent to dependence draws attention away from data pertaining to control and toward another kind of data, perhaps to the algorithms of the heart.[^15]

Bateson left London with new and renewed friendships. He and Ginsberg had been acquainted in San Francisco in the fifties, and London offered them the chance to reconnect. Among other matters, they had talked about William Blake. It’s hard to image that there was something of Blake’s work with which Ginsberg was unfamiliar, but Bateson promised to send him a book. A more significant friendship was struck with Paul Goodman. In a number of ways, Goodman’s talk to the congress was closest in substance to Bateson’s. He too counseled a rethinking of technology, education in ecology, and a politics of decentralization. In coming years, before Goodman’s death in 1972, Bateson and Goodman would enter into a fruitful correspondence. Bateson would secure a series of lectures for Goodman in Hawaii, and Goodman would settle there for a time, joining Bateson’s social circle, along with the Pryors and the Wylies.[^16]

Immediately following the congress, however, Gregory and Lois joined John at the Barlow estate for the extended visit they had planned. Bateson was in a high mood. Visiting Nora and her husband at Boswells was a time to relax, the tensions of the London congress behind him, the excitement of planning his own conference ahead. A game of croquet was set up on the lawn, surely a nod to W. B.’s love of the game, which he would play in his fez, using his mallet like a Zen archer’s bow. They visited Cambridge and participated in the high table formalities at St. John’s. With Lois and John, Bateson walked over the same hills and woods he had as a boy, on those earliest butterfly- and beetle-collecting expeditions, trailing behind his older and more expert brothers, John and Martin. He had been six years old when the Bateson family had left that Garden of Eden near to Cambridge, but his memories of it were vivid, with the many trips back after the family had moved to London and the friendships and associations he had maintained over the years with the Barlows, the Huxleys, and others.[^17]

Back in Waimanalo by late summer, Bateson began planning for the 1968 Austria conference in earnest. He made contact with those he was sure he wanted as participants: his old Macy mentor, Warren McCulloch; Barry Commoner; Konrad Lorenz. He asked his daughter, Mary Catherine, an anthropologist and semiotician, to serve as conference rapporteur. The dolphin research was frustrating as usual. He wrote Nora Barlow that October, speculating that he would need to lay at least a half decade of groundwork before research might become productive and that it might make more sense to set the research project aside and devote himself to a book that would gather his “thinking of the last twenty years.” His friend Nora, Darwin’s granddaughter, would understand this calculation, considering how old the both of them were.[^18]

An April 1968 letter to Barlow was more upbeat. Nine months had passed since the trip to England, and Lois had given birth to a daughter. Bateson referred again to the golden time they had all spent together at Boswells with renewed gratitude and not a little pride. He would be sixty-four years old the month following, and now he was a new father again. He and Lois had considered naming the baby after his mother, Beatrice, but decided to call her Nora instead.[^19]

## Acknowledgments

This book was built upon the foundation laid by Bateson scholars David Lipset, Rodney E. Donaldson, and Peter Harries-Jones. This implies, of course, no endorsement on their part, but since their works were always before me, oft consulted and ready at hand, I could never forget how dependent I was on their labor.

I depended, too, on the generous aid and access to materials provided to me by the Bateson Idea Group—Nora Bateson, Barry Schwartz, Phillip Guddemi, Wendel Ray, and especially Mark Engel—and for that I am deeply grateful. My deepest gratitude goes also to John, Eric, and Lois Bateson and to Karen Wylie Pryor.

I want to acknowledge and thank those teachers, mentors, colleagues, and friends who offered inspiration, read drafts or chapters of the book, and gave help, advice, critical insight, and encouragement: Susan Briante, Natalie Ring, Clay Reynolds, Lilian Calles Barger, L. D. Burnett, Peter Jay Ingrao, Steve England, and Peter Murphy. I am especially indebted to Daniel Wickberg, who offered guidance and wise counsel all along the way.

I am indebted and grateful to many who were generous with their time and expertise in supplying information, answering questions, offering insights and direction, and making photos and documents available for consultation or use in these pages. These include Martin Levy, Peter Davis, the Don D. Jackson Archive at the University of Louisiana–Monroe, Riccardo Draghi-Lorenz and Dr. Wolfgang Schleidt, Philip Hansen Bailey and the John C. Lilly Estate, and Lisa Law. Special thanks go to the staff at the University of North Carolina Press for their assistance and good cheer, and I especially thank my editor, Brandon Proia.

I’m grateful to Candice and Brian McKay for helping me negotiate the path to publication and to the Herriages, the Pittengers, the Ingrums, and the Richie-Comparinis, whose sustaining friendship was crucial throughout the project. I benefited greatly from the support, both material and moral, of Charles and Fannie Chaney, and also of Rochelle Murphy, who provided the roof under which many of these pages were written.

Finally, no one has contributed more generously or selflessly to the making of this book than Andrea M. Chaney, whose loving gifts of support and encouragement can scarcely be captured in words.

24.]] One might express this division in a number of ways; few are satisfactory. “Mind-oriented” and “matter-oriented” are to be understood in an expansive sense. I use the terms “spirit,” “spiritual,” and particularly “soul” with special care to convey their reference to familiar human experience but not to evoke any necessarily supernaturalist connotations. For further discussion, see Griffin’s introduction to _Reenchantment of Science_, 2–4; and Deacon, _Incomplete Nature_, chaps. 1–4. I found Deacon’s discussion of “absential” (as opposed to “present”) and “ententional” (as opposed to strictly “material”) phenomena to be especially useful.

The neo-orthodox movement in theology arose in the 1930s as an attack on the optimism of liberal theology under question in the political and economic failures of World War I and the Depression. Certainly, a mood and exploration of existential disillusionment drew in turn on romantic responses to nineteenth-century industrial capitalism and, earlier still, on responses to the breakdown of medieval scholasticism.
