## Introduction

Two aspects of John von Neumann’s career were very controversial. Awkwardly, I find myself on his side in both controversies. First, he was more hawkish than most of his friends in framing nuclear deterrence in 1949-55 against Stalin and his immediate successors. I think that some hawkishness at that stage saved the planet. When the draft of this book was circulated to people whom I respect, several scholars and Johnny’s contemporaries resented this conclusion. I hope that I have not anywhere been rude to the great and good men who held a more pacifist view, as Johnny himself carefully was not.

Second, Johnny grabbed other people’s ideas, then by his clarity leapt five blocks ahead of them, and helped put them into practical effect. I think that is one of the things very clever people exist to do. Because Johnny thought his computers would allow “research teams to tackle one hundred times as many projects one hundred times more quickly,” he thought that by now we would have made great scientific advances, such as providing limitless energy through nuclear fusion and controlling the world’s weather. Today such views are regarded as irresponsible. I think that, over the next twenty years, they will come back more into fashion. But I launch this book when I know many eminent reviewers will disagree with me.

All this by a cancer patient in considerable pain.

By November he was in a wheelchair. He told his friends that “it was the result of my operation in August, but is probably psychosomatic.” York said of this time:

He was determined to continue his role in the work of the von Neumann committee, and the air force authorities were at least as anxious for him to do so. I recall several more meetings of the committee in which, after the rest of us were present and seated, Johnny arrived in a wheelchair propelled by a military aide. At first he seemed his normal self, smiling and cheerful, and the meetings proceeded in the customary way with Johnny dominating them intellectually without being at all argumentative or overtly domineering. Later when he came to see that his condition was hopeless he grew more despairing and turned back to the Roman Catholic Church for solace.

In January 1956 Johnny went into hospital again. He came out still in the wheelchair to receive a special Medal of Freedom personally from Eisenhower. “I wish I could be around long enough to deserve this honor,” said Johnny to the president, in one of his first confessions even to his friends that he had known for some time that he was going to die. “You will be with us for a long time,” replied Eisenhower, “we need you.” This was possibly just an Eisenhower bumble, but in many senses Johnny’s work did live on — and has been one of the reasons why the second half of the twentieth century has been nicer than the bloody first half of it.

The twenty-year-old Marina von Neumann had decided to get married straight from a brilliant college degree. Johnny was not pleased. He liked her chosen husband well enough but thought that early marriage would damage an academic career (a reasonable fear for a woman in 1955). He would have been pleased that the fear proved unfounded. Dr. Marina von Neumann Whitman was invited by President Nixon to be the first woman on any president’s council of economic advisers. Johnny turned up in a wheelchair for Marina’s engagement party in early 1956, but was back in the hospital before her marriage.

The great and the important now flocked to his bedside at the Walter Reed Hospital in Washington, D.C. Strauss was frequently there, together with much of the defense establishment, hanging on Johnny’s words like black crows. It was known that Johnny’s illness might lead to him talking in his sleep, and Colonel Ford was told to place soldiers to ensure that he did not shout out military secrets. This was not entirely successful. When Johnny started hallucinating in his sleep, he did so in Hungarian, which the soldier on guard did not understand. At least once Johnny summoned the soldier so that he could ring through a mild new idea he had for the air force in the middle of the night. His old associates on scientific subjects would have found this familiar, but the air force feared he was saying something very important with his last gasp.

These midnight calls probably led to the story that he sent screams from his deathbed through the dark, and that “Johnny von Neumann, who knew so well how to live, did not know how to die.” He did admit his despair to some visitors. He could not visualize a world which did not include himself thinking within it. Some visitors say he was rude to Klari at this time. She was inclined to want to quiet those who would try to make him think while he was dying. He wanted to think as long as he could.

As the cancer had sent lesions near his brain he could not long continue with this. He had the draft of the Silliman lectures beside his bed, posthumously published as The Computer and the Brain. A few parts of that book, especially the end, are superb. Sadly there are other parts that are not up to the usual Johnny brilliance. These were the passages written when the cancer was advancing. “We could never keep up with the speed of his thinking,” said one famous American scientist who is not a modest man. “Until sadly in that last year in the hospital we could.”

The family gathered round the bedside. Michael Neumann read bits from Goethe’s Faust in the original German. Johnny broke in when Michael reached speeches by his favorite characters and proclaimed them with gusto and total recall. In the summer his mother, Margaret von Neumann, was diagnosed as having cancer also. She died of it within two weeks. Johnny had eighteen months from diagnosis to death.

In this period Johnny returned to the Catholic faith that had also been significant to his mother after the family’s conversion in 1929-30. There are those who say he took instruction from the Catholic priest at the hospital mainly because the priest was an educated man, to whom Johnny could talk of classical Rome and Greece better than he could to the soldiers on guard. But Johnny had earlier said to his mother, “There probably is a God. Many things are easier to explain if there is than if there isn’t.” He also admitted jovially to Pascal’s point: so long as there is the possibility of eternal damnation for nonbelievers it is more logical to be a believer at the end. His memory of old Latin was still perfect, and he astonished one deathbed visitor by reciting the Latin declamation that begins: “Judex ergo cum sedebit,” and ends, “Quid sum miser tunc dicturus? Quem patronem rogaturus, cum vix justus sed sicurus?” (When the Judge His seat hath taken... What shall wretched I then plead? Who for me shall intercede when the righteous scarce is freed?)

All his friends, and some who had been a trial to him, were sending messages. Marston Morse’s sounded a bit guilty: “We have stood shoulder to shoulder for two decades. There have been crises in which we had to take unwelcome positions prompted in each case, I believe, by considerations sometimes inevitable, sometimes very difficult to arrive at... The conclusion of my mathematical colleagues with regard to the computer took into account the fact that your historic role of design and initial use of the computer had been magnificently finished.” Gödel sent a letter of condolence about the illness in German, but soon wafted off on to mathematical symbols, asking Johnny’s view on some impossibly abstruse problem. After about September the messages had rather little point, although Klari was gallantly replying to them. Her letter to Veblen on November 13, 1956, was in a mode she used to several correspondents at the time:

    

Dear Oswald

This is to acknowledge your recent letter to Johnny. I read it to him and he seemed to enjoy hearing from you, although by now it is very hard to tell about his reactions. He hardly speaks any more and the only way you can tell is by the expression on his face or the motion of his eyes. However, as well as I could tell, I think he enjoyed just the fact that he received a letter from you — and for this, I want to thank you.

On February 8, 1957, Johnny died. A large congregation arrived at the funeral. He was buried in Princeton cemetery in a plot beside his mother and the 1939 suicide, Charles Dan. The later suicide Klari (who walked into the sea in November 1963) has since then been laid beside them.

The old friends from Los Alamos crowded into a funeral car. York remembers that Bradbury, the postwar director at Los Alamos, spoke a rather better epitaph than the Catholic priest had during the ceremony. “If Johnny is where he thought he was going,” said Bradbury, “there must be some very interesting conversations going on about now.”

## Chapter 1

Much of this chapter came from Steve White’s notes, and from Stanislaw Ulam (both 1958 and 1976). Also from conversations with (inter alia) Hans Bethe, Peter Lax, Nicholas Vonneuman, Eugene Wigner. Published sources (see Bibliography) include Bell, Blair, Burks, Dore (especially Samuelson’s chapter), Fermi, Gleick, Goldstine, Grafton, Halmos, Nagy, Rhodes, Shurkin, Strauss, Taub, Wigner (including the Quantum History Archives). The extended quotation from Lewis Strauss is from his speech at a von Neumann memorial dinner in Washington, D.C., in 1971.

    

## Chapter 2

The two main published sources from which I drew (see Bibliography) are John Lukacs and Nicholas Vonneuman. Other points are from the books by Churchill, Heims, Rhodes. The late Catherine Pedroni (née Alcsuti) had the most encyclopedic memory, and helped me rewrite the second draft of this chapter. Earlier, Nicholas Vonneuman had kindly removed many mistakes from the first draft. Steve White did the main research in and around Budapest; I drew heavily from his notes.

    

## Chapter 3

Once again, much of this came from Steve White’s notes, especially on his Budapest researches and his interviews with William Fellner and Eugene Wigner. By the time I saw the eighty-nine-year-old Wigner in 1990, his memory was less sharp. Much came from my conversations with Vonneuman, Pedroni, Lax. I drew especially on published work (see Bibliography) by Halmos, Nagy, Rhodes, Ulam, Vonneuman, Wigner.

    

## Chapter 4

Steve White’s notes. Published work (see Bibliography) by Bell, Clark, Heims, Reid, Taub, Ulam, Wigner (including the Quantum History Archives). I must thank the rector of the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule at Zurich for responding so kindly with Xeroxed material from his records.

    

## Chapter 5

It will be clear that I differ in opinions from Professor Steve Heims (who found Norbert Wiener a far more attractive character than Johnny) and from Bertrand Russell, but have gratefully quoted from their books (see Bibliography). Much of my summary of the history of math came from books by Carl Boyer and particularly Daniel Boorstin. The extensive quotations from Johnny’s own views on the history of math, and on how to set about the subject, are in his collected works as edited by A. H. Taub. At this distance I assumed it was more convenient to cite this source rather than the various publications or seminar meetings at which they appeared. Other published works helpful in this chapter were (see Bibliography) Casimir, Dore (again, Samuelson’s chapter), Regis, Wiener.

    

## Chapter 6

Published sources again include Casimir, Dyson, Halmos, Hawking, Heims, the Quantum History Archives. Discussions with Peter Lax of New York’s Courant Institute produced the reminiscences from K. O. Friedrichs. Other conversations with Bethe, Dyson, Wigner.

    

## Chapter 7

The opening part of this chapter includes the many stories told about young Johnny, with the selection made from the ones that seem most likely to be true, though maybe with a bias to the jovial. Probably the most frequently cited published sources are Ulam and the Collected Works of John von Neumann, edited by A. H. Taub. But this is also the last part of the story to which Steve White’s notes stretched. And it is the point at which both the von Neumann and Veblen files in the Library of Congress begin to be very useful. Other valuable conversations included those with Bethe, Dyson, Lax, Teller, Françoise Ulam (Stan’s widow), Marina von Neumann Whitman (Johnny’s daughter), and Wigner (including his interview in the Quantum History Archives). But, as the end of the chapter makes clear, the most marvelous interviewee was Mariette Kuper, née Kovesi, and in 1930-37 the first Mrs. Johnny von Neumann. My talks with her in 1990 set the book alight.

    

## Chapter 8

The first part, and some of the middle part, of this chapter owe much to the lively history of the Institute for Advanced Study by Ed Regis (see Bibliography). Other published sources on which I drew include Clark, Feynman, Nagy, and especially Ulam. Reminiscences from Mariette Kuper abound through the chapter, as well as material from mathematical conversations with Lax. The librarians at the Institute for Advanced Study and at the American Philosophy Library in Philadelphia (guardian of the Ulam papers) were very kind to me. However, as this was a period during which Johnny kept his papers more methodically than at most other times, the main sources were again the von Neumann and Veblen files in the Library of Congress.

    

## Chapter 9

Once again the main sources were the von Neumann and Veblen archives in the Library of Congress. The ballistic problems at Aberdeen are described (see Bibliography) in Goldstine and Shurkin. Other material (see Bibliography) from Grafton, Sakharov, Taub. Conversations with Bethe, Goldstine, Lax.

    

## Chapter 10

I hope I express adequately in the text what any writer on Los Alamos owes to Richard Rhodes’s superb The Making of the Atom Bomb. I drew facts and quotations from it. Other material is from (see Bibliography) Alvarez, Clark, Ulam, York. Peter Lax took me to his old stamping ground of Los Alamos, and I met the lively colony of those connected with the bomb who have retired there or near there, including Carson Mark, Nick Metropolis, Foster Evans, Françoise Ulam. Other interviews with Bethe, the late Frederick de Hoffmann, Sam Goldman, Lax, Teller, York. Again, a lot from the von Neumann archives in the Library of Congress.

    

## Chapter 11

When I returned from being an RAF navigator to Cambridge University in England in October 1945, I took the economics tripos and got first-class honors in economics in 1947. I stayed on doing research and some teaching in economics at Cambridge until 1949, just as both The Theory of Games and Economic Behavior and Johnny’s Expanding Economy Model were attracting attention. I therefore wrote the first draft of this chapter early, because I thought I had some competence in the subject. I soon discovered how wrong I was. Johnny’s reputation as an economist has multiplied astonishingly since his death. I rewrote some of the first part of this chapter after the publication in 1989 by Oxford University Press, of John von Neumann and Modern Economics, edited by Professors Mohammed Dore, Sukhamoy Chakravarty, and Richard Goodwin (see Bibliography). The eleven contributors to it included two Nobel Prize winners (Paul Samuelson and Kenneth Arrow), as well as Sidney Afriat, Andrew Brody, John Harsanyi, the late Lord Kaldor, Lionello Punzo, Gerald Thompson. I have quoted views from the book, with I hope proper acknowledgment. I knew the late Lord Kaldor, and had very briefly discussed Johnny with him, but his introduction to the Oxford University Press book fills in the story much more fully. Other published sources drawn on (see Bibliography) include Bronowski, Mansfield, Nagy, and of course The Theory of Games itself.

    

## Chapter 12

The two great published sources are Goldstine and Aspray (see Bibliography), and I have drawn from both. Much of the first and historical part of the chapter comes almost wholly from Goldstine, both his book and the interviews he kindly gave to me in Philadelphia. Other published sources (see Bibliography) include Nagy, Shurkin, Watson.

    

## Chapter 13

Once again Goldstine and Aspray are the important sources (both their books in the Bibliography and interviews). Other published sources mentioned in the Bibliography include Burks, von Neumann’s The Computer and the Brain, Taub (the IAS computer papers appear in the Collected Works), Kemeny, Regis, Smagorinsky, Ulam, Watson, Wiener. Interviews included Julian Bigelow, Cuthbert Hurd (of IBM), Joseph Smagorinsky, Françoise Ulam. The Library of Congress archives are especially useful in the period when Johnny was lobbying for funds and approval of his IAS computer project, and therefore detailing what his objectives were.

    

## Chapter 14

Herbert York’s books (see Bibliography) become especially important sources in these last two chapters. That includes the 1989 second edition of The Advisors, which has an appendix by Hans Bethe. Other published sources include Clark, Regis, Rhodes, Sakharov, Ulam. Interviews included Bethe, de Hoffmann, Lax, Pedroni, Teller, York, and the lively retired community at or near Los Alamos (including Carson Mark, Françoise Ulam, and others) with whom I had a memory-storming joint afternoon and long dinner in 1989.

    

## Chapter 15

Herbert York’s three books are again the best source. I have drawn heavily on them. Other published sources include Vonneuman, Heims, and newspapers at the time. By 1951-56 I was in the United States for The Economist once or twice a year, including four months swapped on to Time magazine in New York in 1952. I became intrigued that everybody in the know said that John von Neumann, who to me was an economist and author of The Theory of Games, was drawing near to the center of American defense strategy. I made requests for interviews, but they were never acceded to — although the rest of Washington, D.C., was amazingly open then to young assistant editors of The Economist. I talked casually about Johnny’s 1952-55 influence to many people at the time and in my next thirty-five years as a viewspaperman. But I think the picture only fitted into place when (as Johnny’s biographer) I read Herbert York’s books. I am also grateful for conversations about Johnny’s last years with York, Marina von Neumann Whitman (Johnny’s daughter), and Nicholas Vonneuman (his brother), and with others who gathered at his bedside in 1956. In his last decade Johnny had fuller secretarial assistance than a professor usually has. His papers in the Library of Congress (including his daily lists of appointments) reflect this.

In writing this book, I have become very much aware that my training is as a viewspaperman rather than a scholar. A viewspaperman when in full employment publishes perhaps one thousand words a day, and is anxious to have his views considered and words used, with or without attribution, so as to keep discussion going. If others use my words, whether or not they agree with me, that gives me a feeling that the topics I have raised in that day’s article are worthwhile. Scholars (unless they are a Johnny) publish far fewer words a year, and can become very cross if somebody repeats them without attribution. Johnny did not belong to this company. He wanted the ideas pulsing each moment through his mind to get quickly into the public domain, although preferably not through journalists. I believe the world can grow richer fastest and cheapest if we can have many more of his like again. I hope that in this book I have not offended against either his or other scholars’ traditions, and have not trodden on toes.    

Macrae on Macrae

Born 1923. RAF navigator 1942-45. Went up to Cambridge 1945. First-class honors in economics tripos, 1947. Did research and some teaching in economics at Cambridge in 1947-49, but left before completing Ph.D. because was already getting stuff published and wanted to get married. Joined The Economist in 1949, and apart from sabbaticals to write eight books and do a little consultancy was there until retirement in 1988. Assistant editor after 1954, and deputy editor after 1965. Have written over three thousand articles, mostly anonymous ones in The Economist, but have also lectured on five continents and written for other magazines around the world. The books published in America were The Neurotic Trillionaire, then America’s Third Century (these were originally my two surveys on the United States in The Economist, but Harcourt Brace Jovanovich reprinted them in the United States as paperbacks), and The 2025 Report: A Future History of 1975-2025 (published in America by Macmillan in 1985). I was a co-author of General Sir John Hackett’s two books on World War III, which sold over three million copies worldwide; I wrote the chapters starting and ending the war, while the generals and admirals wrote the chapters fighting it.

Three surveys I have written on Japan, starting with one in 1962 which prophesied that they were the only country to have got economic policy right, have been published as books in Japan. In the Japanese emperor’s birthday honors in 1988 I was given the Order of the Rising Sun with Gold Rays. In the same retirement year I was made a Commander of the British Empire in Queen Elizabeth’s birthday honors.
