This suggests that we ought to apply Dr Johnson's criterion again. If we want to know whether a given abstraction really exists, we should ask whether it 'kicks back' in a complex, autonomous way. For example, mathematicians characterize the 'natural numbers' i, 2, 3,... in the first instance through a precise definition such as:

> 1 is a natural number.
> 
> Each natural number has precisely one successor, which is also a natural number.
> 
> 1 is not the successor of any natural number.
> 
> Two natural numbers with the same successor are the same.

Such definitions are attempts to express abstractly the intuitive _physical_ notion of successive amounts of a discrete quantity. (More precisely, as I explained in the previous chapter, that notion is really quantum-mechanical.) The operations of arithmetic, such as multiplication and addition, and further concepts such as that of 1 prime number, are then defined with reference to the 'natural numbers'. But having created abstract 'natural numbers' through that definition, and having understood them through that intuition, we find that there is a lot more that we still do not understand about them. The definition of a prime number fixes once and for ill which numbers are primes and which are not. But the _understanding_ of which numbers are prime - for instance, how prime numbers are distributed on very large scales, how clumped they are, how 'random' they are, and why - involves a wealth of new insights and new explanations. Indeed, it turns out that number theory is a whole world (the term is often used) in itself. To understand numbers more fully we have to define many new classes of abstract entities, and postulate many new structures and connections among those structures. We find that some of these abstract itmctures are related to other intuitions that we already had but  {223}  which, on the face of it, had nothing to do with numbers - such as _symmetry, rotation_, the _continuum, sets, infinity_, and many more. Thus, abstract mathematical entities we think we are familiar with can nevertheless surprise or disappoint us. They can pop up unexpectedly in new guises, or disguises. They can be inexplicable, and then later conform to a new explanation. So they are complex and autonomous, and therefore by Dr Johnson's criterion we must conclude that they are real. Since we cannot understand them either as being part of ourselves or as being part of something else that we already understand, but we _can_ understand them as independent entities, we must conclude that they _are_ real, independent entities.

Nevertheless, abstract entities are intangible. They do not kick back physically in the sense that a stone does, so experiment and observation cannot play quite the same role in mathematics as they do in science. In mathematics, _proof_ plays that role. Dr Johnson's stone kicked back by making his foot rebound. Prime numbers kick back when we prove something unexpected about them especially if we can go on to explain it too. In the traditional view, the crucial difference between proof and experiment is that a proof makes no reference to the physical world. We can perform a proof in the privacy of our own minds, or we can perform a proof trapped inside a virtual-reality generator rendering the wrong physics. Pro vided only that we follow the rules of mathematical inference, we should come up with the same answer as anyone else. And again, the prevailing view is that, apart from the possibility of making blunders, when we have proved something we know with _absolute certainty_ that it is true.

Mathematicians are rather proud of this absolute certainty, anil scientists tend to be a little envious of it. For in science there is no way of being certain of any proposition. However well one's theories explain existing observations, at any moment someone may make a new, inexplicable observation that casts doubt on thr whole of the current explanatory structure. Worse, someone may reach a better understanding that explains not only all existing observations but also why the previous explanations seemed to work but are nevertheless quite wrong. Galileo, for instance, found  {224}  new explanation of the age-old observation that the ground beneath our feet is at rest, an explanation that involved the ground actually moving. Virtual reality - which can make one environment seem to be another - underlines the fact that when observation is the ultimate arbiter between theories, there can never be any certainty that an existing explanation, however obvious, is even remotely true. But when proof is the arbiter, it is supposed, there can be certainty.

It is said that the rules of logic were first formulated in the hope that they would provide an impartial and infallible method of resolving all disputes. This hope can never be fulfilled. The study of logic itself revealed that the scope of logical deduction as a means of discovering the truth is severely limited. Given substantive i umptions about the world, one can deduce conclusions; but the conclusions are no more secure than the assumptions. The only repositions that logic can prove without recourse to assumptions are tautologies - statements such as 'all planets are planets', which assert nothing. In particular, all substantive questions of science lie outside the domain in which logic alone can settle disputes. But mathematics, it is supposed, lies _inside_ that domain. Thus mathematicians seek absolute but abstract truth, while scientists console themselves with the thought that they can gain substantive and useful knowledge of the physical world. But they must accept that this knowledge comes without guarantees. It is forever tentative, forever fallible. The idea that science is characterized by 'induction', a method of justification which is supposed to be a slightly fallible analogue of logical deduction, is an attempt to make the best of this perceived second-class status of scientific knowledge. Instead of deductively justified certainties, perhaps we can make do with inductively justified near-certainties.

As I have said, there is no such method of justification as 'induction'. The idea of reasoning one's way to 'near-certainty' in science is myth. How could I prove with 'near-certainty' that a wonderful new theory of physics, overturning my most unquestioned assumptions about reality, will not be published tomorrow? Or that I am in not inside a virtual-reality generator? But all this is not to say  {225}  that scientific knowledge is indeed 'second-class'. For the idea that mathematics yields certainties is _a myth too._

Since ancient times, the idea that mathematical knowledge has a privileged status has often been associated with the idea that some abstract entities, at least, are not merely part of the fabric of reality but are even more real than the physical world. Pythagoras believed that regularities in nature are the expression of mathematical relationships between natural numbers. 'All things are numbers' was the slogan. This was not meant quite literally, but Plato went further and effectively denied that the physical world is real at all. He regarded our apparent experiences of it as worthless or misleading, and argued that the physical objects and phenomena we perceive are merely 'shadows' or imperfect imitations of their ideal essences ('Forms', or 'Ideas') which exist in a separate realm that is the true reality. In that realm there exist, among other things, the Forms of pure numbers such as i, _z_, 3,. .., and the Forms of mathematical operations such as addition and multiplication. We may perceive some shadows of these Forms, as when we place an apple on the table, and then another apple, and then see that there are two apples. But the apples exhibit 'one-ness' and 'two-ness' (and, for that matter, 'apple-ness') only imperfectly. They are not perfectly identical, so there are never really _two_ of anything on the table. It might be objected that the number two could also be represented by there being two _different_ things on the table. But such a representation is still imperfect because we must then admit that there are cells that have fallen from the apples, and dust, and air, on the table as well. Unlike Pythagoras, Plato had no particular axe to grind about the natural numbers. His reality contained the Forms of all concepts. For example, it contained the Form of a perfect circle. The 'circles' we experience are never really circles. They are not perfectly round, nor perfectly planar; they have a finite thickness; and so on. All of them are imperfect.

Plato then pointed out a problem. Given all this Earthly imperfection (and, he could have added, given our imperfect sensory accesn even to Earthly circles), how can we possibly know what we know about real, perfect circles? Evidently we do know about them, but  {226}  how? Where did Euclid obtain the knowledge of geometry which he expressed in his famous axioms, when no genuine circles, points or straight lines were available to him? Where does the certainty of a mathematical proof come from, if no one can perceive the abstract entities that the proof refers to? Plato's answer was that we do not obtain our knowledge of such things from this world of shadow and illusion. Instead, we obtain it directly from the real world of Forms itself. We have perfect inborn knowledge of that world which is, he suggests, forgotten at birth, and then obscured by layers of errors caused by trusting our senses. But reality can be remembered through the diligent application of 'reason', which then yields the absolute certainty that experience can never provide.

I wonder whether anyone has ever believed this rather rickety fantasy (including Plato himself, who was after all a very competent philosopher who believed in telling ennobling lies to the public). However, the problem he posed - of how we can possibly have knowledge, let alone certainty, of abstract entities - is real enough, und some elements of his proposed solution have been part of the prevailing theory of knowledge ever since. In particular, the core idea that mathematical knowledge and scientific knowledge come from _different sources_, and that the 'special' source of mathematics confers _absolute certainty_ upon it, is to this day accepted uncriti-mlly by virtually all mathematicians. Nowadays they call this iource _mathematical intuition_, but it plays exactly the same role an Plato's 'memories' of the realm of Forms.

There have been many bitter controversies about precisely which types of perfectly reliable knowledge our mathematical intuition can be expected to reveal. In other words, mathematicians agree that mathematical intuition is a source of absolute certainty, but they cannot agree about what mathematical intuition tells them! Obviously this is a recipe for infinite, unresolvable controversy.

Inevitably, most such controversies have centred on the validity or otherwise of various methods of proof. One controversy concerned so-called 'imaginary' numbers. Imaginary numbers are the square roots of negative numbers. New theorems about ordinary, 'real' numbers were proved by appealing, at intermediate stages of  {227}  a proof, to the properties of imaginary numbers. For example, the first theorems about the distribution of prime numbers were proved in this way. But some mathematicians objected to imaginary numbers on the grounds that they were not real. (Current terminology still reflects the old controversy, even though we now think that imaginary numbers are just as real as 'real' numbers.) I expect that their schoolteachers had told them that they were not _allowed_ to take the square root of minus one, and consequently they did not see why anyone else should be allowed to. No doubt they called this uncharitable impulse 'mathematical intuition'. But other mathematicians had different intuitions. They understood what the imaginary numbers were and how they fitted in with the real numbers. Why, they thought, should one not define new abstract entities to have any properties one likes? Surely the only legitimate grounds for forbidding this would be that the required properties were logically inconsistent. (That is essentially the modern consen sus which the mathematician John Horton Conway has robustly referred to as the 'Mathematicians' Liberation Movement'.) Admit tedly, no one had proved that the system of imaginary numbers _was_ self-consistent. But then, no one had _proved_ that the ordinary arithmetic of the natural numbers was self-consistent either.

There were similar controversies over the validity of the use ol infinite numbers, and of sets containing infinitely many elements, and of the infinitesimal quantities that were used in calculus. Davul Hilbert, the great German mathematician who provided much ol the mathematical infrastructure of both the general theory of rela tivity and quantum theory, remarked that 'the literature of mathe matics is glutted with inanities and absurdities which have hail their source in the infinite'. Some mathematicians, as we shall see, denied the validity of reasoning about infinite entities at all. The runaway success of pure mathematics during the nineteenth century had done little to resolve these controversies. On the contrary, it tended to intensify them and raise new ones. As mathematical reasoning became more sophisticated, it inevitably moved ever further away from everyday intuition, and this had two important, opposing effects. First, mathematicians became more meticulous  {228}  about proofs, which were subjected to ever increasing standards or rigour before they were accepted. But second, more powerful _methods_ of proof were invented which could not always be validated by existing methods. And that often raised doubts as to whether a particular method of proof, however self-evident, was completely infallible.

So by about 1900 there was a crisis at the foundations of mathematics - namely, that there were no foundations. But what had become of the laws of pure logic? Were they not supposed to resolve all disputes within the realm of mathematics? The embarrassing fact was that the 'laws of pure logic' were in effect what the disputes in mathematics were now about. Aristotle had been the first to codify such laws in the fourth century BC, and so founded what is today called _proof theory._ He assumed that a proof must consist of a sequence of statements, starting with some premises and definitions and ending with the desired conclusion. For a sequence of statements to be a valid proof, each statement, apart from the premises at the beginning, had to follow from previous ones according to one of a fixed set of patterns called _syllogisms._ A typical syllogism was

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_All men are mortal._|
||_Socrates is a man._|
|---|   |
|[Therefore]|_Socrates is mortal._|

In other words, this rule said that if a statement of the form 'all As have property B' (as in 'all men are mortal') appears in a proof, and another statement of the form 'the individual X is an A' (as in 'Socrates is a man') also appears, then the statement 'X has property B' ('Socrates is mortal') may validly appear later in the proof, and in particular it is a valid conclusion. The syllogisms expressed what we would call _rules of inference_ - that is, rules defining the steps that are permitted in proofs, such that the truth of the premises is transmitted to the conclusions. By the same token, they are rules that can be applied to determine whether a purported proof is valid or not.

Aristotle had declared that all valid proofs could be expressed  {229}  in syllogistic form. But he had not proved this! And the problem for proof theory was that very few modern mathematical proofs were expressed purely as a sequence of syllogisms; nor could many of them be recast in that form, even in principle. Yet most mathematicians could not bring themselves to stick to the letter of the Aristotelian law, since some of the new proofs seemed just as self-evidently valid as Aristotelian reasoning. Mathematics had moved on. New tools such as symbolic logic and set theory allowed mathematicians to relate mathematical structures to one another in new ways. This had created new self-evident truths that were independent of the classical rules of inference, so those classical rules were self-evidently inadequate. But which of the new methods of proof were genuinely infallible? How were the rules of inference to be modified so that they would have the completeness that Aristotle had mistakenly claimed? How could the absolute authority of the old rules ever be regained if mathematicians could not agree on what was self-evident and what was nonsense?

Meanwhile, mathematicians were continuing to construct their abstract castles in the sky. For practical purposes many of these constructs seemed sound enough. Some had become indispensable in science and technology, and most were connected by a beautiful and fruitful explanatory structure. Nevertheless, no one could guarantee that the entire structure, or any substantial part of it, was not founded upon a logical contradiction, which would make it literally nonsense. In 1902 Bertrand Russell proved that a scheme for defining set theory rigorously, which had just been proposed by the German logician Gottlob Frege, was inconsistent. This did not mean that it was necessarily invalid to use sets in proofs. Indeed, very few mathematicians seriously supposed that any of the usual ways of using sets, or arithmetic, or other core areas of mathematics, might be invalid. What was shocking about Russell's result was that mathematicians had believed their subject to be _par excellence_ the means of delivering absolute certainty through the proofs of mathematical theorems. The very possibility of controversy over the validity of different methods of proof undermined the whole purpose (as it was supposed) of the subject.  {230} 

Many mathematicians therefore felt that it was a matter of urgency to place proof theory, and thereby mathematics itself, on a secure foundation. They wanted to consolidate after their headlong advances: to define once and for all which types of proof were absolutely secure, and which were not. Whatever was outside the secure zone could be dropped, and whatever was inside would be the sole basis of all future mathematics.

To this end, the Dutch mathematician Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer advocated an extreme conservative strategy for proof theory, known as _intuitionism_, which still has adherents to this day. Intuitionists try to construe 'intuition' in the narrowest conceivable way, retaining only what they consider to be its unchal-lengeably self-evident aspects. Then they elevate mathematical intuition, thus defined, to a status higher even than Plato afforded it: they regard it as being prioreven to pure logic. Thus they regard logic itself as untrustworthy, except where it is justified by direct mathematical intuition. For instance, intuitionists deny that it is possible to have a direct intuition of any infinite entity. Therefore they deny that any infinite sets, such as the set of all natural numbers, exist at all. The proposition 'there exist infinitely many natural numbers' they would consider self-evidently false. And the proposition 'there exist more Cantgotu environments than physically possible environments' they would consider completely meaningless.

Historically, intuitionism played a valuable liberating role, just as inductivism did. It dared to question received certainties - some of which were indeed false. But as a positive theory of what is or is not a valid mathematical proof, it is worthless. Indeed, intuitionism is precisely the expression, in mathematics, of solipsism. In both cases there is an over-reaction to the thought that we cannot be _sure_ of what we know about the wider world. In both cases the proposed solution is to retreat into an inner world which we can supposedly know directly and therefore (?) can be sure of knowing truly. In both cases the solution involves either denying the existence - or at least renouncing explanation - of what lies outside. And in both cases this renunciation also makes it impossible to explain much of what lies inside the favoured  {231}  domain. For instance, if it is indeed false, as intuitionists maintain, that there exist infinitely many natural numbers, then we can infer that there must be only finitely many of them. How many? And then, however many there are, why can we not form an intuition of the next natural number above that one? Intuitionists would explain this problem away by pointing out that the argument I have just given assumes the validity of ordinary logic. In particular, it involves inferring, from the fact that there are not infinitely many natural numbers, that there must be some particular finite number of them. The relevant rule of inference is called the _law of the excluded middle._ It says that, for any proposition X (such as 'there are infinitely many natural numbers'), there is no third possibility between X being true and its negation ('there are finitely many natural numbers') being true. Intuitionists coolly deny the law of the excluded middle.

Since, in most people's minds, the law of the excluded middle is itself backed by a powerful intuition, its rejection naturally causes non-intuitionists to wonder whether the intuitionists' intuition is so self-evidently reliable after all. Or, if we consider the law of the excluded middle to stem from a _logical_ intuition, it leads us to re-examine the question whether mathematical intuition really supersedes logic. At any rate, can it be _self-evident_ that it does?|   |   |   |

But writing the programs is not the issue here. I am not asking whether we can find out enough about a past environment (or, indeed, about a present or future environment) to write a program that would render that environment specifically. I am asking whether the _set of all possible_ programs for virtual-reality generators does or does not include one that gives a virtual-reality rendering of past-directed time travel and, if so, how accurate that rendering can be. If there were _no_ programs rendering time travel, then the Turing principle would imply that time travel was physically impossible (because it says that everything that is physically possible can be rendered by some program). And on the face of it, there is indeed a problem here. Even though there are programs which accurately render past environments, there appear to be fundamental obstacles to using them to render time travel. These are the same obstacles that appear to prevent time travel itself, namely the so-called 'paradoxes' of time travel.

Here is a typical such paradox. I build a time machine and use it to travel back into the past. There I prevent my former self from building the time machine. But if the time machine is not built, I shall not be able to use it to travel into the past, nor therefore to prevent the time machine from being built. So do I make this trip or not? If I do, then I deprive myself of the time machine and therefore do not make the trip. If I do not make the trip, then I allow myself to build the time machine and so do make the trip. This is sometimes called the 'grandfather paradox', and stated in terms of using time travel to kill one's grandfather before he had any children. (And then, if he had no children, he could not have had any grandchildren, so who killed him?) These two forms of the paradox are the ones most commonly cited, and happen to require an element of violent conflict between the time traveller and people in the past, so one finds oneself wondering who will win. Perhaps the time traveller will be defeated, and the paradox avoided. But violence is not an essential part of the problem here. If I had a time machine, I could decide as follows: that if, today,  {293}  my future self visits me, having set out from tomorrow, then tomorrow I _shall not_ use my time machine; and that if I receive no such visitor today, then tomorrow I _shall_ use the time machine to travel back to today and visit myself. It seems to follow from this decision that if I use the time machine then I shall not use it, and if I do not use it then I shall use it: a contradiction.

A contradiction indicates a faulty assumption, so such paradoxes have traditionally been taken as proofs that time travel is impossible. Another assumption that is sometimes challenged is that of free will - whether time travellers can choose in the usual way how to behave. One then concludes that if time machines did exist, people's free will would be impaired. They would somehow be unable to form intentions of the type I have described; or else, when they travelled in time, they would somehow systematically forget the resolutions they made before setting out. But it turns out that the faulty assumption behind the paradoxes is neither the existence of a time machine nor the ability of people to choose their actions in the usual way. All that is at fault is the classical theory of time, which I have already shown, for quite independent reasons, to be untenable.{332}  general. No serious biologist or philosopher attributes the origin of species to divine creation or to Lamarckian evolution. (Lamarckism, an evolutionary theory that Darwinism superseded, was the analogue of inductivism. It attributed biological adaptations to the inheritance of characteristics that the organism had striven for and acquired during its life.) Yet, just as with the other three strands, objections to pure Darwinism _as an explanation_ of the phenomena of the biosphere are numerous and widespread. One class of objections centres on the question whether in the history of the biosphere there has been enough time for such colossal complexity to have evolved by natural selection alone. No viable rival theory has been advanced to substantiate such objections, except conceivably the idea, of which the astronomers Fred Hoyle and Chandra Wickramasinghe are recent proponents, that the complex molecules on which life is based originated in outer space. But the point of such objections is not so much to contradict the Darwinian model as to claim that something fundamental remains unexplained in the matter of how the adaptations we observe in the biosphere came into being.

Darwinism has also been criticized as being circular because it invokes 'the survival of the fittest' as an explanation, while the 'fittest' are defined retrospectively, by their having survived. Alternatively, in terms of an independent definition of 'fitness', the idea that evolution 'favours the fittest' seems to be contradicted by the facts. For example, the most intuitive definition of biological fitness would be 'fitness of a species for survival in a particular niche', in the sense that a tiger might be thought to be the optimal machine for occupying the ecological niche that tigers occupy. The standard counter-examples to that sort of 'survival of the fittest' are adaptations, such as the peacock's tail, that seem to make the organism much _less_ fit to exploit its niche. Such objections seem to undermine the ability of Darwin's theory to meet its original purpose, which was to explain how the apparent 'design' (i.e. adaptations) in living organisms could have come into being through the operation of 'blind' laws of physics on inanimate matter, without the intervention of a purposeful Designer.  {333} 

Richard Dawkins' innovation, as set out in his books _The Selfish Gene_ and _The Blind Watchmaker_, is yet again the claim that the prevailing theory is true after all. He argues that none of the current objections to the unadorned Darwinian model turn out, on careful inspection, to have any substance. In other words, Dawkins claims that Darwin's theory of evolution does provide a full explanation of the origin of biological adaptations. Dawkins elaborated Darwin's theory in its modern form as the theory of replicators. The replicator that is best at getting itself replicated in a given environment will eventually displace all variants of itself because, by definition, they are worse at getting themselves replicated. It is not the fittest _species_ variant that survives (Darwin had hot quite realized this) but the fittest _gene_ variant. One consequence of this is that sometimes a gene may displace variant genes (such as genes for less cumbersome tails in peacocks) by means (such as sexual selection) that do not especially promote the good of the species or the individual. But all evolution promotes the 'good' (i.e. the replication) of the best-replicating genes - hence the term 'selfish gene'. Dawkins meets each of the objections in detail and shows that Darwin's theory, correctly interpreted, has none of the alleged flaws and does indeed explain the origin of adaptations.{43}  detect with instruments, whereas the shadow photons are intangible (invisible) - detectable only indirectly through their interference effects on the tangible photons. (Later, we shall see that there is no intrinsic difference between tangible and shadow photons: each photon is tangible in one universe and intangible in all the other parallel universes - but I anticipate.) What we have inferred so far is only that each tangible photon has an accompanying retinue of shadow photons, and that when a photon passes through one of our four slits, some shadow photons pass through the other three slits. Since different interference patterns appear when we cut slits at other places in the screen, provided that they are within the beam, shadow photons must be arriving all over the illuminated part of the screen whenever a tangible photon arrives. Therefore there are many more shadow photons than tangible ones. How many? Experiments cannot put an upper bound on the number, but they do set a rough lower bound. In a laboratory the largest area that we could conveniently illuminate with a laser might be about a square metre, and the smallest manageable size for the holes might be about a thousandth of a millimetre. So there are about 1012 (one trillion) possible hole-locations on the screen. Therefore there must be at least a trillion shadow photons accompanying each tangible one.

Thus we have inferred the existence of a seething, prodigiously complicated, hidden world of shadow photons. They travel at the speed of light, bounce off mirrors, are refracted by lenses, and are stopped by opaque barriers or filters of the wrong colour. Yet they do not trigger even the most sensitive detectors. The only thing in the universe that a shadow photon can be observed to affect is the tangible photon that it accompanies. That is the phenomenon of interference. Shadow photons would go entirely unnoticed were it not for this phenomenon and the strange patterns of shadows by which we observe it.

Interference is not a special property of photons alone. Quantum theory predicts, and experiment confirms, that it occurs for every sort of particle. So there must be hosts of shadow neutrons accompanying every tangible neutron, hosts of shadow electrons  {44}  accompanying every electron, and so on. Each of these shadow particles is detectable only indirectly, through its interference with the motion of its tangible counterpart.

It follows that reality is a much bigger thing than it seems, and most of it is invisible. The objects and events that we and our instruments can directly observe are the merest tip of the iceberg.

Now, tangible particles have a property that entitles us to call them, collectively, a _universe._ This is simply their defining property of being tangible, that is, of interacting with each other, and hence of being directly detectable by instruments and sense organs made of other tangible particles. Because of the phenomenon of interference, they are not _wholly_ partitioned off from the rest of reality (that is, from the shadow particles). If they were, we should never have discovered that there is more to reality than tangible particles. But to a good approximation they do resemble the universe that we see around us in everyday life, and the universe referred to in classical (pre-quantum) physics.

For similar reasons, we might think of calling the shadow particles, collectively, a _parallel universe_, for they too are affected by tangible particles only through interference phenomena. But we can do better than that. For it turns out that shadow particles are partitioned among themselves in exactly the same way as the universe of tangible particles is partitioned from them. In other words, they do not form a single, homogeneous parallel universe vastly larger than the tangible one, but rather a huge number of parallel universes, each similar in composition to the tangible one, and each obeying the same laws of physics, but differing in that the particles are in different positions in each universe.

A remark about terminology. The word 'universe' has traditionally been used to mean 'the whole of physical reality'. In that sense there can be at most one universe. We could stick to that definition, and say that the entity we have been accustomed to calling 'the universe' - namely, all the directly perceptible matter and energy around us, and the surrounding space - is not the whole universe after all, but only a small portion of it. Then we should have to invent a new name for that small, tangible portion. But most  {45}  physicists prefer to carry on using the word 'universe' to denote the same entity that it has always denoted, even though that entity now turns out to be only a small part of physical reality. A new word, _multiverse_, has been coined to denote physical reality as a whole.

Single-particle interference experiments such as I have been describing show us that the multiverse exists and that it contains many counterparts of each particle in the tangible universe. To reach the further conclusion that the multiverse is roughly partitioned into parallel universes, we must consider interference phenomena involving more than one tangible particle. The simplest way of doing this is to ask, by way of a 'thought experiment', what must be happening at the microscopic level when shadow photons strike an opaque object. They are stopped, of course: we know that because interference ceases when an opaque barrier is placed in the paths of shadow photons. But why? What stops them? We can rule out the straightforward answer - that they are absorbed, like tangible photons would be, by the tangible atoms in the barrier. For one thing, we know that shadow photons do not interact with tangible atoms. For another, we can verify by measuring the atoms in the barrier (or more precisely, by replacing the barrier by a detector) that they neither absorb energy nor change their state in any way unless they are struck by tangible photons. Shadow photons have no effect.

To put that another way, shadow photons and tangible photons are affected in identical ways when they reach a given barrier, but the barrier itself is not identically affected by the two types of photon. In fact, as far as we can tell, it is not affected by shadow photons at all. That is indeed the defining property of shadow photons, for if any material were observably affected by them, that material could be used as a shadow-photon detector and the entire phenomenon of shadows and interference would not be as I have described it.

Hence there is some sort of shadow barrier at the same location as the tangible barrier. It takes no great leap of imagination to conclude that this shadow barrier is made up of the _shadow atoms_ that we already know must be present as counterparts of the  {46}  tangible atoms in the barrier. There are very many of them present for each tangible atom. Indeed, the total density of shadow atoms in even the lightest fog would be more than sufficient to stop a tank, let alone a photon, _if_ they could all affect it. Since we find that partially transparent barriers have the same degree of transparency for shadow photons as for tangible ones, it follows that not all the shadow atoms in the path of a particular shadow photon can be involved in blocking its passage. Each shadow photon encounters much the same sort of barrier as its tangible counterpart does, a barrier consisting of only a tiny proportion of all the shadow atoms that are present.

For the same reason, each shadow atom in the barrier can be interacting with only a small proportion of the other shadow atoms in its vicinity, and the ones it does interact with form a barrier much like the tangible one. And so on. All matter, and all physical processes, have this structure. If the tangible barrier is the frog's retina, then there must be many shadow retinas, each capable of stopping only one of the shadow-counterparts of each photon. Each shadow retina only interacts strongly with the corresponding shadow photons, and with the corresponding shadow frog, and so on. In other words, particles are grouped into parallel universes. They are 'parallel' in the sense that within each universe particles interact with each other just as they do in the tangible universe, but each universe affects the others only weakly, through interference phenomena.

Thus we have reached the conclusion of the chain of reasoning that begins with strangely shaped shadows and ends with parallel universes. Each step takes the form of noting that the behaviour of objects that we observe can be explained only if there are unobserved objects present, and if those unobserved objects have certain properties. The heart of the argument is that single-particle interference phenomena unequivocally rule out the possibility that the tangible universe around us is all that exists. There is no disputing the fact that such interference phenomena occur. Yet the existence of the multiverse is still a minority view among physicists. Why?

The answer, I regret to say, does not reflect well upon the  {47}  majority. I shall have more to say about this in Chapter 13]], but for the moment let me point out that the arguments I have presented in this chapter are compelling only to those who seek explanations. Those who are satisfied with mere prediction, and who have no strong desire to understand how the predicted outcomes of experiments come about, may if they wish simply deny the existence of anything other than what I have been calling 'tangible' entities. Some people, such as instrumentalists and positivists, take this line as a matter of philosophical principle. I have already said what I think of such principles, and why. Other people just don't want to think about it. After all, it is such a _large_ conclusion, and such a disturbing one on first hearing. But I think that those people are making a mistake. As I hope to persuade readers who bear with me, understanding the multiverse is a precondition for understanding reality as best we can. Nor is this said in a spirit of grim determination to seek the truth no matter how unpalatable it may be (though I hope I would take that attitude if it came to it). It is, on the contrary, because the resulting world-view is so much more integrated, and makes more sense in so many ways, than any previous world-view, and certainly more than the cynical pragmatism which too often nowadays serves as a surrogate for a world-view among scientists.

'Why can't we just say,' some pragmatic physicists ask, 'that photons behave _as if_ they were interacting with invisible entities? Why can we not leave it at that? Why do we have to go on to take a position about whether those invisible entities are really there?' A more exotic variant of what is essentially the same idea is the following. 'A tangible photon is real; a shadow photon is merely a way in which the real photon could possibly have behaved, but did not. Thus quantum theory is about the _interaction of the real with the possible_.' This, at least, sounds suitably profound. But unfortunately the people who take either of these views - including some eminent scientists who ought to know better - invariably lapse into mumbo-jumbo at that point. So let us keep cool heads. The key fact is that a real, tangible photon _behaves differently_ according to what paths are open, elsewhere in the apparatus, for  {48}  something to travel along and eventually intercept the tangible photon. Something does travel along those paths, and to refuse to call it 'real' is merely to play with words. 'The possible' cannot interact with the real: non-existent entities cannot deflect real ones from their paths. If a photon is deflected, it must have been deflected by something, and I have called that thing a 'shadow photon'. Giving it a name does not make it real, but it cannot be true that an actual event, such as the arrival and detection of a tangible photon, is caused by an imaginary event such as what that photon 'could have done' but did not do. It is only what really happens that can cause other things really to happen. If the complex motions of the shadow photons in an interference experiment were mere possibilities that did not in fact take place, then the interference phenomena we see would not, in fact, take place.

The reason why interference effects are usually so weak and hard to detect can be found in the quantum-mechanical laws that govern them. Two particular implications of those laws are relevant. First, every subatomic particle has counterparts in other universes, and is interfered with only by those counterparts. It is not directly affected by any other particles in those universes. Therefore interference is observed only in special situations where the paths of a particle and its shadow counterparts separate and then reconverge (as when a photon and shadow photon are heading towards the same point on the screen). Even the timing must be right: if one of the two paths involves a delay, the interference is reduced or prevented. Second, the detection of interference between any two universes requires an interaction to take place between _all the particles whose positions and other attributes are not identical_ in the two universes. In practice this means that interference is strong enough to be detected only between universes that are very alike. For example, in all the experiments I have described, the interfering universes differ only in the position of one photon. If a photon affects other particles in its travels, and in particular if it is observed, then those particles or the observer will also become differentiated in different universes. If so, subsequent interference involving that photon will be undetectable in practice because the requisite interaction  {49}  between _all_ the affected particles is too complicated to arrange. I must mention here that the standard phrase for describing this fact, namely 'observation destroys interference', is very misleading in three ways. First, it suggests some sort of psychokinetic effect of the conscious 'observer' on basic physical phenomena, though there is no such effect. Second, the interference is not 'destroyed': it is just (much!) harder to observe because doing so involves controlling the precise behaviour of many more particles. And third, it is not just 'observation', but _any_ effect of the photon on its surroundings that depends on which path the photon has taken, that does this. For the benefit of readers who may have seen other accounts of quantum physics, I must briefly make contact between the argument I have given in this chapter and the way the subject is usually presented. Perhaps because the debate began among theoretical physicists, the traditional starting-point has been quantum theory itself. One states the theory as carefully as possible, and then one tries to understand what it tells us about reality. That is the only possible approach if one wants to understand the finer details of quantum phenomena. But as regards the issue of whether reality consists of one universe or many, it is an unnecessarily complicated approach. That is why I have not followed it in this chapter. I have not even stated any of the postulates of quantum theory - I have merely described some physical phenomena and drawn inescapable conclusions. But if one does start from theory, there are two things that everyone agrees on. The first is that quantum theory is unrivalled in its ability to predict the outcomes of experiments, even if one blindly uses its equations without worrying much about what they mean. The second is that quantum theory tells us something new and bizarre about the nature of reality. The dispute is only about what exactly this is. The physicist Hugh Everett was the first to understand clearly (in 1957, some thirty years after the theory became the basis of subatomic physics) that quantum theory describes a multiverse. Ever since, the argument has raged about whether the theory admits of any other interpretation (or re-interpretation, or reformulation, or modification, etc.) in which it describes a single universe, but continues correctly to predict the  {50}  outcomes of experiments. In other words, does accepting the predictions of quantum theory force us to accept the existence of parallel universes?

It seems to me that this question, and therefore the whole prevailing tone of the debate on this issue, is wrong-headed. Admittedly, it is right and proper for theoretical physicists such as myself to devote a great deal of effort to trying to understand the formal structure of quantum theory, but not at the expense of losing sight of our primary objective, which is to understand reality. Even if the predictions of quantum theory could, somehow, be made without referring to more than one universe, individual photons would still cast shadows in the way I have described. Without knowing anything of quantum theory, one can see that those shadows could not be the result of any single history of the photon as it travels from the torch to the observer's eye. They are incompatible with any explanation in terms of only the photons that we see. Or in terms of only the barrier that we see. Or in terms of only the universe that we see. Therefore, if the best theory available to physics did not refer to parallel universes, it would merely mean that we needed a better theory, one that did refer to parallel universes, in order to explain what we see.

So, does accepting the predictions of quantum theory force us to accept the existence of parallel universes? Not in itself. We can always reinterpret any theory along instrumentalist lines so that it does not force us to accept anything about reality. But that is beside the point. As I have just said, we do not need deep theories to tell us that parallel universes exist - single-particle interference phenomena tell us that. What we need deep theories for is to explain and predict such phenomena: to tell us what the other universes are like, what laws they obey, how they affect one another, and how all this fits in with the theoretical foundations of other subjects. That is what quantum theory does. The quantum theory of parallel universes is not the problem, it is the solution. It is not some troublesome, optional interpretation emerging from arcane theoretical considerations. It is the explanation - the only one that is tenable - of a remarkable and counter-intuitive reality.  {51} 

So far, I have been using temporary terminology which suggests that one of the many parallel universes differs from the others by being 'tangible'. It is time to sever that last link with the classical, single-universe conception of reality. Let us go back to our frog. We have seen that the story of the frog that stares at the distant torch for days at a time, waiting for the flicker that comes on average once a day, is not the whole story, because there must also be shadow frogs, in shadow universes that co-exist with the tangible one, also waiting for photons. Suppose that our frog is trained to jump when it sees a flicker. At the beginning of the experiment, the tangible frog will have a large set of shadow counterparts, all initially alike. But shortly afterwards they will no longer all be alike. Any particular one of them is unlikely to see a photon immediately. But what is a rare event in any one universe is a common event in the multiverse as a whole. At any instant, somewhere in the multiverse, there are a few universes in which one of the photons is currently striking the retina of the frog in that universe. And that frog jumps.

Why exactly does it jump? Because within its universe it obeys the same laws of physics as tangible frogs do, and its shadow retina has been struck by a shadow photon belonging to that universe. One of the light-sensitive shadow molecules in that shadow retina has responded by undergoing complex chemical changes, to which the shadow frog's optic nerve has in turn responded. It has transmitted a message to the shadow frog's brain, and the frog has consequently experienced the sensation of seeing a flicker.

Or should I say 'the _shadow_ sensation of seeing a flicker'? Surely not. If 'shadow' observers, be they frogs or people, are real, then their sensations must be real too. When they observe what we might call a shadow object, they observe that it is tangible. They observe this by the same means, and according to the same definition, as we apply when we say that the universe we observe is 'tangible'. Tangibility is relative to a given observer. So objectively there are not two kinds of photon, tangible and shadow, nor two kinds of frog, nor two kinds of universe, one tangible and the rest shadow. There is nothing in the description I have given of the  {52}  formation of shadows, or any of the related phenomena, that distinguishes between the 'tangible' and the 'shadow' objects, apart from the mere assertion that one of the copies is 'tangible'. When I introduced tangible and shadow photons I apparently distinguished them by saying that we can see the former, but not the latter. But who are 'we'? While I was writing that, hosts of shadow Davids were writing it too. They too drew a distinction between tangible and shadow photons; but the photons they called 'shadow' include the ones I called 'tangible', and the photons they called 'tangible' are among those I called 'shadow'.

Not only do none of the copies of an object have any privileged position in the explanation of shadows that I have just outlined, neither do they have a privileged position in the full mathematical explanation provided by quantum theory. I may feel subjectively that I am distinguished among the copies as the 'tangible' one, because I can directly perceive myself and not the others, but I must come to terms with the fact that all the others feel the same about themselves.

Many of those Davids are at this moment writing these very words. Some are putting it better. Others have gone for a cup of tea.

### TERMINOLOGY

**photon** A particle of light.

**tangible/shadow** For the purposes of exposition in this chapter only, I called particles in this universe _tangible_, and particles in other universes _shadow particles._ multiverse The whole of physical reality. It contains many parallel universes.

**parallel universes** They are 'parallel' in the sense that within each universe particles interact with each other just as they do in the tangible universe, but each universe affects the others only weakly, through interference phenomena.

**quantum theory** The theory of the physics of the multiverse.  {53} 

**quantization** The property of having a discrete (rather than continuous) set of possible values. Quantum theory gets its name from its assertion that all measurable quantities are quantized. However, the most significant quantum effect is not quantization but interference.

**interference** The effect of a particle in one universe on its counterpart in another. Photon interference can cause shadows to be much more complicated than mere silhouettes of the obstacles causing them.

### SUMMARY

In interference experiments there can be places in a shadow-pattern that go dark when new openings are made in the barrier casting the shadow. This remains true even when the experiment is performed with individual particles. A chain of reasoning based on this fact rules out the possibility that the universe we see around us constitutes the whole of reality. In fact the whole of physical reality, the multiverse, contains vast numbers of parallel universes.

_Quantum physics is one of the four main strands of explanation. The next strand is_ epistemology, _the theory of knowledge._  {54}

possible observation would rule it out - then it cannot by itself explain why those events happen in the way they are observed to and not in some other way. For example, the 'angel' theory of planetary motion is untestable because no matter how planets moved, that motion could be attributed to angels; therefore the angel theory cannot explain the particular motions that we see, unless it is supplemented by an independent theory of how angels move. That is why there is a methodological rule in science which says that once an experimentally testable theory has passed the appropriate tests, any _less_ testable rival theories about the same phenomena are summarily rejected, for their explanations are bound to be inferior. This rule is often cited as distinguishing science from other types of knowledge-creation. But if we take the view that science is about explanations, we see that this rule is really a special case of something that applies naturally to all problem-solving: _theories that are capable of giving more detailed explanations are automatically preferred._ They are preferred for two reasons. One is that a theory that 'sticks its neck out' by being more specific about more phenomena opens up itself and its rivals to more forms of criticism, and therefore has more chance of taking the problem-solving process forward. The second is simply that, if such a theory survives the criticism, it leaves less unexplained - which is the object of the exercise.

I have already remarked that even in science most criticism does not consist of experimental testing. That is because most scientific criticism is directed not at a theory's predictions but directly at the underlying explanations. Testing the predictions is just an indirect way (albeit an exceptionally powerful one, when available) of testing the explanations. In Chapter 1]], I gave the example of the 'grass cure' - the theory that eating a kilogram of grass is a cure for the common cold. That theory and an infinity of others of the same ilk are readily testable. But we can criticize and reject them without bothering to do any experiments, purely on the grounds that they explain no more than the prevailing theories which they contradict, yet make new, unexplained assertions.  {66} 

The stages of a scientific discovery shown in Figure 3.3 are seldom completed in sequence at the first attempt. There is usually repeated backtracking before each stage is completed - or rather, _solved_, for each stage may present a problem whose solution itself requires all five stages of a subsidiary problem-solving process. This applies even to stage 1, for the initiating problem itself is not immutable. If we cannot think of good candidate solutions we may return to stage 1 and try to reformulate the problem, or even choose a different problem. Indeed, apparent insolubility is only one of many reasons why we often find it desirable to modify problems we are solving. Some variants of a problem are inevitably more interesting, or more relevant to other problems; some are better formulated; some seem to be potentially more fruitful, or more urgent - or whatever. In many cases the issue of what precisely the problem is, and what the attributes of a 'good' explanation would be, receive as much criticism and conjecture as do trial solutions.

Similarly, if our criticisms at stage 3 fail to distinguish between rival theories, we try to invent new methods of criticism. If that does not seem to work we may backtrack to stage 2 and try to sharpen our proposed solutions (and existing theories) so as to get more explanations and predictions out of them and make it easier to find fault with them. Or we may again backtrack to stage 1 and try to find better criteria for the explanations to meet. And so on.

Not only is there constant backtracking, but the many sub-problems all remain simultaneously active and are addressed opportunistically. It is only when the discovery is complete that a fairly sequential argument, in a pattern something like Figure 3.3, can be presented. It can begin with the latest and best version of the problem; then it can show how some of the rejected theories fail criticism; then it can set out the winning theory, and say why it survives criticism; then it can explain how one copes without the superseded theory; and finally it can point out some of the new problems that this discovery creates or allows for.

While a problem is still in the process of being solved we are dealing with a large, heterogeneous set of ideas, theories, and criteria, with many variants of each, all competing for survival. There  {67}  is a continual turnover of theories as they are altered or replaced by new ones. So all the theories are being subjected to _variation_ and _selection_, according to criteria which are themselves subject to variation and selection. The whole process resembles biological evolution. A problem is like an ecological niche, and a theory is like a gene or a species which is being tested for viability in that niche. Variants of theories, like genetic mutations, are continually being created, and less successful variants become extinct when more successful variants take over. 'Success' is the ability to survive repeatedly under the selective pressures - criticism - brought to bear in that niche, and the criteria for that criticism depend partly on the physical characteristics of the niche and partly on the attributes of other genes and species (i.e. other ideas) that are already present there. The new world-view that may be implicit in a theory that solves a problem, and the distinctive features of a new species that takes over a niche, are _emergent_ properties of the problem or niche. In other words, obtaining solutions is inherently complex. There is no simple way of discovering the true nature of planets, given (say) a critique of the celestial-sphere theory and some additional observations, just as there is no simple way of designing the DNA of a koala bear, given the properties of eucalyptus trees. Evolution, or trial and error - especially the focused, purposeful form of trial and error called scientific discovery - are the only ways.

For this reason, Popper has called his theory that knowledge can grow only by conjecture and refutation, in the manner of Figure 3.3, an _evolutionary epistemology._ This is an important unifying insight, and we shall see that there are other connections between these two strands. But I do not want to overstate the similarities between scientific discovery and biological evolution, for there are important differences too. One difference is that in biology variations (mutations) are random, blind and purposeless, while in human problem-solving the creation of new conjectures is itself a complex, knowledge-laden process driven by the intentions of the people concerned. Perhaps an even more important difference is that there is no biological equivalent of _argument._ All conjectures  {68}  have to be tested experimentally, which is one reason why biological evolution is slower and less efficient by an astronomically large factor. Nevertheless, the link between the two sorts of process is far more than mere analogy: they are two of my four intimately related 'main strands' of explanation of the fabric of reality.

Both in science and in biological evolution, evolutionary success depends on the creation and survival of _objective knowledge_, which in biology is called _adaptation._ That is, the ability of a theory or gene to survive in a niche is not a haphazard function of its structure but depends on whether enough true and useful information about the niche is implicitly or explicitly encoded there. I shall say more about this in Chapter 8]].

We can now begin to see what justifies the inferences that we draw from observations. We never draw inferences from observations alone, but observations can become significant in the course of an argument when they reveal deficiencies in some of the contending explanations. We choose a scientific theory because arguments, only a few of which depend on observations, have satisfied us (for the moment) that the explanations offered by all known rival theories are less true, less broad or less deep.

Take a moment to compare Figures 3.1 and 3.3. Look how different these two conceptions of the scientific process are. Inductivism is observation- and prediction-based, whereas in reality science is problem- and explanation-based. Inductivism supposes that theories are somehow extracted or distilled from observations, or are justified by them, whereas in fact theories begin as unjustified conjectures in someone's mind, which typically _precede_ the observations that rule out rival theories. Inductivism seeks to justify predictions as likely to hold in the future. Problem-solving justifies an explanation as being better than other explanations available in the present. Inductivism is a dangerous and recurring source of many sorts of error, because it is superficially so plausible. But it is not true.

When we succeed in solving a problem, scientific or otherwise, we end up with a set of theories which, though they are not problem-free, we find preferable to the theories we started with.  {69}  What new attributes the new theories will have therefore depends on what we saw as the deficiencies in our original theories - that is, on what the problem was. Science is characterized by its problems as well as by its method. Astrologers who solve the problem of how to cast more intriguing horoscopes without risking being proved wrong are unlikely to have created much that deserves to be called scientific knowledge, even if they have used genuine scientific methods (such as market research) and are themselves quite satisfied with the solution. The problem in genuine science is always to understand some aspect of the fabric of reality, by finding explanations that are as broad and deep, and as true and specific, as possible.

When we think that we have solved a problem, we naturally adopt our new set of theories in preference to the old set. That is why science, regarded as explanation-seeking and problem-solving, raises no 'problem of induction'. There is no mystery about why we should feel compelled tentatively to accept an explanation when it is the best explanation we can think of.

### TERMINOLOGY

**solipsism** The theory that only one mind exists and that what appears to be external reality is only a dream taking place in that mind.

**problem of induction** Since scientific theories cannot be logically justified by observation, what does justify them?

**induction** A fictitious process by which general theories were supposed to be obtained from, or justified by, accumulated observations.

**problem** A problem exists when it seems that some of our theories, especially the explanations they contain, seem inadequate and worth trying to improve.

**criticism** Rational criticism compares rival theories with the aim of finding which of them offers the best explanations according to the criteria inherent in the problem.  {70} 

**science** The _purpose_ of science is to understand reality through explanations. The characteristic (though not the only) _method of criticism_ used in science is experimental testing.

**experimental test** An experiment whose outcome may falsify one or more of a set of rival theories.

### SUMMARY

In fundamental areas of science, observations of ever smaller, more lubtle effects are driving us to ever more momentous conclusions ibout the nature of reality. Yet these conclusions cannot be deduced by pure logic from the observations. So what makes them compelling? This is the 'problem of induction'. According to inductivism, ncientific theories are discovered by extrapolating the results of observations, and justified when corroborating observations are obtained. In fact, inductive reasoning is invalid, and it is impossible lo extrapolate observations unless one already has an explanatory Iramework for them. But the refutation of inductivism, and also the real solution of the problem of induction, depends on recognizing that science is a process not of deriving predictions from observations, but of finding explanations. We seek explanations when we encounter a problem with existing ones. We then embark on a problem-solving process. New explanatory theories begin as unjustified conjectures, which are criticized and compared according to the criteria inherent in the problem. Those that fail to survive this criticism are abandoned. The survivors become the new prevailing theories, some of which are themselves problematic and so lead us to seek even better explanations. The whole process resembles biological evolution.

_Thus we acquire ever more knowledge of reality by solving problems and finding better explanations. But when all is said and done, problems and explanations are located within the human mind, which owes its reasoning power to a fallible brain, and its supply  {71}  of information to fallible senses. What, then, entitles a human mind to draw conclusions about objective, external reality from its own purely subjective experience and reason?_{125} 

In our search for the ultimate in virtual-reality we have strayed a very long way from what is feasible today, or even from what is on any foreseeable technological horizon. So let me stress again that for our present purposes technological obstacles are irrelevant. We are not investigating what sorts of virtual-reality generator can be buili, or even, necessarily, what sorts of virtual-reality generator will ever be built, by human engineers. We are investigating what the lawn of physics do and do not allow in the way of virtual reality. The reason why this is important has nothing to do with the prospect n for making better virtual-reality generators. It is that the relation ship between virtual reality and 'ordinary' reality is part of the deep, unexpected structure of the world, which this book is about.

By considering various tricks - nerve stimulation, stopping anil starting the brain, and so on - we have managed to envisage a physically possible virtual-reality generator whose repertoire covers the entire sensory range, is fully interactive, and is not constrained by the speed or memory capacity of its computer. Is there anything outside the repertoire of such a virtual-reality generator? Would its repertoire be the set of all logically possible environments? It would not. Even this futuristic machine's repertoire is drastically circumscribed by the mere fact of its being a physical object. It does not even scratch the surface of what is logically possible, as I shall now show.

The basic idea of the proof - known as a _diagonal argument_ - predates the idea of virtual reality. It was first used by the nineteenth-century mathematician Georg Cantor to prove that there are infinite quantities greater than the infinity of natural number (1, 2, 3...). The same form of proof is at the heart of the modern theory of computation developed by Alan Turing and others in the 1930s. It was also used by Kurt Gödel to prove his celebrated 'incompleteness theorem', of which more in Chapter 10]].

Each environment in our machine's repertoire is generated by some program for its computer. Imagine the set of all valid programs for this computer. From a physical point of view, each sucli program specifies a particular set of values for physical variables, on the disks or other media, that represent the computer's program.  {126}  We know from quantum theory that all such variables are quantized, and therefore that, no matter how the computer works, the set of possible programs is discrete. Each program can therefore he expressed as a finite sequence of symbols in a discrete code or computer language. There are infinitely many such programs, but each one can contain only a finite number of symbols. That is because symbols are physical objects, made of matter in recognizable configurations, and one could not manufacture an infinite number of them. As I shall explain in Chapter 10]], these intuitively obvious physical requirements - that the programs must be quantized, and that each of them must consist of a finite number of symbols and can be executed in a sequence of steps - are more substantive than they seem. They are the only consequences of the laws of physics that are needed as input for the proof, but they are enough to impose drastic restrictions on the repertoire of any phihysically possible machine. Other physical laws may impose even more restrictions, but they would not affect the conclusions of this chapter.

Now let us imagine this infinite set of possible programs arranged in an infinitely long list, and numbered Program 1, Program 2, and on. They could, for instance, be arranged in 'alphabetical' order with respect to the symbols in which they are expressed. Because each program generates an environment, this list can also be regarded as a list of all the environments in the machine's repertoire; we may call them Environment 1, Environment 2, and so on. It could be that some of the environments are repeated in the list, because two different programs might in effect perform the same calculations, but that will not affect the argument. What is important is that each environment in our machine's repertoire should appear at least once in the list.

A simulated environment may be limited or unlimited in apparent physical size and apparent duration. An architect's simulation of a house, for example, can be run for an unlimited time, but will probably cover only a limited volume. A video game might allow the user only a finite time for play before the game ends, or it might render a game-universe of unlimited size, allow an unlimited  {127}  amount of exploration and end only when the user deliberately ends it. To make the proof simpler, let us consider only programs that continue to run for ever. That is not much of a restriction, because if a program halts we can always choose to regard its lack of response as being the response of a sensory-isolation environment.

Let me define a class of logically possible environments which I shall call _Cantgotu environments_, partly in honour of _Cantor_, Gddel and Taring, and partly for a reason I shall explain shortly. They are defined as follows. For the first subjective minute, a Cantgotu environment behaves differently from Environment i (generated by Program i of our generator). It does not matter how it does behave, so long as it is, to the user, recognizably different from Environment i. During the second minute it behaves differently from Environment 2 (though it is now allowed to resemble Environment 1 again). During the third minute, it behaves differently from Environment 3, and so on. Any environment that satisfied these rules I shall call a Cantgotu environment.

Now, since a Cantgotu environment does not behave exactly like Environment 1, it cannot _be_ Environment 1; since it does not behave exactly like Environment 2, it cannot _be_ Environment 2. Since it is guaranteed sooner or later to behave differently from Environment 3, Environment 4 and every other environment on the list, it cannot be any of those either. But that list contains all the environments that are generated by every possible program for this machine. It follows that none of the Cantgotu environments are in the machine's repertoire. The Cantgotu environments are environments that we _can't go to_ using this virtual-reality generator.

Clearly there are enormously many Cantgotu environments, because the definition leaves enormous freedom in choosing how they should behave, the only constraint being that during each minute they should not behave in one particular way. It can be proved that, for every environment in the repertoire of a given virtual-reality generator, there are infinitely many Cantgotu environments that it cannot render. Nor is there much scope for extending the repertoire by using a range of different virtual-reality  {128}  generators. Suppose that we had a hundred of them, each (for the sake of argument) with a different repertoire. Then the whole collection, combined with the programmable control system that determines which of them shall be used to run a given program, is just a larger virtual-reality generator. That generator is subject to the argument I have given, so for every environment it can render there will be infinitely many that it cannot. Furthermore, the assumption that different virtual-reality generators might have different repertoires turns out to be over-optimistic. As we shall see in a moment, all sufficiently sophisticated virtual-reality generators have essentially the same repertoire.

Thus our hypothetical project of building the ultimate virtual-reality generator, which had been going so well, has suddenly run into a brick wall. Whatever improvements may be made in the distant future, the repertoire of the entire technology of virtual reality will never grow beyond a certain fixed set of environments. Admittedly this set is infinitely large, and very diverse by comparison with human experience prior to virtual-reality technology. Nevertheless, it is only an infinitesimal fraction of the set of all logically possible environments.

What would it feel like to be in a Cantgotu environment? Although the laws of physics do not permit us to be in one, it is still logically possible and so it is legitimate to ask what it would feel like. Certainly, it could give us no new _sensations_, because a universal image generator _is_ possible and is assumed to be part of our high-technology virtual-reality generator. So a Cantgotu environment would seem mysterious to us only after we had experienced it and reflected on the results. It would go something like this. Suppose you are a virtual-reality buff in the distant, ultra-high-techhnology future. You have become jaded, for it seems to you that you have already tried everything interesting. But then one day a genie appears and claims to be able to transport you to a Cantgotu environment. You are sceptical, but agree to put its claim to the test. You are whisked away to the environment. After a few expedients you seem to recognize it - it responds just like one of your favourite environments, which on your home virtual-reality system  {129}  has program number X. However, you keep experimenting, and eventually, during the Xth subjective minute of the experience, the environment responds in a way that is markedly different from anything that Environment X would do. So you give up the idea that this is Environment X. You may then notice that everything that has happened so far is also consistent with another renderable environment, Environment Y. But then, during the Yth subjective minute you are proved wrong again. The characteristic of a Cantgotu environment is simply this: no matter how often you guess, no matter how complex a program you contemplate as beinn the one that might be rendering the environment, you will alwayi be proved wrong because _no_ program will render it, on your virtual reality generator or on any other.

Sooner or later you will have to bring the test to a close. At that point you may well decide to concede the genie's claim. That is nor to say that you could ever _prove_ that you had been in a Cantgotu environment, for there is always an even more complex program that the genie might have been running, which would match your experiences so far. That is just the general feature of virtual reality that I have already discussed, namely that experience cannot prove that one is in a given environment, be it the Centre Court at Wimbledon or an environment of the Cantgotu type.

Anyway, there are no such genies, and no such environments So we must conclude that physics does not allow the repertoire ol a virtual-reality generator to be anywhere near as large as logi< alone would allow. How large can it be?

Since we cannot hope to render all logically possible environments, let us consider a weaker (but ultimately more interesting) sort of universality. Let us define a _universal virtual-reality gene? ator_ as one whose repertoire contains that of every other physically possible virtual-reality generator. Can such a machine exist? It can. Thinking about futuristic devices based on computer-controlled nerve stimulation makes this obvious - in fact, almost too obvious. Such a machine could be programmed to have the characteristics of any rival machine. It could calculate how that machine would respond, under any given program, to any behaviour by the user,  {130}  and so could render those responses with perfect accuracy (from the point of view of any given user). I say that this is 'almost too obvious' because it contains an important assumption about what the proposed device, and more specifically its computer, could be programmed to do: given the appropriate program, and enough time and storage media, it could calculate the output of any computation performed by any other computer, including the one in the rival virtual-reality generator. Thus the feasibility of a universal virtual-reality generator depends on the existence of a universal computer - a single machine that can calculate anything that can be calculated.

As I have said, this sort of universality was first studied not by physicists but by mathematicians. They were trying to make precise the intuitive notion of 'computing' (or 'calculating' or 'proving') something in mathematics. They did not take on board the fact that mathematical calculation is a physical process (in particular, as I have explained, it is a virtual-reality rendering process), so it is impossible to determine by mathematical reasoning what can or cannot be calculated mathematically. That depends entirely on the laws of physics. But instead of trying to deduce their results from physical laws, mathematicians postulated abstract models of 'computation', and _defined_ 'calculation' and 'proof' in terms of those models. (I shall discuss this interesting mistake in Chapter 10]].) That is how it came about that over a period of a few months in 1936, three mathematicians, Emil Post, Alonzo Church and, most importantly, Alan Turing, independently created the first abstract designs for universal computers. Each of them conjectured that his model of 'computation' did indeed correctly formalize the traditional, intuitive notion of mathematical 'computation'. Consequently, each of them also conjectured that his model was equivalent to (had the same repertoire as) any other reasonable formalization of the same intuition. This is now known as the _Church-Turing conjecture._|   |

Now, as I have said, image generation is only one component of virtual reality: there is the all-important interactive element as well. A virtual-reality generator can be thought of as an image generator whose _resources/books//The Fabric of Reality - David Deutsch are not wholly specified in advance but depend partly on what the user chooses to do. It does not play its user a predetermined sequence of _resources/books//The Fabric of Reality - David Deutsch, as a movie or a feelie would. It composes the _resources/books//The Fabric of Reality - David Deutsch as it goes along, taking into account a continuous stream of information about what the user is doing. Present-day virtual-reality generators, for instance, keep track of the position of the user's head, using motion sensors as shown in Figure 5.1. Ultimately they will have to keep track of everything the user does that could affect the subjective appearance of the emulated environment. The environment may include the user's own body: since the body is external to the mind, the specification of a virtual-reality environment may legitimately include the requirement that the user's body should seem to have been replaced by a new one with specified properties.

The human mind affects the body and the outside world by emitting nerve impulses. Therefore a virtual-reality generator can in principle obtain all the information it needs about what the user In doing by intercepting the nerve signals coming from the user's brain. Those signals, which would have gone to the user's body, can instead be transmitted to a computer and decoded to determine exactly how the user's body would have moved. The signals sent back to the brain by the computer can be the same as those that would have been sent by the body if it were in the specified environment. If the specification called for it, the simulated body could also react differently from the real one, for example to enable it to survive in simulations of environments that would kill a real human body, or to simulate malfunctions of the body.

I had better admit here that it is probably too great an idealization to say that the human mind interacts with the outside world  {111}  _only_ by emitting and receiving nerve impulses. There are chemical messages passing in both directions as well. I am assuming that in principle those messages could also be intercepted and replaced at some point between the brain and the rest of the body. Thus the user would lie motionless, connected to the computer, but having the experience of interacting fully with a simulated world - in effect, living there. Figure 5.2 illustrates what I am envisaging. Incidentally, though such technology lies well in the future, the idea for it is much older than the theory of computation itself. In the early seventeenth century Descartes was already considering the philosophical implications of a sense-manipulating 'demon' that was essentially a virtual-reality generator of the type shown in Figure 5.2, with a supernatural mind replacing the computer.

From the foregoing discussion it seems that any virtual-reality generator must have at least three principal components:

> a set of sensors (which may be nerve-impulse detectors) to detect what the user is doing,
> 
> a set of image generators (which may be nerve-stimulation devices), and
> 
> a computer in control.

My account so far has concentrated on the first two of these, the sensors and the image generators. That is because, at the present

primitive state of the technology, virtual-reality research is still preoccupied with image generation. But when we look beyond transient technological limitations, we see that image generators merely provide the interface - the 'connecting cable' - between the user and the true virtual-reality generator, which is the computer. For it is entirely within the computer that the specified environment is simulated. It is the computer that provides the complex and autonomous 'kicking back' that justifies the word 'reality' in 'virtual reality'. The connecting cable contributes nothing to the user's perceived environment, being from the user's point of view 'transparent', just as we naturally do not perceive our own nerves as being part of our environment. Thus virtual-reality generators of the future would be better described as having only one principal component, a computer, together with some trivial peripheral devices.

I do not want to understate the practical problems involved in intercepting all the nerve signals passing into and out of the human brain, and in cracking the various codes involved. But this is a finite set of problems that we shall have to solve once only. After that, the focus of virtual-reality technology will shift once and for all to the computer, to the problem of programming it to render various environments. What environments we shall be able to render will no longer depend on what sensors and image generators we can build, but on what environments we can specify. 'Specifying' an environment will mean supplying a program for the computer, which is the heart of the virtual-reality generator.|   |   |   |

Another way in which quantum physics is implicit in classical computation is that all practical implementations of Turing-type computers rely on such things as solid matter or magnetized materials, which could not exist in the absence of quantum-mechanical effects. For example, any solid body consists of an array of atoms, which are themselves composed of electrically charged particles (electrons, and protons in the nuclei). But because of classical chaos, no array of charged particles could be stable under classical laws of motion. The positively and negatively charged particles would simply move out of position and crash into each other, and the structure would disintegrate. It is only the strong quantum interference between the various paths taken by charged particles in parallel universes that prevents such catastrophes and makes solid matter possible.

Building a universal quantum computer is well beyond present technology. As I have said, detecting an interference phenomenon always involves setting up an appropriate interaction between _all_ the variables that have been different in the universes that contribute to the interference. The more interacting particles are involved, therefore, the harder it tends to be to engineer the interaction that would display the interference - that is, the result of the compulation. Among the many technical difficulties of working at the level of a single atom or single electron, one of the most important is that of preventing the environment from being affected by the different interfering sub-computations. For if a group of atoms is undergoing an interference phenomenon, and they differentially affect other atoms in the environment, then the interference can no longer be detected by measurements of the original group alone, and the group is no longer performing any useful quantum compulation. This is called _decoherence._ I must add that this problem is often presented the wrong way round: we are told that 'quantum interference is a very delicate process, and must be shielded from all outside influences'. This is wrong. Outside influences could cause minor imperfections, but it is the effect of the quantum computation on the outside world that causes decoherence.

Thus the race is on to engineer sub-microscopic systems in which  {213}  information-carrying variables interact among themselves, but affect their environment as little as possible. Another novel simplification, unique to the quantum theory of computation, partly offsets the difficulties caused by decoherence. It turns out that, unlike classical computation, where one needs to engineer specific classical logic elements such as and, _or_ and not, the precise form of the interactions hardly matters in the quantum case. Virtually any atomic-scale system of interacting bits, so long as it does not de-1 cohere, could be made to perform useful quantum computations.

Interference phenomena involving vast numbers of particles, such I as superconductivity and superfluidity, are known, but it seems I that none of them can be used to perform any interesting computations. At the time of writing, only single-bit quantum computations can be easily performed in the laboratory. Experimentalists are confident, however, that two- and higher-bit _quantum gates_ (the quantum equivalent of the classical logical elements) will be constructed within the next few years. These are the basic components of quantum computers. Some physicists, notably Rolf i Landauer of IBM Research, are pessimistic about the prospects for further advances after that. They believe that decoherence will never be reduced to the point where more than a few consecutive quantum-computational steps can be performed. Most researcher in the field are much more optimistic (though perhaps that id because only optimistic researchers choose to work on quantum l computation!). Some special-purpose quantum computers have already been built (see below), and my own opinion is that more complex ones will appear in a matter of years rather than decades. As for the universal quantum computer, I expect that its construction too is only a matter of time, though I should not like to predict whether that time will be decades or centuries.

The fact that the repertoire of the universal quantum computei contains environments whose rendering is classically intractable implies that new classes of purely mathematical computations musi have become tractable too. For the laws of physics are, as Galileo said, expressed in mathematical language, and rendering an environment is tantamount to evaluating certain mathematical  {214}  functions. And indeed, many mathematical tasks have now been discovered which could be efficiently performed by quantum computation where all known classical methods are intractable. The most spectacular of these is the task of factorizing large numbers. The method, known as _Shor's algorithm_, was discovered in 1994 by Peter Shor of Bell Laboratories. (While this book was in proof further spectacular quantum algorithms have been discovered, including _Graver's algorithm_ for searching long lists very rapidly.)

Shor's algorithm is extraordinarily simple and requires far more modest hardware than would be needed for a universal quantum computer. It is likely, therefore, that a _quantum factorization engine_ will be built long before the full range of quantum computations is technologically feasible. This is a prospect of great significance for _cryptography_ (the science of securely communicating and authenticating information). Realistic communication networks may be global and have large, constantly changing sets of participants with unpredictable patterns of communication. It is impractical to require every pair of participants, physically and in advance, to exchange secret cryptographic keys that would allow them later to communicate without fear of eavesdroppers. _Public-key cryptography_ is any method of sending secret information where the piender and recipient do not already share any secret information. The most secure known method of public-key cryptography depends on the intractability of the problem of factorizing large numbers. This method is known as the RSA cryptosystem, named after Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adelman, who first proposed it in 1978. It depends on a mathematical procedure whereby a message can be encoded using a large (say, 250-digit) number as a key. The recipient can freely make this key public, because any message encoded with it can only be decoded given a knowledge of the factors of that number. Thus I can choose two 125-digit prime numbers and keep them secret, but multiply them together and make their 250-digit product public. Anyone can send me a message using that number as the key, but only I can read the messages because only I know the secret factors.

As I have said, there is no practical prospect of factorizing  {215}  250-digit numbers by classical means. But a quantum factorization engine running Shor's algorithm could do it using only a few thousand arithmetic operations, which might well take only a matter of minutes. So anyone with access to such a machine would easily be able to read any intercepted message that had been encrypted using the RSA cryptosystem.

It would do the cryptographers no good to choose larger numbers as keys because the resources required by Shor's algorithm increase only slowly with the size of the number being factorized. In the quantum theory of computation, factorization is a very tractable task. It is thought that, in the presence of a given level of decoher-ence, there would again be a practical limit on the size of number that could be factorized, but there is no known lower limit on the rate of decoherence that can be technologically achieved. So we must conclude that one day in the future, at a time that cannot now be predicted, the RSA cryptosystem with any given length of key may become insecure. In a certain sense, that makes it insecure even today. For anyone, or any organization, that records an RSA-encrypted message today, and waits until they can buy a quantum factorization engine with low enough decoherence, will be able to decode the message. That may not happen for centuries, or it may be only decades - perhaps less, who can tell? But the likelihood that it will be rather a long time is all that now remains of the former complete security of the RSA system.

When a quantum factorization engine is factorizing a 250-digit number, the number of interfering universes will be of the order of 10500 - that is, ten to the power of 500. This staggeringly large number is the reason why Shor's algorithm makes factorization tractable. I said that the algorithm requires only a few thousand arithmetic operations. I meant, of course, a few thousand operations _in each universe_ that contributes to the answer. All those computations are performed in parallel, in different universes, and share their results through interference.

You may be wondering how we can persuade our counterparts in 10500-odd universes to start working on our factorization task. Will they not have their own agendas for the use of their computers?  {216}  No - and no persuasion is necessary. Shor's algorithm operates initially only on a set of universes that are _identical_ to one another, and it causes them to become differentiated only within the confines of the factorization engine. So we, who specified the number to be factorized, and who wait while the answer is computed, are identical in. all the interfering universes. There are, no doubt, many other universes in which we programmed different numbers or never built the factorization engine at all. But those universes differ from ours in too many variables - or more precisely, in variables that ure not made to interact in the right way by the programming of Shor's algorithm - and so do not interfere with our universe.

The argument of Chapter 2]], applied to _any_ interference phenomenon destroys the classical idea that there is only one universe. Logically, the possibility of complex quantum computations adds nothing to a case that is already unanswerable. But it does add psychological impact. With Shor's algorithm, the argument has been writ very large. To those who still cling to a single-universe world-view, I issue this challenge: _explain how Shor's algorithm works._ I do not merely mean predict that it will work, which is merely a matter of solving a few uncontroversial equations. I mean provide an explanation. When Shor's algorithm has factorized a number, using 10500 or so times the computational resources that can be seen to be present, where was the number factorized? There are only about 1080 atoms in the entire visible universe, an utterly miniscule number compared with 10500. So if the visible universe were the extent of physical reality, physical reality would not even remotely contain the resources required to factorize such a large number. Who did factorize it, then? How, and where, was the computation performed?

I have been discussing traditional types of mathematical task that quantum computers would be able to perform more quickly than existing machines. But there is an additional class of new tasks open to quantum computers that no classical computer could perform at all. By a strange coincidence, one of the first of these tasks to be discovered also concerns public-key cryptography. This time it is not a matter of breaking an existing system, but of  {217}  implementing a new, absolutely secure system of _quantum cryptography._ In 1989, at IBM Research, Yorktown Heights, New York, in the office of the theoretician Charles Bennett, the first working quantum computer was built. It was a special-purpose quantum computer consisting of a pair of quantum cryptographic devices designed by Bennett and pilles Brassard of the University of Montreal. It became the first machine ever to perform non-trivial computations that no Turing machine could perform.

In Bennett and Brassard's quantum cryptosystem, messages are encoded in the states of individual photons emitted by a laser. Although many photons are needed to transmit a message (one photon per bit, plus many more photons wasted in various inefficiencies), the machines can be built with existing technology because they need to perform their quantum computations on only one photon at a time. The system's security is based not on intractability, either classical or quantum, but directly on the properties of quantum interference: that is what gives it its classically unobtainable absolute security. No amount of future computation by any sort of computer, whether for millions or trillions of years, would be of any help to an eavesdropper on quantum-encrypted messages: for if one communicates through a medium exhibiting interference, _one can detect eavesdroppers._ According to classical physics, there is nothing that can prevent an eavesdropper who has physical access to a communication medium, such as a telephone line, from installing a passive listening device. But, as I have explained, if one makes any measurement on a quantum system one alters its subsequent interference properties. The communi cation protocol relies on this effect. The communicating partic effectively set up repeated interference experiments, co-ordinating them over a public communication channel. Only if the interference passes the test for there having been no eavesdropper do they pass on to the next stage of the protocol, which is to use some of the transmitted information as a cryptographic key. At worst, persistent eavesdropper might prevent any communication froi taking place at all (though of course that is more easily achievr just by cutting the telephone line). But as for reading a message,  {218}  only the intended recipient can do that, and the guarantee of that is provided by the laws of physics.

Because quantum cryptography depends on manipulating individual photons, it suffers from a major limitation. Each photon that is successfully received, carrying one bit of the message, must somehow have been transmitted intact from the transmitter to the receiver. But every method of transmission involves losses, and if these are too heavy the message will never arrive. Setting up relay stations (which is the remedy for this problem in existing communication systems) would compromise the security because an eavesdropper could, without being detected, monitor what goes on inside the relay station. The best existing quantum-cryptographic systems use fibre-optic cables and have a range of about ten kilometres. This would suffice to provide, say, the financial district of a city with absolutely secure internal communications. Marketable systems may not be far away, but to solve the problem of public-key cryptography in general - say, for global communication - further advances in quantum cryptography are required.

Experimental and theoretical research in the field of quantum computation is accelerating world-wide. Ever more promising new technologies for realizing quantum computers are being proposed, and new types of quantum computation with various advantages over classical computation are continually being discovered and analysed. I find all these developments very exciting, and I believe that some of them will bear technological fruit. But as far as this book is concerned, that is a side-issue. From a fundamental standpoint it does not matter how useful quantum computation turns out to be, nor does it matter whether we build the first universal quantum computer next week, or centuries from now, or never. The quantum theory of computation must in any case be an integral part of the world-view of anyone who seeks a fundamental understanding of reality. What quantum computers tell us about connections between the laws of physics, universality, and apparently unrelated strands of explanation of the fabric of reality, we can discover - and are already discovering - by studying them theoretically.  {219} 

### TERMINOLOGY

**quantum computation** Computation that requires quantum-mechanical processes, especially interference. In other words, computation that is performed in collaboration between parallel universes.

**exponential computation** A computation whose resource requirements (such as the time required) increase by a roughly constant factor for each additional digit in the input.

**tractable/intractable** (Rough-and-ready rule) A computational task is deemed tractable if the resources required to perform it do not increase exponentially with the number of digits in the input.

**chaos** The instability in the motion of most classical systems. A small difference between two initial states gives rise to exponentially growing deviations between the two resulting trajectories. But reality obeys quantum and not classical physics. Unpredictability caused by chaos is in general swamped by quantum indeterminacy caused by identical universes becoming different.

**universal quantum computer** A computer that could perform any computation that any other quantum computer could perform, and render any finite, physically possible environment in virtual reality.

**quantum cryptography** Any form of cryptography that can be performed by quantum computers but not by classical computers.

**special-purpose quantum computer** A quantum computer, such as a quantum cryptographic device or quantum factorization engine, that is not a universal quantum computer.

**decoherence** If different branches of a quantum computation, in different universes, affect the environment differently, then interference is reduced and the computation may fail. Decoherenct is the principal obstacle to the practical realization of more powerful quantum computers.

### SUMMARY

The laws of physics permit computers that can render every physically possible environment without using impractically large resources. So universal computation is not merely possible, as required by the Turing principle, it is also tractable. Quantum phenomena may involve vast numbers of parallel universes and therefore may not be capable of being efficiently simulated within one universe. However, this strong form of universality still holds because quantum computers can efficiently render every physically possible quantum environment, even when vast numbers of universes are interacting. Quantum computers can also efficiently solve certain mathematical problems, such as factorization, which are classically intractable, and can implement types of cryptography which are classically impossible. Quantum computation is a qualitatively new way of harnessing nature.

_The next chapter is likely to provoke many mathematicians. This tan't be helped. Mathematics is not what they think it is._

(_Readers who are unfamiliar with traditional assumptions about the certainty of mathematical knowledge may consider the chapter's main conclusion - that our knowledge of mathematical truth depends on, and is no more reliable than, our knowledge of the physical world - to be obvious. Such readers may prefer to skim this chapter and hurry on to the discussion of time in Chapter 11]]._)  {220}|   |   |   |

This raises a problem for anyone who prefers explanations to unexplained complications. Instead of solving that problem by providing an alternative or deeper explanatory structure for the natural numbers, intuitionism does exactly what the Inquisition did, and what solipsists do: it retreats still further from explanation. It introduces further unexplained complications (in this case the denial of the law of the excluded middle) whose only purpose is to allow intuitionists to behave as if their opponents' explanation were true, while drawing no conclusions about reality from this.

Just as solipsism starts with the motivation of simplifying a frighteningly diverse and uncertain world, but when taken seriously turns out to be realism _plus_ some unnecessary complications, so intuitionism ends up being one of the most counter-intuitive doctrines that has ever been seriously advocated.{232}  statement would in principle be provable under the rules, and that no false statement would be. In 1900, to mark the turn of the century, Hilbert published a list of problems that he hoped mathematicians might be able to solve during the course of the twentieth century. The tenth problem was to find a set of rules of inference with the above properties, and, by their own standards, to prove them consistent.

Hilbert was to be definitively disappointed. Thirty-one years later, Kurt Gödel revolutionized proof theory with a root-and-branch refutation from which the mathematical and philosophical worlds are still reeling: he proved that Hilbert's tenth problem is insoluble. Gödel proved first that any set of rules of inference that is capable of correctly validating even the proofs of ordinary arithmetic could never validate a proof of its own consistency. Therefore there is no hope of finding the provably consistent set of rules that Hilbert envisaged. Second, Gödel proved that if a set of rules of inference in some (sufficiently rich) branch of mathematics _is_ consistent (whether provably so or not), then within that branch of mathematics there must exist valid methods of proof that those rules fail to designate as valid. This is called _Gödel's incompleteness theorem_. To prove his theorems, Gödel used a remarkable extension of the Cantor 'diagonal argument' that I mentioned in Chapter 6]]. He began by considering any consistent set of rules of inference. Then he showed how to construct a proposition which could neither be proved nor disproved under those rules. Then he proved that that proposition would be true.

If Hilbert's programme had worked, it would have been bad news for the conception of reality that I am promoting in this book, for it would have removed the necessity for _understanding_ in judging mathematical ideas. Anyone - or any mindless machine - that could learn Hilbert's hoped-for rules of inference by heart would be as good a judge of mathematical propositions as the ablest mathematician, yet without needing the mathematician's insight or understanding, or even having the remotest clue as to what the propositions were about. In principle, it would be possible to make new mathematical discoveries without knowing any mathematics  {234}  at all, beyond Hilbert's rules. One would simply check through all possible strings of letters and mathematical symbols in alphabetical order, until one of them passed the test for being a proof or disproof of some famous unsolved conjecture. In principle, one could settle any mathematical controversy without ever understanding it - without even knowing the meanings of the symbols, let alone understanding how the proof worked, or what it proved, or what the method of proof was, or why it was reliable.

It may seem that the achievement of a unified standard of proof in mathematics could at least have helped us in the overall drive towards unification - that is, the 'deepening' of our knowledge that I referred to in Chapter 1]]. But the opposite is the case. Like the predictive 'theory of everything' in physics, Hilbert's rules would have told us almost nothing about the fabric of reality. They would, as far as mathematics goes, have realized the ultimate reductionist vision, predicting everything (in principle) but explaining nothing. Moreover, if mathematics had been reductionist then all the undesirable features which I argued in Chapter 1]] are absent from the structure of human knowledge would have been present in mathematics: mathematical ideas would have formed a hierarchy, with Hilbert's rules at its root. Mathematical truths whose verification from the rules was very complex would have been objectively less fundamental than those that could be verified immediately from the rules. Since there could have been only a finite supply of such fundamental truths, as time went on mathematics would have had to concern itself with ever less fundamental problems. Mathematics might well have come to an end, under this dismal hypothesis. If it did not, it would inevitably have fragmented into ever more arcane specialities, as the complexity of the 'emergent' issues that mathematicians would have been forced to study increased, and as the connections between those issues and the foundations of the subject became ever more remote.

Thanks to Goedel, we know that there will never be a fixed method of determining whether a mathematical proposition is true, any more than there is a fixed way of determining whether a scientific theory is true. Nor will there ever be a fixed way of generating  {235}  new mathematical knowledge. Therefore progress in mathematics will always depend on the exercise of creativity. It will always be possible, and necessary, for mathematicians to invent new types of proof. They will validate them by new arguments and by new modes of explanation depending on their ever improving understanding of the abstract entities involved. Gödel's own theorems were a case in point: to prove them, he had to invent a new method of proof. I said the method was based on the 'diagonal argument', but Gödel extended that argument in a new way. Nothing had ever been proved in this way before; no rules of inference laid down by someone who had never seen Gödel's method could possibly have been prescient enough to designate it as valid. Yet it _is_ self-evidently valid. Where did this self-evidentness come from? It came from Gödel's understanding of the nature of proof. Gödel's proofs are as compelling as any in mathematics, but only if one first understands the explanation that accompanies them.

So explanation does, after all, play the same paramount role in pure mathematics as it does in science. Explaining and understanding the world - the physical world and the world of mathematical abstractions - is in both cases the object of the exercise. Proof and' observation are merely means by which we check our explanations. Roger Penrose has drawn a further, radical and very Platonic lesson from Gödel's results. Like Plato, Penrose is fascinated by the ability of the human mind to grasp the abstract certainties of mathematics. Unlike Plato, Penrose does not believe in the supernatural, and takes it for granted that the brain is part of, and has access only to, the natural world. So the problem is even more acute for him than it was for Plato: how can the fuzzy, unreliable physical world deliver mathematical certainties to a fuzzy, unreliable part of itself such as a mathematician? In particular, Penrose wonders how we can possibly perceive the infallibility of new, valid _forms_ of proof, of which Gödel assures us there is an unlimited supply.{236}  of physics, and in particular that it is incompatible with the Turing principle. His argument, in summary, runs as follows. If the Turing principle is true, then we can consider the brain (like any other object) to be a computer executing a particular program. The brain's interactions with the environment constitute the inputs and outputs of the program. Now consider a mathematician in the act of deciding whether some newly proposed type of proof is valid or not. Making such a decision is tantamount to executing a proof-validating computer program within the mathematician's brain. Such a program embodies a set of Hilbertian rules of inference which, according to Gödel's theorem, cannot possibly be complete. Moreover, as I have said, Gödel provides a way of constructing, and proving, a true proposition which those rules can never recognize as proven. Therefore the mathematician, whose mind is effectively a computer applying those rules, can never recognize the proposition as proven either. Penrose then proposes to show the proposition, and Gödel's method of proving it to be true, to that very mathematician. The mathematician understands the proof. It is, after all, self-evidently valid, so the mathematician can presumably see that it is valid. But that would contradict Gödel's theorem. Therefore there must be a false assumption somewhere in the argument, and Penrose thinks that the false assumption is the Turing principle.

Most computer scientists do not agree with Penrose that the Turing principle is the weakest link in his story. They would say that the mathematician in the story would indeed be unable to recognize the Gödelian proposition as proven. It may seem odd that a mathematician should suddenly become unable to comprehend a self-evident proof. But look at this proposition:

_David Deutsch cannot consistently judge this statement to be true._

I am trying as hard as I can, but I cannot consistently judge it to be true. For if I did, I would be judging that I _cannot_ judge it to be true, and would be contradicting myself. But _you_ can see that it is true, can't you? This shows it is at least possible for a proposition to be unfathomable to one person yet self-evidently true to everyone else.  {237} 

Anyway, Penrose hopes for a new, fundamental theory of physics replacing both quantum theory and the general theory of relativity. It would make new, testable predictions, though it would of course agree with quantum theory and relativity for all existing observations. (There are no known experimental counter-examples to those theories.) However, Penrose's world is fundamentally very different from what existing physics describes. Its basic fabric of reality is what _we_ call the world of mathematical abstractions. In this respect Penrose, whose reality includes all mathematical abstractions, but perhaps not _all_ abstractions (like honour and justice), is somewhere between Plato and Pythagoras. What we call the physical world is, to him, fully real (another difference from Plato), but is somehow part of, or emergent from, mathematics itself. Furthermore, there is no universality; in particular, there is no machine that can render all possible human thought processes. Nevertheless, the world (especially, of course, its mathematical substrate) is still comprehensible. Its comprehensibility is ensured not by the universality of computation, but by a phenomenon quite new to physics (though not to Plato): _mathematical entities impinge directly on the human brain_, via physical processes yet to be discovered. In this way the brain, according to Penrose, does not do mathematics solely by reference to what we currently call the physical world. It has direct access to a Platonic reality of mathematical Forms, and can perceive mathematical truths there with (blunders aside) absolute certainty.{238}  universality, so that under his new theory it will not be possible to construe some of the actions of the brain as computations at all.

I must admit that I cannot conceive of such a theory. However, fundamental breakthroughs do tend to be hard to conceive of before they occur. Naturally, it is hard to judge Penrose's theory before he succeeds in formulating it fully. If a theory with the properties he hopes for does eventually supersede quantum theory or general relativity, or both, whether through experimental testing or by providing a deeper level of explanation, then every reasonable person would want to adopt it. And then we would embark on the adventure of comprehending the new world-view that the theory's explanatory structures would compel us to adopt. It is likely that this would be a very different world-view from the one I am presenting in this book. However, even if all this came to pass, I am nevertheless at a loss to see how the theory's original motivation, that of explaining our ability to grasp new mathematical proofs, could possibly be satisfied. The fact would remain that, now and throughout history, great mathematicians have had different, conflicting intuitions about the validity of various methods of proof. So even if it is true that an absolute, physico-mathematical reality feeds its truths directly into our brains to create mathematical intuitions, mathematicians are not always able to distinguish those intuitions from other, mistaken intuitions and ideas. There is, unfortunately, no bell that rings, or light that flashes, when we are comprehending a truly valid proof. We might sometimes feel such a flash, at a 'eureka' moment - and nevertheless be mistaken. And even if the theory predicted that there _is_ some previously unnoticed physical indicator accompanying true intuitions (this is getting extremely implausible now), we should certainly find it useful, but that would still not amount to a proof that the indicator works. Nothing could prove that an even better physical theory would not one day supersede Penrose's, and reveal that the supposed indicator was unreliable after all, and some other indicator was better. Thus, even if we make every possible concession to Penrose's proposal, if we imagine it is true and view the world entirely in its terms, it  {239}  still does not help us to explain the alleged certainty of the knowledge that we acquire by doing mathematics.

I have presented only a sketch of the arguments of Penrose and his opponents. The reader will have gathered that essentially I side with the opponents. However, even if it is conceded that Penrose's Gödelian argument fails to prove what it sets out to prove, and his proposed new physical theory seems unlikely to explain what it sets out to explain, Penrose is nevertheless right that any world-view based on the existing conception of scientific rationality creates a problem for the accepted foundations of mathematics (or, as Penrose would have it, vice versa). This is the ancient problem that Plato raised, a problem which, as Penrose points out, becomes more acute in the light of both Gödel's theorem and the Turing principle. It is this: in a reality composed of physics and understood by the methods of science, where does mathematical certainty come from? While most mathematicians and computer scientists take the certainty of mathematical intuition for granted, they do not take seriously the problem of reconciling this with a scientific world-view. Penrose does take it seriously, and he proposes a solution. His proposal envisages a comprehensible world, rejects the supernatural, recognizes creativity as being central to mathematics, ascribes objective reality both to the physical world and to abstract entities, and involves an integration of the foundations of mathematics and physics. In all those respects I am on his side.

Since Brouwer's, and Hilbert's, and Penrose's and all other attempts to meet Plato's challenge do not seem to have succeeded, it is worth looking again at Plato's apparent demolition of the idea that mathematical truth can be obtained by the methods of science.{240}  tools because the first one would have to be built with inaccurate machine tools. With the benefit of hindsight, we can see that this line of criticism depends on a very crude picture of how science works - something like inductivism - which is hardly surprising, since Plato lived before anything that we would recognize as science. If, say, the only way of learning about circles from experience were to examine thousands of physical circles and then, from the accumulated data, to try to infer something about their abstract Euclidean counterparts, Plato would have a point. But if we form a hypothesis that real circles resemble the abstract ones in specified ways, and we happen to be right, then we may well learn something about abstract circles by looking at real ones. In Euclidean geometry one often uses diagrams to specify a geometrical problem or its solution. There is a possibility of error in such a method of description if the imperfections of circles in the diagram give a misleading impression - for example if two circles seem to touch each other when they do not. But if one understands the relationship between real circles and perfect circles, one can, with care, eliminate all such errors. If one does not understand that relationship, it is practically impossible to understand Euclidean geometry at all.

The reliability of the knowledge of a _perfect_ circle that one can gain from a _diagram_ of a circle depends entirely on the accuracy of the hypothesis that the two resemble each other in the relevant ways. Such a hypothesis, referring to a physical object (the diagram), amounts to a physical theory and can never be known with certainty. But that does not, as Plato would have it, preclude the possibility of learning about perfect circles from experience; it just precludes the possibility of certainty. That should not worry anyone who is looking not for certainty but for explanations.|   |   |   |

|<<]]||>>]]|{241}  hypothesis that the physical behaviour of the symbols corresponds to the behaviour of the abstractions they denote. Therefore the reliability of what we learn by manipulating those symbols depends entirely on the accuracy of our theories of their physical behaviour, and of the behaviour of our hands, eyes, and so on with which we manipulate and observe the symbols. Trick ink that caused the occasional symbol to change its appearance when we were not looking - perhaps under the remote control of some high-technology practical joker - could soon mislead us about what we know 'for certain'.

Now let us re-examine another assumption of Plato's: the assumption that we do not have access to perfection in the physical world. He may be right that we shall not find perfect honour or justice, and he is certainly right that we shall not find the laws of physics or the set of all natural numbers. But we can find a perfect hand in bridge, or the perfect move in a given chess position. That is to say, we can find physical objects or processes that fully possess the properties of the specified abstractions. We can learn chess just as well with a real chess set as we could with a perfect Form of a chess set. The fact that a knight is chipped does not make the checkmate it delivers any less final.

As it happens, a perfect Euclidean circle _can_ be made available to our senses. Plato did not realize this because he did not know about virtual reality. It would not be especially difficult to program the virtual-reality generators I envisaged in Chapter 5]] with the rules of Euclidean geometry in such a way that the user could experience an interaction with a perfect circle. Having no thickness, the circle would be invisible unless we also modified the laws of optics, in which case we might give it a glow to let the user know where it is. (Purists might prefer to manage without this embellishment.) We could make the circle rigid and impenetrable, and the user could test its properties using rigid, impenetrable tools and measuring instruments. Virtual-reality callipers would have to come to a perfect knife-edge so that they could measure a zero thickness accurately. The user could be allowed to 'draw' further circles or other geometrical figures according to the rules of Euclidean geometry.  {242}  The sizes of the tools, and the user's own size, could be adjustable at will, to allow the predictions of geometrical theorems to be checked on any scale, no matter how fine. In every way, the rendered circle could respond precisely as specified in Euclid's axioms. So, on the basis of present-day science we must conclude that Plato had it backwards. We _can_ perceive perfect circles in physical reality (i.e. virtual reality); but we shall never perceive them in the domain of Forms, for, in so far as such a domain can be said to exist, we have no perceptions of it at all.

Incidentally, Plato's idea that physical reality consists of imperfect imitations of abstractions seems an unnecessarily asymmetrical stance nowadays. Like Plato, we still study abstractions for their own sake. But in post-Galilean science, and in the theory of virtual reality, we also regard abstractions as means of understanding real or artificial _physical_ entities, and in that context we take it for granted that the abstractions are nearly always _approximations_ to the true physical situation. So, whereas Plato thought of Earthly circles in the sand as approximations to true, mathematical circles, a modern physicist would regard a mathematical circle as a bad approximation to the real shapes of planetary orbits, atoms and other physical things.

Given that there will always be a possibility that the virtual-reality generator or its user interface will go wrong, can a virtual-reality rendering of a Euclidean circle really be said to achieve perfection, up to the standards of mathematical certainty? It can. No one claims that mathematics itself is free from _that_ sort of uncertainty. Mathematicians can miscalculate, mis-remember axioms, introduce misprints into their accounts of their own work, and so on. The claim is that, _apart from blunders_, their conclusions are infallible. Similarly, the virtual-reality generator, when it was working properly according to its design specifications, would render a perfect Euclidean circle perfectly.{243}  laws of physics for sure, we cannot know for sure that the machine is genuinely rendering Euclidean geometry. But again, no one denies that unforeseen physical phenomena - whether they result from unknown laws of physics or merely from brain disease or trick ink - could mislead a mathematician. But if the laws of physics are in relevant respects as we think they are, then the virtual-reality generator can do its job perfectly, even though we cannot be certain that it is doing so. We must be careful here to distinguish between two issues: whether _we can know_ that the virtual-reality machine is rendering a perfect circle; and whether it is _in fact_ rendering one. I We can never know for sure, but that need not detract one iota ' from the perfection of the circle that the machine actually renders. I shall return to this crucial distinction - between perfect knowledge (certainty) about an entity, and the entity itself being 'perfect' - in a moment.

Suppose that we deliberately modify the Euclidean geometry program so that the virtual-reality generator will still render circles quite well, but less than perfectly. Would we be unable to infer _anything_ about perfect circles by experiencing this imperfect rendering? That would depend entirely on whether we knew in what respects the program had been altered. If we did know, we could work out with certainty (apart from blunders, etc.) which aspects of the experiences we had within the machine would faithfully represent perfect circles, and which would not. And in that case the knowledge we gained there would be just as reliable as any we gained when we were using the correct program.

When we _imagine_ circles we are doing just this sort of virtual-reality rendering within our own brains. The reason why this is not a useless way of thinking about perfect circles is that we are able to form accurate theories about what properties our imagined circles do or do not share with perfect ones.

Using a perfect virtual-reality rendering, we might experience six identical circles touching the edge of another identical circle in a plane without overlapping. This experience, under those circumstances, would amount to a rigorous proof that such a pattern is possible, because the geometrical properties of the rendered shapes  {244}  would be absolutely identical with those of the abstract shapes. But this sort of 'hands-on' interaction with perfect shapes is not capable of yielding _every_ sort of knowledge of Euclidean geometry. Most of the interesting theorems refer not to one geometrical pattern but to infinite classes of patterns. For example, the sum of the angles of any Euclidean triangle is 180�. We can measure particular triangles with perfect accuracy in virtual reality, but even in virtual reality we cannot measure all triangles, and so we cannot verify the theorem.

How do we verify it? We prove it. A proof is traditionally defined as a sequence of statements satisfying self-evident rules of inference, but what does the 'proving' _process_ amount to physically? To prove a statement about infinitely many triangles at once, we examine certain physical objects - in this case symbols - which have properties in common with whole classes of triangles. For example, when, under appropriate circumstances, we observe the symbols 'D_���_=D_DEF_' (i.e. 'triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF'), we conclude that a whole class of triangles that we have defined in a particular way always have the same shape as corresponding triangles in another class which we have defined differently. The 'appropriate circumstances' that give this conclusion the ittatus of proof are, in physical terms, that the symbols appear on a page underneath other symbols (some of which represent axioms of Euclidean geometry) and that the pattern in which the symbols tippear conforms to certain rules, namely the rules of inference.{245}  regress, for we should first have to prove that the method of proof that we used was itself valid). Nor can we haughtily tell the critics that there must be something wrong with their intuition, because _our_ intuition says that the symbols will mimic the abstract entities perfectly. All we can do is explain. We must explain why we think that, under the circumstances, the symbols will behave in the desired way under our proposed rules. And the critics can explain why they favour a rival theory. A disagreement over two such theories is, in part, a disagreement about the observable behaviour of physical objects. Such disagreements can be addressed by the normal methods of science. Sometimes they can be readily resolved; sometimes not. Another cause of such a disagreement could be a conceptual clash about the nature of the abstract entities themselves. Then again, it is a matter of rival explanations, this time about abstractions rather than physical objects. Either we could come to a common understanding with our critics, or we could agree that we were discussing two different abstract objects, or we could fail to agree. There are no guarantees. Thus, contrary to the traditional belief, it is not the case that disputes within mathematics can always be resolved by purely procedural means.

A conventional symbolic proof seems at first sight to have quite a different character from the 'hands-on' virtual-reality sort of proof. But we see now that they are related in the way that computations are to physical experiments. Any physical experiment can be regarded as a computation, and any computation is a physical experiment. In both sorts of proof, physical entities (whether in virtual reality or not) are manipulated according to rules. In both cases the physical entities represent the abstract entities of interest. And in both cases the reliability of the proof depends on the truth of the theory that physical and abstract entities do indeed share the appropriate properties.{246}  text, we mean that the object can be used as a program for recreating a computation of the appropriate kind.

It follows that neither the theorems of mathematics, nor the process of mathematical proof, nor the experience of mathematical intuition, confers any certainty. Nothing does. Our mathematical knowledge may, just like our scientific knowledge, be deep and broad, it may be subtle and wonderfully explanatory, it may be uncontroversially accepted; but it cannot be certain. No one can guarantee that a proof that was previously thought to be valid will not one day turn out to contain a profound misconception, made to seem natural by a previously unquestioned 'self-evident' assumption either about the physical world, or about the abstract world, or about the way in which some physical and abstract entities are related.

It was just such a mistaken, self-evident assumption that caused geometry itself to be mis-classified as a branch of mathematics for over two millennia, from about 300 bc when Euclid wrote his _Elements_, to the nineteenth century (and indeed in most dictionaries and schoolbooks to this day). Euclidean geometry formed part of every mathematician's intuition. Eventually some mathematicians began to doubt that one in particular of Euclid's axioms was self-evident (the so-called 'parallel axiom'). They did not, at first, doubt that this axiom was true. The great German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss is said to have been the first to put it to the test. The parallel axiom is required in the proof that the angles of a triangle add up to 180�. Legend has it that, in the greatest secrecy (for fear of ridicule), Gauss placed assistants with lanterns and theodolites at the summits of three hills, the vertices of the largest triangle he could conveniently measure. He detected no deviation from Euclid's predictions, but we now know that that was only because his instruments were not sensitive enough. (The vicinity of the Earth happens to be rather a tame place geometrically.) Einstein's general theory of relativity included a new theory of geometry that contradicted Euclid's and has been vindicated by experiment. The angles of a real triangle really do _not_ necessarily add up to 180�: the true total depends on the gravitational field within the triangle.  {247} 

A very similar mis-classification has been caused by the fundamental mistake that mathematicians since antiquity have been making about the very nature of their subject, namely that mathematical knowledge is more certain than any other form of knowledge. Having made that mistake, one has no choice but to classify proof theory as part of mathematics, for a mathematical theorem could not be certain if the theory that justifies its method of proof were itself uncertain. But as we have just seen, proof theory is not a branch of mathematics - it is a science. Proofs are not abstract. There is no such thing as abstractly proving something, just as there is no such thing as abstractly calculating or computing something. One can of course define a class of abstract entities and call them 'proofs', but those 'proofs' cannot verify mathematical statements because no one can see them. They cannot persuade anyone of the truth of a proposition, any more than an abstract virtual-reality generator that does not physically exist can persuade people that they are in a different environment, or an abstract computer can factorize a number for us. A mathematical 'theory of proofs' would have no bearing on which mathematical truths can or cannot be proved in reality, just as a theory of abstract 'computation' has no bearing on what mathematicians - or anyone else - can or cannot calculate in reality, unless there is a separate, empirical reason for believing that the abstract 'computations' in the theory resemble real computations. Computations, including the special computations that qualify as proofs, are physical processes. Proof theory is about how to ensure that those processes correctly mimic the abstract entities they are intended to mimic.{248}  his results. His results were self-evidently justified, not because they were 'pure logic' but because mathematicians found the assumptions self-evident.

One of Gödel's assumptions was the traditional one that a proof can have only a finite number of steps. The intuitive justification of this assumption is that we are finite beings and could never grasp a literally infinite number of assertions. This intuition, by the way, caused many mathematicians to worry when, in 1976, Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken used a computer to prove the famous 'four-colour conjecture' (that using only four different colours, any map drawn in a plane can be coloured so that no two adjacent regions have the same colour). The program required hundreds of hours of computer time, which meant that the steps of the proof, if written down, could not have been read, let alone recognized as self-evident, by a human being in many lifetimes. 'Should we take the computer's word for it that the four-colour conjecture is proved?', the sceptics wondered - though it had never occurred to them to catalogue all the firings of all the neurons in their own brains when they accepted a relatively 'simple' proof.

The same worry may seem more justified when applied to a putative proof with an infinite number of steps. But what is a 'step', and what is 'infinite'? In the fifth century bc Zeno of Elea concluded, on the basis of a similar intuition, that Achilles will never overtake the tortoise if the tortoise has a head start. After all, by the time Achilles reaches the point where the tortoise is now, it will have moved on a little. By the time he reaches _that_ point, it will have moved a little further, and so on _ad infinitum._ Thus the 'catching-up' procedure requires Achilles to perform an infinite number of catching-up steps, which as a finite being he supposedly cannot do. But what Achilles can do cannot be discovered by pure logic. It depends entirely on what the governing laws of physics say he can do. And if those laws say he will overtake the tortoise, then overtake it he will. According to classical physics, catching up requires an infinite number of steps of the form 'move to the tortoise's present location'. In that sense it is a computationally infinite operation. Equivalently, considered as a proof  {249}  that one abstract quantity becomes larger than another when a given set of operations is applied, it is a proof with an infinite number of steps. But the relevant laws designate it as a physically finite process - and that is all that counts.

GodePs intuition about steps and finiteness does, as far as we know, capture real physical constraints on the process of proof. Quantum theory requires discrete steps, and none of the known ways in which physical objects can interact would allow for an infinite number of steps to precede a measurable conclusion. (It might, however, be possible for an infinite number of steps to be completed in the whole history of the universe - as I shall explain in Chapter 14]].) Classical physics would not have conformed to these intuitions if (impossibly) it had been true. For example, the continuous motion of classical systems would have allowed for 'analogue' computation which did not proceed in steps and which had a substantially different repertoire from the universal Turing machine. Several examples are known of contrived classical laws under which an infinite amount of computation (infinite, that is, by Turing-machine or quantum-computer standards) could be performed by physically finite methods. Of course, classical physics is incompatible with the results of countless experiments, so it is rather artificial to speculate on what the 'actual' classical laws of physics 'would have been'; but what these examples show is that one cannot _prove_, independently of any knowledge of physics, that a proof must consist of finitely many steps. The same considerations apply to the intuition that there must be finitely many rules of inference, and that these must be 'straightforwardly applicable'. None of these requirements is meaningful in the abstract: they are physical requirements. Hilbert, in his influential essay 'On the Infinite', contemptuously ridiculed the idea that the 'finite-number-of-steps' requirement is a substantive one. But the above argument shows that he was mistaken: it is substantive, and it follows only from his and other mathematicians' _physical_ intuition.

At least one of Gödel's intuitions about proof turns out to have been mistaken; fortunately, it happens not to affect the proofs of  {250}  his theorems. He inherited it intact from the prehistory of Greek mathematics, and it remained unquestioned by every generation of mathematicians until it was proved false in the 1980s by discoveries in the quantum theory of computation. It is the intuition that a proof is a particular type of _object_, namely a sequence of statements that obey rules of inference. I have already argued that a proof is better regarded not as an object but as a process, a type of computation. But in the classical theory of proof or computation this makes no fundamental difference, for the following reason. If we can go through the process of a proof, we can, with only a moderate amount of extra effort, keep a record of everything relevant that happens during that process. That record, a physical object, will constitute a proof in the sequence-of-statements sense. And conversely, if we have such a record we can read through it, checking that it satisfies the rules of inference, and in the process of doing so we shall have proved the conclusion. In other words, in the classical case, converting between proof processes and proof objects is always a tractable task.

Now consider some mathematical calculation that is intractable on all classical computers, but suppose that a quantum computer can easily perform it using interference between, say, 10500 universes. To make the point more clearly, let the calculation be such that the answer (unlike the result of a factorization) cannot be tractably verified once we have it. The process of programming a quantum computer to perform such a computation, running the program and obtaining a result, constitutes a proof that the mathematical calculation has that particular result. But now there is no way of keeping a record of everything that happened during the proof process, because most of it happened in other universes, and measuring the computational state would alter the interference properties and so invalidate the proof. So creating an old-fashioned proof _object_ would be infeasible; moreover, there is not remotely enough material in the universe as we know it to make such an object, since there would be vastly more steps in the proof than there are atoms in the known universe. This example shows that because of the possibility of quantum computation, the two notions of proof  {251}  are not equivalent. The intuition of a proof as an object does not capture all the ways in which a mathematical statement may in reality be proved.

Once again, we see the inadequacy of the traditional mathematical method of deriving certainty by trying to strip away every possible source of ambiguity or error from our intuitions until only self-evident truth remains. That is what Gödel had done. That is what Church, Post and especially Turing had done when trying to intuit their universal models for computation. Turing hoped that his abstracted-paper-tape model was so simple, so transparent and well defined, that it would not depend on any assumptions about physics that could conceivably be falsified, and therefore that it could become the basis of an abstract theory of computation that was independent of the underlying physics. 'He thought,' as Feynman once put it, 'that he understood paper.' But he was mistaken. Real, quantum-mechanical paper is wildly different from the abstract stuff that the Turing machine uses. The Turing machine is entirely classical, and does not allow for the possibility that the paper might have different symbols written on it in different universes, and that those might interfere with one another. Of course, it is impractical to detect interference between different states of a paper tape. But the point is that Turing's intuition, because it included false assumptions from classical physics, caused him to abstract away some of the _computational_ properties of his hypothetical machine, the very properties he intended to keep. That is why the resulting model of computation was incomplete.

That mathematicians throughout the ages should have made various mistakes about matters of proof and certainty is only natural. The present discussion should lead us to expect that the current view will not last for ever, either. But the confidence with which mathematicians have blundered into these mistakes and their inability to acknowledge even the possibility of error in these matters are, I think, connected with an ancient and widespread confusion between the _methods_ of mathematics and its _subject-matter._ Let me explain. Unlike the relationships between physical entities,  {252}  relationships between abstract entities are independent of any contingent facts and of any laws of physics. They are determined absolutely and objectively by the autonomous properties of the abstract entities themselves. Mathematics, the study of these relationships and properties, is therefore the study of _absolutely necessary truths._ In other words, the truths that mathematics _studies_ are absolutely certain. But that does not mean that our knowledge of those necessary truths is itself certain, nor does it mean that the methods of mathematics confer necessary truth on their conclusions. After all, mathematics also studies falsehoods and paradoxes. And that does not mean that the conclusions of such a study are necessarily false or paradoxical.

Necessary truth is merely the _subject-matter_ of mathematics, not the reward we get for doing mathematics. The objective of mathematics is not, and cannot be, mathematical certainty. It is not even mathematical truth, certain or otherwise. It is, and must he, mathematical explanation.

Why, then, does mathematics work as well as it does? Why does it lead to conclusions which, though not certain, can be accepted and applied unproblematically for millennia at least? Ultimately the reason is that _some_ of our knowledge of the physical world is also that reliable and uncontroversial. And when we understand the physical world sufficiently well, we also understand which physical objects have properties in common with which abstract ones. But in principle the reliability of our knowledge of mathematics remains ptubsidiary to our knowledge of physical reality. Every mathematical proof depends absolutely for its validity on our being right about the rules that govern the behaviour of some physical objects, be they virtual-reality generators, ink and paper, or our own brains.{253}  variable - time - with respect to which attributes change, but that nevertheless objects can retain their identity over time. Another is that objects interact, and that this can change some of their attributes. Mathematical intuition concerns the way in which the physical world can display the properties of abstract entities. One such intuition is that of an abstract law, or at least an explanation, that underlies the behaviour of objects. The intuition that space admits closed surfaces that separate an 'inside' from an 'outside' may be refined into the mathematical intuition of a _set_, which partitions everything into members and non-members of the set. But further refinement by mathematicians (starting with Russell's refutation of Frege's set theory) has shown that this intuition ceases to be accurate when the sets in question contain 'too many' members (too large a degree of infinity of members).

Even if any physical or mathematical intuition were inborn, that would not confer any special authority upon it. Inborn intuition cannot be taken as a surrogate for Plato's 'memories' of the world of Forms. For it is a commonplace observation that many of the intuitions built into human beings by accidents of evolution are simply false. For example, the human eye and its controlling software implicitly embody the false theory that yellow light consists of a mixture of red and green light (in the sense that yellow light gives us exactly the same sensation as a mixture of red light and green light does). In reality, all three types of light have different frequencies and cannot be created by mixing light of other frequencies. The fact that a mixture of red and green light appears to us to be yellow light has nothing whatever to do with the properties of light, but is a property of our eyes. It is the result of a design compromise that occurred at some time during our distant ancestors' evolution. It is just possible (though I do not believe it) that Euclidean geometry or Aristotelian logic are somehow built into the structure of our brains, as the philosopher Immanuel Kant believed. But that would not logically imply that they were true. Even in the still more implausible event that we have inborn intuitions that we are constitutionally unable to shake off, such intuitions would still not be necessary truths.  {254} 

The fabric of reality, then, does have a more unified structure than would have been possible if mathematical knowledge had been verifiable with certainty, and hence hierarchical, as has traditionally been assumed. Mathematical entities are part of the fabric of reality because they are complex and autonomous. The sort of reality they form is in some ways like the realm of abstractions envisaged by Plato or Penrose: although they are by definition intangible, they exist objectively and have properties that are independent of the laws of physics. However, it is physics that allows us to gain knowledge of this realm. And it imposes stringent constraints. Whereas everything in physical reality is comprehensible, the comprehensible mathematical truths are precisely the infinitesimal minority which happen to correspond exactly to some physical truth - like the fact that if certain symbols made of ink on paper are manipulated in certain ways, certain other symbols appear. That is, they are the truths that can be rendered in virtual reality. We have no choice but to assume that the incomprehensible mathematical entities are real too, because they appear inextricably in our explanations of the comprehensible ones.{113}  one may specify in advance the appearance of the court, the weather, the demeanour of the audience and how well the opponent should play. But one does not specify how the game will go: that depends on the stream of decisions the user makes during the game. Each set of decisions will result in different responses from the simulated environment, and therefore in a different tennis game.

The number of possible tennis games that can be played in a single environment - that is, rendered by a single program - is very large. Consider a rendering of the Centre Court at Wimbledon from the point of view of a player. Suppose, very conservatively, that in each second of the game the player can move in one of two perceptibly different ways (perceptibly, that is, to the player). Then after two seconds there are four possible games, after three seconds, eight possible games, and so on. After about four minutes the number of possible games that are perceptibly different from one another exceeds the number of atoms in the universe, and it continues to rise exponentially. For a program to render that one environment accurately, it must be capable of responding in any one of those myriad, perceptibly different ways, depending on how the player chooses to behave. If two programs respond in the same way to every possible action by the user, then they render the same environment; if they would respond perceptibly differently to even one possible action, they render different environments.

That remains so even if the user never happens to perform the action that shows up the difference. The environment a program renders (for a given type of user, with a given connecting cable) is a logical property of the program, independent of whether the program is ever executed. A rendered environment is accurate in so far as it _would_ respond in the intended way to every possible action of the user. Thus its accuracy depends not only on experiences which users of it actually have, but also on experiences they do not have, but would have had if they had chosen to behave differently during the rendering. This may sound paradoxical, but as I have said, it is a straightforward consequence of the fact that virtual reality is, like reality itself, interactive.{114}  generation and virtual-reality generation. The accuracy of an image generator's rendering can in principle be experienced, measured and certified by the user, but the accuracy of a virtual-reality rendering never can be. For example, if you are a music-lover and know a particular piece well enough, you can listen to a performance of it and confirm that it is a perfectly accurate rendering, in principle down to the last note, phrasing, dynamics and all. But if you are a tennis fan who knows Wimbledon's Centre Court perfectly, you can never confirm that a purported rendering of it is accurate. Even if you are free to explore the rendered Centre Court for however long you like, and to 'kick' it in whatever way you like, and even if you have equal access to the real Centre Court for comparison, you cannot ever certify that the program does indeed render the real location. For you can never know what would have happened if only you had explored a little more, or looked over your shoulder at the right moment. Perhaps if you had sat on the rendered umpire's chair and shouted 'fault!', a nuclear submarine would have surfaced through the grass and torpedoed the Scoreboard.

On the other hand, if you find even one difference between the rendering and the intended environment, you can immediately certify that the rendering is inaccurate. Unless, that is, the rendered environment has some intentionally unpredictable features. For example, a roulette wheel is designed to be unpredictable. If we make a film of roulette being played in a casino, that film may be laid to be accurate if the numbers that are shown coming up in the film are the same numbers that actually came up when the film was made. The film will show the same numbers every time it is played: it is totally predictable. So an accurate _image_ of an unpredictable environment must be predictable. But what does it mean for a virtual-reality _rendering_ of a roulette wheel to be accurate? As before, it means that a user should not find it perceptibly different from the original. But this implies that the rendering must _not_ behave identically to the original: if it did, either it or the original could be used to predict the other's behaviour, and then neither would be unpredictable. Nor must it behave in the same way every time it is run. A perfectly rendered roulette  {115}  wheel must be just as usable for gambling as a real one. Therefore it must be just as unpredictable. Also, it must be just as fair; that is, all the numbers must come up purely randomly, with equal probabilities.

How do we recognize unpredictable environments, and how do we confirm that purportedly random numbers are distributed fairly? We check whether a rendering of a roulette wheel meets its specifications in the same way that we check whether the real thing does: by kicking (spinning) it, and seeing whether it responds as advertised. We make a large number of similar observations and perform statistical tests on the outcomes. Again, however many tests we carry out, we cannot certify that the rendering is accurate, or even that it is probably accurate. For however randomly the numbers seem to come up, they may nevertheless fall into a secret pattern that would allow a user in the know to predict them. Or perhaps if we had asked out loud the date of the battle of Waterloo, the next two numbers that came up would invariably show that date: 18, 15. On the other hand, if the sequence that comes up looks unfair, we cannot know for sure that it is, but we might be able to say that the rendering is _probably_ inaccurate. For example, if zero came up on our rendered roulette wheel on ten consecutive spins, we should conclude that we probably do not have an accurate rendering of a fair roulette wheel.

When discussing image generators, I said that the accuracy of a rendered image depends on the sharpness and other attributes of the user's senses. With virtual reality that is the least of our problems. Certainly, a virtual-reality generator that renders a given environment perfectly for humans will not do so for dolphins or extraterrestrials. To render a given environment for a user with given types of sense organs, a virtual-reality generator must be physically adapted to such sense organs and its computer must be programmed with their characteristics. However, the modifications that have to be made to accommodate a given species of user are finite, and need only be carried out once. They amount to what I have called constructing a new 'connecting cable'. As we consider environments of ever greater complexity, the task of rendering environments for  {116}  a given type of user becomes dominated by writing the programs for calculating what those environments will do; the species-specific part of the task, being of fixed complexity, becomes negligible by comparison. This discussion is about the ultimate limits of virtual reality, so we are considering arbitrarily accurate, long and complex renderings. That is why it makes sense to speak of 'rendering a given environment' without specifying who it is being rendered for.

We have seen that there is a well-defined notion of the accuracy of a virtual-reality rendering: accuracy is the closeness, as far as is perceptible, of the rendered environment to the intended one. But it must be close for every possible way in which the user might behave, and that is why, no matter how observant one is when experiencing a rendered environment, one cannot certify that it is accurate (or probably accurate). But experience can sometimes show that a rendering is inaccurate (or probably inaccurate).

This discussion of accuracy in virtual reality mirrors the relationship between theory and experiment in science. There too, it is possible to confirm experimentally that a general theory is false, but never that it is true. And there too, a short-sighted view of science is that it is all about predicting our sense-impressions. The correct view is that, while sense-impressions always play a role, what science is about is understanding the whole of reality, of which only an infinitesimal proportion is ever experienced.

The program in a virtual-reality generator embodies a general, predictive theory of the behaviour of the rendered environment. The other components deal with keeping track of what the user is doing and with the encoding and decoding of sensory data; these, as I have said, are relatively trivial functions. Thus if the environment is physically possible, rendering it is essentially equivalent to finding rules for predicting the outcome of every experiment that could be performed in that environment. Because of the way in which scientific knowledge is created, ever more accurate predictive rules can be discovered only through ever better explanatory theories. So accurately rendering a physically possible environment depends on understanding its physics.{131}  number of easily distinguishable symbols written on each square Computation was performed by examining one square at a time moving the tape backwards or forwards, and erasing or writing one of the symbols according to simple, unambiguous rules. Turing proved that one particular computer of this type, the _universal Turing machine_, had the combined repertoire of all other Turing machines. He conjectured that this repertoire consisted precisely of 'every function that would naturally be regarded as computable'. He meant computable _by mathematicians._

But mathematicians are rather untypical physical objects. Why should we assume that rendering them in the act of performing calculations is the ultimate in computational tasks? It turns out that it is not. As I shall explain in Chapter 9]], _quantum computers_ can perform computations of which no (human) mathematician will ever, even in principle, be capable. It is implicit in Turing's work that he expected what 'would naturally be regarded as computable' to be also what could, at least in principle, be computed in nature. This expectation is tantamount to a stronger, physical version of the Church-Turing conjecture. The mathematician Roger Penrose has suggested that it should be called the _Turing principle_:

**The Turing principle**

(for abstract computers simulating physical objects)

_There exists an abstract universal computer whose repertoire_

_includes any computation that any physically possible object can_

_perform._

Turing believed that the 'universal computer' in question was the universal Turing machine. To take account of the wider repertoire of quantum computers, I have stated the principle in a form that does not specify which particular 'abstract computer' does the job. The proof I have given of the existence of Cantgotu environments is essentially due to Turing. As I said, he was not thinking explicitly in terms of virtual reality, but an 'environment that can be rendered' does correspond to a class of mathematical questions whose answers can be calculated. Those questions are _computable._ The remainder, the questions for which there is no way of calculating  {132}  the answer, are called _non-computable._ If a question is non-computable that does not mean that it has no answer, or that its answer is in any sense ill-defined or ambiguous. On the contrary, it means that it definitely has an answer. It is just that physically there is no way, even in principle, of obtaining that answer (or more precisely, since one could always make a lucky, unverifiable guess, of proving that it is the answer). For example, a _prime pair_ is a pair of prime numbers whose difference is 2, such as 3 and 5, or 11 and 13. Mathematicians have tried in vain to answer the question whether there are infinitely many such pairs, or only a finite number of them. It is not even known whether this question is computable. Let us suppose that it is not. That is to say that no one, and no computer, can ever produce a proof either that there are only finitely many prime pairs or that there are infinitely many. Even so, the question does have an answer: one can say with certainty that either there is a highest prime pair or there are infinitely many prime pairs; there is no third possibility. The question remains well-defined, even though we may never know the answer.

In virtual-reality terms: no physically possible virtual-reality generator can render an environment in which answers to non-computable questions are provided to the user on demand. Such environments are of the Cantgotu type. And conversely, every Cantgotu environment corresponds to a class of mathematical questions ('what would happen next in an environment defined in such-and-such a way?') which it is physically impossible to answer.

Although non-computable questions are infinitely more numerous than computable ones, they tend to be more esoteric. That is no accident. It is because the parts of mathematics that we tend to consider the least esoteric are those we see reflected in the behaviour of physical objects in familiar situations. In such cases we can often use those physical objects to answer questions about the corresponding mathematical relationships. For example, we can count on our fingers because the physics of fingers naturally mimics the arithmetic of the whole numbers from zero to ten.

The repertoires of the three very different abstract computers defined by Turing, Church and Post were soon proved to be identical.  {133}  So have the repertoires of all abstract models of mathematical computation that have since been proposed. This is deemed to lend support to the Church-Turing conjecture and to the universality of the universal Turing machine. However, the computing power of _abstract_ machines has no bearing on what is computable in reality. The scope of virtual reality, and its wider implications for the comprehensibility of nature and other aspects of the fabric of reality, depends on whether the relevant computers are physically realizable. In particular, any genuine universal computer must itself be physically realizable. This leads to a stronger version of the Turing principle:

**The Turing principle**

(for physical computers simulating each other)

_It is possible to build a universal computer: a machine that can_

_be programmed to perform any computation that any other_

_physical object can perform._

It follows that if a universal image generator were controlled by a universal computer, the resulting machine would be a universal virtual-reality generator. In other words, the following principle also holds:

**The Turing principle**

(for virtual-reality generators rendering each other)

_It is possible to build a virtual-reality generator whose repertoire_

_includes that of every other physically possible virtual-reality_

_generator._

Now, any environment can be rendered by a virtual-reality gener ator of _some_ sort (for instance, one could always regard a copy ol that very environment as a virtual-reality generator with perhap a very small repertoire). So it also follows from this version of th Turing principle that any physically possible environment can b rendered by the universal virtual-reality generator. Hence to expres the very strong self-similarity that exists in the structure of reality embracing not only computations but all physical processes, tin Turing principle can be stated in this all-embracing form:  {134} 

**The Turing principle**

_It is possible to build a virtual-reality generator whose repertoire  
includes every physically possible environment._

This is the strongest form of the Turing principle. It not only tells us that various parts of reality can resemble one another. It tells us that a single physical object, buildable once and for all (apart from maintenance and a supply of additional memory when needed), can perform with unlimited accuracy the task of describing or mimicking any other part of the multiverse. The set of all behaviours and responses of that one object exactly mirrors the set of all behaviours and responses of all other physically possible objects and processes.

This is just the sort of self-similarity that is necessary if, according to the hope I expressed in Chapter 1]], the fabric of reality is to be truly unified and comprehensible. If the laws of physics as they apply to any physical object or process are to be comprehensible, they must be capable of being embodied in another physical object - the knower. It is also necessary that processes capable of creating such knowledge be physically possible. Such processes are called science. Science depends on experimental testing, which means physically rendering a law's predictions and comparing it with (a rendering of) reality. It also depends on explanation, and that requires the abstract laws themselves, not merely their predictive content, to be capable of being rendered in virtual reality. This is a tall order, but reality does meet it. That is to say, the laws of physics meet it. The laws of physics, by conforming to the Turing principle, make it physically possible for those same laws to become known to physical objects. Thus, the laws of physics may be said to mandate their own comprehensibility.

Since building a universal virtual-reality generator is physically possible, it must actually _be_ built in some universes. A caveat is necessary here. As I explained in Chapter 3]], we can normally define physically possible process as one that actually occurs somewhere in the multiverse. But strictly speaking, a universal virtual-reality generator is a limiting case that requires arbitrarily large resources  {135}  to operate. So what we really mean by saying that it is 'physically possible' is that virtual-reality generators with repertoires arbitrarily close to the set of all physically possible environments exist in the multiverse. Similarly, since the laws of physics are capable of being rendered, they _are_ rendered somewhere. Thus it follows from the Turing principle (in the strong form for which I have argued) that the laws of physics do not merely mandate their own comprehensibility in some abstract sense - comprehensibility by abstract scientists, as it were. They imply the physical existence, somewhere in the multiverse, of entities that understand them arbitrarily well. I shall discuss this implication further in later chapters.

Now I return to the question I posed in the previous chapter, namely whether, if we had only a virtual-reality rendering based on the wrong laws of physics to learn from, we should expect to learn the wrong laws. The first thing to stress is that we _do_ have only virtual reality based on the wrong laws to learn from! As I have said, all our external experiences are of virtual reality, generated by our own brains. And since our concepts and theories (whether inborn or learned) are never perfect, all our renderings are indeed inaccurate. That is to say, they give us the experience of an environment that is significantly different from the environment that we are really in. Mirages and other optical illusions are examples of this. Another is that we experience the Earth to be at rest beneath our feet, despite its rapid and complex motion in reality. Another is that we experience a single universe, and a single instance of our own conscious selves at a time, while in reality there are many. Bui these inaccurate and misleading experiences provide no argument against scientific reasoning. On the contrary, such deficiencies are its very starting-point.

We are embarked upon solving problems about physical reality. If it turns out that all this time we have merely been studying the programming of a cosmic planetarium, then that would merely mean that we have been studying a smaller portion of reality than we thought. So what? Such things have happened many times in the history of science, as our horizons have expanded beyond the Earth to include the solar system, our Galaxy, other galaxies, clusters  {136}  of galaxies and so on, and, of course, parallel universes. Another such broadening may happen tomorrow; indeed, it may happen according to any one of an infinity of possible theories - or it may never happen. Logically, we must concede to solipsism and related doctrines that the reality we are learning about _might_ be an unrepresentative portion of a larger, inaccessible or incomprehensible structure. But the general refutation that I have given of such doctrines shows us that it is irrational to build upon that possibility. Following Occam, we shall entertain such theories when, and only when, they provide better explanations than simpler rival theories.

However, there is a question we can still ask. Suppose that someone were imprisoned in a small, unrepresentative portion of our own reality - for instance, inside a universal virtual-reality generator that was programmed with the wrong laws of physics. What could such prisoners learn about our external reality? At first sight, it seems impossible that they could discover anything at all about it. It may deem that the most they could discover would be the laws of operation, i.e. the program, of the computer that operated their prison.

But that is not so! Again, we must bear in mind that if the prisoners are scientists, they will be seeking explanations as well as predictions. In other words, they will not be content with merely knowing the program that operates their prison: they will want to explain the origin and attributes of the various entities, including themselves, that they observe in the reality they inhabit. But in most virtual-reality environments no such explanation exists, for the rendered objects do not originate there but have been designed in the external reality. Suppose that you are playing a virtual-reality video game. For the sake of simplicity, suppose that the game is essentially chess (a first-person-perspective version perhaps, in which you adopt the persona of the king). You will use the normal methods of science to discover this environment's 'laws of physics' and their emergent consequences. You will learn that checkmate and stalemate are 'physically' possible events (i.e. possible under your best understanding of how the environment works), but that a position with nine white pawns is not 'physically' possible. Once  {137}  you had understood the laws sufficiently well, you would notice that the chessboard is too simple an object to have, for instance, thoughts, and consequently that your own thought-processes can not be governed by the laws of chess alone. Similarly, you could tell that during any number of games of chess the pieces can never evolve into self-reproducing configurations. And if life cannot evolve on the chessboard, far less can intelligence evolve. Therefore you would also infer that your own thought-processes could not have originated in the universe in which you found yourself. So even if you had lived within the rendered environment all your life, and did not have your own memories of the outside world to account for as well, your knowledge would not be confined to that environment. You would know that, even though the universe seemed to have a certain layout and obey certain laws, there must be a wider universe outside it, obeying different laws of physics. And you could even guess some of the ways in which these wider laws would have to differ from the chessboard laws.

Arthur C. Clarke once remarked that 'any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic'. This is true, but slightly misleading. It is stated from the point of view of a pre-scientific thinker, which is the wrong way round. The fact is that to anyone who understands what virtual reality is, even genuine magic would be indistinguishable from technology, for there is no room for magic in a comprehensible reality. Anything that seems incomprehensible is regarded by science merely as evidence that there is something we have not yet understood, be it a conjuring trick, advanced technology or a new law of physics.

Reasoning from the premise of one's own existence is called 'anthropic' reasoning. Although it has some applicability in cosmology, it usually has to be supplemented by substantive assumptions about the nature of 'oneself' before it yields definite conclusions. But anthropic reasoning is not the only way in which the inmates of our hypothetical virtual-reality prison could gain knowledge of an outside world. _Any_ of their evolving explanations of their narrow world could, at the drop of a hat, reach into an outside reality. For instance, the very rules of chess contain what  {138}  a thoughtful player may realize is 'fossil evidence' of those rules having had an evolutionary history: there are 'exceptional' moves such as castling and capturing _en passant_ which increase the complexity of the rules but improve the game. In explaining that complexity, one justifiably concludes that the rules of chess were not always as they are now.

In the Popperian scheme of things, explanations always lead to new problems which in turn require further explanations. If the prisoners fail, after a while, to improve upon their existing explanations, they may of course give up, perhaps falsely concluding that there are no explanations available. But if they do not give up they will be thinking about those aspects of their environment that seem inadequately explained. Thus if the high-technology jailers wanted to be confident that their rendered environment would forever fool their prisoners into thinking that there is no outside world, they would have their work cut out for them. The longer they wanted the illusion to last, the more ingenious the program would have to be. It is not enough that the inmates be prevented from observing the outside. The rendered environment would also have to be such that no explanations of anything inside would ever require one to postulate an outside. The environment, in other words, would have to be self-contained as regards explanations. But I doubt that any part of reality, short of the whole thing, has that property.

### TERMINOLOGY

**Cantgotu environments** Logically possible environments which cannot be rendered by any physically possible virtual-reality generator.

On the assumptions I have been making, this implies that there is no upper bound on the universality of virtual-reality generators that will actually be built somewhere in the multiverse.

### SUMMARY

The diagonal argument shows that the overwhelming majority of logically possible environments cannot be rendered in virtual reality. I have called them Cantgotu environments. There is nevertheless a comprehensive self-similarity in physical reality that is expressed in the Turing principle: _it is possible to build a virtual-reality generator whose repertoire includes every physically possible environment._ So a single, buildable physical object can mimic all the behaviours and responses of any other physically possible object or process. This is what makes reality comprehensible.

_It also makes possible the evolution of living organisms. However, before I discuss the theory of evolution, the fourth strand of explanation of the fabric of reality, I must make a brief excursion into epistemology._{294}  accurately, but not both. Thus it would appear that, in one way or the other, a virtual-reality rendering of time travel is intrinsically incapable of being accurate - which is another way of saying that time travel could not be rendered in virtual reality.

But is this effect really an impediment to the accurate rendering of time travel? Normally, mimicking an environment's actual behaviour is not the aim of virtual reality: what counts is that it should respond accurately. As soon as you begin to play tennis on the rendered Wimbledon Centre Court, you make it behave differently from the way the real one is behaving. But that does not make the rendering any less accurate. On the contrary, that is what is required for accuracy. Accuracy, in virtual reality, means the closeness of the rendered behaviour to that which the original environment _would_ exhibit if the user were present in it. Only at the beginning of the rendering does the rendered environment's state have to be faithful to the original. Thereafter it is not its state but its responses to the user's actions that have to be faithful. Why is that 'paradoxical' for renderings of time travel but not for other renderings - for instance, for renderings of ordinary travel?{117}  depends on creating a virtual-reality rendering of it. Normally one would say that scientific theories only describe and explain physical objects and processes, but do not render them. For example, an explanation of eclipses of the Sun can be printed in a book. A computer can be programmed with astronomical data and physical laws to predict an eclipse, and to print out a description of it. But rendering the eclipse in virtual reality would require both further programming and further hardware. However, those are already present in our brains! The words and numbers printed by the computer amount to 'descriptions' of an eclipse only because someone knows the meanings of those symbols. That is, the symbols evoke in the reader's mind some sort of likeness of some predicted effect of the eclipse, against which the real appearance of that effect will be tested. Moreover, the 'likeness' that is evoked is interactive. One can observe an eclipse in many ways: with the naked eye, or by photography, or using various scientific instruments; from some positions on Earth one will see a total eclipse of the Sun, from other positions a partial eclipse, and from anywhere else no eclipse at all. In each case an observer will experience different _resources/books//The Fabric of Reality - David Deutsch, any of which can be predicted by the theory. What the computer's description evokes in a reader's mind is not just a single image or sequence of _resources/books//The Fabric of Reality - David Deutsch, but a general method of creating many different _resources/books//The Fabric of Reality - David Deutsch, corresponding to the many ways in which the reader may contemplate making observations. In other words, it is a virtual-reality rendering. Thus, in a broad enough sense, taking into account the processes that must take place inside the scientist's mind, science and the virtual-reality rendering of physically possible environments are two terms denoting the same activity.

Now, what about the rendering of environments that are not physically possible? On the face of it, there are two distinct types of virtual-reality rendering: a minority that depict physically possible environments, and a majority that depict physically impossible environments. But can this distinction survive closer examination? Consider a virtual-reality generator in the act of rendering a physically impossible environment. It might be a flight simulator, running  {118}  a program that calculates the view from the cockpit of an aircraft that can fly faster than light. The flight simulator is _rendering_ that environment. But in addition the flight simulator is itself the environment that the user is experiencing, in the sense that it is a physical object surrounding the user. Let us consider this environment. Clearly it is a physically possible environment. Is it a renderable environment? Of course. In fact it is exceptionally easy to render: one simply uses a second flight simulator of the same design, running the identical program. Under those circumstances the second flight simulator can be thought of as rendering either the physically impossible aircraft, or a physically possible environment, namely the first flight simulator. Similarly, the first flight simulator could be regarded as rendering a physically possible environment, namely the second flight simulator. If we assume that any virtual-reality generator that can in principle be built, can in principle be built again, then it follows that every virtual-reality generator, running any program in its repertoire, is rendering _some_ physically possible environment. It may be rendering other things as well, including physically impossible environments, but in particular there is always some physically possible environment that it is rendering.

So, which physically impossible environments can be rendered in virtual reality? Precisely those that are not perceptibly different from physically possible environments. Therefore the connection between the physical world and the worlds that are renderable in virtual reality is far closer than it looks. We think of some virtual-reality renderings as depicting fact, and others as depicting fiction, hut the fiction is always an interpretation in the mind of the beholder. There is no such thing as a virtual-reality environment that the user would be compelled to interpret as physically impossible.

We might choose to render an environment as predicted by some 'laws of physics' that are different from the true laws of physics. We may do this as an exercise, or for fun, or as an approximation because the true rendering is too difficult or expensive. If the laws we are using are as close as we can make them to real ones, given  {119}  the constraints under which we are operating, we may call these renderings 'applied mathematics' or 'computing'. If the rendered objects are very different from physically possible ones, we may call the rendering 'pure mathematics'. If a physically impossible environment is rendered for fun, we call it a 'video game' or 'computer art'. All these are interpretations. They may be useful interpretations, or even essential in explaining our motives in composing a particular rendering. But as far as the rendering itself goes there is always an alternative interpretation, namely that it accurately depicts some physically possible environment.

It is not customary to think of mathematics as being a form of virtual reality. We usually think of mathematics as being about abstract entities, such as numbers and sets, which do not affect thr senses; and it might therefore seem that there can be no question of artificially rendering their effect on us. However, although math ematical entities do not affect the senses, the experience of doinc mathematics is an external experience, no less than the experieno of doing physics is. We make marks on pieces of paper and look at them, or we imagine looking at such marks - indeed, we cannoi do mathematics without imagining abstract mathematical entities. But this means imagining an environment whose 'physics' embodies the complex and autonomous properties of those entities. For example, when we imagine the abstract concept of a line segment which has no thickness, we may imagine a line that is visible but imperceptibly wide. That much may, just about, be arranged in physical reality. But mathematically the line must continue to have no thickness when we view it under arbitrarily powerful magnification. That is not a property of any physical line, but it can easily be achieved in the virtual reality of our imagination.

Imagination is a straightforward form of virtual reality. What may not be so obvious is that our 'direct' experience of the world through our senses is virtual reality too. For our external experience is never direct; nor do we even experience the signals in our nerves directly - we would not know what to make of the streams of electrical crackles that they carry. What we experience directly is a virtual-reality rendering, conveniently generated for us by our  {120}  unconscious minds from sensory data plus complex inborn and acquired theories (i.e. programs) about how to interpret them.

We realists take the view that reality is out there: objective, physical and independent of what we believe about it. But we never experience that reality directly. Every last scrap of our external experience is of virtual reality. And every last scrap of our knowledge - including our knowledge of the non-physical worlds of logic, mathematics and philosophy, and of imagination, fiction, art and fantasy - is encoded in the form of programs for the rendering of those worlds on our brain's own virtual-reality generator.

So it is not just science - reasoning about the physical world - that involves virtual reality. All reasoning, all thinking and all external experience are forms of virtual reality. These things are physical processes which so far have been observed in only one place in the universe, namely the vicinity of the planet Earth. We shall see in Chapter 8]] that all living processes involve virtual reality too, but human beings in particular have a special relationship with it. Biologically speaking, the virtual-reality rendering of their environment is the characteristic means by which human beings survive. In other words, it is the reason why human beings exist. The ecological niche that human beings occupy depends on virtual reality as directly and as absolutely as the ecological niche that koala bears occupy depends on eucalyptus leaves.

### SUMMARY

Virtual reality is not just a technology in which computers simulate the behaviour of physical environments. The fact that virtual reality is possible is an important fact about the fabric of reality. It is the basis not only of computation, but of human imagination and external experience, science and mathematics, art and fiction.

_What are the ultimate limits - the full scope - of virtual reality (and hence of computation, science, imagination and the rest)? In the next chapter we shall see that in one respect the scope of virtual reality is unlimited, while in another it is drastically circumscribed._|   |   |   |

virtual-reality one. But if a real past-directed time machine existed it would, like this one, not be an exotic sort of vehicle but an exotic sort of _place._ Rather than drive or fly it to the past, one would take a certain path through it (perhaps using an ordinary space vehicle) and emerge at an earlier time.

On the wall of the simulated laboratory there is a clock, initially showing noon, and by the cylinder's entrance there are some instructions. By the time I have finished reading them it is five minutes past noon, both according to my own perception and according to the clock. The instructions say that if I enter the cylinder, go round once with the revolving door, and emerge, it will be five minutes earlier in the laboratory. I step into one of the compartments of the revolving door. As I walk round, my compartment closes behind me and then, moments later, reaches the entrance again. I step out. The laboratory looks much the same except - what? What exactly should I expect to experience next, if this is to be an accurate rendering of past-directed time travel?

Let me backtrack a little first. Suppose that by the entrance there is a switch whose two positions are labelled 'interaction _on_' and 'interaction _off_'. Initially it is at 'interaction _off_'. This setting does not allow the user to participate in the past, but only to observe it. In other words, it does not provide a full virtual-reality rendering of the past environment, but only image generation.

With this simpler setting at least, there is no ambiguity or paradox about what _resources/books//The Fabric of Reality - David Deutsch ought to be generated when I emerge from the revolving door. They are _resources/books//The Fabric of Reality - David Deutsch of me, in the laboratory, doing  {296}  what I did at noon. One reason why there is no ambiguity is that I can remember those events, so I can test the _resources/books//The Fabric of Reality - David Deutsch of the past against my own recollection of what happened. By restricting our analysis to a small, closed environment over a short period, we have avoided the problem analogous to that of finding out what Julius Caesar was really like, which is a problem about the ultimate limits of archaeology rather than about the inherent problems of time travel. In our case, the virtual-reality generator can easily obtain the information it needs to generate the required _resources/books//The Fabric of Reality - David Deutsch, by making a recording of everything I do. Not, that is, a recording of what I do in physical reality (which is simply to lie still inside the virtual-reality generator), but of what I do in the virtual environment of the laboratory. Thus, the moment I emerge from the time machine, the virtual-reality generator ceases to render the laboratory at five minutes past noon, and starts to play back its recording, starting with _resources/books//The Fabric of Reality - David Deutsch of what happened at noon. It displays this recording to me with the perspective adjusted for my present position and where I am looking, and it continuously readjusts the perspective in the usual way as I move. Thus, I see the clock showing noon again. I also see my earlier self, standing in front of the time machine, reading the sign above the entrance and studying the instructions, exactly as I did five minutes ago. I see him, but he cannot see me. No matter what I do, he - or rather _it_, the moving image of me - does not react to my presence in any way. After a while, it walks towards the time machine.

If I happen to be blocking the entrance, my image will nevertheless make straight for it and walk in, exactly as I did, for if it did anything else it would be an inaccurate image. There are many ways in which an image generator can be programmed to handle a situation where an image of a solid object has to pass through the user's location. For instance, the image could pass straight through like a ghost, or it could push the user irresistibly away. The latter option gives a more accurate rendering because then the _resources/books//The Fabric of Reality - David Deutsch are to some extent tactile as well as visual. There need be no danger of my getting hurt as my image knocks me aside, however abruptly, because of course I am not physically there. If there is not enough room for me to get out of the way, the virtual-reality  {297}  generator could make me flow effortlessly through a narrow gap, or even teleport me past an obstacle.

It is not only the image of myself on which I can have no further effect. Because we have temporarily switched from virtual reality to image generation, I can no longer affect anything in the simulated environment. If there is a glass of water on a table I can no longer pick it up and drink it, as I could have before I passed through the revolving door to the simulated past. By requesting a simulation of non-interactive, past-directed time travel, which is effectively a playback of specific events five minutes ago, I necessarily relinquish control over my environment. I cede control, as it were, to my former self.

As my image enters the revolving door, the time according to the clock has once again reached five minutes past twelve, though it is ten minutes into the simulation according to my subjective perception. What happens next depends on what I do. If I just stay in the laboratory, the virtual-reality generator's next task must be to place me at events that occur after five minutes past twelve, laboratory time. It does not yet have any recordings of such events, nor do I have any memories of them. Relative to me, relative to the simulated laboratory and relative to physical reality, those events have not yet happened, so the virtual-reality generator can resume its fully interactive rendering. The net effect is of my having spent five minutes in the past without being able to affect it, and then returning to the 'present' that I had left, that is, to the normal sequence of events which I can affect.

Alternatively, I can follow my image into the time machine, travel round the time machine with my image and emerge again into the laboratory's past. What happens then? Again, the clock says twelve noon. Now I can see _two_ _resources/books//The Fabric of Reality - David Deutsch of my former self. One of them is seeing the time machine for the first time, and notices neither me nor the other image. The second image appears to see the first but not me. I can see both of them. Only the first image appears to affect anything in the laboratory. This time, from the virtual-reality generator's point of view, nothing special has happened at the moment of time travel. It is still at the 'interaction  {298}  _off_' setting, and is simply continuing to play back _resources/books//The Fabric of Reality - David Deutsch of events five minutes earlier (from my subjective point of view), and these have now reached the moment when I began to see an image of myself.

After another five minutes have passed I can again choose whether to re-enter the time machine, this time in the company of _two_ _resources/books//The Fabric of Reality - David Deutsch of myself (Figure 12.2). If I repeat the process, then after every five subjective minutes an additional image of me will appear. Each image will appear to see all the ones that appeared earlier than itself (in my experience), but none of those that appeared later than itself.

If I continue the experience for as long as possible, the maximum number of copies of me that can co-exist will be limited only by the image generator's collision avoidance strategy. Let us assume that it tries to make it realistically difficult for me to squeeze myself into the revolving door with all my _resources/books//The Fabric of Reality - David Deutsch. Then eventually I shall be forced to do something other than travel back to the past with them. I could wait a little, and take the compartment after theirs, in which case I should reach the laboratory a moment after they do. But that just postpones the problem of overcrowding in the time machine. If I keep going round this loop, eventually all the 'slots' for time travelling into the period of five minutes after noon will be filled, forcing me to let myself reach a later time from which there will be no further means of returning to that period. This too is a property that time machines would have if they existed physically. Not only are they places, they are places

with a finite capacity for supporting through traffic into the past.

Another consequence of the fact that time machines are not vehicles, but places or paths, is that one is not completely free to choose which time to use them to travel to. As this example shows, one can use a time machine only to travel to times and places at which it has existed. In particular, one cannot use it to travel back to a time before its construction was completed.

The virtual-reality generator now has recordings of many different versions of what happened in that laboratory between noon and five minutes past. Which one depicts the real history? We ought not be too concerned if there is no answer to this question, for it asks what is real in a situation where we have artificially suppressed interactivity, making Dr Johnson's test inapplicable. One could argue that only the last version, the one depicting the most copies of me, is the real one, because the previous versions all in effect show history from the point of view of people who, by the artificial rule of non-interaction, were prevented from fully seeing what was happening. Alternatively, one could argue that the first version of events, the one with a single copy of me, is the only real one because it is the only one I experienced interactively. The whole point of non-interactivity is that we are temporarily preventing ourselves from changing the past, and since subsequent versions all differ from the first one, they do not depict the past. All they depict is someone _viewing_ the past by courtesy of a universal image generator.

One could also argue that all the versions are equally real. After all, when it is all over I remember having experienced not just one history of the laboratory during that five-minute period, but several such histories. I experienced them successively, but from the laboratory's point of view they all happened during the same five-minute period. The full record of my experience requires many snapshots of the laboratory for each clock-defined instant, instead of the usual single snapshot per instant. In other words, this was a rendering of parallel universes. It turns out that this last interpretation is the closest to the truth, as we can see by trying the same experiment again, this time with interaction switched on.

The first thing I want to say about the interactive mode, in which  {300}  I am free to affect the environment, is that _one_ of the things I can choose to make happen is the exact sequence of events I have just described for the non-interactive mode. That is, I can go back and encounter one or more copies of myself, yet nevertheless (if I am a good enough actor) behave exactly as though I could not see some of them. Nevertheless, I must watch them carefully. If I want to recreate the sequence of events that occurred when I did this experiment with interaction switched off, I must remember what the copies of me do so that I can do it myself on subsequent visits to this time.

At the beginning of the session, when I first see the time machine, I immediately see it disgorging one or more copies of me. Why? Because with interaction switched on, when I come to use the time machine at five minutes past noon I shall have the right to affect the past to which I return, and that past is what is happening now, at noon. Thus my future self or selves are arriving to exercise their right to affect the laboratory at noon, and to affect me, and in particular to be seen by me.

The copies of me go about their business. Consider the computational task that the virtual-reality generator has to execute, in rendering these copies. There is now a new element that makes this overwhelmingly more difficult than it was in the non-interactive mode. How is the virtual-reality generator to find out what the copies of me are going to do? It does not yet have any recordings of that information, for in physical time the session has only just begun. Yet it must immediately present me with renderings of my future self.

So long as I am resolved to pretend that I cannot see these renderings, and then to mimic whatever I see them do, they are not going to be subjected to too stringent a test of accuracy. The virtual-reality generator need only make them do _something_ - anything that I might do; or more precisely any behaviour that I am capable of mimicking. Given the technology that we are assuming the virtual-reality generator to be based on, that would presumably not be exceeding its capabilities. It has an accurate mathematical model of my body, and a degree of direct access to my brain. It  {301}  can use these to calculate some behaviour which I could mimic, and then have its initial renderings of me carry out that behaviour.

So I begin the experience by seeing some copies of me emerge from the revolving door and do something. I pretend not to notice them, and after five minutes I go round the revolving door myself and mimic what I earlier saw the first copy doing. Five minutes later I go round again and mimic the second copy, and so on. Meanwhile, I notice that one of the copies always repeats what I had been doing during the first five minutes. At the end of the time-travelling sequence, the virtual-reality generator will again have several records of what happened during the five minutes after noon, but this time all those records will be identical. In other words, only one history happened, namely that I met my future self but pretended not to notice. Later I became that future self, travelled back in time to meet my past self, and was apparently not noticed. That is all very tidy and non-paradoxical - and unrealistic. It was achieved by the virtual-reality generator and me engaging in an intricate, mutually referential game: I was mimicking it while it was mimicking me. But with normal interactions switched on, I can choose not to play that game.

If I really had access to virtual-reality time travel, I should certainly want to test the authenticity of the rendering. In the case we are discussing, the testing would begin as soon as I saw the copies of me. Far from ignoring them, I would immediately engage them in conversation. I am far better equipped to test their authenticity than Dr Johnson would be to test Julius Caesar's. To pass even this initial test, the rendered versions of me would effectively have to be artificial intelligent beings - moreover, beings so similar to me, at least in their responses to external stimuli, that they can convince me they are accurate renderings of how I might be five minutes from now. The virtual-reality generator must be running programs similar in content and complexity to my mind. Once again, the difficulty of writing such programs is not the issue here: we are investigating the principle of virtual-reality time travel, not its practicality. It does not matter where our hypothetical virtual-reality generator gets its programs, for we are asking whether the  {302}  _set of all possible programs_ does or does not include one that accurately renders time travel. But our virtual-reality generator does in principle have the means of discovering all the possible ways I might behave in various situations. This information is located in the physical state of my brain, and sufficiently precise measurements could in principle read it out. One (probably unacceptable) method of doing this would be for the virtual-reality generator to cause my brain to interact, in virtual reality, with a test environment, record its behaviour and then restore its original state, perhaps by running it backwards. The reason why this is probably unacceptable is that I would presumably _experience_ that test environment, and though I should not recall it afterwards, I want the virtual-reality generator to give me the experiences I specify and no others.

In any case, what matters for present purposes is that, since my brain is a physical object, the Turing principle says that it is within the repertoire of a universal virtual-reality generator. So it is possible in principle for the copy of me to pass the test of whether he accurately resembles me. But that is not the only test I want to perform. Mainly, I want to test whether the time travel itself is being rendered authentically. To that end I want to find out not just whether this person is authentically me, but whether he is authentically from the future. In part I can test this by questioning him. He should say that he remembers being in my position five minutes ago, and that he then travelled around the revolving door and met me. I should also find that _he_ is testing _my_ authenticity. Why would he do that? Because the most stringent and straightforward way in which I could test his resemblance to the future me would be to wait until I have passed through the time machine, and then look for two things: first, whether the copy of me whom I find there behaves as I remember myself behaving; and second, whether I behave as I remember the _copy_ behaving.

In both these respects the rendering will certainly fail the test! At my very first and slightest attempt to behave differently from the way I remember my copy behaving, I shall succeed. And it will be almost as easy to make him behave differently from the way in  {303}  which I behaved: all I have to do is ask him a question which I, in his place, had not been asked, and which has a distinctive answer. So however much they resemble me in appearance and personality, the people who emerge from the virtual-reality time machine are not authentic renderings of the person I am shortly to become. Nor should they be - after all, I have the firm intention not to behave as they do when it is my turn to use the time machine and, since the virtual-reality generator is now allowing me to interact freely with the rendered environment, there is nothing to prevent me from carrying out that intention.

Let me recap. As the experiment begins I meet a person who is recognizably me, apart from slight variations. Those variations consistently point to his being from the future: he remembers the laboratory at five minutes past noon, a time which, from my perspective, has not happened yet. He remembers setting out at that time, passing through the revolving door and arriving at noon. He remembers, before all that, beginning this experiment at noon and seeing the revolving door for the first time, and seeing copies of himself emerging. He says that this happened over five minutes ago, according to his subjective perception, though according to mine the whole experiment has not yet lasted five minutes. And so on. Yet though he passes all tests for being a version of me from the future, it is demonstrably not _my_ future. When I test whether he is the specific person I am going to become, he fails that test. Similarly, he tells me that I fail the test for being his past self, since I am not doing exactly what he remembers himself doing.

So when I travel to the laboratory's past, I find that it is not the same past as I have just come from. Because of his interaction with me, the copy of me whom I find there does not behave quite as I remember behaving. Therefore, if the virtual-reality generator were to record the totality of what happens during this time-travel sequence, it would again have to store several snapshots for each instant as defined by the laboratory clock, and this time they would all be different. In other words, there would be several distinct, parallel histories of the laboratory during the five-minute time-travelling period. Again, I have experienced each of these histories  {304}  in turn. But this time I have experienced them all interactively, so there is no excuse for saying that any of them are less real than the others. So what is being rendered here is a little multiverse. If this were physical time travel, the multiple snapshots at each instant would be parallel universes. Given the quantum concept of time, we should not be surprised at this. We know that the snapshots which stack themselves approximately into a single time sequence in our everyday experience are in fact parallel universes. We do not normally experience the other parallel universes that exist at the _same_ time, but we have reason to believe that they are there. So, if we find some method, as yet unspecified, of travelling to an earlier time, why should we expect that method necessarily to take each copy of us to the particular snapshot which that copy had already experienced? Why should we expect every visitor we receive from the future to hail from the particular future snapshots in which we shall eventually find ourselves? We really should not expect this. Asking to be allowed to interact with the past environment means asking to change it, which means by definition asking to be in a different snapshot of it from the one we remember. A time traveller would return to the same snapshot (or, what is perhaps the same thing, to an identical snapshot) only in the extremely contrived case I discussed above, where no effective interaction takes place between the copies who meet, and the time traveller manages to make all the parallel histories identical.

Now let me subject the virtual-reality time machine to the ultimate test. Let me deliberately set out to enact a paradox. I form the firm intention that I stated above: I resolve that if a copy of me emerges at noon from the time machine, then I _shall not_ enter it at five minutes past noon, or indeed at any time during the experiment. But if no one emerges, then at five minutes past noon I _shall_ enter the time machine, emerge at noon, and then not use the time machine again. What happens? Will someone emerge from the time machine or not? Yes. And no! It depends which universe we are talking about. Remember that more than one thing happens in that laboratory at noon. Suppose that I see no one emerging from the time machine, as illustrated at the point marked 'Start'  {305}  at the right of Figure 12.3. Then, acting on my firm intention, I wait until five minutes past noon and then walk round that now-familiar revolving door. Emerging at noon, I find, of course, another version of myself, standing at the point marked 'Start' on the _left_ of Figure 12.3. As we converse, we find that he and I had formed the same intention. Therefore, because I have emerged into his universe, he will behave differently from the way I behaved. Acting on the same intention as mine leads him _not_ to use the time machine. From then on, he and I can continue to interact for as long as the simulation lasts, and there will be two versions of me in that universe. In the universe I came from, the laboratory remains empty after five minutes past twelve, for I never return to it. We have encountered no paradox. Both versions of me have succeeded in enacting our shared intention - which was therefore not, after all, logically incapable of being carried out.

I and my alter ego in this experiment have had different experiences. He saw someone emerging from the time machine at noon, and I did not. Our experiences would have been equally faithful to our intention, and equally non-paradoxical, had our roles been reversed. That is, I could have seen him emerging from the time machine at noon, and then not used it myself. In that case both of us would have ended up in the universe I started in. In the universe he started in, the laboratory would remain empty.

Which of these two self-consistent possibilities will the virtual-reality  {306}

generator show me? During this rendering of an intrinsically multiversal process, I play only one of the two copies of me; the program renders the other copy. At the beginning of the experiment the two copies look identical (though in physical reality they are different because only one of them is connected to a physical brain and body outside the virtual environment). But in the physical version of the experiment - if a time machine existed physically - the two universes containing the copies of me who were going to meet would initially be strictly identical, and both copies would be equally real. At the multiverse-moment when we met (in one universe) or did not meet (in the other), those two copies would become different. It is not meaningful to ask _which_ copy of me would have which experience: so long as we are identical, there is no such thing as 'which' of us. Parallel universes do not have hidden serial numbers: they are distinguished only by what happens in them. Therefore in rendering all this for the benefit of one copy of me, the virtual-reality generator must recreate for me the effect of existing as two identical copies who then become different and have different experiences. It can cause that literally to happen by choosing at random, with equal probabilities, which of the two roles it will play (and therefore, given my intention, which role I shall play). For choosing randomly means in effect tossing some electronic version of a fair coin, and a fair coin is one that shows 'heads' in half the universes in which it is tossed and 'tails' in the other half. So in half the universes I shall play one role, and in the other half, the other. That is exactly what would happen with a real time machine.

We have seen that a virtual-reality generator's ability to render time travel accurately depends on its having detailed information about the user's state of mind. This may make one briefly wonder whether the paradoxes have been genuinely avoided. If the virtual-reality generator knows what I am going to do in advance, am I really free to perform whatever tests I choose? We need not get into any deep questions about the nature of free will here. I am indeed free to do whatever I like in this experiment, in the sense that for every possible way I may choose to react to the simulated  {307}  past - including randomly, if I want to - the virtual-reality generator allows me to react in that way. And all the environments I interact with are affected by what I do, and react back on me in precisely the way they would if time travel were not taking place. The reason why the virtual-reality generator needs information from my brain is not to predict _my_ actions, but to render the behaviour of my counterparts from other universes. Its problem is that in the real version of this situation there would be parallel-universe counterparts of me, initially identical and therefore possessing the same propensities as me and making the same decisions. (Farther away in the multiverse there would also be others who were already different from me at the outset of the experiment, but a time machine would never cause me to meet those versions.) If there were some other way of rendering these people, the virtual-reality generator would not need any information from my brain, nor would it need the prodigious computational resources that we have been envisaging. For example, if some people who know me well were able to mimic me to some degree of accuracy (apart from external attributes such as appearance and tone of voice, which are relatively trivial to render) then the virtual-reality generator could use those people to act out the roles of my parallel-universe counterparts, and could thereby render time travel to that same degree of accuracy.{308}  our own, really amount to time travel? Is it just _inter-universe_ travel that makes sense, rather than time travel? No. The processes I have been describing really are time travel. First of all, it is not the case that we _cannot_ travel to a snapshot where we have already been. If we arrange things correctly, we can. Of course if we change anything in the past - if we make it different from how it was in the past we came from - then we find ourselves in a different past. Fully fledged time travel would allow us to change the past. In other words, it allows us to make the past different from the way we remember it (in this universe). That means different from the way it actually is, in the snapshots in which we did not arrive to change anything. And those include, by definition, the snapshots we remember being in.

So wanting to change the specific past snapshots in which we once were does indeed not make sense. But that has nothing to do with time travel. It is a nonsense that stems directly from the nonsensical classical theory of the flow of time. Changing the past means choosing which past snapshot to be in, not changing any specific past snapshot into another one. In this respect, changing the past is no different from changing the future, which we do all the time. Whenever we make a choice, we change the future: we change it from what it would have been had we chosen differently. Such an idea would make no sense in classical, spacetime physics with its single future determined by the present. But it does make sense in quantum physics. When we make a choice, we change the future from what it will be in universes in which we choose differently. But in no case does any particular snapshot in the future change. It cannot change, for there is no flow of time with respect to which it could change. 'Changing' the future means choosing which snapshot we will be in; 'changing' the past means exactly the same thing. Because there is no flow of time, there is no such thing as changing a particular past snapshot, such as one we remember being in. Nevertheless, if we somehow gain physical access to the past, there is no reason why we could not change it in precisely the sense in which we change the future, namely by choosing to  {309}  be in a different snapshot from the one we would have been in if we had chosen differently.

Arguments from virtual reality help in understanding time travel because the concept of virtual reality requires one to take 'counter-factual events' seriously, and therefore the multi-universe quantum concept of time seems natural when it is rendered in virtual reality. By seeing that past-directed time travel is within the repertoire of a universal virtual-reality generator, we learn that the idea of past-directed time travel makes perfect sense. But that is not to say that it is necessarily physically achievable. After all, faster-than-light travel, perpetual motion machines and many other physical impossibilities are all possible in virtual reality. No amount of reasoning about virtual reality can prove that a given process is permitted by the laws of physics (though it can prove that it is not: if we had reached the contrary conclusion, it would have implied, via the Turing principle, that time travel cannot occur physically). So what do our positive conclusions about virtual-reality time travel tell us about physics?

They tell us what time travel would look like if it did occur. They tell us that past-directed time travel would inevitably be a process set in several interacting and interconnected universes. In that process, the participants would in general travel from one universe to another whenever they travelled in time. The precise ways in which the universes were connected would depend, among other things, on the participants' states of mind.

So, for time travel to be physically possible it is necessary for there to be a multiverse. And it is necessary that the physical laws governing the multiverse be such that, in the presence of a time machine and potential time travellers, the universes become interconnected in the way I have described, and not in any other way. For example, if I am not going to use a time machine come what may, then no time-travelling versions of me must appear in my snapshot; that is, no universes in which versions of me do use a time machine can become connected to my universe. If I am definitely going to use the time machine, then my universe must become connected to another universe in which I also definitely use it. And  {310}  if I am going to try to enact a 'paradox' then, as we have seen, my universe must become connected with another one in which a copy of me has the same intention as I do, but by carrying out that intention ends up behaving differently from me. Remarkably, all this is precisely what quantum theory does predict. In short, the result is that if pathways into the past do exist, travellers on them are free to interact with their environment in just the same way as they could if the pathways did not lead into the past. In no case does time travel become inconsistent, or impose special constraints on time travellers' behaviour.

That leaves us with the question whether it is physically possible for pathways into the past to exist. This question has been the subject of much research, and is still highly controversial. The usual starting-point is a set of equations which form the (predictive) basis of Einstein's general theory of relativity, currently our best theory of space and time. These equations, known as _Einstein's equations_, have many solutions, each describing a possible four-dimensional configuration of space, time and gravity. Einstein's equations certainly permit the existence of pathways into the past; many solutions with that property have been discovered. Until recently, the accepted practice has been systematically to ignore such solutions. But this has not been for any reason arising from within the theory, nor from any argument within physics at all. It has been because physicists were under the impression that time travel would 'lead to paradoxes', and that such solutions of Einstein's equations must therefore be 'unphysical'. This arbitrary second-guessing is reminiscent of what happened in the early years of general relativity, when the solutions describing the Big Bang and an expanding universe were rejected by Einstein himself. He tried to change the equations so that they would describe a static universe instead. Later he referred to this as the biggest mistake of his life, and the expansion was verified experimentally by the American astronomer Edwin Hubble. For many years also, the solutions obtained by the German astronomer Karl Schwarzschild, which were the first to describe black holes, were mistakenly rejected as 'unphysical'. They described counter-intuitive phenomena, such as a region from  {311}  which it is in principle impossible to escape, and gravitational forces becoming infinite at the black hole's centre. The prevailing view nowadays is that black holes do exist, and do have the properties predicted by Einstein's equations.

Taken literally, Einstein's equations predict that travel into the past would be possible in the vicinity of massive, spinning objects, such as black holes, if they spun fast enough, and in certain other situations. But many physicists doubt that these predictions are realistic. No sufficiently rapidly spinning black holes are known, and it has been argued (inconclusively) that it may be impossible to spin one up artificially, because any rapidly spinning material that one fired in might be thrown off and be unable to enter the black hole. The sceptics may be right, but in so far as their reluctance to accept the possibility of time travel is rooted in a belief that it leads to paradoxes, it is unjustified.

Even when Einstein's equations have been more fully understood, they will not provide conclusive answers on the subject of time travel. The general theory of relativity predates quantum theory and is not wholly compatible with it. No one has yet succeeded in formulating a satisfactory quantum version - a quantum theory of gravity. Yet, from the arguments I have given, quantum effects would be dominant in time-travelling situations. Typical candidate versions of a quantum theory of gravity not only allow past-directed connections to exist in the multiverse, they predict that such connections are continually forming and breaking spontaneously. This is happening throughout space and time, but only on a sub-microscopic scale. The typical pathway formed by these effects is about 10�35 metres across, remains open for one Planck time (about 10�43 seconds), and therefore reaches only about one Planck time into the past.

Future-directed time travel, which essentially requires only efficient rockets, is on the moderately distant but confidently foreseeable technological horizon. Past-directed time travel, which requires the manipulation of black holes, or some similarly violent gravitational disruption of the fabric of space and time, will be practicable only in the remote future, if at all. At present we know  {312}  of nothing in the laws of physics that rules out past-directed time travel; on the contrary, they make it plausible that time travel is possible. Future discoveries in fundamental physics may change this. It may be discovered that quantum fluctuations in space and time become overwhelmingly strong near time machines, and effectively seal off their entrances (Stephen Hawking, for one, has argued that some calculations of his make this likely, but his argument is inconclusive). Or some hitherto unknown phenomenon may rule out past-directed time travel - or provide a new and easier method of achieving it. One cannot predict the future growth of knowledge. But if the future development of fundamental physics continues to allow time travel in principle, then its practical attainment will surely become a mere technological problem that will eventually be solved.

Because no time machine provides pathways to times earlier than the moment at which it came into existence, and because of the way in which quantum theory says that universes are interconnected, there are some limits to what we can expect to learn by using time machines. Once we have built one, but not before, we may expect visitors, or at least messages, from the future to emerge from it. What will they tell us? One thing they will certainly not tell us is news of our own future. The deterministic nightmare of the prophecy of an inescapable future doom, brought about in spite of - or perhaps as the very consequence of - our attempts to avoid it, is the stuff of myth and science fiction only. Visitors from the future cannot know our future any more than we can, for they did not come from there. But they can tell us about the future of their universe, whose past was identical to ours. They can bring taped news and current affairs programmes, and newspapers with dates starting from tomorrow and onwards. If their society made some mistaken decision, which led to disaster, they can warn us of it. We may or may not follow their advice. If we follow it, we may avoid the disaster, or - there can be no guarantees - we may find that the result is even worse than what happened to them.

On average, though, we should presumably benefit greatly from studying their future history. Although it is not our future history,  {313}  and although knowing of a possible impending disaster is not the same thing as knowing what to do about it, we should presumably learn much from such a detailed record of what, from our point of view, _might_ happen.

Our visitors might bring details of great scientific and artistic achievements. If these were made in the near future of the other universe, it is likely that counterparts of the people who made them would exist in our universe, and might already be working towards those achievements. All at once, they would be presented with completed versions of their work. Would they be grateful? There is another apparent time-travel paradox here. Since it does not appear to create inconsistencies, but merely curiosities, it has been discussed more in fiction than in scientific arguments against time travel (though some philosophers, such as Michael Dummett, have taken it seriously). I call it the _knowledge paradox_ of time travel; here is how the story typically goes. A future historian with an interest in Shakespeare uses a time machine to visit the great playwright at a time when he is writing _Hamlet._ They have a conversation, in the course of which the time traveller shows Shakespeare the text of Hamlet's 'To be or not to be' soliloquy, which he has brought with him from the future. Shakespeare likes it and incorporates it into the play. In another version, Shakespeare dies and the time traveller assumes his identity, achieving success by pretending to write plays which he is secretly copying from the _Complete Works of Shakespeare_, which he brought with him from the future. In yet another version, the time traveller is puzzled by not being able to locate Shakespeare at all. Through some chain of accidents, he finds himself impersonating Shakespeare and, again, plagiarizing his plays. He likes the life, and years later he realizes that he has become _the_ Shakespeare: there never had been another one.

Incidentally, the time machine in these stories would have to be provided by some extraterrestrial civilization which had already achieved time travel by Shakespeare's day, and which was willing to allow our historian to use one of their scarce, non-renewable slots for travelling back to that time. Or perhaps (even less likely,  {314}  I guess) there might be a usable, naturally occurring time machine in the vicinity of some black hole.

All these stories relate a perfectly consistent chain - or rather, circle - of events. The reason why they are puzzling, and deserve to be called paradoxes, lies elsewhere. It is that in each story great literature comes into existence without anyone having written it: no one originally wrote it, no one has created it. And that proposition, though logically consistent, profoundly contradicts our understanding of where knowledge comes from. According to the epistemological principles I set out in Chapter 3]], knowledge does not come into existence fully formed. It exists only as the result of creative processes, which are step-by-step, evolutionary processes, always starting with a problem and proceeding with tentative new theories, criticism and the elimination of errors to a new and preferable problem-situation. This is how Shakespeare wrote his plays. It is how Einstein discovered his field equations. It is how all of us succeed in solving any problem, large or small, in our lives, or in creating anything of value.{315}  traditional sense is invoked. Nevertheless, the origin of species in this story is distinctly supernatural: the story gives no explanation - and _rules out the possibility of there being an explanation_ - of how the specific and complex adaptations of the species to their niches got there.

In this way, knowledge-paradox situations violate epistemological or, if you like, evolutionary principles. They are paradoxical only because they involve the creation, out of nothing, of complex human knowledge or of complex biological adaptations. Analogous stories with other sorts of object or information on the loop are not paradoxical. Observe a pebble on a beach; then travel back to yesterday, locate the pebble elsewhere and move it to where you are going to find it. Why did you find it at that particular location? Because you moved it there. Why did you move it there? Because you found it there. You have caused some information (the position of the pebble) to come into existence on a self-consistent loop. But so what? The pebble had to be somewhere. Provided the story does not involve getting something for nothing, by way of knowledge or adaptation, it is no paradox.

In the multiverse view, the time traveller who visits Shakespeare has not come from the future of that copy of Shakespeare. He can affect, or perhaps replace, the copy he visits. But he can never visit the copy who existed in the universe he started from. And it is _that_ copy who wrote the plays. So the plays had a genuine author, and there are no paradoxical loops of the kind envisaged in the story. Knowledge and adaptation are, even in the presence of pathways to the past, brought into existence only incrementally, by acts of human creativity or biological evolution, and in no other way.

I wish I could report that this requirement is also rigorously implemented by the laws that quantum theory imposes on the multiverse. I expect it is, but this is hard to prove because it is hard to express the desired property in the current language of theoretical physics. What mathematical formula distinguishes 'knowledge' or 'adaptation' from worthless information? What physical attributes distinguish a 'creative' process from a non-creative one? Although we cannot yet answer these questions, I do  {316}  not think that the situation is hopeless. Remember the conclusions of Chapter 8]], about the significance of life, and of knowledge, in the multiverse. I pointed out there (for reasons quite unconnected with time travel) that knowledge creation and biological evolution are physically significant processes. And one of the reasons was that those processes, and only those, have a particular effect on parallel universes - namely to create trans-universe structure by making them become alike. When, one day, we understand the details of this effect, we may be able to define knowledge, adaptation, creativity and evolution in terms of the convergence of universes.

When I 'enact a paradox', there are eventually two copies of me in one universe and none in the other. It is a general rule that after time travel has taken place the total number of copies of me, counted across all universes, is unchanged. Similarly, the usual conservation laws for mass, energy and other physical quantities continue to hold for the multiverse as a whole, though not necessarily in any one universe. However, there is no conservation law for knowledge. Possession of a time machine would allow us access to knowledge from an entirely new source, namely the creativity of minds in other universes. They could also receive knowledge from us, so one can loosely speak of a 'trade' in knowledge - and indeed a trade in artefacts embodying knowledge - across many universes. But one cannot take that analogy too literally. The multiverse will never be a free-trade area because the laws of quantum mechanics impose drastic restrictions on which snapshots can be connected to which others. For one thing, two universes first become connected only at a moment when they are identical: becoming connected makes them begin to diverge. It is only when those differences have accumulated, and new knowledge has been created in one universe and sent back in time to the other, that we could receive knowledge that does not already exist in our universe.

A more accurate way of thinking about the inter-universe 'trade' in knowledge is to think of all our knowledge-generating processes, our whole culture and civilization, and all the thought processes in the minds of every individual, and indeed the entire evolving  {317}  biosphere as well, as being a gigantic _computation._ The whole thing is executing a self-motivated, self-generating computer program. More specifically it is, as I have mentioned, a virtual-reality program in the process of rendering, with ever-increasing accuracy, the whole of existence. In other universes there are other versions of this virtual-reality generator, some identical, some very different. If such a virtual-reality generator had access to a time machine, it would be able to receive some of the results of computations performed by its counterparts in other universes, in so far as the laws of physics allowed the requisite interchange of information. Each piece of knowledge that one obtains from a time machine will have had an author somewhere in the multiverse, but it may benefit untold numbers of different universes. So a time machine is a computational resource that allows certain types of computation to be performed with enormously greater efficiency than they could be on any individual computer. It achieves this efficiency by effectively sharing computational work among copies of itself in different universes.

In the absence of time machines, there tends to be very little interchange of information between universes because the laws of physics predict, in that case, very little causal contact between them. To a good degree of approximation, knowledge created in one set of identical snapshots reaches relatively few other snapshots, namely those that are stacked into spacetimes to the future of the original snapshots. But this is only an approximation. Interference phenomena are the result of causal contact between nearby universes. We have seen in Chapter 9]] that even this minuscule level of contact can be used to exchange significant, computationally useful information between universes.{318}  world-view I am presenting in this book. All the connections that it could set up between past and future are comprehensible and non-paradoxical. And all the connections that it would necessitate, between apparently unconnected fields of knowledge, are there anyway.

### TERMINOLOGY

**time travel** It is only past-directed time travel that really deserves the name.

**past-directed** In past-directed time travel the traveller experiences the same instant, as defined by external clocks and calendars, more than once in subjective succession.

**future-directed** In future-directed time travel the traveller reaches a later instant in a shorter subjective time than that defined by external clocks and calendars.

**time machine** A physical object that enables the user to travel into the past. It is better thought of as a place, or pathway, than as a vehicle.

**paradox of time travel** An apparently impossible situation that a time traveller could bring about if time travel were possible.

**grandfather paradox** A paradox in which one travels into the past and then prevents oneself from ever doing so.

**knowledge paradox** A paradox in which knowledge is created from nothing, through time travel.

### SUMMARY

Time travel may or may not be achieved one day, but it is not paradoxical. If one travels into the past one retains one's normal freedom of action, but in general ends up in the past of a different universe. The study of time travel is an area of theoretical study in which all four of my main strands are significant: quantum mechanics, with its parallel universes and the quantum concept of  {319}  time; the theory of computation, because of the connections between virtual reality and time travel, and because the distinctive features of time travel can be analysed as new modes of computation; and epistemology and the theory of evolution, because of the constraints they impose on how knowledge can come into existence.

_Not only are the four strands related as part of the fabric of reality, there are also remarkable parallels between the four fields of knowledge as such. All four basic theories have the unusual status of being simultaneously accepted and rejected, relied upon and disbelieved, by most people working in those fields._{348}  both space and time, the memory capacity, the number of possible computational steps and the effective energy supply are all unlimited. This apparent impossibility can happen because of the extreme violence of the final moments of the universe's Big Crunch collapse. Spacetime singularities, like the Big Bang and the Big Crunch, are seldom tranquil places, but this one is far worse than most. The shape of the universe would change from a 3-sphere to the three-dimensional analogue of the surface of an ellipsoid. The degree of deformation would increase, and then decrease, and then increase again more rapidly with respect to a different axis. Both the amplitude and frequency of these oscillations would increase without limit as the final singularity was approached, so that a literally infinite number of oscillations would occur even though the end would come within a finite time. Matter as we know it would not survive: all matter, and even the atoms themselves, would be wrenched apart by the gravitational shearing forces generated by the deformed spacetime. However, these shearing forces would also provide an unlimited source of available energy, which could in principle be used to power a computer. How could a computer exist under such conditions? The only 'stuff' left to build computers with would be elementary particles and gravity itself, presumably in some highly exotic quantum states whose existence we, still lacking an adequate theory of quantum gravity, are currently unable to confirm or deny. (Observing them experimentally is of course out of the question.) If suitable states of particles and the gravitational field exist, then they would also provide an unlimited memory capacity, and the universe would be shrinking so fast that an infinite number of memory accesses would be feasible in a finite time before the end. The end-point of the gravitational collapse, the Big Crunch of this cosmology, is what Tipler calls the omega point.

Now, the Turing principle implies that there is no upper bound on the number of computational steps that are physically possible. So, given that an omega-point cosmology is (under plausible assumptions) the only type in which an infinite number of computational steps could occur, we can infer that our actual spacetime  {349}  must have the omega-point form. Since all computation would cease as soon as there were no more variables capable of carrying information, we can infer that the necessary physical variables (perhaps quantum-gravitational ones) do exist right up to the omega point.

A sceptic might argue that this sort of reasoning involves a massive, unjustified extrapolation. We have experience of 'universal' computers only in a most favourable environment which does not remotely resemble the final stages of the universe. And we have experience of them performing only a finite number of computational steps, using only a finite amount of memory. How can it be valid to extrapolate from those finite numbers to infinity? In other words, how can we know that the Turing principle in its strong form is strictly true? What evidence is there that reality supports more than _approximate_ universality?

This sceptic is, of course, an inductivist. Furthermore, this is exactly the type of thinking that (as I argued in the previous chapter) prevents us from understanding our best theories and improving upon them. What is or is not an 'extrapolation' depends on which _theory_ one starts with. If one starts with some vague but parochial concept of what is 'normal' about the possibilities of computation, a concept uninformed by the best available explanations in that subject, then one will regard _any_ application of the theory outside familiar circumstances as 'unjustified extrapolation'. But if one starts with explanations from the best available fundamental theory, then one will consider the very idea that some nebulous 'normalcy' holds in extreme situations to be an unjustified extrapolation. To understand our best theories, we must take them seriously as explanations of reality, and not regard them as mere summaries of existing observations. The Turing principle is our best theory of the foundations of computation. Of course we know only a finite number of instances confirming it - but that is true of every theory in science. There remains, and will always remain, the logical possibility that universality holds only approximately. But there is no rival theory of computation claiming that. And with good reason, for a 'principle of approximate universality' would have  {350}  no explanatory power. If, for instance, we want to understand why the world _seems_ comprehensible, the explanation might be that the world _is_ comprehensible. Such an explanation can, and in fact does, fit in with other explanations in other fields. But the theory that the world is _half_-comprehensible explains nothing and could not possibly fit in with explanations in other fields unless _they_ explained _it._ It simply restates the problem and introduces an unexplained constant, one-half. In short, what justifies assuming that the full Turing principle holds at the end of the universe, is that any other assumption spoils good explanations of what is happening here and now.

Now, it turns out that the type of oscillations of space that would make an omega point happen are highly unstable (in the manner of classical chaos) as well as violent. And they become increasingly more so, without limit, as the omega point is approached. A small deviation from the correct shape would be magnified rapidly enough for the conditions for continuing computation to be violated, so the Big Crunch would happen after only a finite number of computational steps. Therefore, to satisfy the Turing principle and attain an omega point, the universe would have to be continually 'steered' back onto the right trajectories. Tipler has shown in principle how this could be done, by manipulating the gravitational field over the whole of space. Presumably (again we would need a quantum theory of gravity to know for sure), the technology used for the stabilizing mechanisms, and for storing information, would have to be continually improved - indeed, improved an infinite number of times - as the density and stresses became ever higher without limit. This would require the continual creation of new knowledge, which, Popperian epistemology tells us, requires the presence of rational criticism and thus of intelligent entities. We have therefore inferred, just from the Turing principle and some other independently justifiable assumptions, that intelligence will survive, and knowledge will continue to be created, until the end of the universe.

The stabilization procedures, and the accompanying knowledge-creation processes, will all have to be increasingly rapid until, in  {351}  the final frenzy, an infinite amount of both occur in a finite time. We know of no reason why the physical resources should not be available to do this, but one might wonder why the inhabitants should bother to go to so much trouble. Why should they continue so carefully to steer the gravitational oscillations during, say, the last second of the universe? If you have only one second left to live, why not just sit back and take it easy at last? But of course, that is a misrepresentation of the situation. It could hardly be a bigger misrepresentation. For these people's minds will be running as computer programs in computers whose physical speed is increasing without limit. Their thoughts will, like ours, be virtual-reality renderings performed by these computers. It is true that at the end of that final second the whole sophisticated mechanism will be destroyed. But we know that the subjective duration of a virtual-reality experience is determined not by the elapsed time, but by the computations that are performed in that time. In an infinite number of computational steps there is time for an infinite number of thoughts - plenty of time for the thinkers to place themselves into any virtual-reality environment they like, and to experience it for however long they like. If they tire of it, they can switch to any other environment, or to any number of other environments they care to design. Subjectively, they will not be at the final stages of their lives but at the very beginning. They will be in no hurry, for subjectively they will live for ever. With one second, or one microsecond, to go, they will still have 'all the time in the world' to do more, experience more, create more - infinitely more - than anyone in the multiverse will ever have done before then. So there is every incentive for them to devote their attention to managing their resources. In doing so they are merely preparing for their own future, an open, infinite future of which they will be in full control and on which, at any particular time, they will be only just embarking.

We may hope that the intelligence at the omega point will consist of our descendants. That is to say, of our _intellectual_ descendants, since our present physical forms could not survive near the omega point. At some stage human beings would have to transfer the  {352}  computer programs that are their minds into more robust hardware. Indeed, this will eventually have to be done an infinite number of times.

The mechanics of 'steering' the universe to the omega point require actions to be taken throughout space. It follows that intelligence will have to spread all over the universe in time to make the first necessary adjustments. This is one of a series of deadlines that Tipler has shown we should have to meet - and he has shown that meeting each of them is, to the best of our present knowledge, physically possible. The first deadline is (as I remarked in Chapter 8]]) about five billion years from now when the Sun will, if left to its own devices, become a red giant star and wipe us out. We must learn to control or abandon the Sun before then. Then we must colonize our Galaxy, then the local cluster of galaxies, and then the whole universe. We must do each of these things soon enough to meet the corresponding deadline but we must not advance so quickly that we use up all the necessary resources before we have developed the next level of technology.

I say 'we must' do all this, but that is only on the assumption that it is we who are the ancestors of the intelligence that will exist at the omega point. We need not play this role if we do not want to. If we choose not to, and the Turing principle is true, then we can be sure that someone else (presumably some extraterrestrial intelligence) will.

Meanwhile, in parallel universes, our counterparts are making the same choices. Will they all succeed? Or, to put that another way, will someone _necessarily_ succeed in creating an omega point in our universe? This depends on the fine detail of the Turing principle. It says that a universal computer is physically possible, and 'possible' usually means 'actual in this or some other universe'. Does the principle require a universal computer to be built in all universes, or only in some - or perhaps in 'most'? We do not yet understand the principle well enough to decide. Some principles of physics, such as the principle of the conservation of energy, hold only over a group of universes and may under some circumstances be violated in individual universes. Others, such as the principle  {353}  of the conservation of charge, hold strictly in every universe. The two simplest forms of the Turing principle would be:

(1) there is a universal computer in _all_ universes; or

(2) there is a universal computer in _at least some_ universes.

The 'all universes' version seems too strong to express the intuitive idea that such a computer is physically _possible._ But 'at least some universes' seems too weak since, on the face of it, if universality holds only in very few universes then it loses its explanatory power. But a 'most universes' version would require the principle to specify a particular percentage, say 85 per cent, which seems very implausible. (There are no 'natural' constants in physics, goes the maxim, except zero, one and infinity.) Therefore Tipler in effect opts for 'all universes', and I agree that this is the most natural choice, given what little we know.

That is all that the omega-point theory - or, rather, the scientific component I am defending - has to say. One can reach the same conclusion from several different starting-points in three of the four strands. One of them is the epistemological principle that _reality is comprehensible._ That principle too is independently justifiable in so far as it underlies Popperian epistemology. But its existing formulations are all too vague for categorical conclusions about, say, the unboundedness of physical representations of knowledge, to be drawn from it. That is why I prefer not to postulate it directly, but to infer it from the Turing principle. (This is another example of the greater explanatory power that is available when one considers the four strands as being jointly fundamental.) Tipler himself relies either on the postulate that life will continue for ever, or on the postulate that information processing will continue for ever. From our present perspective, neither of these postulates seems fundamental. The advantage of the Turing principle is that it is already, for reasons quite independent of cosmology, regarded as a fundamental principle of nature - admittedly not always in this strong form, but I have argued that the strong form is necessary if the principle is to be integrated into physics.*]]  {354} 

Tipler makes the point that the science of cosmology has tended to study the _past_ (indeed, mainly the distant past) of spacetime. But most of spacetime lies to the future of the present epoch. Existing cosmology does address the issue of whether the universe will or will not recollapse, but apart from that there has been very little theoretical investigation of the greater part of spacetime. In particular, the lead-up to the Big Crunch has received far less study than the aftermath of the Big Bang. Tipler sees the omega-point theory as filling that gap. I believe that the omega-point theory deserves to become the prevailing theory of the future of spacetime until and unless it is experimentally (or otherwise) refuted. (Experimental refutation is possible because the existence of an omega point in our future places certain constraints on the condition of the universe today.)

Having established the omega-point scenario, Tipler makes some additional assumptions - some plausible, others less so - which enable him to fill in more details of future history. It is Tipler's quasi-religious interpretation of that future history, and his failure to distinguish that interpretation from the underlying scientific theory, that have prevented the latter from being taken seriously. Tipler notes that an infinite amount of knowledge will have been created by the time of the omega point. He then assumes that the intelligences existing in this far future will, like us, want (or perhaps need) to discover knowledge other than what is immediately necessary for their survival. Indeed, they have the potential to discover all knowledge that is physically knowable, and Tipler assumes that they will do so.

So in a sense, the omega point will be _omniscient._

But only in a sense. In attributing properties such as omniscience or even physical existence to the omega point, Tipler makes use of a handy linguistic device that is quite common in mathematical physics, but can be misleading if taken too literally. The device is to identify a limiting point of a sequence with the sequence itself. Thus, when he says that the omega point 'knows' X, he means that X is known by some finite entity before the time of the omega point, and is never subsequently forgotten. What he does _not_ mean  {355}  is that there is a knowing entity literally at the end-point of gravitational collapse, for there is no physical entity there at all.*]] Thus in the most literal sense the omega point knows nothing, and can be said to 'exist' only because some of our explanations of the fabric of reality refer to the limiting properties of physical events in the distant future.

Tipler uses the theological term 'omniscient' for a reason which will shortly become apparent; but let me note at once that in this usage it does not carry its full traditional connotation. The omega point will not know _everything._ The overwhelming majority of abstract truths, such as truths about Cantgotu environments and the like, will be as inaccessible to it as they are to us.*]]

Now, since the whole of space will be filled with the intelligent computer, it will be _omnipresent_ (though only after a certain date). Since it will be continually rebuilding itself, and steering the gravitational collapse, it can be said to be in control of everything that happens in the material universe (or multiverse, if the omega-point phenomenon happens in all universes). So, Tipler says, it will be _omnipotent._ But again, this omnipotence is not absolute. On the contrary, it is strictly limited to the available matter and energy, and is subject to the laws of physics.*]]

Since the intelligences in the computer will be creative thinkers, they must be classified as 'people'. Any other classification, Tipler rightly argues, would be racist. And so he claims that at the omega-point limit there is an omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent society of people. This society, Tipler identifies as God.

I have mentioned several respects in which Tipler's 'God' differs from the God or gods that most religious people believe in. There are further differences, too. For instance, the people near the omega point could not, even if they wanted to, speak to us or communicate their wishes to us, or work miracles (today).*]] They did not create the universe, and they did not invent the laws of physics - nor could they violate those laws if they wanted to. They may listen to prayers from the present day (perhaps by detecting very faint signals), but they cannot answer them. They are (and this we can infer from Popperian epistemology) opposed to religious faith, and  {356}  have no wish to be worshipped. And so on. But Tipler ploughs on, and argues that most of the core features of the God of the Judaeo-Christian religions are also properties of the omega point. Most religious people will, I think, disagree with Tipler about what the core features of their religions are.*]]{357}  would be counter-productive to place them immediately in contact with the contemporary culture at the time of resurrection: they would be instantly confused, humiliated and overwhelmed. Therefore, Tipler says, we can expect to be resurrected in an environment of a type that is essentially familiar to us, except that every unpleasant element will have been removed, and many extremely pleasant elements will have been added. In other words, heaven.

Tipler goes on in this manner to reconstitute many other aspects of the traditional religious landscape by redefining them as physical entities or processes that can plausibly be expected to exist near the omega point. Now, let us set aside the question whether the reconstituted versions are true to their religious analogues. The whole story about what these far-future intelligences will or will not do is based on a string of assumptions. Even if we concede that these assumptions are individually plausible, the overall conclusions cannot really claim to be more than informed speculation. Such speculations are worth making, but it is important to distinguish them from the argument for the existence of the omega point itself, and from the theory of the omega point's physical and epistemological properties. For _those_ arguments assume no more than that the fabric of reality does indeed conform to our best theories, an assumption that can be independently justified.

As a warning against the unreliability of even informed speculation, let me revisit the ancient master builder of Chapter 1]], with his pre-scientific knowledge of architecture and engineering. We are separated from him by so large a cultural gap that it would be extremely difficult for him to conceive a workable picture of our civilization. But we and he are almost contemporaries in comparison with the tremendous gap between us and the earliest possible moment of Tiplerian resurrection. Now, suppose that the master builder is speculating about the distant future of the building industry, and that by some extraordinary fluke he happens upon a perfectly accurate assessment of the technology of the present day. Then he will know, among other things, that we are capable of building structures far vaster and more impressive than the greatest cathedrals of his day. We could build a cathedral a mile high if we  {358}  chose to. And we could do it using a far smaller proportion of our wealth, and less time and human effort, than he would have needed to build even a modest cathedral. So he would have been confident in predicting that by the year 2000 there would be mile-high cathedrals. He would be mistaken, and badly so, for though we have the technology to build such structures, we have chosen not to. Indeed, it now seems unlikely that such a cathedral will ever be built. Even though we supposed our near-contemporary to be right about our technology, he would have been quite wrong about our preferences. He would have been wrong because some of his most unquestioned assumptions about human motivations have become obsolete after only a few centuries.

Similarly, it may seem natural to us that the omega-point intelligences, for reasons of historical or archaeological research, or compassion, or moral duty, or mere whimsy, will eventually create virtual-reality renderings of us, and that when their experiment is over they will grant us the piffling computational resources we would require to live for ever in 'heaven'. (I myself would prefer to be allowed gradually to join their culture.) But we cannot know what they will want. Indeed, no attempt to prophesy future large-scale developments in human (or superhuman) affairs can produce reliable results. As Popper has pointed out, the future course of human affairs depends on the future growth of knowledge. And we cannot predict what specific knowledge will be created in the future - because if we could, we should by definition already possess that knowledge in the present.*]]

It is not only scientific knowledge that informs people's preferences and determines how they choose to behave. There are also, for instance, moral criteria, which assign attributes such as 'right' and 'wrong' to possible actions. Such values have been notoriously difficult to accommodate in the scientific world-view. They seem to form a closed explanatory structure of their own, disconnected from that of the physical world. As David Hume pointed out, it is impossible logically to derive an 'ought' from an 'is'. Yet we use such values both to explain and to determine our physical actions.

The poor relation of morality is _usefulness._ Since it seems much  {359}  easier to understand what is objectively useful or useless than what is objectively right or wrong, there have been many attempts to define morality in terms of various forms of usefulness. There is, for example, evolutionary morality, which notes that many forms of behaviour which we explain in moral terms, such as not committing murder, or not cheating when we cooperate with other people, have analogues in the behaviour of animals. And there is a branch of evolutionary theory, _sociobiology_, that has had some success in explaining animal behaviour. Many people have been tempted to conclude that moral explanations for human choices are just window-dressing; that morality has no objective basis at all, and that 'right' and 'wrong' are simply tags we apply to our inborn urges to behave in one way rather than another. Another version of the same explanation replaces genes by memes, and claims that moral terminology is just window-dressing for social conditioning. However, none of these explanations fits the facts. On the one hand, we do _not_ tend to explain inborn behaviour - say, epileptic fits - in terms of moral choices; we have a notion of voluntary and involuntary actions, and only the voluntary ones have moral explanations. On the other hand, it is hard to think of a single inborn human behaviour - avoiding pain, engaging in sex, eating or whatever - that human beings have not under various circumstances chosen to override for moral reasons. The same is true, even more commonly, of socially conditioned behaviour. Indeed, overriding both inborn and socially conditioned behaviours is itself a characteristic human behaviour. So is explaining such rebellions in moral terms. None of these behaviours has any analogue among animals; in none of these cases can moral explanations be reinterpreted in genetic or memetic terms. This is a fatal flaw of this entire class of theories. Could there be a gene for overriding genes when one feels like it? Social conditioning that promotes rebellion? Perhaps, but that still leaves the problem of _how we choose what to do instead_, and of what we mean when we explain our rebellion by claiming that we were simply right, and that the behaviour prescribed by our genes or by our society in this situation was simply evil.  {360} 

These genetic theories can be seen as a special case of a wider stratagem, that of denying that moral judgements are meaningful on the grounds that we do not really choose our actions - that free will is an illusion incompatible with physics. But in fact, as we saw in Chapter 13]], free will _is_ compatible with physics, and fits quite naturally into the fabric of reality that I have described.

_Utilitarianism_ was an earlier attempt to integrate moral explanations with the scientific world-view through 'usefulness'. Here 'usefulness' was identified with human happiness. Making moral choices was identified with calculating which action would produce the most happiness, either for one person or (and the theory became more vague here) for 'the greatest number' of people. Different versions of the theory substituted 'pleasure' or 'preference' for 'happiness'. Considered as a repudiation of earlier, authoritarian systems of morality, utilitarianism is unexceptionable. And in the sense that it simply advocates rejecting dogma and acting on the 'preferred' theory, the one that has survived rational criticism, every rational person is a utilitarian. But as an attempt to solve the problem we are discussing here, of explaining the meaning of moral judgements, it too has a fatal flaw: _we choose our preferences._ In particular, we _change_ our preferences, and we give moral explanations for doing so. Such an explanation cannot be translated into utilitarian terms. Is there an underlying, master-preference that controls preference changes? If so, it could not itself be changed, and utilitarianism would degenerate into the genetic theory of morality discussed above.

What, then, is the relationship of moral values to the particular scientific world-view I am advocating in this book? I can at least argue that there is no fundamental obstacle to formulating one. The problem with all previous 'scientific world-views' was that they had hierarchical explanatory structures. Just as it is impossible, within such a structure, to 'justify' scientific theories as being _true_, so one cannot justify a course of action as being _right_ (because then, how would one justify the structure as a whole as being right?). As I have said, each of the four strands has a hierarchical explanatory structure. But the fabric of reality as a whole does  {361}  not. So explaining moral values as objective attributes of physical processes need not amount to deriving them from anything, even in principle. Just as with abstract mathematical entities, it will be a matter of what they contribute to the explanation - whether physical reality can or cannot be understood without also attributing reality to such values.

In this connection, let me point out that 'emergence' in the standard sense is only one way in which explanations in different strands may be related. So far I have really only considered what might be called _predictive_ emergence. For example, we believe that the predictions of the theory of evolution follow logically from the laws of physics, even though proving the connection might be computationally intractable. But the _explanations_ in the theory of evolution are not believed to follow from physics at all. However, a non-hierarchical explanatory structure allows for the possibility of explanatory emergence. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that a given moral judgement can be explained as being right in some narrow utilitarian sense. For instance: 'I want it; it harms no one; so it is right.' Now, that judgement might one day be called into question. I might wonder, '_Should_ I want it?' Or, 'Am I really right that it harms no one?' - for the issue of whom I judge the action to 'harm' itself depends on moral assumptions. My sitting quietly in a chair in my own home 'harms' everyone on Earth who might benefit from my going out and helping them at that moment; and it 'harms' any number of thieves who would like to steal the chair if only I went elsewhere for a while; and so on. To resolve such issues, I adduce further moral theories involving new explanations of my moral situation. When such an explanation seems satisfactory, I shall use it tentatively to make judgements of right and wrong. But the explanation, though temporarily satisfactory to me, still does not rise above the utilitarian level.

But now suppose that someone forms a general theory about such explanations themselves. Suppose that they introduce a higher-level concept, such as 'human rights', and guess that the introduction of that concept will, for a given class of moral problems like the one I have just described, always generate a new explanation that  {362}  solves the problem in the utilitarian sense. Suppose, further, that this theory about explanations is itself an explanatory theory. It explains, in terms of some other strand, _why_ analysing problems in terms of human rights is 'better' (in the utilitarian sense). For example, it might explain on epistemological grounds why respect for human rights can be expected to promote the growth of knowledge, which is itself a precondition for solving moral problems.

If the explanation seems good, it might be worth adopting such a theory. Furthermore, since utilitarian calculations are impossibly difficult to perform, whereas analysing a situation in terms of human rights is often feasible, it may be worth using a 'human rights' analysis in preference to any specific theory of what the happiness implications of a particular action are. If all this were true, it could be that the concept of 'human rights' is not expressible, even in principle, in terms of 'happiness' - that it is not a utilitarian concept at all. We may call it a moral concept. The connection between the two is through emergent explanation, not emergent prediction.

I am not especially advocating this particular approach; I am merely illustrating the way in which moral values might exist objectively by playing a role in emergent explanations. If this approach did work, then it would explain morality as a sort of 'emergent usefulness'.

In a similar way, 'artistic value' and other aesthetic concepts have always been difficult to explain in objective terms. They too are often explained away as arbitrary features of culture, or in terms of inborn preferences. And again we see that this is not necessarily so. Just as morality is related to usefulness, so artistic value has a less exalted but more objectively definable counterpart, _design._ Again, the value of a design feature is understandable only in the context of a given purpose for the designed object. But we may find that it is possible to improve designs by incorporating a good aesthetic criterion into the design criteria. Such aesthetic criteria would be incalculable from the design criteria; one of their uses would be to improve the design criteria themselves. The  {363}  relationship would again be one of explanatory emergence. And artistic value, or beauty, would be a sort of _emergent design._

Tipler's overconfidence in predicting people's motives near the omega point has caused him to underrate an important implication of the omega-point theory for the role of intelligence in the multiverse. It is that intelligence is not only there to control physical events on the largest scale, it is also there to choose what will happen. The ends of the universe are, as Popper said, for us to choose. Indeed, to a large extent the content of future intelligent thoughts is what will happen, for in the end the whole of space and its contents will _be_ the computer. The universe will in the end consist, literally, of intelligent thought-processes. Somewhere towards the far end of these materialized thoughts lies, perhaps, all physically possible knowledge, expressed in physical patterns.

Moral and aesthetic deliberations are also expressed in those patterns, as are the outcomes of all such deliberations. Indeed, whether or not there is an omega point, wherever there is knowledge in the multiverse (complexity across many universes) there must also be the physical traces of the moral and aesthetic reasoning that determined what sort of problems the knowledge-creating entity chose to solve there. In particular, before any piece of factual knowledge can become similar across a swathe of universes, moral and aesthetic judgements must already have been similar across those universes. It follows that such judgements also contain objective knowledge in the physical, multiverse sense. This justifies the use of epistemological terminology such as 'problem', 'solution', 'reasoning' and 'knowledge' in ethics and aesthetics. Thus, if ethics and aesthetics are at all compatible with the world-view advocated in this book, beauty and tightness must be as objective as scientific or mathematical truth. And they must be created in analogous ways, through conjecture and rational criticism.

So Keats had a point when he said that 'beauty is truth, truth beauty'. They are not the same thing, but they are the same _sort_ of thing, they are created in the same way, and they are inseparably related. (But he was of course quite wrong to continue 'that is all ye know on earth, and all ye need to know'.)  {364} 

In his enthusiasm (in the original sense of the word!), Tipler has neglected part of the Popperian lesson about what the growth of knowledge must look like. If the omega point exists, and if it will be created in the way that Tipler has set out, then the late universe will indeed consist of embodied thoughts of inconceivable wisdom, creativity and sheer numbers. But thought is problem-solving, and problem-solving means rival conjectures, errors, criticism, refutation and backtracking. Admittedly, _in the limit_ (which no one experiences), at the instant when the universe ends, everything that is comprehensible may have been understood. But at every finite point our descendants' knowledge will be riddled with errors. Their knowledge will be greater, deeper and broader than we can imagine, but they will make mistakes on a correspondingly titanic scale too.*]]

Like us, they will never know certainty or physical security, for their survival, like ours, will depend on their creating a continuous stream of new knowledge. If ever they fail, even once, to discover a way to increase their computing speed and memory capacity within the period available to them, as determined by inexorable physical law, the sky will fall in on them and they will die. Their culture will presumably be peaceful and benevolent beyond our wildest dreams, yet it will not be tranquil. It will be embarked upon the solution of tremendous problems and will be split by passionate controversies. For this reason it seems unlikely that it could usefully be regarded as a 'person'. Rather, it will be a vast number of people interacting at many levels and in many different ways, but _disagreeing._ They will not speak with one voice, any more than present-day scientists at a research seminar speak with one voice. Even when, by chance, they do happen to agree, they will often be mistaken, and many of their mistakes will remain uncorrected for arbitrarily long periods (subjectively). Nor will the culture ever become _morally_ homogeneous, for the same reason. Nothing will be sacred (another difference, surely, from conventional religion!), and people will continually be questioning assumptions that other people consider to be fundamental moral truths. Of course, morality, being real, is comprehensible by the methods of reason, and so every particular controversy will be resolved. But  {365}  it will be replaced by further, even more exciting and fundamental controversies. Such a discordant yet progressive collection of overlapping communities is very different from the God in whom religious people believe. But it, or rather some subculture within it, is what will be resurrecting us if Tipler is right.

In view of all the unifying ideas that I have discussed, such as quantum computation, evolutionary epistemology, and the multiverse conceptions of knowledge, free will and time, it seems clear to me that the present trend in our overall understanding of reality is just as I, as a child, hoped it would be. Our knowledge is becoming both broader and deeper, and, as I put it in Chapter 1]], depth is winning. But I have claimed more than that in this book. I have been advocating a particular unified world-view based on the four strands: the quantum physics of the multiverse, Popperian epistemology, the Darwin-Dawkins theory of evolution and a strengthened version of Turing's theory of universal computation. It seems to me that at the current state of our scientific knowledge, this is the 'natural' view to hold. It is the conservative view, the one that does not propose any startling change in our best fundamental explanations. Therefore it ought to be the prevailing view, the one against which proposed innovations are judged. That is the role I am advocating for it. I am not hoping to create a new orthodoxy; far from it. As I have said, I think it is time to move on. But we can move to better theories only if we take our best existing theories seriously, as explanations of the world.

### TERMINOLOGY

**mathematics** The study of absolutely necessary truths.

**proof** A way of establishing the truth of mathematical propositions.

(Traditional definition:) A sequence of statements, starting with some premises and ending with the desired conclusion, and satisfying certain 'rules of inference'.

(Better definition:) A computation that models the properties of some abstract entity, and whose outcome establishes that the abstract entity has a given property.

**mathematical intuition** (Traditionally:) An ultimate, self-evident source of justification for mathematical reasoning.

(Actually:) A set of theories (conscious and unconscious) about the behaviour of certain physical objects whose behaviour models that of interesting abstract entities.

**intuitionism** The doctrine that all reasoning about abstract entities is untrustworthy except where it is based on direct, self-evident intuition. This is the mathematical version of solipsism.

**Hilbert's tenth problem** To 'establish once and for all the certitude of mathematical methods' by finding a set of rules of inference sufficient for all valid proofs, and then proving those rules consistent by their own standards.

**Gödel's incompleteness theorem** A proof that Hilbert's tenth problem cannot be solved. For any set of rules of inference, there are valid proofs not designated as valid by those rules.

### SUMMARY

Abstract entities that are complex and autonomous exist objectively and are part of the fabric of reality. There exist logically necessary truths about these entities, and these comprise the subject-matter of mathematics. However, such truths cannot be known with certainty. Proofs do not confer certainty upon their conclusions. The  {256}  validity of a particular form of proof depends on the truth of our theories of the behaviour of the objects with which we perform the proof. Therefore mathematical knowledge is inherently derivative, depending entirely on our knowledge of physics. The comprehensible mathematical truths are precisely the infinitesimal minority which can be rendered in virtual reality. But the incomprehensible mathematical entities (e.g. Cantgotu environments) exist too, because they appear inextricably in our explanations of the comprehensible ones.

_I have said that computation always was a quantum concept, because classical physics was incompatible with the intuitions that formed the basis of the classical theory of computation. The same thing is true of time. Millennia before the discovery of quantum theory, time was the first quantum concept._  {257}

There has been a very unfortunate consequence, for all four strands, of the prevailing theory's being generally rejected as an explanation, without serious rival explanations being current. It is that the proponents of the prevailing theories - Popper, Turing, Everett, Dawkins and their supporters - have found themselves constantly on the defensive against obsolete theories. The debate between Popper and most of his critics was (as I said in Chapters [^3] and [^7]) effectively about the problem of induction. Turing spent the last years of his life in effect defending the proposition that human brains do not operate by supernatural means. Everett left scientific research after making no headway, and for several years the theory of the multiverse was championed almost single-handedly by Bryce DeWitt until progress in quantum cosmology in the 1970s forced its pragmatic acceptance in that field. But the opponents of the multiverse theory _as an explanation_ have seldom advanced rival explanations. (David Bohm's theory, which I mentioned in Chapter 4]], is an exception.) Instead, as the cosmologist Dennis Sciama once remarked, 'When it comes to the interpretation of quantum mechanics, the standard of argument suddenly drops to zero.' Proponents of the multiverse theory typically face a wistful, defiant but incoherent appeal to the Copenhagen interpretation - which, however, hardly anyone still believes. And finally, Dawkins has somehow become the public defender of scientific rationality against, of all things, _creationism_, and more generally against a pre-scientific world-view that has been obsolete since Galileo. The frustrating thing about all this is that, so long as the proponents of our best theories of the fabric of reality have to expend their intellectual energies in futile refutation and re-refutation of theories long known to be false, the state of our deepest knowledge cannot improve. Either Turing or Everett could easily have discovered the quantum theory of computation. Popper could have been  {335}  elaborating the theory of scientific explanation. (In fairness I must acknowledge that he did understand and elaborate some connections between his epistemology and the theory of evolution.) Dawkins could, for instance, be advancing his own theory of the evolution of replicating ideas (memes).

The unified theory of the fabric of reality that is the subject of this book is, at the most straightforward level, merely the combination of the four prevailing fundamental theories of their respective fields. In that sense it too is the 'prevailing theory' of those four fields taken as a whole. Even some of the connections between the four strands are quite widely acknowledged. My thesis, therefore, also takes the form 'the prevailing theory is true after all!' Not only do I advocate taking each of the fundamental theories seriously as an explanation of its own subject-matter, I argue that taken together they provide a new level of explanation of a unified fabric of reality.

I have also argued that none of the four strands can be properly understood independently of the other three. This is possibly a clue to the reason why all these prevailing theories have not been believed. All four individual explanations share an unattractive property which has been variously criticized as 'idealized and unrealistic', 'narrow' or 'naïve' - and also 'cold', 'mechanistic' and 'lacking in humanity'. I believe that there is some truth in the gut feeling behind these criticisms. For example, of those who deny the possibility of artificial intelligence, and find themselves in effect denying that the brain is a physical object, a few are really only trying to express a much more reasonable criticism: that the Turing explanation of computation seems to leave no room, even in principle, for any future explanation _in physical terms_ of mental attributes such as consciousness and free will. It is then not good enough for artificial-intelligence enthusiasts to respond brusquely that the Turing principle guarantees that a computer can do everything a brain can do. That is of course true, but it is an answer in terms of prediction, and the problem is one of explanation. There is an _explanatory gap._

I do not believe that this gap can be filled without bringing in  {336}  the other three strands. Now, as I have said, my guess is that the brain is a classical computer and not a quantum computer, so I do not expect the explanation of consciousness to be that it is any sort of quantum-computational phenomenon. Nevertheless, I expect the unification of computation and quantum physics, and probably the wider unification of all four strands, to be essential to the fundamental _philosophical_ advances from which an understanding of consciousness will one day flow. Lest the reader find this paradoxical, let me draw an analogy with a similar problem from an earlier era, 'What is life?' This problem was solved by Darwin. The essence of the solution was the idea that the intricate and apparently purposeful design that is apparent in living organisms is not built into reality _ab initio_, but is an emergent consequence of the operation of the laws of physics. The laws of physics had not specifically mandated the shapes of elephants and peacocks, any more than a Creator had. They make no reference to outcomes, especially emergent ones; they merely determine the rules under which atoms and the like interact. Now, this conception of a law of nature as a set of laws of motion is relatively recent. It can, I think, be credited specifically to Galileo, and to some extent to Newton. The previous concept of a law of nature had been that of a rule stating _what happens._ An example is Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion, which described how the planets move in elliptical orbits. This is to be contrasted with Newton's laws, which are laws of physics in the modern sense. They make no mention of ellipses, though they reproduce (and correct) Kepler's predictions under appropriate conditions. No one could have explained what life is under Kepler's conception of a 'law of physics', for they would have been looking for a law that mandates elephants in the same way as Kepler's laws mandate ellipses. But Darwin was able to wonder how laws of nature that did not mention elephants could nevertheless produce them, just as Newton's laws produce ellipses. Although Darwin made no use of any specific law of Newton's, his discovery would have been inconceivable without the world-view underlying those laws. That is the sense in which I expect the solution of the 'What is consciousness?' problem to depend on  {337}  quantum theory. It will invoke no specific quantum-mechanical processes, but it will depend crucially on the quantum-mechanical, and especially the multi-universe, world-picture.

What is my evidence? I have already presented some of it in Chapter 8]], where I discussed the multiverse view of knowledge. Although we do not know what consciousness is, it is clearly intimately related to the growth and representation of knowledge within the brain. It seems unlikely, then, that we shall be able to explain what consciousness is, as a physical process, before we have explained knowledge in physical terms. Such an explanation has been elusive in the classical theory of computation. But, as I explained, in quantum theory there is a good basis for one: knowledge can be understood as complexity that extends across large numbers of universes.

Another mental attribute that is somehow associated with consciousness is free will. Free will is also notoriously difficult to understand in the classical world-picture. The difficulty of reconciling free will with physics is often attributed to determinism, but it is not determinism that is at fault. It is (as I have explained in Chapter 11]]) classical spacetime. In spacetime, _something_ happens to me at each particular moment in my future. Even if what will happen is unpredictable, it is already there, on the appropriate cross-section of spacetime. It makes no sense to speak of my 'changing' what is on that cross-section. Spacetime does not change, therefore one cannot, within spacetime physics, conceive of causes, effects, the openness of the future or free will.

Thus, replacing deterministic laws of motion by indeterministic (random) ones would do nothing to solve the problem of free will, so long as the laws remained classical. Freedom has nothing to do with randomness. We value our free will as the ability to express, in our actions, who we as individuals are. Who would value being random? What we think of as our _free_ actions are not those that are random or undetermined but those that are largely _determined_ by who we are, and what we think, and what is at issue. (Although they are largely determined, they may be highly unpredictable in practice for reasons of complexity.)  {338} 

Consider this typical statement referring to free will: 'After careful thought I chose to do X; I could have chosen otherwise; it was the right decision; I am good at making such decisions.' In any classical world-picture this statement is pure gibberish. In the multiverse picture it has a straightforward physical representation, shown in Table 13.1. (I am not proposing to _define_ moral or aesthetic values in terms of such representations; I am merely pointing out that, thanks to the multiverse character of quantum reality, free will and related concepts are now compatible with physics.)

Thus Turing's conception of computation seems less disconnected from human values, and is no obstacle to the understanding of human attributes like free will, provided it is understood in a multiverse context. The same example exonerates Everett's theory itself. On the face of it, the price of understanding interference phenomena is to create or exacerbate many philosophical problems. But here, and in many other examples I have given in this book, we see that the very opposite is the case. The fruitfulness of the multiverse theory in contributing to the solution of long-standing philosophical problems is so great that it would be worth adopting even if there were no physical evidence for it at all. Indeed, the

|TABLE 13.1 _Physical representations of some statements referring to free will._  {339}|

  
philosopher David Lewis, in his book _On the Plurality of Worlds_, has postulated the existence of a multiverse for philosophical reasons alone.

Turning again to the theory of evolution, I can similarly attribute _some_ sense to those who criticize Darwinian evolution on the grounds that it seems 'unlikely' that such complex adaptations could have evolved in the given time. One of Dawkins' critics wants us to be as surprised by the biosphere as we would be if a heap of spare parts thrown together happened to fall into the pattern of a Boeing 747. On the face of it, this critic is forcing an analogy between, on the one hand, billions of years of planet-wide trial and error, and on the other hand an instantaneous accident of 'happening to fall together'. That would be wilfully to miss the whole point of the evolutionary explanation. Nevertheless, is Dawkins' precisely opposite position completely adequate as an explanation? Dawkins wants us _not to be surprised_ that complex adaptations have come into being spontaneously. In other words, he is claiming that his 'selfish gene' theory is a full explanation - not of course for specific adaptations, but of how it was possible for such complex adaptations to come into being.

But it is not a full explanation. There is an explanatory gap, and this time we already know much more about how the other strands could fill it. We have seen that the very fact that physical variable can store information, that they can interact with one another to transfer and replicate it, and that such processes are stable, all depend on the details of quantum theory. Furthermore, we have seen that the existence of highly adapted replicators depends on the physical feasibility of virtual-reality generation and universality, which in turn can be understood as consequences of a deep principle, the Turing principle, that links physics and the theory of computation and makes no explicit reference to replicators, evolution or biology at all.

An analogous gap exists in Popperian epistemology. Its critics wonder why the scientific method works, or what justifies our reliance on the best scientific theories. This leads them to hanker after a principle of induction or something of the sort (though, as  {340}  crypto-inductivists, they usually realize that such a principle would not explain or justify anything either). For Popperians to reply that there is no such thing as justification, or that it is never rational to rely on theories, is to provide no explanation. Popper even said that 'no theory of knowledge should attempt to explain why we are successful in our attempts to explain things' (_Objective Knowledge_ p. 23). But, once we understand that the growth of human knowledge is a physical process, we see that it cannot be illegitimate to try to explain how and why it occurs. Epistemology is a theory of (emergent) physics. It is a factual theory about the circumstances under which a certain physical quantity (knowledge) will or will not grow. The bare assertions of this theory are largely accepted. But we cannot possibly find an explanation of why they are true solely within the theory of knowledge _per se._ In that narrow sense, Popper was right. The explanation must involve quantum physics, the Turing principle and, as Popper himself stressed, the theory of evolution.

The proponents of the prevailing theory, in each of the four cases, are put permanently on the defensive by their critics' harping on these explanatory gaps. This often forces them to retreat into the core of their own strand. 'Here I stand, I can do no other' is their ultimate response, as they rely on the self-evident irrationality of abandoning the unrivalled fundamental theory of their own particular field. This only makes them seem even more narrow to the critics, and it tends to engender pessimism about the very prospect of further fundamental explanation.

Despite all the excuses I have been making for the critics of the central theories, the history of all four strands shows that something very unpleasant happened to fundamental science and philosophy for most of the twentieth century. The popularity of positivism and of an instrumentalist view of science was connected with an apathy, loss of self-confidence and pessimism about genuine explanations at a time when the prestige, usefulness and, indeed, funding for fundamental research were all at an all-time high. Of course there were many individual exceptions, including the four heroes of this chapter. But the unprecedented manner in which their  {341}  theories were simultaneously adopted and ignored speaks for itself. I do not claim to have a full explanation for this phenomenon, but whatever caused it, we seem to be coming out of it now.

I have pointed out one possible contributory cause, namely that individually, all four theories have explanatory gaps that can make them seem narrow, inhuman and pessimistic. But I suggest that when they are taken together as a unified explanation of the fabric of reality, this unfortunate property is reversed. Far from denying free will, far from placing human values in a context where they are trivial and insignificant, far from being pessimistic, it is a fundamentally optimistic world-view that places human minds at the centre of the physical universe, and explanation and understanding at the centre of human purposes. I hope we shall not have to spend too long looking backwards to defend this unified view against non-existent competitors. There will be no lack of competitors when, having taken the unified theory of the fabric of reality seriously, we begin to develop it further. It is time to move on.

### TERMINOLOGY

**paradigm** The set of ideas through which those who hold it observe and explain everything in their experience. According to Thomas Kuhn, holding a paradigm blinds one to the merits of another paradigm and prevents one from switching paradigms. One cannot comprehend two paradigms at the same time.

**Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics** An idea for making it easier to evade the implications of quantum theory for the nature of reality. At moments of observation, the outcome in one of the universes supposedly becomes real, and all the other universes - even those that contributed to that outcome - are deemed never to have existed. Under this view, one is not permitted to ask about what happens in reality between conscious observations.  {342} 

### SUMMARY

The intellectual histories of the fundamental theories of the four strands contain remarkable parallels. All four have been simultaneously accepted (for use in practice) and ignored (as explanations of reality). One reason for this is that, taken individually, each of the four theories has explanatory gaps, and seems cold and pessimistic. To base a world-view on any of them individually is, in a generalized sense, reductionist. But when they are taken together as a unified explanation of the fabric of reality, this is no longer so.
