## CHAPTER 1

## What’s So Tragic about the “Commons”?

I first learned of Dr. Elinor Ostrom’s Nobel-prize-winning research on environmental management when I was a graduate student in upstate New York. However, it took a trip to a Nairobi shopping mall for me to really understand it.

My family and I were living in Kenya while I worked as a visiting professor at Kenyatta University. Nairobi is famous for its chaotic traffic so we relied on a taxi driver, James Waithaka, for most of our car trips. While driving me to a lunch meeting at one Nairobi’s many upscale malls, Waithaka said that he’d drop me off at the front entrance, but he would park at the far end of the lot to wait for me.

I asked Waithaka why he would not be waiting in the taxi lot right in front of the mall. He explained that that lot was unofficially reserved for drivers who are part of the taxi collective. Customers can request a taxi as they leave the mall. The taxi collective determines who gets to drive the next customer, and the drivers agree to charge the same rates. Many of the Nairobi malls had such an informal arrangement. Waithaka, not being a member of the collective, had to wait elsewhere. He also was not interested in picking up another customer because he was going to wait for me.

As a professor of natural resources management, I immediately recognized this as a “commons.” Commons, or as Ostrom called them, “common-pool resources,” are goods that can be depleted if overused but are also difficult to exclude people from using. The conventional wisdom held that resources like the common pastures of old-time, agrarian villages would be overgrazed if all residents were allowed to bring as many animals to the pasture as they wished. In this case, taxi drivers from all over Nairobi would have clogged the shopping mall’s lots. Too many drivers would have chased too few customers. The drivers would have lowered their rates to unsustainable levels in a competition to lure customers. They would have, in effect, overgrazed and degraded the taxi commons and made all of the drivers worse off.

But the taxi drivers did not succumb to this fate. They organized and determined which drivers were “in” the taxi collective and which were “out.” They developed rules to determine who gets the next customer. They set physical boundaries where the rules apply and where drivers like Waithaka, who bring their own customers, can wait quietly. And they doled out punishments to those who broke the rules (not all of which were legal). They did this with the tacit approval of the mall owners and law enforcement. The taxi drivers, through years of trial and error, figured out a way to sustainably manage their flow of customers. Each taxi driver has enough customers to earn a living. And they did it on their own.

As Waithaka told me all of this, I recalled the work of Elinor Ostrom. As a professor at Indiana University, Ostrom studied resource-using communities around the world. She found that, contrary to the conventional wisdom, communities can work together to manage their resources without degrading them. These arrangements can be messy and complicated, but they also can be effective. Communities are not relegated to the fate of overusing their “commons.” And these taxi drivers were yet another example.

The Nairobi taxi drivers piqued my curiosity. Where else do we find these common-pool resources and how are people dealing with them? It turns out that common-pool resources are all around us.

Take, for example, our office coffee club. The staff in my university department would bring in a can of coffee to join the club. By doing that, they gained access to the communal coffee pot. Coffee aficionados might want to bring in expensive coffee. They would pay a lot for that premium coffee but would end up sharing it with all the club members. Others might bring in the cheapest, worst coffee they could find knowing that most people will bring in a better grade of coffee. Even the coffee aficionado would soon realize it is more rational to bring in a lower grade of coffee. If everyone in the coffee club followed this line of logic, the department coffee pot would soon be filled with the worst, most bitter coffee on the market. Thankfully, that did not happen. The department administrator set the standard by bringing in the first can of coffee. Then, she wrote the name of staff members on the can as they made their contributions. Nobody wants to be known as the office cheapskate. Simply writing the contributor’s name on the can was an effective way to enforce the standard.

Of course, there were those who would just sneak an occasional cup of coffee without contributing their share. They were “free riding” on the donations of their coworkers. When our department moved into a new building, someone donated a single-cup coffee maker, the kind with pods. Now all coffee drinkers are responsible for their own coffee. That eliminated the free rider problem. But we lost, in a small way, a sense of community, something that bound us together. Our department coffee commons is no more.

In his essay, “The Tragedy of the Commons,” biologist Garrett Hardin assumed that there were only two ways to avoid ruining a commons: privatizing the resource by dividing it up or imposing rules through an outside authority. In terms of the coffee club example, this would mean either having all coffee drinkers bring in their own coffee pods for personal use (thus negating the idea of a club) or having the department collect money from participants (or perhaps every employee to avoid free riders) and buy one standard brand of coffee. Ostrom’s Nobel-winning insight was that there is a third way: collective action. People can, under certain conditions, create and enforce rules and expectations of behavior. Our department coffee club did that, and it worked well for years.

Economists, political scientists, and natural resource managers have studied commons for decades. The consensus was that, if left unregulated, commons would be overused or degraded. Ostrom challenged this consensus. By collaborating with colleagues from diverse academic fields around the world, she showed that people can come together to manage their local commons on their own. Ostrom won the 2009 Nobel Prize in Economics for her pioneering work in the “economic governance” of commons.[^1]

Ostrom’s research showed that the taxi drivers’ “bottom-up” solutions were not as unusual as we might first expect. Water managers in Los Angeles had figured this out, as had dryland farmers in both Spain and the Philippines. Lobster harvesters in Maine organized into “harbor gangs” and defended their territory much like Nairobi’s taxi drivers. Ostrom and her colleagues found hundreds of instances around the world in which people effectively managed their common-pool resources.

The more I learned about Ostrom’s approach to environmental management, the more intrigued I became. I had the opportunity to spend a year as a visiting scholar at Indiana University’s Ostrom Workshop, the research center she started with her husband, Vincent. While there, I was immersed in the scholarship of common-pool resources and met people who had worked closely with the Ostroms. A new generation of scholars continues to apply her ideas to new challenges, from space commons to cybersecurity.

This book is about Ostrom’s collaborative approach to safeguarding our environment. It argues that Ostrom’s “third way” is, in many cases but not all, a critical tool for managing a wide range of resource challenges. Ostrom herself developed a set of eight “design principles” that provides a template for sustainable stewardship of the common-pool resources. The next few chapters show how Ostrom, through more than four decades of research, came to develop these design principles and apply them in settings around the world. The last third of the book illustrates how Ostrom’s design principles and theories for managing the commons continue to influence researchers and policy makers. Her ideas are being applied to managing satellites and orbital debris, cybersecurity, and digital information. Ostrom’s groundbreaking work is as relevant as ever.

In order to appreciate the importance of Ostrom’s ideas, let’s take a closer look at how scholars and policy makers viewed the world when Ostrom was starting her career. Ostrom’s work is inseparable from that of another scholar, Garrett Hardin.

**Box 1.1 A Campus Commons**

It is a sunny September afternoon on the campus of the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry (ESF) in Syracuse, New York. Hackberry trees, just starting to take on their fall colors, line the path around the grassy quad at the center of campus. The quad is not just the geographic center of ESF’s campus; it is also the social center. Students spread out across the lush grass to study, toss a Frisbee, play guitar, or just lounge in between classes.

The low chatter and laughter of friends is broken by a shout.

“Get off the quad!”

Students look up to see someone—a new student? a visitor?—cutting across the diagonal of the quad. This person has made a grave error.

The ESF students, known around here as “Stumpies,” treasure this common space and defend its integrity. The quad is a perfectly green rectangle, unmarred by “desire lines” worn across the turf by students who wish to cut across it. New students quickly learn not to cut across the quad. Those who violate this tradition will hear shouts from students firmly reminding them to stick to the path around the perimeter. Cutting across the quad is not formally forbidden by the college. The only penalty is a brief moment of social stigma. It’s a tradition, an informal expectation of behavior, that has been passed down through generations of students.

Although ESF’s quad has endured for more than a century, the conventional wisdom on resource management says it should not be so. After all, most students are late once in a while and cutting across the quad would shorten the distance to class. Why take the long way around the quad and be late if everyone else is going to cut across? And if I am going to take the short cut, who am I to judge others who do the same? The conventional wisdom therefore is that rational students will keep cutting across the quad and creating desire lines. And yet, the quad remains unmarred. Why?

The campus quad at ESF is an example of a commons. Originally a commons (or, sometimes, common) was a plot of land, such as a pasture, that was available for community members to graze their animals. For example, Boston Common was established in 1634 as a place for people to graze cattle, assemble militias, and conduct public executions. Today a commons refers to any resource that can be used up but from which it is difficult to exclude people. The quad at ESF is a commons in the sense that it will be degraded by an unsightly and muddy crisscross of desire paths if too many students cut across it. However, the quad is just a grassy lawn in the middle of campus. No fence surrounds the quad, no locked gate prevents students from walking across it. Although difficult, the students have shown it is not impossible, to stop people from taking a short cut across the quad. It takes a commitment from the students themselves to transmit and enforce this expectation to incoming students.

As a newly fledged political scientist, Elinor (Lin) Ostrom probably would not have been familiar with most of Garrett Hardin’s academic work. He was, after all, a biologist. But Hardin was not merely an academic scientist. During the mid-1960s, Hardin emerged as an outspoken advocate for population control. An essay he wrote about “the population problem” would come to influence generations of environmental managers. And that essay would put Ostrom on the path to the Nobel Prize.

In 1968, Hardin served as the president of the Pacific Division of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. At that summer’s annual meeting, he delivered a rather lengthy address about what he perceived to be the problem of overpopulation.[^2] Hardin revised the lecture into a much shorter essay published in December 1968 as “The Tragedy of the Commons.”[^3] It would quickly go on to become one of the most requested and downloaded articles _Science_ magazine has ever published. Hardin wrote it just as the modern environmental movement was taking off. Earlier that year, fellow ecologist Paul Ehrlich wrote a bestseller, _The Population Bomb_. A year later, Cleveland’s Cuyahoga River would famously catch fire, although not for the first time and not the only river to do so. In many ways, it was the perfect time to offer a simple, easy to understand reason why our planet was in rough shape.

In his essay, Hardin borrowed the parable of a village commons from an 1833 pamphlet by William Foster Lloyd.[^4] “Picture a pasture open to all,” Hardin begins. Villagers bring their animals to this common pasture to graze. Because the pasture is “open to all,” none can be excluded. Any villager earns more profit from the meat and milk produced by each additional animal in the herd. However, the costs of grazing on the commons are shared by everyone. The villager gets all the benefits from enlarging the herd but only pays a fraction of the costs. Each villager then has a rational incentive to maximize income by bringing more animals to graze. But when each villager follows that same rational plan, the animals overgraze and degrade the common pasture. All of the villagers then suffer from the barren commons. Hardin, like Lloyd before him, assumed that the incentives to overgraze the commons are so hardwired into the system that they are virtually impossible to overcome.

Hardin acknowledged that common pastures did exist and, in some cases, were used for centuries. For example, Boston Common, now a metropolitan park, was once a common pasture.[^5] But Hardin claimed, without evidence, that “tribal wars, poaching, and disease keep the numbers of both man and beast well below the carrying capacity of the land.” A long-enduring commons, in other words, was the product of some other form of misery and not of successful management.

This was a parable, a story meant to teach a lesson. Hardin wasn’t really interested in cattle or pastures. The cattle were a metaphor for the human population, and the pasture was Earth’s resources. The story, then, was of humans’ destiny to ruin the planet through an ever-increasing population.

We often think of a “tragedy” as a sad story. However, Hardin chose the word “tragedy” for its particular connection to the dramatic tragedies of ancient Greece. Hardin quoted a philosopher, Alfred North Whitehead, when invoking the Greek meaning of a tragedy: “This inevitableness of destiny can only be illustrated in terms of human life by incidents which in fact involve unhappiness. For it is only by them that the futility of escape can be made evident in the drama.”[^6] Hardin emphasized this notion of the futility of escape, of being trapped.

“In all the stories of tragedy, the hero is told in advance what is going to happen, and then he tries to avoid his fate, switching to left and switching to right,” Hardin told an interviewer in 1983. “But, no matter what he does: tragedy eventually hits him anyway.”

“Tragedy brings a feeling of the inevitable, a feeling that something is inescapable; and that is the idea of a scientific law. . . . And Whitehead said that this idea of inescapability, which is almost a religious idea, is essential to science.”[^7]

Consider the classic Greek story of Oedipus Rex. Oedipus’s parents take their newborn son to an oracle who told the baby’s future. Little Oedipus, the oracle says, will grow up to kill his father and marry his mother. What an awful fate for everyone! His parents, wanting to avoid this horrible destiny, abandon baby Oedipus on the side of a road. But Oedipus survives and is raised by another family. His adoptive family keeps his origins a secret. Years later, grown-up Oedipus gets into a roadside argument with an older stranger. He kills the man and flees. Oedipus solves the famous riddle of the Sphinx, marries a widow, and becomes a king. Only later does his mother, now also his wife, realize that Oedipus is her son. The man Oedipus killed on the side of the road so long ago was his father. The oracle’s prediction had come true. Tormented by the realization, his mother kills herself and Oedipus gouges out his eyes.

There is no spoiler alert in Greek tragedy. What keeps the audiences, both ancient and modern, engaged is how the tragedy unfolds. We know Oedipus will kill his father and marry his mother. The oracle said so at the very beginning of the play. Trying to escape that fate is futile. There may be surprises along the way, but the end is predetermined.

Like the tragic heroes of ancient Greece, Hardin posited that our environmental fates are already determined. The oracle has spoken—we will overgraze the common pastures, overfish the seas, overpollute the atmosphere, overpopulate the planet. We are trapped in a system that rewards individuals for overconsuming the planet’s shared resources. “Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush,” according to Hardin.

The only ways to avoid this ruinous future, Hardin said, are by privatizing the resource—and thereby negating the commons—or having government impose restrictions on people’s behavior. The resource users, Hardin argued, were incapable of avoiding the “tragedy of the commons” on their own. Hardin shared an early draft of what would become “The Tragedy of the Commons” with his family and friends. In it, Hardin emphasized that some kind of coercion would be necessary to keep people from ruining a commons. But that forced coercion did not sit well with some in his test audience.

“Our daughter Hyla, who was 26 years old at that time, objected to my introduction of coercion. In response, I changed it to ‘mutual coercion mutually agreed upon.’ . . . And it wasn’t until several years later, when other people were still objecting to this coercion, that I realized my phrase is merely a definition of any law passed in a democracy. . . . The majority coerces the minority.”[^8]

But Hardin did not always have faith that democratic institutions would save a commons from ruin. “If ruin is to be avoided in a crowded world,” Hardin wrote, “people must be responsive to a coercive force outside their individual psyches, a ‘Leviathan,’ to use Hobbes’ term.”[^9]

Hardin’s perspective influenced environmental managers for more than fifty years—but was he correct? Are we destined to destroy our commons? Hardin’s powerful metaphor is easy to understand. But as H. L. Mencken wrote, “Explanations exist; they have existed for all time; there is always a well-known solution to every human problem—neat, plausible and wrong.”[^10]

Ostrom had already finished her doctorate and was a professor at Indiana University when Hardin published “The Tragedy of the Commons.” Hardin’s simple but powerful explanation of environmental degradation, and the solutions he proposed, fit neatly into the era’s dominant mode of thinking. “In the mid-twentieth century,” Ostrom reflected many years later, “the dominant scholarly effort was to try to fit the world into simple models and to criticize institutional arrangements that did not fit.”[^11] Most scholars, including Hardin, saw “the market” or “the government” as the only two viable options for solving these challenges.

Ostrom summarized the midcentury thinking in her 2009 Nobel Prize address. “The market was seen as the optimal institution for the production and exchange of private goods,” she read from the podium in Stockholm. “For nonprivate goods, on the other hand, one needed ‘the’ government to impose rules and taxes to force self-interested individuals to contribute necessary resources and refrain from self-seeking activities. Without a hierarchical government to induce compliance, self-seeking citizens and officials would fail to generate efficient levels of public goods, such as peace and security, at multiple scales.”[^12]

“A lot of people presumed that it was impossible for those who use the fishery—or groundwater basin or a lake or a river—to self-organize,” she told an interviewer after winning the Nobel. “Self-organization was considered to be impossible. That’s why they recommended that either ‘the market’ or ‘the state’—not well defined, not well worked out—but these in an idealized form.”[^13]

But as a graduate student in the early 1960s, Ostrom knew that the dominant model of “the market” and “the government” was insufficient. She studied the communities around Los Angeles, California, as they solved their problems of groundwater overuse on their own. They didn’t need the California state government to impose restrictions on them. The communities’ water-sharing arrangement did not fit neatly into the scholars’ simple models. And yet, it worked. So, when Hardin’s essay set the academic world buzzing in the late 1960s, Ostrom knew that his parable of the commons did not reflect the world’s complexity and the ingenuity of resource users.

Ostrom had the opportunity to meet Garret Hardin in 1976 when Indiana University invited Hardin to deliver the annual Patten Foundation Lecture. Hardin’s guest lecture revisited many of the themes he covered in “The Tragedy of the Commons.” Resource depletion due to uncontrolled population growth was the problem, according to Hardin, and top-down government policies were the solution.

“He indicated that every man and every woman should be sterilized after they have one child. He was very serious about it,” Ostrom recalled decades later. “I was somewhat taken aback: ‘My theory proves that we should do this,’ and people said, ‘Well, don’t you think that that’s a little severe?’ ‘No! That’s what we should do, or we’re sunk.’”[^14]

Ostrom, sitting in the audience, must have been shocked to hear this. The research Lin and her husband Vincent were doing showed that, in fact, government coercion was not the only way. As a married couple who were also research partners, they often sparred over ideas, like competitive athletes pushing each other toward ever faster race times. Sometimes new ideas emerged from these vigorous, but always respectful, debates. Lin even dedicated one of her books, “To Vincent, for his love and contestation.”

No one would ever describe Ostrom as a shrinking violet. So, it’s not surprising that Ostrom and Hardin developed a friendly, professional rivalry also based on contestation. They challenged one another about how best to manage a commons. Lin and Vincent even invited Hardin to their home for dinner. According to Barbara Allen, a former student and close friend who was there, Lin served him Hamburger Helper casserole.

**Box 1.2 Hardin’s Tragedy**

Although his metaphor of a degraded pasture has been used to describe countless resources, from the Atlantic bluefin tuna harvest to cybersecurity, Hardin’s essay had one particular commons in mind: human population. “The Tragedy of the Commons” describes global population as a commons that, just like any other commons, can be overexploited. Hardin argues that “freedom to breed is intolerable.” He says we cannot count on conscientious people to have fewer children because “conscience is self-eliminating.” People, left to their own whims, will overwhelm Earth’s resources and rush to ruin. For Hardin, the only alternative is for the government to impose restrictions on reproduction. Such regulations would not be necessary “_if_ the children of improvident parents starved to death; _if_, thus, overbreeding brought its own punishment to the germ line” (emphasis in the original).

This is a grim outlook. It has not aged well, neither factually nor morally.

Hardin was no oracle. Contrary to his predictions, global population growth has been steadily slowing since 1971. When Hardin published his essay, global population was increasing at 2.03 percent annually. In 2018, the rate was 1.11 percent. Hardin wrote, “There is no prosperous population in the world today that has, and has had for some time, a growth rate of zero.” Today, twenty-five countries have zero or negative growth rates, including Japan, Cuba, Italy, and Poland. Some countries’ populations are declining because of civil war or economic crises, such as Syria and Venezuela. But population growth is slowing in all parts of the world. In 2070, the global fertility rate is expected to dip to replacement level of 2.1 births per woman, which corresponds with zero population growth. Global population is expected to stabilize at 10.9 billion by 2100. That is a substantial increase over the current population, but an end to population growth is in sight. Children born today will likely live to see a world with a stable population size.

How did Hardin get it wrong? A clue may be in the essay itself. The word “breed” appears twelve times in the essay. “Woman” or “female” appears not once. It turns out that empowering women to make their own decisions about children is strongly associated with smaller families. According to demographers K. C. Samir and Wolfgang Lutz, the “empirical data show that, in virtually all populations—and in particular those that are still in the process of demographic transition—more educated women have lower fertility.” For example, Ethiopian women with a secondary education have an average of two children whereas those without any formal education have six.

The idea that people, in particular women, can and should be able to choose the number of children to bear was, to Hardin, absurd. He rejected the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which stated “any choice and decision with regard to the size of the family must irrevocably rest with the family itself, and cannot be made by anyone else.” To this, Hardin responded, “If we love the truth we must openly deny the validity of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.” He rejected, out of hand, the very solution that successfully slowed population growth. More pointedly, he rejected the role of women.

Political scientist Matto Mildenberger critiqued Hardin’s legacy as one of “a racist, eugenicist, nativist, and Islamophobe.” Hardin was just one of many scholars in the late 1960s to call for extreme, sometimes racist, actions in the name of environmental sustainability. William and Paul Paddock, in a book called _Famine—1975!_, recommended cutting off food aid to India, Haiti, and other countries because they “can’t be saved” from catastrophe. Better, they claimed, to send scarce American food aid to countries such as Pakistan and Tunisia that could put it to better use. Paul Ehrlich’s book, _The Population Bomb_, doubled down on the Paddock brothers’ advice. Ehrlich suggested mandatory mass sterilization for men as the price for food aid. These were not scholars on the fringe. For example, Hardin published a book with the White House Council on Environmental Quality. Ehrlich was a frequent guest on _The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson_. Mildenberger calls for modern environmental scholars to move beyond the flawed ideas and ideologies from the 1960s. Democratic governance and cooperation can be an effective, if messy, approach to managing the commons. Janet Yellen, former chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, said, “Women and men have significantly different approaches and views on public policy issues which means that women’s voices and those of minorities need to be heard.” If Hardin, Ehrlich, and their peers had listened to women’s voices, we might have stabilized population and empowered women sooner.

Allen recalled that dinner and the many letters Ostrom and Hardin exchanged. “Lin and Garrett Hardin had a long correspondence that was a no-holds barred conversation,” Allen said in a 2014 interview.[^15] Allen produced the documentary film, _Actual World, Possible Future_, about the Ostroms.[^16]

The Nobel Prize committee recognized Ostrom for her decades-long effort to show that regular people—farmers, fishers, taxi drivers—can and do figure out ways to manage their commons sustainably. However, fifty years after its publication, “The Tragedy of the Commons” still exerts considerable influence over the environmental professions. A recent survey showed that one-third to one-half of college instructors, depending on the discipline, consider Hardin’s article as “representing the foremost thinking on the commons; if students learn one thing about commons governance it should be this concept.”[^17] Ostrom, on the other hand, objected to “the metaphor of ‘the tragedy of the commons’ after years of empirical research in both the lab and the field that has called their universal applicability into question.”[^18]

“People say I disproved him, and I come back and say, ‘No, that’s not right. I’ve not disproved him. I’ve shown that his assertion that common property will always be degraded is wrong,’” Ostrom told an interviewer. “He was addressing a problem of considerable significance that we need to take seriously. It’s just that he went too far. He said people could never manage the commons well.”[^19]

Hardin begrudgingly agreed. “If I were doing it over again, I would summarize the idea more carefully, along somewhat the following lines: that in a crowded world, an unmanaged commons cannot possibly work. In the original, I did not refer to a ‘crowded world,’ but that’s an essential part of it. Also, the term, ‘unmanaged,’ I didn’t put that in initially. That was the implication, but I didn’t put it in.”[^20]

Ostrom and her colleague Michael McGinnis later wrote, “What Hardin did not capture was the capacity of the individuals involved in such tragedies to have sufficient insight into the problems that they faced to restructure their own rules and change the incentives they faced.”[^21]

Ostrom’s work suggested that Hardin’s idea is at best incomplete. People can work together to manage their shared resources sustainably without restrictions being imposed on them from outside or privatizing the commons. Doing so takes time to develop a set of rules and effort in enforcing them. Collective action is messy, complex, and not always successful. However, Ostrom identified a set of “design principles” that make success more likely.

**Box 1.3 Olson and the Logic of Collective Action**

Garrett Hardin wasn’t the first, or only, person to conclude that people could not work together for the common good. In 1965, a young midwestern economist named Mancur Olson wrote a provocative book titled _The Logic of Collective Action_. Political scientists were particularly drawn to Olson’s ideas. The book would also have an enduring influence on Ostrom’s work.

Prior to Olson’s book, the conventional wisdom was that people organize into groups to gain some kind of benefits that they are unable to attain as individuals. That is, people benefit from acting collectively. But Olson showed that it might not be rational for individuals to organize even if the total benefits from organizing are substantial. It takes effort for someone to join a group. But the benefits are benefits shared by everyone. If someone can enjoy the benefits without actually joining the group—that is, be a free rider— then it is logical not to join. And, as in “The Tragedy of the Commons,” if everyone follows that logic, nobody will join and nobody will receive any benefits.

Take, for example, a labor union. The labor union bargains with the factory owner for better wages and working conditions. If successful, all the workers enjoy the fruits of the union’s work. But what if some workers don’t join the union? They would presumably enjoy these benefits without paying dues to the union. It’s entirely logical, even rational, to just “free ride” on the union’s work. If enough workers opt out of the union, then the union itself doesn’t have the resources to operate. It can’t bargain for better wages and working conditions. All the workers lose.

Olson concluded that if the benefits are diffuse, but the costs are concentrated, then people don’t have a sufficient incentive to organize. Even though the total benefits exceed the total costs, a better world is out of reach.

The solution, according to Olson, is to make the benefits exclusive. Joining the union, in this example, isn’t optional. If every worker enjoys the benefits for which the union advocates, then every worker has to pay dues to the union whether they want to or not. Otherwise the whole system breaks down. That’s why unions treat strikebreakers harshly. Conversely, it’s why some factory owners advocate for “right to work” laws that allow workers the “freedom” not to join the union. The “right to work” law enables workers to decline joining the union but still enjoy its benefits. Over time, it undermines the union’s bargaining power.

According to _The Logic of Collective Action_, benefits that are not exclusive should not exist, at least in meaningful numbers. Logical people would not spend their own time and money making something or organizing a group if people could then get it for free. But, as _Star Trek_’s Mr. Spock said, “Logic is the beginning of wisdom . . . not the end.”

Wikipedia is one of the most popular websites on the internet. Millions of people rely on it for information. But by Olson’s logic, it should not exist. The entries into Wikipedia are not made by professional scholars but rather by hundreds of thousands of amateur enthusiasts. Each Wikipedia editor volunteers time and expertise to update the database. They don’t get paid. They are, for the most part, anonymous. Wikipedia doesn’t sell advertisements. Why give away such troves of knowledge for free when it can be locked behind a paywall and available to only paid subscribers?

Elinor Ostrom would go on to show that communities—whether physical villages or online groups—can establish and enforce rules that can limit the benefits of a project to those who contributed to it. And the benefit to one’s reputation can be more valuable than cash. The contributors to Wikipedia or firms that reduce pollution may be acting quite logically. But it took the wisdom of Elinor Ostrom to bring that rational process to light.

“Humans are neither all angels nor all devils,” Ostrom said in a 2009 interview. “It is the context, and the institutional context, in which they find themselves that enables them to have . . . more willingness to use reciprocity, to trust one another, and to be in a situation that I trust you and you trust me and I won’t be a sucker.”[^22]

Like the audience watching an ancient Greek tragedy, we know how this story ends. Elinor Ostrom wins the 2009 Nobel Prize in Economics. What makes it interesting is the journey she took in reaching that destination. Unlike the stories of Oedipus, Ostrom was not destined to win the Nobel Prize. But now that we know how it ends, let’s show how she got there.  

## CHAPTER 2

## Los Angeles Groundwater

The biggest hit song in 1933, when Elinor Claire Awan was born on the outskirts of Beverly Hills, was Ethel Waters’s “Stormy Weather.” “Don’t know why, there’s no sun up in the sky,” Waters sang. “Keeps rainin’ all the time.” If only that were true in Southern California.

Beverly Hills, like the rest of the Los Angeles (LA) metropolitan area, was short on water. The region was recovering from a nine-year drought that had loosened its grip just two years before.[^1] The dry conditions exposed just how vulnerable the city was to water shortages. Decades earlier, the founders of LA knew that, without substantial supplies of water, the city was destined to remain “a torpid, suppurating, stunted little slum,” as Marc Reisner described it in his classic book _Cadillac Desert_.[^2] The region initially depended almost entirely on the Los Angeles River’s meager flow and groundwater for drinking, agriculture, and industry. These resources were insufficient for a city with dreams of rivaling San Francisco.

Southern California’s population increased as the Great Depression and Dust Bowl pushed people west seeking new opportunities. Some, like Elinor’s parents, sought employment in the growing movie business. Migrating midwestern farmers traded their wheat farms for oranges and other water-intensive crops. Southern California was, and still is, also home to a thriving oil industry. The city of El Segundo, for example, was named after the second of Standard Oil’s (now Chevron’s) refineries in the area. All of these required water—lots and lots of water.

The drought of the 1920s and early 1930s wasn’t the first time LA faced water shortages, nor would it be the last. A drought at the turn of the twentieth century prompted LA’s imperial quest to obtain—using some questionable methods—water from the Owens Valley. The resulting Los Angeles Aqueduct quenched the city’s thirst, but only temporarily. The region’s population kept growing, and the city’s water department, run by the ruthless yet visionary William Mulholland, had to keep up. The 1920s drought sent LA’s water engineers looking even farther afield, to the Colorado River. In January 1933, six months before Elinor was born, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California broke ground on an ambitious construction project: the Colorado River Aqueduct. The new aqueduct would deliver millions of gallons of water to the LA region.

These engineering marvels, however, were expensive to build, and the water agencies charged a hefty premium for river water. Groundwater, on the other hand, was cheap, clean, reliable, and abundant—for a while. Groundwater can be a renewable resource, but only if the pumping rate is less than the recharge rate. In the dry climate of coastal LA, groundwater recharges rather slowly. The region’s groundwater demand soon exceeded the natural recharge rate. The pumpers were, in effect, mining water. “Everyone was living off tens of thousands of years of accumulated groundwater,” Reisner wrote, “like a spendthrift heir squandering his wealth.”[^3]

This was especially true in the West Basin, a hydrological region that included part of LA and the coastal cities to its southwest. At the turn of the twentieth century, Manhattan Beach and other seaside communities were just small villages populated with a few hundred families. But in 1903, the Los Angeles Pacific Railway Company extended its trolley service to the coastal towns from Playa del Rey to Redondo Beach. Many were not even incorporated as cities until the trolley came to town. The transportation link to downtown LA set off a real estate boom.[^4] And as the population soared, the groundwater supply plummeted.

**Box 2.1 A California Water War**

Mark Twain almost certainly did not say (as many claim), “Whiskey is for drinking and water is for fighting over.” But Elinor Ostrom recognized that water scarcity has been the cause of violence in California and elsewhere. She referred to her husband’s book _Water and Politics_ for a true tale of a water war in the not-so-old West.

In his book, Vincent Ostrom told the story of how Los Angeles (LA) obtained—others say stole—the water from the Owens Valley. Los Angeles had its eye on Owens Valley water since 1890 or so. The Owens River lies 250 miles (400 kilometers) east of LA on the far side of the Sierra Nevada and near Death Valley. A prominent Angeleno named Fred Eaton believed that the Owens River could be the solution to LA’s water woes. Eaton, a water engineer and former mayor of LA, envisioned water flowing through an aqueduct across the desert, piercing through mountains in tunnels, and bringing life to his city. He shared his vision with William Mulholland, the Los Angeles City Water Department’s superintendent and one of the most powerful and vengeful people in the city.

The problem was that the people of the Owens Valley already owned the water. Under California law, water can be private property based on the doctrine of “prior appropriation.” School kids call it “dibs.” If a farmer has been using 100 acre-feet of water a year from a river, then the farmer has a right to keep using it in the future. If another farmer moves in upstream and starts using that river water too, the downstream farmer, who was there first, has “dibs,” or senior water rights. In wet years, there might be enough water for both farmers. In dry years, however, the new farmer with junior rights must let the water pass by her farm and let it flow to her neighbor with senior rights. These water rights can also be separated from the land and sold on a market.

Eaton conspired to bring Owens Valley water to LA and make a fortune doing it. Eaton bought more than 20,000 acres (8,100 hectares) of land—and the water rights associated with it—under the ruse that he was developing a cattle ranch. Instead, he turned the land over to the City of Los Angeles. Where water means economic development, the people of the Owens Valley saw their economic future flowing to LA. Without that water, there would be fewer farms in the Owens Valley, fewer hardware and feed stores, and fewer economic opportunities all around.

The city completed the aqueduct in 1913, but LA had even bigger plans. The city needed ever more water to keep up with its growth. The city sought to purchase more water rights and land for reservoirs in the Owens Valley, especially as droughts set in during the early 1920s. Many valley residents objected. Court battles ensued. Farmers opened ditch gates and let water flow intentionally, and uselessly, over their fields to spite the city. Tempers flared in the desert heat. Guns were drawn. And on May 21, 1924, near the town of Lone Pine, someone blew up the aqueduct.

Tensions and dry conditions continued through the summer and fall of 1924. Mulholland’s water department recommended “destroying all irrigation” in the valley in retaliation for the blast. But the water war in the Owens Valley raged on for another three years. Much property, and many careers, were destroyed. Thankfully no lives were lost.

If this sounds familiar, the general story was fictionalized in the script for the 1974 noir classic _Chinatown_. The true story is also vividly retold in Reisner’s _Cadillac Desert_ and Steven Erie and Harold Brackman’s _Beyond Chinatown_.

Here at the edge of the continent, the ocean water does not stop at the beach. The salty ocean water extends into the porous rocks even several miles from shore. The fresh groundwater floats above the saltwater the way Guinness floats above an ale in a “black and tan”—because the freshwater and Guinness are less dense. As long as they are relatively undisturbed, the fresh and salty layers of groundwater won’t mix.

The freshwater layer grew thinner and thinner as pumpers tried to meet the new residential and industrial development. That allowed the seawater to advance inland, like a wedge, and start mixing with the freshwater above. Even small amounts of saltwater intrusion can render the fresh groundwater undrinkable and unsuitable for agriculture and industrial processes. Without freshwater, the California dream would become a nightmare.

As the coastal cities kept pumping the fresh groundwater, the seawater stealthily crept further and further into the West Basin. Redondo Beach first sounded the saltwater intrusion alarm in 1912, followed by its neighbor Hermosa Beach in 1915 and El Segundo in 1921.[^5] The municipal water supply agencies across the West Basin all drew from the same groundwater aquifer, like friends using multiple straws to share a single milkshake. The friends might not know who is drinking the most, but they can see the milkshake quickly disappearing. Each friend has an incentive to drink more before it’s all gone.

Ostrom later described the situation as an age-old dilemma. “The ancient creed of the robber baron to take what you can get and keep what you can became the basic rule for proprietors using ground water supplies.”[^6]

And so, the water agencies and industries kept pumping. By 1930 there wasn’t a functioning freshwater well within a half mile of the Pacific coast. In some places, the saltwater wedge extended inland almost a mile. When Elinor was born in 1933, billions of gallons of briny seawater flowed into the aquifer each year.[^7] Even the Central Basin communities, including Elinor’s hometown of Beverley Hills, grew concerned. The Central Basin is hydrologically connected to the West Basin, so saltwater could intrude under the whole LA region. By the time Elinor was in elementary school in the early 1940s, the grass at some West Basin parks and schools was dying. The irrigation water, pumped from underground, was contaminated with seawater.[^8]

Until the grass died or some other obvious calamity happened, nobody knew exactly how much fresh groundwater was in the West Basin or how much everyone was pumping. There were signs, however, that the rate of pumping was unsustainable. Individual well owners might have noticed the dropping water levels in their wells. It wasn’t until 1945 that the first report conclusively showed that more water was being withdrawn from the West Basin than was naturally replenished.[^9]

The water pumpers finally admitted to themselves that their “robber baron” approach to water management wasn’t sustainable. No individual pumper had an incentive to slow down if the others kept pumping with abandon. Working together and coordinating their withdrawals was the only logical choice. The question, however, was how to do it.

![[logo.png]]

“Increasing salt water intrusion in a ground water basin was the stimulus which evoked the efforts of entrepreneurs [to] seek public solutions to their common problem,” Ostrom wrote in 1965.[^10] These words began her doctoral dissertation and hinted at the work she would continue her entire life. Forty years later she reflected, “I was studying the commons from the beginning, but I didn’t know it.”[^11]

Ostrom framed her dissertation research as an investigation of “public entrepreneurship.” In business, entrepreneurs are celebrated for innovating new products or processes. But political scientists, at that time, mostly took the government as a given. They usually didn’t consider that mayors, council members, or agency heads could also innovate and find solutions to public problems. Public entrepreneurs have less freedom than those in the private sector because public entrepreneurs are constrained by various laws and the political process. Nevertheless, public entrepreneurs may exhibit surprising creativity in finding solutions that promote the public good. This idea of public entrepreneurship intrigued Vincent Ostrom, at that time a professor at the University of California–Los Angeles (UCLA). It also piqued the curiosity of his students, including Elinor (who was now going by the nickname Lin).

Elinor Ostrom wrote that political scientists assumed individual firms, in this case water pumpers, were “the appropriate unit for solving water supply problems.” These individual agencies viewed each other as competitors for a limited, and dwindling, groundwater resource. You don’t share critical information with your competitors. So, rather than share information about the groundwater resources’ condition, the water agencies kept mum and kept pumping. Ostrom noted, “In this environment of legal uncertainty, attorneys often advised water producers to pump as much as they needed and to defend later. The pumping race was on.”[^12] The “robber baron” strategy might have been legally sound, but it would destroy the critical groundwater resource.

The conventional strategies dealing with decreasing groundwater supplies focused on individual water agencies and competition. When a conflict emerged, they either competed in the economic game (as Ostrom called it) or competed in the courtroom. In the economic game, agencies tried to secure marketable water rights. But this strategy was potentially risky. Under California’s “prior appropriation” doctrine, water rights that went unused could be usurped by other users. In other words, it’s a “use it or lose it” law. So, it was difficult for agencies to secure water rights in anticipation of increased demand in the future. The other strategy—competing in the courts—was also risky. Judges were likely to issue “all or nothing” rulings—a risky gamble. Agencies did not want to risk losing all of their water rights.

But what if the individual firm was not “the appropriate unit for solving water supply problems”? President Dwight Eisenhower said, “Whenever I run into a problem I can’t solve, I always make it bigger. I can never solve it by trying to make it smaller, but if I make it big enough, I can begin to see the outlines of a solution.”[^13] Maybe the solution lay in changing the perspective to something bigger than the individual water agency.

No individual water agency could solve the overpumping problem alone. Ostrom observed that West Basin water producers themselves knew that cooperation, not competition, was the way to manage the groundwater resource. Enter the public entrepreneurs. Creative water managers sought ways of organizing on a bigger scale. By recognizing it as a basin-wide problem instead of an individual pumper’s problem—by making the problem bigger—maybe they could sustain the groundwater resource. So, in 1946, as suburban lawns were dying from being irrigated with salty water, the agencies banded together to form the West Basin Water Association (WBWA).

The WBWA focused on reining in the uncontrolled competition for groundwater in the region. Members of the WBWA could have candid conversations about mutual problems, share information, and study the shared groundwater resource. Conversations held over coffee helped build trust and a sense of community.

The WBWA also enabled the water agencies to avoid the “all or nothing” court decisions. A court may decide what is the reasonable rate of groundwater pumping in the basin, but it could allow the WBWA to allocate the water rights proportionately among its members.[^14] The community of water users themselves could decide the rules on who gets the water rather than having the court impose the rules on them.

California laws are particularly favorable to public entrepreneurs. “Since the political structure is highly conducive to the free entry of communities of water producers and users who wish to coordinate their efforts through the use of public powers,” Ostrom wrote, “a relatively competitive public enterprises system has developed in California.”[^15] This is the essence of public entrepreneurship. The laws allow public agencies, like those in the West Basin, to organize into associations and districts to solve problems at regional scales that individual units would be unable to solve.

The water pumpers knew they had to cut back on groundwater use. But the residents, factories, and farms still needed water. The pumpers would be reluctant to implement the cuts until they secured alternative water supplies. The water agencies had rejected previous opportunities to join the Metropolitan Water District (known as the MET) and obtain Colorado River water. But by 1947, the situation had changed. In another example of public entrepreneurship, the West Basin cities created an entity called the West Basin Municipal Water District, distinct from the WBWA. The West Basin Municipal Water District enabled the municipal water supply agencies to act as a single unit, join the MET together, and obtain water from the Colorado River. The district became the re-wholesaler of the MET’s Colorado River water to the West Basin communities. The district also represented the interests of the West Basin water users on the MET’s board of directors. The aqueduct carried the first gallons of Colorado River water to the West Basin in 1949, when Lin was sixteen years old.[^16]

With the supply of Colorado River water secured, the WBWA turned its attention back to reducing the overconsumption of groundwater. An investigation, prompted by a lawsuit several years earlier, found that the West Basin’s water producers pumped about three times more than the aquifer’s sustainable yield. The technical report recommended cutting production back to that sustainable yield, but the large water producers opposed such drastic cuts. Most of the West Basin water producers entered a voluntary agreement in which they would cut water production by 25 percent. Although weaker than the technical report’s recommendations, the cut was a step in the right direction. The agreement also set up an exchange pool in which water producers that cut back more than 25 percent could sell their excess gallons to other producers. By the time Ostrom finished her dissertation in 1965, the water producers had cut their withdrawals by about 30 percent, a modest success.

Despite the cuts in production, groundwater withdrawals were still about twice the sustainable yield. That left communities, especially those closest to the coast, vulnerable to seawater intrusion. The WBWA determined that a freshwater barrier would be the best option. Beginning with a pilot-scale test in the early 1950s, engineers injected freshwater from the surface back into the ground through wells near the coast. This freshwater injection formed a barrier, almost like a curtain, between the ocean and the groundwater used for drinking and industrial production.

The seawater barrier passed the technical test, but it was an expensive solution. The WBWA faced a number of questions about it. Who would pay for the full-scale barrier—property owners or water users? And how would the WBWA collect money? It had no legal power to collect taxes or fees for such a project. The public entrepreneurs once again found a creative solution. Local advocates convinced the California state government to pass legislation that enabled the WBWA and other emerging groundwater districts to collect and administer money for groundwater projects. In order to collect revenue for the barrier, the West Basin and neighboring Central Basin collaborated to form the Central and West Basin Water Replenishment District. This new entity levied a “pump tax” on each gallon of groundwater withdrawn. The district used the money to buy freshwater for the seawater barrier and to replenish the groundwater resource. Levying the pump tax meant the district collected critical information about how much each well was pumping and about the groundwater levels across the region. This degree of widespread and timely monitoring was critical to sustaining the resource.

**Box 2.2 Recycling Water to Hold Back the Ocean**

Marc Quijano has a bit in common with the “Hero of Haarlem”—the fictional little boy who saved the Dutch town by putting his finger in the leaky dike. As the production manager at the Edward C. Little Water Recycling Facility, Quijano works daily to hold back the Pacific Ocean. But instead of a finger in a dike, Quijano and his colleagues pump recycled water into the ground to stop the salty seawater from intruding into the West Basin’s aquifer.

The state-of-the-art facility is just the latest front in a seventy-year-old battle against the Pacific Ocean. Since the 1950s, area water managers have injected freshwater underground as a barrier against the sea. Usually this was Colorado River water purchased from the Metropolitan Water District. The facility where Quijano works, however, takes the process a step further. Water that was once used by households and sent down the drain is cleaned to the highest standards and then is injected back into the ground—in other words, recycled. When these water recycling systems were proposed decades ago, opponents “called it ‘Toilet to Tap,’” said Quijano with a tone of bemusement. “People never got over the ‘yuck’ factor.” This facility produces five grades of recycled water. Only the highest grade, which gets the “Cadillac treatment” Quijano reassured, is injected into the ground. “It’s cleaner than bottled water,” he said. Visitors to the facility can even drink a sample of the recycled water from a faucet on site. (I did. It’s good!) The other grades are used for industrial applications. The on-site lab constantly tests the water to ensure that it meets health standards. Quijano estimated that it would take a couple of decades for the recycled water to move underground from the injection site to someone’s well. The first gallons of recycled water injected in the mid-1990s would just be making their way to pumping facilities in the 2020s. The recycled water is a critical resource for the West Basin’s never-ending struggle against the sea.

By the early 1960s, a complex network of institutions managed the West Basin’s water resources. Some focused on delivering freshwater while others managed floods and water pollution. Whatever problem a resident faced and whatever the scale, there was some kind of association, board, or district that could handle it. And if there wasn’t, the public entrepreneurs would get together and create one if needed.

Such a messy array of agencies ran counter to the theories of the era’s political scientists. Administrative efficiency was in vogue and that called for streamlining, not complexity. But the success of the water management agencies showed that a one-size-fits-all approach to efficiency does not always work. Sometimes what looks like a bureaucratic mess is actually creative problem solving.

After graduating from Beverly Hills High School, Lin dreamt of college. Her parents, now divorced, could not contribute financially to her college tuition. Nevertheless, she persisted. Lin paid her own way at the local college working various odd jobs including, as a senior, grading freshman economic papers. That local college happened to be UCLA, one of the finest public universities in the country. She majored in political science, and Lin was an academic force to be reckoned with. She graduated in 1954—in three years and with honors.[^17]

The career world of the 1950s offered few opportunities for college-educated women. By the time Lin graduated, her course was charted. Lin married Charles (Chuck) Scott over the winter break of her final year. After graduation they moved east to Boston, where Chuck enrolled in law school. Lin put her husband through school by working at a manufacturing firm. She was the first woman the firm ever hired for nonsecretarial work.[^18] But Lin was not cut out for the life of a corporate lawyer’s wife. She dreaded hosting parties with all the husbands in one room and wives whisked off to another. Lin ached to return to school for a graduate degree. Chuck, however, disapproved.[^19] In 1957, Lin and Chuck returned to California—and separated amicably.

Lin’s hope was to complete a graduate degree in economics at UCLA. But those hopes were dashed. Academic advisors, in those days, discouraged women from taking math courses. And without the prerequisite math courses, a graduate degree in economics was impossible. Unless a woman had perfect foresight and the will to override her guidance counselors and advisors—or a time machine—an economics department simply wouldn’t accept her. Lin was rejected even though, as an undergraduate, she was skilled enough to be hired to grade freshman economics papers.

Maybe she consoled herself with the Groucho Marx line, “I wouldn’t want to join a club that would accept me as a member.” Fifty years later, there was a certain irony to this situation.

The Political Science Department didn’t want her either. “There was a huge controversy in the faculty because they hadn’t had a woman faculty member or graduate student for multiple decades,” Lin later reflected. The department relented to the administrators’ pressure and admitted a cohort of four women, including Lin. “People wondered why that committee let four of us in. They thought it would hurt the reputation of the department.”[^20]

Lin enrolled in a political science seminar taught by Vincent Ostrom. Her research assignment: study “how water producers were coping with or ignoring overdrafts” in the West Basin.[^21] Who could have guessed that this assignment would lead to a five-decade marriage and a Nobel Prize.

![[logo.png]]

Lin and Vincent married in 1963. The newlyweds, twenty-nine and forty-three, considered leaving UCLA for professional and personal reasons. Although UCLA had been Vincent’s academic home for many years, he felt unsupported and underappreciated by his department’s leadership. Also, UCLA had an antinepotism rule that would have prohibited Lin from being hired for any job at the university. Although she was still a doctoral student, there would be no path to a faculty job as long as the couple stayed at UCLA. So, when Indiana University offered Vincent a job, they were eager to make the move to Bloomington. Indiana University had no such employment prohibition for Lin. Vincent and Lin could, potentially, have a fruitful academic partnership there.

Ostrom continued her doctoral work as a UCLA graduate student but was physically in Indiana. And she continued her study of LA’s municipal water systems. Ostrom framed the study as one of municipal governance, not of natural resources: that she was studying groundwater was incidental. Garrett Hardin’s “Tragedy of the Commons” would not be published until 1968. The study of natural resource commons was far from the frontier of academic research.

As she finished her doctoral dissertation in 1965, Ostrom took a series of temporary and administrative jobs at Indiana University before being hired as a professor. When she turned her attention back to research in the early 1970s, she returned to questions of municipal governance. This time, Ostrom tackled the subject of police departments. Municipal policing, like groundwater management, was an interdisciplinary topic. It did not fit neatly into the rigid structure of Indiana University’s Department of Government. Vincent’s work was also highly interdisciplinary. The challenges Vincent faced at UCLA were revisiting them in Bloomington.

Rather than leave, they decided to stay at Indiana University. But they needed to create a haven for themselves and other like-minded faculty and students, in and outside the Department of Government. In 1973, Vincent and Lin founded the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis. They named it a “workshop” intentionally. As an apprentice learns woodworking from a master craftsman, so would students learn from masters in the many facets of governance. They could develop this community of scholars largely outside the university’s departmental structure. Indiana University had rules about “research centers” but none for something called a “workshop.”

Through the next decade, Ostrom continued her research on municipal policing and other city services. The conventional wisdom was that a highly centralized, bureaucratic hierarchy was the best, most efficient way to organize government services. But some of Vincent’s earlier work and Lin’s study of groundwater management suggested something different. And Lin’s study of police departments confirmed it. There were certain advantages to having a decentralized organization. Vincent called this decentralized approach “polycentricity”—to have many centers of decision-making power. There were many “institutional arrangements” that could successfully produce government services, not just one. These ideas of polycentricity and governing institutions would inform Lin’s research for the next forty years.

![[logo.png]]

“What’s a political scientist like you doing in a research project like this?”[^22] Bill Blomquist saw the puzzled looks on the faces of his fellow graduate students and imagined they were silently asking this question. Most political scientists study topics like elections and political revolutions. Here was Blomquist studying groundwater. Los Angeles groundwater. At a school in Indiana. No wonder he got some quizzical looks.

It was 1982 and Ostrom had just returned from a sabbatical in Germany. There, she gave a seminar on organizational learning. She used her own work on the WBWA as an example of how organizations, like the water agencies, learned how to collaborate, develop rules, and sustain the groundwater resource. But that research was almost twenty years old. An audience member asked if the water agreements were still working. Ostrom didn’t know the answer.

That question must have nagged at her, and she could not leave it unanswered. But Ostrom was starting a new position as chair of the Department of Political Science. She needed help. As luck would have it, new graduate student Bill Blomquist was assigned to be Ostrom’s research assistant. “I had no background in water,” Blomquist, now a professor at Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis, later recalled. He was a midwesterner from Ohio and, frankly, a bit skeptical about the water basin project. Ostrom had done a lot of archival research and interviews for her dissertation. Twenty years later, however, things had changed. People had retired, offices had been moved. There was no internet in 1982, so it wasn’t easy tracking down people. Blomquist spent a lot of time on the phone asking, “What’s been going on?”

Blomquist returned not only to the West Basin but also explored other groundwater basins around LA. During the intervening years, the West Basin water producers continued their public entrepreneurship. They created new institutions as needed to resolve emerging issues. Agencies, however, sometimes disagreed and contested each other in court. Some seawater had intruded into the basin and done lasting damage. But by the 1980s, the agencies had stabilized the groundwater resource. The Department of Water Resources no longer listed the West Basin as critically overdrafted.[^23] The neighboring basins came to similar resolutions. Ostrom could finally answer the question her colleague asked her in Germany. Yes, the agreements still worked.

Blomquist, working with fellow graduate students Edella Schlager and Shui Yan Tang, came to regard the questions around groundwater management in LA as touching on central questions in political science. They and Ostrom studied why some institutions succeed and others fail, why some groups can act collectively to solve a problem whereas others can’t. The issues were bigger than LA groundwater management. They were the same issues his fellow graduate students were grappling with when they studied the failure of the Articles of Confederation or the success of certain interest groups on Capitol Hill. That’s why Blomquist, a political scientist, was doing a research project on groundwater management agencies.

Ostrom finished her dissertation in the early 1960s, before Garrett Hardin wrote “The Tragedy of the Commons,” but by the time Blomquist studied the issue, the phrase had already become commonplace. Blomquist and Ostrom revisited the water basins of Southern California in a new academic context. In the 1980s, the commons were a respectable subject of study, if not a hot topic.[^24] Blomquist directly addressed the “tragedy” metaphor and described its limitations. “The prognosis of doom for the commons has produced two prescriptions,” he wrote, “central government management and privatization.” He took it a step further and countered Hardin’s argument with an alternative approach: the commons “as a form of organization of the use of a resource.” Instead of viewing a commons as a flaw, some kind of market failure, Blomquist conceived the commons as an intentional form of governance with its own rules of access and use. “Resource users themselves may devise well-fitted rules systems for use of the commons.”[^25]

Blomquist and Ostrom, and their colleagues, were entering uncharted territory. The typical theories and metaphors—the prisoner’s dilemma, the tragedy of the commons—could not account for what they observed in the water basins around LA. They needed a new framework for explaining what was happening in the commons.

Financier Warren Buffett once told his investors, “You only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out.”[^26] It’s easy to take risks when times are good. But when the inevitable crisis hits, those risk takers may be embarrassingly exposed.

Building a city in the near desert is a risky venture. Los Angeles requires a constant source of water. And for most of the twentieth century, LA was able to reverse the flow of rivers and bring the waters of the Sierra Nevada and Rockies to it. As the saying goes, “Water flows uphill toward money.” Marcia Hale, a scholar of environmental justice at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, called this era “the piped city.”[^27] As long as it snowed in the Sierra Nevada and Rocky Mountains, LA would have plenty of water flowing through its pipes.

But what happens when the water stops flowing? The West’s climate is changing and becoming dryer. California suffered drought conditions for 367 consecutive weeks spanning 2011 to 2019.[^28] Los Angeles was able to survive the drought by shifting its outlook. Earlier droughts, like the 1920s, sent LA looking for more and more water. But beginning in the 1990s, LA water managers turned toward reducing demand. Southern California uses about the same about of water now as it did decades ago, despite adding millions of new residents. Water conservation was the key. Hale called this a shift to the “self-reliant city.”[^29] So, when the drought hit in 2011, residents were already familiar with ways to reduce their water use. The days of searching far and wide for new sources were over. Los Angeles would need to live and thrive with the resources it had, even in a drought.

**Box 2.3 Surfer Etiquette**

The West Basin extends to the Santa Monica Bay where the smokestacks of Chevron’s oil refinery rise above surfers of El Porto and Manhattan Beach. “Every day we have local surfers and world traveler surfers,” Angel Morales, who works at the El Porto Surf Shop, told me. “They just stop by from LAX and come by here and just get into the ocean for a bit and go. This is a really good area to surf for students, travelers, and locals also.” The surf can get pretty crowded, especially in the summer. Only a few surfers can ride a wave at any one time, and it is important to stay out of each other’s way. On the other hand, beaches are public, and there is no official way to limit the number of surfers. The surf, in other words, is a common-pool resource. And surfers have figured out ways to keep the waves enjoyable for everyone.

In the old days there was much more of an attitude of “locals only,” according to one experienced surfer in Manhattan Beach who talked to me at the shore. If someone from out of town tried to surf a local beach “they’d give you the stink eye” and make it known you weren’t welcome. Today, everyone is welcome to surf the beaches in Santa Monica Bay as long as they obey the unwritten rules. “Never drop in on someone. Don’t do a paddle around,” said the Manhattan Beach surfer. New surfers should stay off to the side, out of the way of experienced surfers. It’s basic surfer etiquette. A rogue surfer who cuts people off not only ruins the experience for others, it also puts them in danger of getting hurt or even drowning. And if someone’s not following the rules? “I yell at people,” said the experienced surfer.

Surfer etiquette largely conforms with Ostrom’s design principles—boundaries, rule making, monitoring, and graduated sanctions. They may differ from beach to beach and season to season, but they keep the waves a sustainable surfing resource.

During the drought’s peak in 2014, the temptation to overuse the West Basin groundwater must have been tremendous. In other parts of Southern California, people, even celebrities, were busted for watering their lawns with black market water trucks.[^30] But the water pumpers of the West Basin kept their water use under the court-imposed limit. In fact, the water users even reduced the amount of water they pumped as the drought raged on. By the time the drought ended in 2019, the total amount pumped was about 27,000 acre-feet, down from 45,000 acre-feet in 2012.[^31] That’s even less than the 30,000 acre-feet that the expert report deemed a “safe yield” in 1952.

The WBWA’s collaborative approach to problem solving seems to have worked. When the water disappeared during the drought, the water pumpers were not caught without swimsuits. They were able to adapt to the changing conditions, enforce the rules themselves, and sustain the groundwater commons.  

## CHAPTER 3

## Maine’s Lobster Gangs

A “trap war” broke out in the summer of 2016 among the lobster harvesters of Maine’s Blue Hill Bay.[^1] The bay was a popular fishing spot, but it was increasingly congested. Lobster harvesters from one side of the bay were setting traps on the other side. The locals did not welcome the new competition.

Lobster traps connect to one another by a line, like beads on a necklace. A color-coded buoy marks their location. If harvesters are not careful, their trap lines can cross each other like a jumble of beaded necklaces on the ocean floor. Pulling up one trap line may drag several others along. If the lines get sufficiently tangled, harvesters may cut their lines, as well as any other tangled trap lines from competing harvesters, and abandon their traps. Tangled trap lines make for unhappy lobster harvesters.

That was the situation the lobster harvesters of Blue Hill Bay found themselves in that summer. One harvester described the situation in Blue Hill Bay as “a total cluster.” He continued, “A lot more [traps] are coming into our area and that’s where the conflict is. Everybody’s dead set and ready to go to war. It’s too bad, but that’s how it is.”[^2]

An unknown group of lobster harvesters started cutting away the buoys from competing trap lines. Without a buoy, the lobster traps are lost. The victims retaliated. By Halloween, the tit-for-tat buoy cutting resulted in more than $350,000 in lost fishing gear. Colonel Jon Cornish, the head of the Maine Department of Marine Resources law enforcement division, said, “This trap war is without a doubt the most costly loss of gear I have witnessed in my 32-year career with the Maine Marine Patrol.”[^3]

Lobsters, like LA’s groundwater, can be depleted if harvested too intensively. And like LA’s groundwater managers, lobster harvesters organized themselves to protect their resource. These “lobster gangs” or “harbor gangs” developed informal, unwritten rules about who can set lobster traps and where they can set them. And the lobster gangs enforce these rules when they are broken. Sure, there are state laws regulating the lobster catch as well as federal laws that apply further offshore. But the state and federal laws do not tell the whole story.

Between private property and state control lies a broad range of civil society institutions that govern how common-pool resources are managed. That is what Hardin missed. And this is where Ostrom found her niche.

What do these civil society institutions look like? Some are highly organized groups closely affiliated with a government. Others are truly grassroot efforts completely organized by local resource users. Maine’s harbor gangs are more like the latter.

For most of the twentieth century, most resource managers, from lobsters to forests, focused on the biological aspect of the resource—how many tons of lobsters were harvested, or how fast the trees were growing. They tended to overlook the importance of the social setting. However, managing lobster harvests, or any common-pool resource, is really about managing people.

Ostrom’s collaborations with anthropologists and other social scientists revealed to her a vast array of approaches for managing natural resource commons. These collaborations would set the stage for her groundbreaking work, _Governing the Commons_, and eventually, a Nobel Prize.

![[logo.png]]

The early 1980s proved to be a turning point in Ostrom’s career. It had been fifteen years since she finished her doctoral research on LA’s groundwater management. She approached the groundwater problem as one of governing institutions, not natural resources. In the intervening years, she applied her skills to other questions of governance. Most of her work was studying how police departments and other municipal services might most effectively be organized.[^4] She was settled in Indiana and was, both physically and intellectually, far from LA.

In 1981, she and Vincent took a sabbatical trip to the University of Bielefeld in Germany. A fellow visitor to the university, Paul Sabatier, asked Ostrom to share her ideas about how organizations can learn. She used an example from her dissertation: the groundwater managers of LA. The managers had developed, through trial and error, a set of rules to sustain the groundwater resource.

“Paul then wanted to know why I was so confident that the systems I had studied 15 years earlier were still operating and performing well,” Ostrom later wrote.[^5] The truth was, she had no idea.

Ostrom returned to Indiana and got to work answering that question. Were these rules still being implemented, nearly two decades later? She recruited graduate student William Blomquist to investigate. To their relief, the rules held up, and the groundwater continued to be managed sustainably.

This fateful question came at an opportune time for Ostrom. Her sabbatical to Germany was a natural transition time. Before leaving, she had finished many of the municipal policing projects. Her students had graduated or would soon. It was a good time to take her research in a slightly different direction.

By this time, Ostrom was well versed in the language of the commons. She understood Garrett Hardin’s “tragedy of the commons” metaphor and engaged in correspondence with him over many years.[^6] She and Vincent wrote an influential paper that placed common-pool resources within a broader framework of public and private goods.[^7] So when she revisited the groundwater basins of LA, she studied them through the lens of a commons.

“I was studying the commons from the beginning, but I didn’t know it,” she later said in an interview.[^8]

The Ostroms’ Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis (Workshop) focused on political _theory_—a big idea that can explain various situations. Ostrom wanted to develop a theory of governance that could explain not only the institutions that manage groundwater in California but all kinds of commons. To do that, she would need more examples of successful, and unsuccessful, management of natural resource commons.

As luck would have it, a former student invited Ostrom to participate in a “Panel on Common Property Resources” convened by the National Academy of Sciences.[^9] Around that same time, a group of anthropologists were writing a book about the social dimensions of common-pool resources. The editors, Bonnie McCay and Jim Acheson, invited Ostrom to contribute a chapter.[^10]

“We weren’t only interested in resource management. We were interested in how groups of people generate rules to manage resources,” Acheson told me in an interview. Ostrom “was very much interested how rules and norms came about. I was, too. She influenced me a great deal. A great deal.”

Ostrom herself recognized the significance of this turn of events. “Our invitation,” McCay recalled in a conversation with me, “gave her the impetus to further develop the case study comparative method she used.”

These studies of the commons were like jigsaw puzzles. Each researcher was working on their own puzzle—Maine lobsters, Botswanan cattle pastures, Amazonian lakes—but nobody had stepped back to see if the individual puzzles fit together to create a grand picture. Maybe they did fit together, maybe they didn’t. But Ostrom was determined to find out.

Ostrom established long-running collaborations with many of the researchers she met during this time, the anthropologist Jim Acheson among them. His work on Maine’s lobster harvesters showed that cooperation among users of natural resource commons was not limited to groundwater in LA. The lobster harvesters had their own methods of sustaining the commons by setting and enforcing rules. Usually these worked well. But every once in a while, the rules would cease to hold and a trap war would break out, as happened in Blue Hill Bay.

![[logo.png]]

Jim Acheson had one regret about his book, _The Lobster Gangs of Maine_: its title.[^11] Many people misunderstood it and sensationalized the “gangs.”[^12] Acheson noted, “It calls to mind criminal activity, and people seem to like that a great deal. I’m sorry I called it that now because it really has given the industry the wrong name, really. They’re not a bunch of crooks. They really are not.” He explained that, in Maine, the term “gang” means group. One might refer to lobster harvesters from Monhegan as the “Monhegan gang,” or a batch of traps as a “gang of traps.” Acheson said to me, “In the rest of the country, gang means criminal conspiracy and that isn’t what I meant, but that’s the way it was taken. So, I’m a little sorry I called it that.”

Acheson noted the irony of his choice of titles. “It certainly sells with ‘lobster gangs’ on it, I’ll tell you that,” he said. His most recent book, _Capturing the Commons,_ is more technical but isn’t selling as well.[^13] “I wish I’d called it _Lobster Law_. That would’ve sold a lot better.”

Maine’s lobster laws are critical to sustaining the harvest. These include both minimum and maximum sizes. When a harvester catches an egg-bearing female lobster, he must cut a V-shaped notch in one of the tail fins and then throw her back. This lets other harvesters know that she is reproductively active and should be let go, even if she doesn’t have visible eggs. But Maine employs only about fifty Marine Patrol officers to cover the entire coastline.[^14] The chances of getting caught with a short lobster or an egg-bearing female are pretty low. How can these laws really be enforced out on the water?

The secret lies with the harbor gangs—small groups of harvesters working in the same harbor or cove over years, even across generations. These groups have developed informal rules and expectations of behavior that are strictly enforced. These rules and their enforcement intrigued Acheson, and in turn, Ostrom.

Acheson started his career with the federal government as the first anthropologist hired by the National Marine Fisheries Service. It wasn’t easy being a social scientist in an agency full of biologists. When Acheson’s boss introduced him to his fellow agency employees, they greeted him skeptically.

“For once, the right words came to me,” Acheson recalled. He told them, “You’re interested in fisheries management, the management of resources. You’re not managing fish and frogs. You’re managing people . . . I know something about people, culture, and social systems. That’s why I’m here.”

These might have been the right words, but they didn’t win over his new colleagues. “They didn’t like that,” he admitted.

Acheson, a Maine native, became increasingly interested in the social dimensions of Maine’s lobstering communities—an interest sparked by two disturbing incidents.

A relative told Acheson about a tragic event in southern Maine many decades ago. Three friends went out one night after work. The trio decided to pull up a bunch of lobster traps that did not belong to them. Acheson said, “They had a big lobster feed at one of the offshore islands, and they never came back.” The authorities found their boat smashed in two. The authorities also recovered two bodies, but one was never found. “I got interested in this, wondering what in hell was going on,” explained Acheson. “I talked to one guy in the fishing industry, and he said, ‘Those people were just taking food out of our mouths.’”

The second event happened when Acheson, as a young man, went lobstering with a friend. His friend put out more than two hundred lobster traps the day before. Acheson and his friend returned to the area to find someone had cut the buoys from the traps. Now there was no way to find the traps. A major investment was lost. “Virtually all of them disappeared overnight,” Acheson said. “I was on the boat when he discovered how many of his traps had gone, and that spurred my interest. I’m afraid my interest was spurred by not very good incidents, but they were interesting.”

Acheson’s buddy and the trio in southern Maine had run afoul of harbor gangs. Each harbor along Maine’s coast is the self-declared territory of the local group of lobster harvesters. If you want to start lobstering in a given harbor, you’ll need a license from the state. But a state license is not enough.

“In order to actually go lobstering,” Acheson said, “what you need is acceptance by a particular group of people fishing out of the harbor.”

Curt Brown fishes out of Cape Elizabeth, just south of Portland. To harvesters like Brown, these harbor gangs and their rules are second nature. Brown grew up hanging out at his grandparents’ waterfront home. He told me it’s where he learned to swim, to drive a boat, to haul a trap, and to respect other harvesters’ territory:

When you grow up in this industry as a lot of people do from a very young age, it’s just all you know. That’s what you do, you follow these rules, you haul your traps, you throw back the majority of what you catch because those are the rules that are in place. . . . That’s what you’re taught from your community. When I entered the fishery, these rules have been in place for a long, long time. . . . It’s no different than going to school and learning math. My education out on the water was, this is how you do things. If you don’t do things this way, you’re not going to last very long as a harvester. 

Unlike big commercial fishing trawlers, lobstering is a local activity practiced by people in small, tight-knit communities within particular harbors. The highly local nature of lobstering turns out to be one of the keys to its sustainability. It is also where Jim Acheson’s anthropological work intersected with that of Elinor Ostrom. Together, and with other collaborators, they helped explain the importance of these communities when it comes to sustaining a common-pool resource.

Lobster harvesters by and large comply with the state’s laws and the harbor gang’s informal rules. They comply because they know that conservation is in the long-term interest of the industry. They also perceive that most other harvesters are also complying. Lobstering has some unique qualities that make it easy to know if others are complying with the rules. All lobster harvesters have their own color code for their buoys. In these tight-knit communities, everyone knows each other’s colors. So, it is pretty obvious if someone new is fishing in the harbor or is setting traps in your favorite spot. When harvesters catch a lobster that already has the V-notch in the tail fin (indicating that it is an egg-bearing female), they know that other harvesters are following the rules.

If you want anonymity, move to the big city. In coastal Maine’s small towns, everyone knows each other’s business. If word gets out that a lobster harvester is violating the rules, people will talk and there will be consequences. For example, Acheson found that in some lobstering communities “gossip, slander, and ostracism are usually quite successful in forcing people into line with the expectations of the community.”[^15]

To Curt Brown, the damage to his reputation for breaking the rules, such as taking an undersized lobster, would be worse than any fine from the State of Maine:

You lose that reputation amongst your peers and it’s very, very difficult to get it back. Everybody works their entire career as a harvester to build up that reputation. I remember being a kid and just dying to be able to go out on someone’s boat as a stern man to show them what I could do in terms of my work ethic. It would be my worst nightmare if I was caught with 15 or 20 undersized lobsters and all those individuals that I looked up to as kids, I knew they would be reading that in the local publication and seeing my name right next to that violation. That alone is enough to keep me from doing it.

Taking short lobsters might get you snubbed at the local store, but putting traps in someone’s customary spot or tangling trap lines will result in escalating penalties. The first time it happens could be an honest mistake and might result in a note inside a bottle left in a trap. Additional or more serious infractions might result in stiffer penalties, like cutting a buoy. A harvester from Portland told me, “One of the meaner things is what we call a ‘hip boot hurricane,’ where you haul the guy’s traps aboard the boat and jump on them and throw them overboard.” Imagine a harvester’s surprise when, instead of hauling up the catch of the day, he’s pulling up traps that are flat as a pancake. That is a clear message to find a new place to set the traps.

To be clear, destroying property like a lobster trap or buoy is illegal. Thankfully, violent means for penalizing rule breakers is much less common today than in earlier decades. Reporting (sometimes anonymously) to Marine Patrol or a local harbor master the violation of conservation laws or property destruction has also become more common and somewhat more socially acceptable.

The stories of territorial fights and penalizing rule breakers are dramatic and sensational but also rather rare. Destroying gear is illegal. Those found guilty of such crimes can lose their licenses for a season or even receive a prison sentence. In many coastal communities, lobstering is the main industry. Losing a license means losing one’s entire annual income. Choosing when and how to enforce the formal and informal rules comes with both benefits and costs. Social scientists have tools to analyze when it pays to violate or enforce the unwritten rules.

The German sabbatical the Ostroms took in 1981 was an education. They not only learned to speak German but also learned the language of game theory. Ostrom, a lifelong learner, studied game theory from Reinhard Selten, an economics professor at the University of Bielefeld.[^16] Selten would be awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1994 for his research on game theory. He shared the prize with John Harsanyi and John Nash (of _A Beautiful Mind_ fame).[^17]

One of the classic “games” is the prisoner’s dilemma. The setup involves two crooks who are apprehended. The police separate and interrogate them. With no witnesses and little evidence, the police try to get the crooks to confess. If both crooks stay silent, they’ll both go free. If one confesses and rats out the other, then the “rat’s” charges will be dropped and the other gets a long sentence. In this setup, it is rational for the crook to rat out the partner in crime. However, if both crooks rat out each other, they both go to prison for a long time. What is the best choice for the individual crook ends up being the worst choice for both of them.[^18]

Ostrom and others noted that Hardin’s “tragedy of the commons” is simply an application of the prisoner’s dilemma. Instead of crooks, we have herders or lobster harvesters. The pasture will not be overgrazed if all herders reduce their herds (“stayed silent” in the prisoner’s dilemma). But it is entirely rational for all herders, thinking only of themselves, to increase their herd (rat out the other crook). One by one, the herders bring more animals to the common pasture.[^19] “Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own best interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons,” Hardin wrote.[^20]

However, not all commons are ruined, and game theory helps us understand why. The prisoner’s dilemma assumes that the game is played once and the prisoners do not talk to each other. But real-life herders, water managers, and lobster harvesters do talk to each other. They make decisions many times a day, not just once. They know who to trust and who will betray them. And betrayal brings consequences.

Game theory is more than the prisoner’s dilemma, though. It is rich and complex enough to describe the behavior of lobster harvesters in a harbor or countries threatening nuclear war. Ostrom found two like-minded economists at Indiana University, Roy Gardner and James Walker, who shared her interest in game theory. Game theory soon became one of the many interdisciplinary approaches embraced by the Workshop.

Game theorists dismissed most inconsequential conversations as “cheap talk” that didn’t affect the game. However, Ostrom and her colleagues found that such cheap talk actually has a big influence. Simply talking—about the weather, about sports, whatever—can build trust among the players. Getting resource users to start talking and building that trust became a cornerstone of Ostrom’s ideas about common-pool resource management.[^21]

The Blue Hill Bay trap war was a dispute over territory. The long-term harvesters of Blue Hill Bay did not want competition from newcomers and were willing to use extrajudicial means of defending that territory. Territoriality is one of the key aspects of lobster management, and yet you won’t find it in any law or regulation. The ability to establish a territory and control access, if sometimes by illegal means, prevents an unlimited number of harvesters from depleting the resource.

“When you’re leaving your gear on bottom and you hope it’s there when you come back, it’s a lot more likely you can have a territory. Because somebody can enforce it, it can get expensive to be in the wrong place,” said Steve Train, who fishes out of Long Island, Maine, in a conversation with me. “I think mostly it’s a respect thing. You don’t fish in someone else’s backyard and you expect them not to fish in yours. It’s like me going in and picking an apple off your tree. I’m not going to do it, so I expect you not to. But the question is, what do you consider your tree?”

Defending territory is a risky endeavor. Tampering with fishing gear is illegal, and penalties may include fines of up to $500 per incident. Even worse, a conviction can result in a multiyear license suspension.[^22] In rural Maine where there are few jobs outside the lobster industry, that is a real deterrent. But as in Blue Hill Bay and elsewhere, some harvesters do occasionally conclude that defending territory is worth the risk. Defending territory, or encroaching on another gang’s, is very much a group decision. The risks for those who go it alone are too great. Success depends on collective action.

This question of when to defend, and who does the defending, interested Acheson. He described the general behavior of harbor gangs in _The Lobster Gangs of Maine_. But Ostrom showed Acheson that the behavior of lobster harvesters could be understood using game theory.

In 2001, Acheson spent time as a visiting scholar at the Ostrom Workshop to understand how the harbor gangs operate. With Workshop member Roy Gardner, Acheson used game theory to understand how lobster harvesters know when to enforce rules, to defend territory, or to attempt to take over another gang’s area. Harbor gangs will defend their territories when the benefits of keeping out the other gangs exceed the costs of defense. But these benefits and costs, and the resulting decisions, depend on a number of factors, like the coastal setting and distance from shore.[^23]

Maine’s lobster fishery is one of the most sustainable fisheries in the country. But it was not always so. For a time at the turn of the twentieth century, it looked like Maine’s lobster fishery was rushing toward ruin.

Lobsters were once so abundant that Native Americans, and later, European colonists, would pluck them from the tidal pools along New England’s rocky coast. Lobsters spoil quickly. If you wanted to eat lobster, you had to dine where the lobsters were. All this changed, however, when the lobster canneries opened in the mid-1800s. The canneries needed lobsters, and the harvesters supplied them.[^24]

So-called dinner lobsters need to be big enough for a meal. Those big dinner lobsters were old enough to have reproduced. The canners, on the other hand, bought lobsters of all sizes. For them, there was no difference in quality between small and large lobsters—it is all going into the can. The canners processed many small lobsters before they got old and big enough to reproduce. The entire lobster population was dwindling fast.[^25]

Maine, with the support of the dinner lobster trade, eventually set a legal minimum lobster size. Without a supply of small, cheap lobsters, the canneries closed or moved to Canada. However, the lobster harvesters had not yet developed the conservation ethic for which they are now known. One researcher described this era as “an industry of pirates” as the conservation laws, like the minimum size, were flouted by harvesters and rarely enforced by officials. Harvesters scrubbed the eggs off reproducing lobsters and sold short lobsters illegally. Lobster populations continued to decline through the Great Depression.[^26]

**Box 3.1 Tailgate Recycling Territories**

Each lobster harvester has an exclusive territory in which to set traps. They are not the only ones, however, who divide a commons into informal territories.

Tailgate parties are part of the college football tradition. Fans gather in parking lots before the game to grill food and drink beer and soda. In Michigan, those beverage containers have a ten-cent deposit. All of those empty cans and bottles become a valuable resource for enterprising people willing to go around and collect them.

Noleen Chikowore, a doctoral student at Michigan State University, learned about Ostrom’s ideas in a class. “That’s when I got curious about commons and looking at it from a waste perspective.” Chikowore used Ostrom’s ideas and techniques to study how can collectors govern their shared resource at the tailgate events.

“You find that these informal recyclers have their own ways of collecting returnable aluminum cans and bottles,” she explained to me. Like the lobster harvesters, can collectors have their own territories. Several collectors have worked the tailgate events for as long as twenty years. Some collectors rely on the cans as a critical source of income. When a new collector encroaches on an experienced person’s territory, Chikowore says, “they tell them, ‘This is my place. You need to go elsewhere.’”

This work fits into Chikowore’s, a Fulbright Scholar from Zimbabwe, broader interest in recycling communities in her home country. People collect recyclable material from dump sites to support their livelihoods and improve environmental quality. Like the tailgate can collectors, they have their own approaches to governing their commons.

The tragedy of the commons was unfolding along the coast of Maine. As Hardin would later predict, it took the state government’s intervention to stop the lobster’s decline. But that wasn’t the whole story.

In the midst of this economic and ecological crisis, Maine’s legislature passed a landmark conservation law: the “double gauge” law.[^27] A double gauge law implements both a minimum and a maximum size for lobsters. The minimum size allows lobsters sufficient time to grow to reproductive size. The maximum size enables the largest, most prolific egg producers to keep spawning and protect the breeding stock. A maximum size was controversial then and remains so today within the scientific and regulatory communities.[^28] But in the desperate days of the Great Depression, the legislators were willing to give it a try. The law, one of the few double gauge conservation laws anywhere, remains a cornerstone of lobster management in Maine.

The state government’s intervention was critical, but Hardin’s prediction was incomplete. The lobster’s recovery was not only due to government regulations. By the mid-1900s, something also changed in the lobstering community. Instead of fighting the regulators and skirting the laws, the harvesters began advocating for more conservation measures. After forty years of debate, Maine established its first trap limit in 1995 and revised it in 2000. Perhaps more importantly, the harvesters themselves fostered a culture that respects the rules even when enforcement is difficult and a harvester is unlikely to be caught.[^29]

Jonathan Labaree of the Gulf of Maine Research Institute told me, “I think one of the things that sets Maine apart is both the maximum size, which has been very important, but also this real strong adhering to the protection of fertile females.” Labaree noted that harvesters largely have a strong conservation ethic. “Most fishermen are pretty conservation minded, frankly,” said Labaree. “The last thing they want is to be the one to catch the last fish.”

Harvester Greg Griffin agreed. Lobster harvesters, he said in an interview with me, “absolutely embrace” the state’s conservation measures. “Lobstermen exercise fantastic husbandry practices,” Griffin said. Lobsters are a local fishery, unlike, for example, shrimp or cod, which swim in the open ocean. Lobsters migrate from deep water to shallow harbors each year. But once they are in the harbors, they mostly stay there. As Griffin put it, “You take care of your lobsters, and they will take care of you.”

The combination of informal, but well-enforced, rules at the local level and the conservation laws at the state and federal levels have helped Maine’s lobster fishery to become one of the most sustainable fisheries in the world. The fishery recovered from a period of low-level harvests in the early twentieth century to record harvests in the early twenty-first. The management regime was a critical part of that recovery. But a number of other factors played a role as well, notably the lack of predators like cod and the warming of the Gulf of Maine.

This last factor may be the lobster harvesters’ greatest challenge in the coming years. Warmer water brings the lobsters in to shore earlier and helps them grow more quickly. But lobsters prefer cool water. It’s already getting too warm for lobsters off the coast of New York’s Long Island and Rhode Island. The Gulf of Maine is warming fast—faster than 99 percent of the ocean. If the Gulf of Maine gets too warm, lobsters will likely head north to Canada. That would spell doom for Maine’s lobster industry and the coastal towns that depend on it.

As Jim Acheson said, “You’re not managing fish and frogs. You’re managing people.” For the second half of the twentieth century, the lobster gangs and resource managers were working with a growing lobster population. In that context, the lobster gangs successfully established and maintained territories, enforced informal and formal rules about sizes and trap limits, and developed ways to expel rule breakers. The harbor gangs adapted to changing conditions—ecological, economic, and social.

Lobster harvesters are a resilient lot. They are fiercely independent yet are willing to work together to overcome challenges. The lobster gangs will respond to the ecological, economic, and social changes as they have for decades, but exactly how is unclear. If the lobster boom does go bust, how will the lobster gangs respond? Will neighboring gangs fight over the best remaining territories? Whatever the case, lobster harvesters will need to develop new rules if they are going to adapt to the anticipated changes in lobster habitat and populations.

The mid-1980s were a watershed moment in the study of the commons and in political science more generally. Almost like Motown in the 1960s or grunge-era Seattle, there was a vibe that something was happening in Bloomington. By the 1980s, Elinor and Vincent Ostrom, along with their colleagues at the Workshop, had created a distinctive perspective in political science. One colleague dubbed this perspective “the Bloomington School” named after Indiana University’s campus where the Ostroms worked.[^30] The Bloomington School of political economy distinguished itself from other traditions by its insistence that people, although fallible, can govern themselves by working together and learning from mistakes. It was a product of both Vincent’s interest in the philosophy of governance and Lin’s data-driven empiricism. Theory influenced the design of experiments. Experimental results and case studies from the field, in turn, modified the theory. Theory and practice came together like a jazz band playing the main theme together, improvising new riffs, then coming together once again.

Hardin’s theory of the commons was insufficient to explain the multitude of civil society institutions, like harbor gangs and groundwater associations, that emerged to manage common-pool resources. Ostrom worked with Jim Acheson, Bonnie McCay, and other social scientists who documented these instances. The data were piling up. But what was the theory that explained such a diversity of cases?

At the 1985 National Academy of Science panel, Ostrom compared the group’s task of describing common-pool resource management systems as the challenge faced by early biologists. For centuries, biologists developed their own systems to classify organisms. Each was useful in its own limited way. But when biologists agreed to adopt the hierarchical system of Carolus Linnaeus, knowledge was able to advance quickly. Similarly, the study of commons was also in its infancy. Scientists from all different disciplines—political science, anthropology, economics, sociology—were trying to organize and classify the commons. Like knowing that mammals have fur or birds have feathers, classifying commons would tell something of the resource users’ behavior. It would describe both the incentives that drive users’ behavior and the outputs.

However, it wasn’t even clear if there _was_ an organizing principle. Ecologists, economists, and sociologists did not share a common vocabulary. Did the rules of Maine’s harbor gangs really have something in common with LA’s water districts and Turkish fisheries? If so, how could people describe them consistently across disciplines?

The key to understanding the commons and their management, Ostrom wrote, was learning how the managing organizations are matched with the resources. Ostrom also wanted to know how these organizations persist and what factors contribute most to sustaining the commons.[^31]

The National Academy panel’s work suggested to Ostrom that a few factors might influence how an organized group of users might sustain their resource. For example, there must be clear rules upon which people agree. Those rules can be enforced both by officials and through social means from other users. The organizations are adaptive to changes. These factors were Ostrom’s first attempt at creating a theory to understand how commons could be sustained.[^32]

Ostrom’s work, influenced by her anthropologist and sociologist colleagues, put the resource users front and center. Too often the assumption was that the resource users don’t know anything and it is up to the government to impose rules. This colonial attitude was not universally true and often harmful. Sometimes, the resource users did have their own ways of managing their commons. But central governments did not always seek the input of local users.

Ostrom listened to the resource users. She did not assume that community members were trapped in the tragedy of the commons. Instead, Ostrom wanted to learn from them. What she learned was “the government” isn’t the _only_ way to manage a common-pool resource. Neither is private property the _only_ way. In between these extremes are communities—large and small, formal and informal—and the institutions they use to govern their resources. Community is nowhere to be found in Hardin’s tragedy of the commons. Resource-using communities are not simply amalgamations of individuals. Communities themselves have characteristics and properties that emerge from the daily conversations and engagements of their residents.

The concept of self-governance was central to both Lin and Vincent’s work and was a key tenet of the Bloomington School of political economy. Vincent especially felt that respectful contestation, listening, and being open to changing views were essential to self-government. And self-government by these principles made the tragedy of the commons less likely.  

## CHAPTER 4

## Spain’s Ancient Water Court

Every Thursday a crowd gathers in the Plaça de la Mare de Déu,[^1] the central square of the Spanish city of València. The cathedral’s bell tolls the noon hour. A man in a black robe and carrying a hooked staff leads eight other robed men to the Apostles’ Door, the cathedral’s main entrance. The crowd grows hushed as the man with the staff calls out in the local Valèncian language, “_Denunciats de la séquia de Quart_!”—“The accused of the Quart irrigation canal!” So begins the proceedings of el Tribunal de les Aigües, València’s historic water court (also known as el Tribunal de las Aguas in Castilian Spanish). Each Thursday at noon, as they have for the last one thousand years, members of this unique court conduct a public hearing in which they resolve disputes over irrigation water.

Established by Arab and Berber farmers who emigrated to Spain sometime before 960, the Tribunal endured the transition to Christian rule in the Middle Ages, the Franco regime in the twentieth century, and innumerable droughts and floods in between. In 2009, the Tribunal de les Aigües, along with a similar institution in nearby Murcia, was recognized by UNESCO[^2] as part of the “intangible cultural heritage of humanity.”[^3]

![[ch4f1.png]]

València’s farmers are yet another example of how ordinary people worked together to manage their resource. They collaborated to build canals, developed rules for using irrigation water, and even created a court to enforce those rules. Scholars once assumed that it took a powerful central government to create large infrastructure projects. Historian Thomas Glick noted, “The assumption was that a great work must have been built by a great king.”[^4] But the canals of València were not built by a great king. The farmers built and managed the canals on their own.

Ostrom did not discover this. València’s water court is famous as a tourist attraction, a working form of justice, and a historical curiosity. Historians have written books about it and artists have immortalized the Tribunal’s proceedings in oil paint and sculpture. The problem, however, was that this knowledge was locked up in disciplinary silos. Anthropologists don’t typically talk to economists and agronomists don’t often read history journals. But Elinor Ostrom did.

Ostrom was a collector. With her husband Vincent, she collected artworks from around the world.[^5] With her students and colleagues, she collected examples of successful—and unsuccessful—management of common-pool resources. Ostrom’s genius was in being able to figure out what they had in common. She discovered that there is not a single remedy, no magic bullet, “no panaceas,” as she liked to say. But the communities that successfully manage their commons share some traits. Ostrom called these traits “design principles,” and she identified eight of them. She wrote them down in her most influential book, _Governing the Commons_.[^6]

València’s water court, the Tribunal, is a particularly good example of these design principles. The medieval farmers of València would never have guessed that their water court would be held up today as a model for managing commons all over the world.

![[logo.png]]

Elinor Ostrom faced a problem: she wanted to understand how communities self-govern their commons. And the more she looked around, the more examples she found. Clearly, Hardin’s tragedy of the commons metaphor was incomplete, if not wrong. But a rigorous, scientific analysis of what she called “the commons dilemma” required data, not anecdotes and stories. She needed a way to somehow compare groundwater managers with lobster harvesters and so forth. Nobody had done this before.

So Ostrom invented her own method for analyzing these communities. She called it the Institutional Analysis and Development Framework. The framework was a scaffold upon which she could reconstruct the key elements of each example of a common-pool resource. Each community managed its commons using a set of rules. Some of these rules were formal, like laws. Other rules were informal and resided within the community—like where a lobster harvester can place his traps. Still others were technically on paper but perhaps disregarded by the community and never enforced. The rules, the people that enforced them, the resource users, and the community attributes became essential elements of this framework. Now she could compare, apples to apples, one commons to another.

The seeds of this framework were planted during her 1981 sabbatical, with Vincent, in Germany. That’s where Paul Sabatier asked his critical question: How do you know these groundwater management rules in LA are still working?[^7] It took another few years before Ostrom published the first version of the framework.[^8] She would continue to tweak it for the next two decades. The framework, however, gave her enough structure to start comparing commons with each other. She was one step closer to understanding why some communities were successful in managing their commons and others were not.

Inventing the new framework was the easy part. Now came the hard work of using the framework to rigorously describe examples of commons from around the world. She enlisted several colleagues[^9] to help document and analyze almost five thousand examples of common-pool resource management. She drew these examples from articles and books in rural sociology, economics, forestry, and various other disciplines. Never before had anyone ever undertaken such an extensive analysis of common-pool resources.

Emerging from this analysis was a set of guidelines—what Ostrom called “design principles” for managing the commons. These design principles tended to be present in commons that were successfully self-governed. They tended to be absent in those that failed. Ostrom identified eight design principles.

Ostrom highlighted a few key examples and introduced the design principles in her book _Governing the Commons_. One such exemplar is València, Spain, and its water court—el Tribunal de les Aigües.

**Box 4.1 Ostrom’s Eight Design Principles for Managing a Commons**

1. The physical and social boundaries are clearly defined.

2. Locally tailored rules define resource access and consumption.

3. Individuals who are most affected by the rules can participate in rule making.

4. Resource monitors are accountable to resource users.

5. Graduated penalties can be imposed on rule breakers.

6. Conflict management institutions are accessible.

7. Authorities recognize a right to self-organize.

8. Complex systems are organized into layers of nested governance.

València lies within a dry but fertile plain near Spain’s Mediterranean coast. The _horta de València_ surrounds the city. The horta is, quite literally, the city’s garden. Farmers working small plots grow diverse crops such as onions, potatoes, artichokes, and _xufa_—the key ingredient in València’s signature drink, _orxata_. But the horta has produced more than just vegetables. The region has nurtured a community of irrigators that has endured for more than one thousand years.[^10]

Irrigation has a long history in this dry part of southeastern Spain. “We know that in the Roman times there was some irrigation infrastructure,” Carles Sanchis Ibor, a geography professor at the Universitat de València, told me in an interview. “But this irrigation culture created in the Roman times was completely abandoned” when the Roman Empire collapsed in the fifth century. “So, the real starting point for our system is the arrival of the Arabs and the Berbers” from North Africa in the eighth century. “When these people arrived to the Peninsula, they brought a well-developed water culture.”

These emigrants from North Africa possessed the vision and technical knowledge in agriculture and engineering to transform the Túria River’s dry valley into productive farmland.[^11], [^12] The farmers themselves—not a powerful central government—built a system of eight irrigation canals, each one forming its own irrigation district.[^13] Upon the region’s conquest by Rei Jaume I (King James I) of Aragon in 1238, all of canal districts except one[^14] were declared to be the common property of the irrigators.[^15]

The entire canal system uses gravity to move water across thousands of acres of irrigated farmland, just as it did hundreds of years ago. No pumps, no electricity, no fossil fuels. The canal gates are cranked by hand. Small tiles, about the size of a book, regulate how much water enters a particular field. Today, concrete and metal structures replaced the earthen ditches and wooden water gates, but the Al Andalus farmers from the tenth century would likely recognize the system in place today.

Irrigating València’s horta is not just an engineering marvel. It is a marriage of technology and governance. Those early farmers dug the ditches to distribute the Túria River’s water but also created a social system to ensure that all farmers receive an equitable share of the water and can quickly resolve conflicts.

![[ch4f2.png]]

**Figure 4.2** An irrigation canal snakes between farm plots in València. (Credit: Jason Reblando.)

To irrigate the onions, artichokes, or any other of the many vegetables grown in the horta, a farmer needs water from the canal. But the farmers must wait for their turn. The system of turn taking (_turno_) is common in this part of the Mediterranean. But it is especially well developed here in València.

Mar Violeta Ortega Reig, an engineering professor at the Universitat Politècnica de València, explained to me how the turno system works. The water moves through the canals by gravity, so the farmers “start to irrigate from top to bottom, canal by canal. And inside a canal, plot by plot, until you arrive at the end.” Each farm plot in the horta is slightly lower than the plot before it. The soil is carefully graded to allow the water to spread out evenly across the whole field.

Each canal has a designated day of the week during which it will draw water. But the water takes time to move through the system. It can take many hours, even days, for the water to reach the farms at the lower end of the canal.

“Normally you do not know exactly when the water will arrive at your plot,” Ortega Reig said. “It depends on how many people have been interested in irrigating before you.” On the day the water is to arrive, the farmers wait expectantly in their fields watching their upstream neighbors irrigate until finally it is their turn. And no farmer wants to miss her turn to take the water.

Each irrigation community has its own system for alerting farmers to when it is time to irrigate. Ortega Reig explained that the Rascanya canal district uses blackboards. The irrigators built little kiosks throughout the canal district. Inside each kiosk is a blackboard, some chalk, a key, and perhaps a note to the farmers.

As if on cue, a farmer drove up to the blackboard. His name was Ernesto Marí Zazo. He has lived all his seventy-five years here in the Valèncian horta. Although now retired, he still had the strong hands of a welder. He worked on his farm in his free time, a farm that has been in his family for generations.

“The first one to come writes the date and their name” on the blackboard, Marí Zazo said. “And after him the other people that come to irrigate, depending on which canal they irrigate, they have more right or less right [to the water].” The first person to write his name on the blackboard also takes the key that unlocks the various water control gates. When other farmers come looking to irrigate on that day, they can look at the blackboard to see who else is irrigating and who has the key. In these close-knit communities, the farmers all know each other and where their fields are. When the farmer finishes irrigating, he returns the key to the blackboard. It is a simple, low-tech system that has worked for decades.

Ortega Reig pointed to the notice tacked to the inside of the kiosk. “You can see that there is a message there for the farmers,” she said. “They pay every year four euros per _fanecada_,[^16] the unit that I told you before.”

The _fanecada_ is the traditional unit of irrigation in the Valèncian horta. It is both a unit of land and the amount of irrigation water to which the farmer is entitled. One fanecada is about one-fifth of an acre. The farmer pays for the right to the water, not for the volume of water actually used.[^17]

The fact that a fanecada refers to both the land and the irrigation water is significant. Here in València, the right to irrigation water is tied to the land. Unlike other regions in Spain, the right to irrigation water in València cannot be separated from ownership of the land. That means that water rights cannot be traded, bought, or sold. Each farmer has the right to enough water to irrigate her crop. It does not matter if that crop requires a lot or a little water.[^18]

In València, the canal water is common property. Garrett Hardin would have expected the canal water to be overused. After all, a farmer can take as much as she wants. If the water was instead private property and traded on a market, then the farmer would pay by the gallon. That would ensure the farmers used the water efficiently. However, contrary to Hardin’s (and most economists’) expectations, the turno system delivers enough water for everyone. And it’s worked for more than one thousand years.

![[ch4f3.png]]

**Figure 4.3** Mar Ortega Reig and Ernesto Marí Zazo explain how blackboards are used to keep track of who is irrigating that day. (Credit: Jason Reblando.)

After the farmers in that section of the canal irrigate their fields, they open the gate so the water can flow down to the next section. Close, fill, irrigate, open—on and on down the gentle slope to the end of the canal.

Ortega Reig and Marí Zazo continued the conversation, and then they started laughing. “He was changing from Catalan to Spanish and he said I am not happy to change from Catalan to Spanish! Then he says ‘Don’t call it Catalan, say Valencià!’ He says Catalan is not the same as Valencià even if the politicians say so. He does not want to be a colony of Catalonia!”

With that, Ernesto Marí Zazo got back to work irrigating his fields. The water would not wait for him.

València’s canal system makes agriculture possible in this dry valley. But how were these canals built and maintained for so long?

The secret to their success is organization. The irrigation communities in València and neighboring regions have a long history of democratic governance. After all, who knows the system better than the people who are working in it, day in and day out?

The farmers of València’s horta organize themselves into canal districts. The landowners, but not tenant farmers, can participate in the district’s general assembly. This governing body makes the canal district’s rules, sets canal maintenance fees, and conducts other orders of business. The participating landowners elect several members to lead the assembly in an executive committee. They also elect one landowner, called a syndic, to preside over the executive committee and represent the canal district on the Tribunal de les Aigües.[^19]

On most days, the water flows through the canals and spreads across the farmers’ fields without a problem. Sometimes there is an issue: perhaps a water gate is stuck or someone missed their turn. The local syndic can usually resolve it. But occasionally a more serious problem arises and the last resort is the Tribunal de les Aigües.

The Tribunal maintains an office perched above the Plaça de la Mare de Déu, in a building adjacent to València’s cathedral. The office overlooks the square’s Font del Túria, a bronze fountain that celebrates the river that gives life to the city and waters the canals. The crowds gather in the square on Thursdays to witness the Tribunal’s public hearings, but a great deal of work gets done behind the scenes inside the office. The office door is marked with the Tribunal’s symbol: a hooked staff once used by irrigators to lift the gates of the canal.

The day-to-day work of the Tribunal is done by the coordinating secretary, María José Olmos Rodrigo. She is the Tribunal’s only full-time employee, and the work keeps her quite busy. She fields phone calls, answers questions, and maintains the documents and archives. If there is a problem with the water, she passes it on to the appropriate syndic. We met for a conversation in her office.

The Tribunal has two functions. “One is the justice function and it’s on Thursday in the public place” at the cathedral’s door, Olmos Rodrigo explained. “And the other function is the administrative function. It is after the public function and they meet here” in the Tribunal office. “They talk about, for example, what quantity of water they will need for next week or next two weeks. They ask for all the problems they had in the last week.” These administrative meetings are facilitated by the Tribunal’s president. The syndics elect one of their own as a president and another as vice president. The vice president must represent a canal district on the opposite side of the Túria River as the president.

The Tribunal is most famous for its justice function. Each Thursday, as the cathedral bell strikes noon, the syndics gather in front of the Apostles’ Door—the main door of the Cathedral of València. The bailiff, carrying the symbolic hooked staff, leads the syndics inside a small fenced area where they take their assigned seats. The bailiff begins the proceedings by calling for the accused from each canal district to step forward. The districts operate under a common set of rules specifically about water rights. The usual violations include taking water out of turn or flooding a neighbor’s field.

The Tribunal’s justice is swift. The complaints must be filed with the Tribunal relatively quickly—between three and ten days, depending on the canal district. Then at Thursday’s hearing, the syndics hear evidence and a defense. No lawyers are called upon in this popular court. The farmer’s own syndic does not participate to avoid a conflict of interest. The syndics review the evidence, hear testimony from witnesses, and confer with one another there at the Apostles’ Door with the crowds watching. Within minutes, the Tribunal arrives at a judgment. The Tribunal’s decision is final. The guilty party has no opportunity to appeal.

The Tribunal determines only the farmer’s guilt. The sentence, usually a fine and compensation for damages, is left for the canal district and its syndic to determine. The Tribunal’s proceedings are entirely oral. There is no written transcript of the syndics’ deliberations, and for centuries there was no written documentation at all. Today, the secretary does log the Tribunal’s decision, but few details of the proceedings are noted.

No farmer wants to be dragged in front of the Tribunal’s Thursday hearing—and in front of hundreds of spectators. So, there is a strong incentive for the farmers to work out their differences with their syndic. Occasionally the farmers will resolve the conflict right before the Tribunal. “When they come here on Thursday sometimes they get an arrangement five minutes before they go to the court. Because for farmers it is a shame to be in the Tribunal,” Olmos Rodrigo explained. Most weeks there is no case to be heard. Without a case to be heard, the whole affair is done in just a few minutes.

“Do you know why this public session is outside of the cathedral?” Olmos Rodrigo asked. “Because in the old times it was inside of the _mesquita_, the mosque.” After the Christian conquest of València, however, the cathedral was built on the site of the mosque. The Muslim farmers were prohibited from entering the Catholic church. So, the Tribunal continued the Muslim tradition of a public hearing, but they moved the proceedings outside so everyone could participate.

And “everyone” included Muslims and Christians as well as women and men. Olmos Rodrigo pointed to a painting hanging on the office wall. It was a reproduction of _El Tribunal de las Aguas_ by Bernardo Ferrándiz (1865), one of the most famous paintings in València. It depicts a scene of the Tribunal hearing a case in the early nineteenth century. The syndics are seated on a bench with the Apostles’ Door behind them. Before them stands a woman in a long blue skirt and white shawl, one hand confidently on her hip and the other gesturing to the man beside her. A crowd has gathered to watch the proceedings. One syndic whispers to another, perhaps deliberating on the witness’s testimony.

Historians Julia Hudson-Richards and Cynthia Gonzales noted that this painting illustrates the important role of women in Valèncian society. Since the earliest times, Valèncian women have owned property, including fields in the horta. As landowners, women have rights to the water and can seek justice in the Tribunal.[^20]

Olmos Rodrigo, an economist by training, is reserved and prefers not to be the center of attention. But she shared that she, too, works a plot in the horta during her free time.

“With my sisters,” Olmos Rodrigo said. “When my father died we decided to continue with his small farm. We grow oranges and mandarins, clementines. But this is not important! This is my personal life!” she said, laughing. “When I was a little girl, I went with my father for irrigation. I’ve been involved all my life.”

So far, all of the syndics have been men. But times are changing in the horta. More women like Olmos Rodrigo and her sisters are owning land and farming.

“I think that is going to happen,” Olmos Rodrigo said confidently. “In the past, it was the tradition that the men go into these kinds of roles. And the women have another kind of role. Nowadays it is changing.” There are some women in the general assembly. They can run and be elected syndic if they have the votes.

“There is no rule preventing women syndics, so they can go. In fact, there were women who [ran for syndic] but didn’t have enough votes. So maybe it could happen.”

Canal districts. Rules for accessing water. Electing leaders. Swift justice.

These were elements that Ostrom and her colleagues could identify using the framework that she invented. The framework enabled her to compare the elements of an irrigation system in Spain with an irrigation system in Nepal, a communal forest in Japan, and an alpine pasture in Switzerland. Her team reviewed dozens, hundreds, thousands of cases. But only a portion of them had enough information to make accurate comparisons.

“What was wonderful about it was our field was a filing cabinet that we could all go to,” Ostrom said in an interview. “So, we would be arguing about this and, ‘Well, now, let’s go back and recode your cases with this idea. Check on new cases about this.’”[^21]

In 1986 Ostrom returned to Germany. “When I was in Bielefeld the second time, everyone pushed me for, ‘Oh, let’s get some—what kind of market rules will work? What kind of bureaucratic rule?’ I mean they wanted [the] simplest. I kept reading, and we couldn’t come up with simple answers.”[^22]

The answer, she realized, was there aren’t simple answers. It’s not the “the market.” It’s not “government regulation.” There is no panacea for the commons dilemma. What emerged, though, were these “design principles” for when communities can self-govern their commons. And these design principles are clearly evident in the case of València.

This system works very well in València. Neighboring regions of Spain have their own communities of irrigators that follow different rules. Like València, they have endured for centuries. Ostrom found still more examples of sustainable irrigation communities in New Mexico, the Philippines, and Nepal. Each of these communities has its own system of rules that is tailored to its location.

There is no “one size fits all” prescription on how to manage irrigation—or forests, fisheries, or any other resource. Sometimes markets and private property are appropriate, and other times government intervention is justified. But these are not the _only_ solutions to the commons dilemma. Communities have a shot at sustaining their resources if their self-governing institutions match Ostrom’s design principles.

Before _Governing the Commons_, common-pool resources were not something with which most political scientists engaged. Most political scientists study elections, courts, and legislative deliberations. It was not even clear that a political scientist _should_ study how farmers or lobster harvesters use their commons. And the interdisciplinarity nature of the work did not earn points within the highly disciplinary structure of a university.

But when Ostrom’s book burst on the scene, people took notice. Here was a rebuttal to Hardin’s “Tragedy of the Commons,” one based on actual data and rigorous analysis. It confirmed that there are not only two ways out of the tragedy, private property or government regulation. In València, as in hundreds of other communities, the people created their own institutions to manage their resources. These institutions could be formal, like the Tribunal de les Aigües, or informal, like a harbor gang. Whether formal or informal, these long-enduring institutions followed a recognizable pattern—the design principles.

**Box 4.2 Applying Ostrom’s Design Principles to València’s Irrigation Communities**

**Boundaries:** The canal districts have clear boundaries. Either a farm plot receives water from a canal or it doesn’t. It has social boundaries, too. Landowners have more rights than farmers who rent their plots.

**Rules:** The irrigation systems have locally tailored rules. Each of the eight canal districts has its own set of rules on how to access the irrigation water when it is delivered. In the Rascanya district, for example, the farmers write their names on the chalkboard. In another district, they all meet at sunrise. It’s whatever works for that community.

**Participation:** The farmers (those who own land) participate in the governance of the canal district. They participate in the general assembly and vote for their district’s executive committee and syndic. If they don’t like the rules, the farmers can vote their leaders out.

**Monitoring:** It’s pretty obvious when a farmer has watered a field. The soil is wet. So, it is easy for farmers to see who is complying with the rules and who isn’t. Farmers can monitor each other, and this keeps everyone in line.

**Graduated penalties:** When the Tribunal de les Aigües has found a farmer guilty, that farmer’s syndic imposes a penalty. It’s usually a fine, and they are not onerous. However, repeat violators may lose their access to irrigation water. Without water, a farmer doesn’t have a livelihood.

**Conflict management:** The Tribunal is one of the oldest functioning conflict management institutions on the planet. The process is transparent and swift. Most judgments are rendered in less than two weeks.

**Right to self-organize:** The Spanish Constitution of 1978 recognizes the Tribunal as a legitimate justice institution in the domain of irrigation water.

**Nested layers:** The system of irrigation canals is technically and socially complex. It is organized into irrigation districts with their own general assemblies. Each district also elects a syndic to participate in the Tribunal.

Suddenly, the commons were a respectable subject of study.

Farming in the horta is hard work. But Ernesto Marí Zazo continues to farm his family plot. “It is not a matter of making money,” he said. He enjoys it because it gives him something to do in his retirement.

Like many farmers in the horta, Marí Zazo is growing old. But he and his wife did not have any children. Who will take over his farm when it becomes too difficult for him? The question was left unanswered.

Are young Valèncians losing their connection to the horta? Will the young people carry on the farming tradition? The horta has survived for more than a millennium because it is adaptable, and there are signs that the horta is adapting, perhaps in small ways, to the changing economic and social conditions.

![[ch4f5.png]]

**Figure 4.5** Ernesto Marí Zazo, a lifelong farmer in the Valèncian horta. (Credit: Jason Reblando.)

Carles Sanchis Ibor, the geography professor, is one of the younger Valèncians who feels that connection to the horta but does not own his own land. “There are some farmers who are renting their plots for urban growers,” he said. “For example, I have a very small plot that I am renting from one of these gardens in the middle of the horta. During the weekend, I take my bike and I go there. I irrigate my small plot and I produce vegetables in an organic way for home.”

This type of community garden is still rare in the horta, but it is becoming more popular. City dwellers enjoy growing their own vegetables. And a farmer can earn a lot more by subdividing the field into small gardens than from growing a traditional crop.

València has a vibrant food scene and restauranteurs increasingly want locally sourced food. Agronomist Sergi Escribano works on food policy issues in the Valèncian horta. From his desk at El Molí Lab, Escribano facilitated the development of València’s municipal agrifood strategy. Perhaps the horta’s future is in higher value specialty crops, not commodity vegetables like onions and potatoes.

It is fitting that the future of the Valèncian horta should be charted here in the Molí Lab. The Molí Lab is a coworking space—a commons, if you will—inside the Molí dels Canyars, a renovated fifteenth-century farmhouse. The Molí Lab’s renovations exposed the massive wooden beams that support the gabled roof. The trees from which those beams were made may have been seedlings when Rei Jaume I took control of the region. Each growth ring on the wooden beam signifies fifty-two meetings of the Tribunal, year after year, century upon century. The crops may change, but the institutions endure.

The Rascanya canal flows past fields of cabbages right in front of the Molí Lab. Here a large pointed stone called a _llengüeta_ (literally, a small tongue) splits the canal into two smaller branches. This is one of just a few llengüetes still in existence. Even though the canals are now made of concrete, the llengüeta is still in its original location, performing the same function it has been since the thirteenth century.

**Box 4.3 A Personal Story**

In 2010, the Tribunal de les Aigües and the Universitat Politècnica de València, particularly Guillermo Palau along with Thomas Glick, wished to honor Ostrom’s work on common-pool resources by presenting her with a medal commemorating the Tribunal’s millennial. “What made Lin’s influence on me so special,” Glick reflected in a recent conversation, “is that there appeared to be a perfect fit between her construction of the way irrigation systems worked [in theory] and the way they actually worked in València.”

Ostrom was scheduled to travel to València and accept the award in 2012. Sadly, Ostrom passed away just three months before the scheduled trip. The medal sat in the Tribunal’s office for the next seven years.

Photographer Jason Reblando and I visited València in June 2019 to interview and photograph farmers, scholars, and syndics for this chapter. Carles Sanchis Ibor, who worked with Palau, told me about the medal and asked if I could bring it back to the Ostrom Workshop at Indiana University. I would be attending a conference at the university later that summer.

So, one Thursday afternoon following the Tribunal’s public hearing (there were no cases that day), we met with the syndics in their office. I accepted the medal and a book about the Tribunal’s history on behalf of the Ostrom Workshop. The silver medal was embossed with the symbols of the Tribunal. The symbols include the names of the eight canals in the Tribunal and the hook once used to lift the canal gates. I brought the medal to conference where it was displayed near Ostrom’s Nobel Prize medal. The Tribunal’s medal and the book on the Tribunal’s history are now housed with Ostrom’s archives at Indiana University’s Lilly Library.

The past is never far from the present in the Valèncian horta. The irrigation communities are rooted in tradition but are open to change when it is called for. The key to the horta’s enduring success has been adaptability. Part of that comes from the democratic systems of governance and conflict resolution. These are traits of almost all long-enduring management schemes. València’s irrigation communities continue to inspire resource managers around the world.  

## CHAPTER 5

## Institutions for Collaborative Forest Management

Whether divinely inspired or a product of the “back-to-the-land” movement, intentional communities (sometimes called communes) have found fertile ground in Indiana. Religious leader Johann Rapp moved his community from Germany to Pittsburgh and finally to New Harmony, Indiana, in 1815. Although the Harmonist religious community lasted barely ten years, New Harmony thrives today as a center for arts and spiritual renewal. Visitors can still walk through the privet hedge labyrinth the Harmonists built to symbolize their spiritual journey.[^1]

Another wave of intentional communities sprang up in the 1970s in the forested hills around Bloomington, Indiana. Some, like the Harmonists before them, were established by charismatic religious leaders. Others, like the May Creek Farm, were founded by groups of like-minded young people interested in connecting with the land in a meaningful way.

“I was bound for California,” said Sara Steffey, one of the residents who founded May Creek Farm in 1976. A friend, however, suggested that she consider starting an intentional community in their home state of Indiana. Sara, along with her husband Michael, gave it some thought. She agreed, “but it had to be near Bloomington,” the home of Indiana University. Sara dreamed of connecting with not only the land and fellow community members but also with the university town’s artists and intellectuals. Before long, Sara, Michael, and about twenty of their friends, purchased several hundred acres of Indiana hardwood forest just south of Bloomington. May Creek sliced through the limestone hills and lent the new community its name.

Nearly half a century later, the May Creek Farm still thrives. A few of the original “Creekers,” as they are called, moved on. But second- and even third-generation Creekers heard the call of the land and community. Some things have changed over the years and decades. The community kitchen and teepees, always meant to be temporary, gave way to permanent homesites. Like Thoreau at Walden Pond, the Creekers planned to be self-sufficient and make a sustainable, if modest, living from the land. But, like Thoreau, they found jobs in town. Michael worked as an arborist at Indiana University, ensuring the health of the sugar maples, shagbark hickories, and other hardwood species on campus. Sara became a teacher and an artist.

The forest at May Creek Farm also changed. Sometime in the early twentieth century, farmers cleared the flat land around May Creek for pasture. The pasture was abandoned long ago, and red cedars grew up in the abundant southern Indiana sunshine. The red cedars held a special place in the hearts of the Creekers. Species like sugar maple and tulip tree eventually overtopped the beloved cedars. The red cedars could not survive in the other trees’ shade. Now the bottomland forest is dotted with the cedars’ skeletal remains.

The forest at May Creek remains community land—a forest commons. The community established formal rules and informal codes of conduct about using the forest. Initial ideas about more active forest management, including sustainable timber harvests to support the community, gave way to forest preservation. Community members can harvest fallen trees for firewood. Rules prohibit gun hunting, but bow hunting, especially to thin the growing deer herd, is allowed.

When, in the 1990s, Elinor Ostrom turned her attention to forest commons around the world, she included the forest commons in her own backyard. May Creek Farm and four other intentional communities in southern Indiana provided natural laboratories to study community forest management.

![[logo.png]]

The seeds of Ostrom’s work on forest commons were planted years earlier at a 1985 conference on common property resource management. Two of her former students, Ronald Oakerson and James Thompson, were involved with the National Research Council’s Panel on Common Property Management. Oakerson and Thompson suggested that Ostrom be invited to join the panel. Ostrom’s work on the panel, and the people she met, would influence the rest of her career. Margaret McKean, a Duke University political scientist who also served on the panel, recalled in a conversation with me, “Little did any of us know that it would change the course of her life.”

In 1982, as Ostrom took a second look at LA’s groundwater, McKean published an article about Japan’s traditional common lands.[^2] Today, Japan might conjure _resources/books//The Uncommon Knowledge of Elinor Ostrom_ E - Erik Nordman of Tokyo’s neon lights, sushi bars, and fast trains. But large areas of Japan remain mountainous and rural. For much of Japan’s history, rural villages managed their own common lands. The commons included forests, meadows, quarries, and other resources. McKean’s study of Japanese commons influenced Ostrom’s thinking.

McKean framed her study of Japanese mountain commons as a critique of Garrett Hardin’s “Tragedy of the Commons.” “The challenge for society,” McKean wrote, “is to figure out how to eliminate circumstances in which rational individuals will make decisions that lead inexorably to tragedies of the commons, essentially to create greater overlap and synchrony between private good and public good.” She laid out several possible solutions, such as privatizing (and therefore eliminating) the commons; developing a community ethic; or dividing a large commons into smaller, community-based units.

A fourth option, McKean noted, was to institute a system of rules and penalties upon which all the users agreed. McKean’s influence on Ostrom’s _Governing the Commons_ is clear from this passage:

What we need to understand, then, is how to devise regulations and sanctions. It is not enough simply to propose regulation of the behavior of co-owners in a commons and exclusion of violators from certain rights. There are presumably regulations that work and regulations that do not, and there are presumably levels of harshness in excluding violators that work better than others. We must go beyond mathematical and theoretical exercises in public goods theory to collect additional information before we can design workable or effective or efficient regulations. One enormous task for research that’s been left almost untouched is to comb the historical record for near-tragedies of the commons to collect examples of success (i.e., prevention of the tragedy of the commons or solutions to free-rider problems), and then to analyze these examples to determine the ingredients of success. Actual successes, after all, are more convincing testimony than paper solutions as to the actual range of human and social capacities. Properly speaking, we need to collect examples of failures too, both to strengthen our analysis of successes and to serve as a stern reminder of the limitations of human and social capacities.[^3]

McKean brought her expertise on Japanese mountain commons to the 1985 Conference on Common Property Resource Management. As McKean urged in her earlier paper, the conference was convened to bring together scholars from various disciplines and identify cases of successful management of the commons. In his opening remarks, conference leader Daniel Bromley challenged the panelists to identify “at least three major causes of success or failure in common property resource management situations.”[^4] The conference attendees shared case studies from around the world in agriculture, fisheries, water, forests, and other resources.

McKean began her collection of successful and failing commons with Japan’s common village lands, or _iriai_. Traditional commons furnished materials essential for life in the country, such as thatch for roofs, fodder for animals, and wood for furniture and fires. Villagers could harvest from the commons according to the local rules. Some common resources, however, operated by direct group control. These commons, like rice paddies and fruit orchards, yielded income for the whole village. In a divided use commons, individuals controlled small plots for their own use. Like a plot in a modern community garden, the villager could use the plot but did not own it. Some villages leased the use of their commons to private firms, such as forestry companies. In the places that McKean studied—villages around Mt. Fuji—the commons were integral to village life until the years after World War II. Although they continue in many places, the economic importance of village commons has diminished in recent years.

Rural Japanese society, McKean wrote, valued collective responsibility in many aspects of village life. “Everything was everybody’s business,” she wrote. When social pressures, however, failed to keep someone from violating the commons, the villages had other means to enforce the rules. Villages recruited young men to patrol the commons. The patrol might demand that violators pay a fine, to the patrol, in cash and a bottle of sake. For more serious crimes, the patrol could confiscate the violator’s horse, equipment, and any resources gathered. Only a formal apology, perhaps even with the violator’s family, could earn the return of the horse and equipment.

This deep dive into Japanese mountain commons led McKean to several conclusions. First, the regulations must bear a strong connection to sustaining the commons. Second, the regulations must treat all of the commons users fairly. Third, the penalties must be clear and enforced. Fourth, a graduated system of penalties can bring swift justice for repeat offenders. McKean pointed out that the villagers themselves created and enforced the rules for managing a commons. She surmised that “it is not necessary for regulation of the commons to be imposed coercively or from the outside.”[^5]

The residents of Japanese mountain villages were not trapped, as Hardin thought, and not doomed to overuse their common-pool resources.

Ostrom heard the presentations of McKean and others and reflected on them. Ostrom’s role at the conference was to synthesize the cases and offer concluding remarks. “Many seemingly different resource systems,” she wrote, drawing in lessons from colleagues, “previously described with different terminologies, share central characteristics of common-pool resource systems.”[^6] In order to study these systems, we need to group them together. Ostrom warned the attendees, however, “not to let the use of terms that focus on similarities fool us into thinking that everything clustered together is similar in all dimensions.” All the examples the panelists shared had one thing in common—rules and cultural norms. The specifics of the rules and norms differ by resource, by community, and over time. Community members relied on these rules and norms to organize group tasks quickly and efficiently. “Without cultural norms and rule systems, every pair of individuals would have to organize each and every activity using a short-term contract. Today, they would have to agree to form a team to go hunting. Tomorrow, they would have to agree to build a house.” Rules and norms are shortcuts that enable the governing of community life. These rules and norms are what distinguish an open access resource from a commons—a mistake made by Hardin and many others. In an open access resource, users cannot be excluded. In a commons, however, the community can agree on and enforce rules about who can be excluded. “Open access arrangements lead to many perverse results when used with any type of good,” Ostrom said in her concluding remarks. “Common property arrangements may, on the other hand, work very well in helping individuals to manage some common pool resource systems.”

“The successful case studies discussed here demonstrate that some common property management systems work very well. . . . On the other hand, considerable evidence exists of common pool resource systems that have not been successfully managed. Major fisheries have disappeared. Traditional grazing areas have become deserts. Irrigation systems have been neglected.”[^7] Understanding what leads to success or failure requires studying how well the rules and norms are matched to the common-pool resource.

The 1985 conference was the first time Ostrom and McKean met. But they quickly realized they shared an interest in natural resource commons. McKean and Ostrom would go on to collaborate on research projects for the next twenty years. McKean’s conclusions from her research in Japan clearly influenced the eight design principles that Ostrom wrote about in her 1990 book, _Governing the Commons_. A few years later, they brought their expertise to bear on a groundbreaking study of forest commons, called the International Forestry Resources and Institutions project.

![[logo.png]]

The quaint mountain villages and their commons invoke an idyllic past. They may inspire a vision of commons as belonging to another time and place, like the Shire, home of the hobbits in Tolkien’s _Lord of the Rings_ books. “Many think the commons problem refers to self-organized governance of management of various natural resource systems by communities in the past,” Ostrom said in a 2003 interview. “They endow these communities with a sort of archaic or exotic aura.”[^8]

However, Ostrom was quick to note that commons are not “relics of a dying past.” Rather commons are an essential form of governance in today’s world. “To those who doubt the viability of commons governance institutions in the modern age,” Ostrom said, “let me point out that many such institutions exist and are proliferating, and not only in the area of natural resources management.”[^9]

Forests are a resource for which the commons form of governance has endured in many communities, and not by some historical accident. Communities around the world intentionally manage their forest resources as commons because common property can, under the right conditions, deliver benefits that other property rights regimes cannot. Forests, however, were not a major focus of Ostrom’s work leading up to _Governing the Commons_ in 1990.

Ostrom and her colleagues at the Workshop for Political Theory and Policy Analysis gained a reputation for groundbreaking analyses of common-pool resources. During the 1980s, they created a unique database of water management and irrigation institutions throughout the world, including LA; València; the Philippines; and Nepal. Unlike many of their peers in economics and political science, Ostrom’s team conducted intensive field studies. “To discover this diversity of locally designed rules,” Ostrom told an interviewer in 2003, “to understand how the institutional arrangements work given the bio-physical conditions of a resource, and the culture of the users, you have no other choice but to go there and do field work.”[^10]

Their unique method of investigating the water management institutions—the formal rules and informal customs—caught the attention of United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). Marilyn Hoskins led the FAO’s Forests, Trees, and People program at the time. “We were working on trying to understand why some communities could manage the forest resources and benefit from them and in other places the forests were degraded. And we couldn’t find it in the literature,” Hoskins recalled in a 2012 documentary.[^11] “So, we went to her [Ostrom] because she was involved in understanding the governing of the commons.”

Hoskins noticed that _Governing the Commons_ featured many types of common-pool resources, including fisheries, irrigation, and alpine pastures. The only reference to forests, however, was McKean’s work on Japanese mountain commons. “We asked her if she could help us understand and expand her work to include trees,” Hoskins said. In other words, could Ostrom help the FAO understand how different kinds of governance arrangements affected forest conditions?[^12]

The plight of tropical deforestation gained international attention during the 1980s. The FAO helped countries conduct national forest inventories on the ground. Satellite imagery became widely available to track deforestation from above. Forest research stations shared information with one another to understand how climate change and pollution affected forests’ long-term health. These were major advances in understanding the ecological condition of the world’s forests. What was missing from these scientific studies, however, was the people.

People living in the forest communities depend on the forests for their livelihoods. People make decisions about how to use the forests. These decisions are guided by the community’s forest institutions.[^13]

Hoskins and the FAO sent McKean and several colleagues to Indiana University to meet with Ostrom and her team. The groups explored how they might establish a research program to study forest commons and institutions around the world.[^14] The meeting proved fruitful, and the International Forestry Resources and Institutions (IFRI) project launched with FAO funding in 1993.

Led by Ostrom, and later University of Michigan professor Arun Agrawal, the IFRI team surveyed more than five hundred forests in eighteen countries in North America, South America, Africa, and Asia.[^15] What made the IFRI project unique and groundbreaking was the use of a standardized data collection technique across all of these forests. Scholars from around the world traveled to Indiana University and the University of Michigan to learn how to use the IFRI methods. This allowed the researchers to compare and contrast the rules for managing forest commons around the world.

Never before had such a large number of research sites been analyzed in a systematic way across two decades to understand a common-pool resource. This was not only revolutionary for natural resource commons but also for social science more broadly. The IFRI project was, to a large extent, an answer to McKean’s call a decade earlier for researchers “to collect examples of success (i.e. prevention of the tragedy of the commons or solutions to the free-rider problems), and then to analyze these examples to determine the ingredients of that success.”[^16] But rather than mixing and matching fisheries, farms, and other commons, the IFRI project focused solely on the world’s forest commons. The project moved the research from amalgamations of single case studies to an intentional, systematic, and large-scale analysis that could make broad conclusions.[^17]

The IFRI project did more than simply monitor the ecological state of the forests. The project was designed to test the theory behind Ostrom’s Institutional Analysis and Development Framework[^18] The theory suggests that the choices people make in a situation depend on a multitude of factors that interact in a structured and predictable way. The factors include benefits and costs, as economists would focus on, as well as interactions with other people, the rules that govern the resource, and the ecological conditions. Ostrom and her colleagues were particularly interested in the formal and informal rules—what she called institutions—that communities developed to manage their forest commons.

Scientists and students from the world over came to Bloomington to learn the standardized assessment tools that Ostrom and her colleagues designed for the IFRI project. May Creek Farm, just outside Bloomington, served as an ideal spot both to teach colleagues how to use the IFRI tools and to collect information about the community’s forest.

The first team of IFRI researchers descended upon the May Creek forest in 1996, two decades after the Creekers established their community. Much had changed at May Creek Farm community in the first twenty years. And it wasn’t just the forest that had changed. The community’s rules, both formal and informal, for governing the forest had changed as well. The team surveyed the forest several more times, the last visit being in 2009.[^19]

**Box 5.1 Conserving the Monarch Butterfly’s Winter Home**

Monarch butterflies are the long-distance migration champions of the insect world. Each fall, the fragile-looking orange and black butterflies leave the fields of the United States and Canada and head south to Mexico. Millions of monarchs gather among the oyamel fir trees in the mountains of Michoacán State. Some butterflies travel up to 2,500 miles (4,000 kilometers) to get to this single forest where every eastern monarch spends the winter.

But monarch butterflies are not the only ones whose lives depend on the Michoacán forest. People have long inhabited the area. The mountain forests provide them with firewood, timber, forage for animals, and other essential products. They knew of and celebrated the monarch’s migration to this forest long before scientists, in the 1970s, traced the butterflies to their winter home.

Since the early part of the twentieth century, however, people have intensified their use of the forest. Indigenous peoples and villages with communal land rights used the forests to meet their needs. In 1986, the Mexican government created the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve. Like many parks before it, the top-down imposition of the reserve excluded people from the forest. The boundaries, however, were poorly designed. Forest harvests continued illegally. What was once a commons regulated by the communities became an illegal open access system. The government modified the boundaries and rules in 2000 and gave communities some rights to harvest from buffer areas.

Members of the International Forestry Resources and Institutions (IFRI) team assessed how two mountain communities differed in their forest management approaches. One community capitalized on butterfly tourism in the forest. The forest itself was also rather far from the village, which made illegal logging less tempting. This village’s forest remained in good condition. The other village, however, struggled with forest management. Although the village tried to protect its forest, regional government and law enforcement agencies often sided with the illegal loggers. The village’s close proximity to the forest made illegal logging relatively easy. The community’s strong organizations and rules could not overcome the power of external forces intent on exploiting the forest.

The monarch’s reserve is still under threat. The core reserve lost almost 7 percent of its forest between 1999 and 2013. This was mostly due to large-scale illegal logging. In February 2020, authorities discovered the murdered bodies of a reserve manager and a tour guide. Community members who speak out against illegal logging put their lives at risk.

The experiment in communal living started in 1976 when the county planning commission granted the property status as a planned unit development. The members built a community kitchen and, a year later, a community building. But some residents desired more privacy than their teepees offered. After a fire destroyed the community building in 1980, the Creekers began constructing private homes. The community, however, did not have a formal title to the land. They were paying on a land contract with the owner. When the owner passed away in 1985, the community, now an S-corporation, obtained a mortgage through a local bank. May Creek Farm, Inc., then divided about one-third of the land into individual parcels. Creekers, as shareholders of May Creek Farm, Inc., then obtained loans to build modern homes on the sites.

The young idealists had a sophisticated understanding of law and finance that enabled them to achieve their vision. They used the existing laws regarding planned unit developments and the banking system to create a haven for their own self-governing community. Then the community drew up its own rules, including those for its communal forest land.

The Creekers began their endeavor with a common understanding of how to use their forest resources. Foremost in their common understanding were values of mutual respect and trust. But the situation grew more complicated once they decided to live on individual parcels and share the communal forest. So, in 1982, they established a more formal set of rules and bylaws regarding the forest and other community resources.

The Creekers, consistent with the “back to the land” movement, placed a high value on nature preservation. The May Creek Farm was not a pristine wilderness when they moved there. Rather it had been cleared for agriculture and timber harvesting in earlier decades. By the 1970s, the old pastures had shifted to a plant community of fast-growing, sun-loving trees such as red cedar and poplar. Elsewhere, slopes cleared for timber harvests had regrown with oaks and hickories. More shade-tolerant maples and beeches slowly grew up beneath them, inching their way toward the canopy. Without some kind of disturbance, like a storm or a timber harvest, the maples and beeches would eventually outcompete the oaks and surpass them as the forest’s dominant species. The process of forest succession, from pioneer species to climax forest, was underway. When the IFRI team assessed the May Creek Forest in 2009, they found that the forest was what foresters call “fully stocked.” In other words, it was crowded. The trees competed with each other for nutrients and sunlight, so much so that the competition impeded their growth. Without a natural disturbance or some active forest management, the forest would not reach its potential for timber, but it would still be suitable for wildlife and recreation.

The Creekers enacted formal rules that excluded certain uses of the forest. They also changed these rules over time to reflect the community’s evolving values. Although the Creekers valued preservation, they also recognized the forest’s economic value for timber. In the community’s early days, some members thought that timber harvests could provide much needed income. But once most of the Creekers abandoned the dream of self-sufficiency for jobs in town, the need for timber revenue subsided. In 1987 the bylaws stated that “no clear cutting or selling timber may occur without council approval.” This applied to both community forests and individual homesites. In 2004, the governing council changed the rule to “no clear cutting or selling of timber may occur on community land.” Trees on individual homesites, however, “may be cleared or thinned as needed.” No Creeker has cut all the trees and installed suburban sod on their property. But the changes reflect a trend toward private property from the early days’ emphasis on communal ideology.[^20]

Even though Creekers gave themselves more autonomy to manage their homesite forests, they still engaged in community-building activities. The community maintains a grassy open area for recreation, dug a pond for swimming and fishing, and built a community picnic shelter and fire pit. May Creek Farm enrolled its three hundred acres of community forest into the Indiana Department of Natural Resources’ classified forest program. Under the program, the Creekers pledged to protect the community forest from future development. In return, the state provided a property tax reduction, technical assistance from foresters and biologists, and grant opportunities.

All the IFRI teams used an analytical tool developed by Ostrom called the Institutional Analysis and Development Framework. The tool helps describe how a community uses rules to manage its common-pool resources. Ostrom and her colleagues had been using and refining the tool for more than twenty years. But the IFRI project, and the May Creek Farm in particular, showed that the tool still lacked something. It did not account for peoples’ values. The 2009 IFRI assessment explicitly tried to incorporate values into its analysis of May Creek Farm.

As an intentional community, May Creek Farm grew from a group of people that shared a set of values. But people mature, members come and go, and the group’s values may shift over time. The IFRI team discovered that these changing values provided critical insights into the evolution of the rules regarding the common forest.

One of Ostrom’s eight design principles for managing a commons is to clearly identify the physical and social boundaries. The physical boundaries of May Creek Farm are clearly delineated in the property records. But the social boundaries are defined by the Creekers themselves. A person, usually a resident, becomes a full community member by purchasing a share of May Creek Farm, Inc. A spouse automatically becomes a full member. Minor children do not have a vote, but the status of adult children of members has never been clearly resolved. Formally, new residents gain membership to the community by purchasing a share. Informally, however, newcomers must also demonstrate a commitment to the community’s values. Some residents rent their homes from May Creek members. The renters may not vote on community matters, but they are obligated to follow the community’s rules. Creekers leave the community when they sell their shares of May Creek Farm, Inc.[^21] The community encourages potential new residents to attend a couple of council meetings and a social event. That way, both the potential residents and community members can feel out each other. If the community doesn’t think the buyer is a good match, the community retains the right to buy the share from the seller and hold on to it.[^22]

The community’s rules also allow friends of Creekers, with permission, to hike through the community forest. Creekers and their friends may also harvest forest plants, like ginseng and goldenseal, and morel mushrooms from individual parcels. However, the rules prohibit anyone from harvesting plants and morels in the community forest. Community members have found evidence of poachers from outside the community taking the plants or even harvesting deer from the community forest.

For the first quarter century of May Creek Farm, the community governed by consensus. Whenever the community faced a major decision, they sought unanimity among the voting members. This required significant give and take. It also presented a barrier to making important decisions. Just one member with a strongly held opinion could derail the process. Therefore, in 2003, the Creekers amended their bylaws and implemented majority rule for most matters. Legal matters still required consensus. The majority rule system streamlined decision making. The change made the community nimbler in the face of emerging challenges. But it also degraded the sense of community. Some Creekers felt that, under the new rules, alternative actions were not given fair consideration. When the community considered installing a municipal water line, some residents suggested that a cistern-based system would be better. The majority voted to construct the water line even though two members objected.

“It remains to be seen,” the IFRI team wrote, “whether consensus remains an important value for Creekers when it comes to decision making, or whether majority decisions will gradually be accepted as legitimate even if minorities within the community are consistently overruled.”

Although voting on certain pragmatic issues led the community to fray a bit, the gentle hand of Father Time is leading them back together. Many of the original Creekers still live at May Creek Farm. Their children have grown up and found homes of their own. They’ve retired from careers in town. But they still have their fellow Creekers and the forest they love. The aging residents find they have more leisure time for walks in the woods with each other or bonfires by the pond. It’s not all sunshine and roses at May Creek, and there are disputes. But the values that brought them together in the 1970s, like forest preservation, keep the Creekers hanging around.

A popular aphorism says, “Nobody ever washes a rental car.”[^23] People invest in and care for things they own. No rational person would spend the effort to wash a car that doesn’t belong to them. This idea can apply to common-pool resources, too. If people don’t have an ownership stake in the commons, then they might be less likely to take care of it. People might be tempted to overuse the commons because they could be kicked out at any minute by the actual owners.

That was the conventional wisdom around community forests. Ostrom told interviewers in 2010, “A lot of people when they first saw some of these results . . . they said, ‘If they harvest they’ll take it all down.’ Having rights doesn’t mean you have a right to clear an entire forest. But if you have no rights, why would you have any interest in protecting it at all?”[^24]

Ownership, however, is more complex than it sounds. In a commons, an individual does not “own” the resource the way someone in the United States might own a car. Instead, people in a commons have rights to the resource. These may include rights to access the area or the rights to harvest certain materials, like firewood. The rights can be seasonal or belong to a household rather than an individual. The rights in a commons can even be passed along to the next generation. Social scientists use the term “tenure” to describe the strength of these rights.

A lack of land tenure is often cited as a cause of deforestation, especially in the tropics. The remedy then is giving people tenure, usually in the form of private property. But the IFRI project showed that this is not always the case. The IFRI project’s leaders wrote, “The major lesson from these studies is that local users of forest resources can exercise more control over the incentives they face than is frequently depicted in textbooks on natural resource policies.”[^25] Community members may have rights to a forest without necessarily having ownership of it, but those rights must be secure.

Common property is just one type of property regime—private property and public (government) ownership are others. Catherine Tucker, one of the IFRI team members, noted that “any property regime can result in well-managed or poorly managed forests.” The IFRI project showed that forest outcomes are influenced by an array of factors, such as the forest’s history, its ecological setting, political and economic processes, and the community members’ experience in forest management. Simply privatizing a forest can result in uncoordinated management among diverse owners or clearing the forest entirely. Publicly owned forests may be neglected from a lack of management. They may even be degraded as forestry agencies become captured by private industries.[^26] Every property management regime has its pros and cons. Common property is not necessarily better or worse than private or public ownership.

The communities that successfully managed their forest commons (and not all were successful) tended to have rules that matched the design principles that Ostrom proposed in _Governing the Commons_. These communities clearly defined the commons’ boundaries, created rules for equitably sharing the benefits and costs, imposed graduated sanctions on rule breakers, and nested smaller forest management organizations within larger ones.

But Ostrom was quick to note that there are no panaceas, no “one size fits all” solutions for managing a commons. Each forest community that the teams studied created its own unique set of rules for sustaining the commons. After reviewing data from hundreds of forests and studies from many other scholars, Ostrom identified another set of factors for successful management of forest commons. She divided these into factors that describe the forest resource and those that describe the resource users. A forest commons is more likely to be sustained when it can be improved with management. A highly degraded forest may be written off as not worth the effort of managing. A sustainable forest commons will also have reliable indicators of its condition and a predictable supply of forest products. Small forests that people know well tend to be more successful than large ones. Although that seems to hold true for forests, other resources fare better when they are larger. A large canal, for example, can draw from a bigger population to help build and maintain it.

The communities that sustain their forest commons are often highly dependent on the forest for their livelihoods. The users share an understanding of the forest’s role in the community, whether for timber, as a source of sustenance, or for preservation, and how their actions affect it. The users also tend to have a long-term outlook for the forest (economists call this having a low discount rate). The forest users trust one another and act reciprocally. The forest users have autonomy to create and enforce the rules for accessing and harvesting from the forest. Finally, successful communities encourage their members to develop organizational and leadership skills.[^27]

Ostrom herself noted that this long list of factors that affect forest commons is cumbersome. And, she suspected, it is probably incomplete. But problems as complex as the governance of a forest commons rarely have simple—and correct—answers.

Vincent Ostrom held craftspeople in high regard. He especially enjoyed woodworking. When he and Elinor moved to Indiana, Vincent sought to learn the craft of woodworking from a local master. Vincent tracked down a master woodworker in Bloomington and learned how to turn a raw log of Indiana hardwood into an item of utility and beauty. So, when it came to establishing a research center at Indiana University, Vincent and Elinor embraced this idea of a woodworking shop in which master and apprentice worked side by side.

“We called it a ‘workshop’ to communicate a commitment to artisanship and collaboration,” Vincent Ostrom said in a 2003 interview. “Colleagues and students work with one another in conceptualizing the task to be undertaken and in the conduct of inquiry itself.”[^28]

The Workshop, therefore, was an intentional community, not unlike the May Creek Farm. Most scholars organize their research centers or labs around a particular topic or scientific technique. But the Ostroms organized the Workshop in a fundamentally different way. The Ostroms and their colleagues shared a set of values, a commitment to inquiry, respect, and trust.

“If a human group is bound together by a shared purpose or identity,” Vincent told the interviewer, “then it has a set of understandings that order the relationships among the members of the group in common.”[^29] Vincent was talking here about their research sites, but his comment applies just as well to the Workshop itself.

The IFRI project was no exception. Led by Elinor, researchers traveled to the Workshop at Indiana University to apprentice with her and her colleagues. Regardless of their discipline or country of origin, they all were bound together by a shared purpose. That purpose was to understand, in all its complexity, how communities might successfully govern their own forest commons and, by extension, all kinds of other commons.

Many of Indiana’s intentional communities were led by charismatic men with big ideas. These communities, however, tended to burn brightly and extinguish quickly. Communities like May Creek Farm, built on shared values and a commitment to collaborative governance, fared better than others. The Ostroms, and Elinor in particular, were charismatic people. But over decades, the Workshop held true to its communitarian values, its commitment to a shared purpose. The Ostroms passed away in 2012, within weeks of each other. But the ideals they embedded in the Workshop carry it forward under new generations of leadership.  

## CHAPTER 6

## The Climate Commons

Tolstoy’s _Anna Karenina_ famously begins, “Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.”[^1] The cases of LA groundwater, Maine lobsters, and València irrigation canals exemplify Tolstoy’s adage. These and other successful resource-using communities all created and enforced rules to sustain their common-pool resources. They all, in some way, exhibit Ostrom’s design principles—from clear boundaries to participatory rule making. Sustainable common-pool resources systems are all alike.

But every unsustainable commons is unsustainable in its own way. In _Governing the Commons_, Ostrom provided examples of communities that had depleted their common-pool resources.[^2] In each case, at least one (and often several) of the design principles were missing. Ostrom was careful to point out that commons will not always be managed sustainably. In fact, the successful long-term management of a commons is the exception rather than the rule.

Earth’s climate system has the attributes of a common-pool resource. The climate system’s limited ability to absorb greenhouse gas pollution makes it a depletable resource. It is difficult, however, to prevent cars and factories from emitting those greenhouse gases. Carbon dioxide in particular has the unusual property of staying in the atmosphere for a long time. That accumulating concentration of greenhouse gases traps heat and changes weather patterns.

The list of climate change impacts happening now is long and ever growing. Fires rage in the American West[^3] and in Australia.[^4] Arctic sea ice melts,[^5] and glaciers retreat.[^6] Cities from Boston to Miami are inundated as the oceans rise.[^7] It is not an exaggeration that every single community now feels the effects of climate change. The latest US National Climate Assessment concluded, “With continued growth in emissions at historic rates, annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century—more than the current gross domestic product of many US states.”[^8]

It’s no wonder that young people like Greta Thunberg are demanding climate action. This is the world they are inheriting.

The future has a habit of becoming the present. Predictions in the early 1990s[^9] for rising waters, fires, and heat waves seemed so far off. Yet, here they are. People all over the world, right now, are grappling with the damages from climate change. We can, however, try to limit the impact climate change has on human lives, but only if we work together.

If the climate system is a commons, then Ostrom’s design principles and other insights might help us govern it. The world’s latest effort to reign in greenhouse gases, the 2015 Paris Agreement, includes many of Ostrom’s design principles. However, the agreement is fragile and in danger of unraveling.

This chapter focuses on two key elements of Ostrom’s work: polycentric governance and enforcing expectations of behavior. It’s up to us, the global community, to ensure that we hold one another accountable for limiting climate-changing emissions and avoid a global tragedy.

Some historians regard the Manhattan Project as one of the greatest scientific achievements of the twentieth century.[^10] The work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change may be seen as the greatest scientific achievement of the twenty-first century. And these two endeavors could not be more different.

The US government assigned the Manhattan Project’s scientists a very particular problem: build a nuclear bomb so the Allies could win World War II. This top-down approach worked. The scientists built the bomb in just a few years.[^11] But scientists rarely operate under such specific directives. It was also done in complete secrecy. This approach to scientific discovery is highly unusual.

More typically, scientists choose their own topics to investigate. A scientist might conduct an experiment on one particular aspect of our world. For example, one might study how teaching with digital technology affects learning in kindergartners or how a new fertilizer formulation affects plant growth. Scientists are also members of a community. They review each other’s papers before publication. They learn from one another about what works and what doesn’t. The scientists themselves set the rules about what is acceptable conduct. Scientists also compete for prestige—they want to be recognized for making breakthrough discoveries (and maybe win a Nobel Prize). They publish their findings in scientific journals, and their discoveries may be reported in the popular press. No central authority oversees the global scientific community. From the outside, it can appear rather chaotic. Somehow, scientific knowledge emerges from this mess.

That “somehow” is what social scientist Michael Polanyi called the “republic of science.”[^12] In the 1950s, Polanyi studied the process of scientific discovery. He found that this chaotic, messy approach to science is, in fact, the “secret sauce” that propels our understanding of the world around us. Polanyi called this grassroots approach “polycentricity”: a social system that has many centers of decision making, each acting somewhat independently but under a common set of guiding principles.[^13]

Climate change is incredibly complex. It involves not only atmospheric science but also oceanography, physics, economics, sociology, ecology—just about every scientific field. The day-to-day endeavor of climate science happening at universities, government labs, and think tanks around the world is very much in line with Polanyi’s concept of polycentricity in science. Each researcher, each laboratory, investigates a small piece of the climate change puzzle.

With all of these scientists publishing in specialized journals, however, it can be hard to see the big picture. That’s where the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) comes in. In 1988, the United Nations formed the IPCC to conduct and publish periodic assessments of climate science.[^14] The IPCC does not, however, conduct the science itself. Unlike the leaders of the Manhattan Project, the IPCC does not directly tell scientists what to study. The purpose of these assessments is to describe what we know about Earth’s climate—and what we don’t know. The knowledge gaps identified by the IPCC can point scientists, and science funders, in a particular direction. The “intergovernmental” part of the IPCC’s name is significant. Although experts from various climate-related fields synthesize the science, the IPCC process is overseen by national governments. The governments must ultimately sign off on the summary of the scientists’ assessments[^15]. In that way, the IPCC does provide some structure to the process of doing climate science, perhaps more structure than Polanyi’s ideal of a “republic of science.”

“Nonetheless, in its actual functioning, it would certainly be appropriate I think to characterise the IPCC as working in a pretty polycentric manner,” Martin Mahony wrote in an email to me. Mahony is a human geographer at the University of East Anglia in the United Kingdom. “Different teams of scientists work fairly independently of each other, responding to what they find in the literature, and it all adds up to a consensus viewpoint on the state of things.”

Polycentricity became one of the cornerstones of the Ostroms’ “Bloomington School” of political economy. It also would turn out to be a critical tool for managing the global climate commons.

![[logo.png]]

Ostrom, along with her Workshop colleague Michael McGinnis, took their first look at the climate commons in 1992. Climate change was emerging as a major global challenge with many facets, including national security. Argonne National Laboratory co-convened a workshop for social scientists to discuss the “merits and limitations of proposed policy initiatives” to address climate change. Ostrom had just published _Governing the Commons_ less than two years before. The workshop’s conveners understood that institutional management was essential for managing a global commons like the climate system. Ostrom had emerged as the leading expert on the commons and was invited to submit a paper.[^16]

The 1992 workshop was held after the IPCC started its work but a few months before the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. There was talk of a global treaty that might, as Ostrom put it, “require drastic changes” in greenhouse gas emissions and “the creation of new institutional arrangements to enforce these measures.”[^17] Ostrom was skeptical of the effectiveness of top-down regulations to cut emissions.

“The current emphasis on global solutions based on international conventions meant to establish global institutions to manage environmental change may be fundamentally misguided,” she and McGinnis wrote.[^18]

The local resources Ostrom described in _Governing the Commons_ were rather simple. As a global commons, the climate system would be much more complex. The difference, they noted, was that a global commons included a much more diverse set of actors. These actors would be nested in institutional arrangements at international, regional, and local levels.[^19] In other words, a single, one-size-fits-all “cure” implemented at the global level might be worse than the “illness.”

The world is a big, diverse place. The world’s diversity—cultural, political, ecological, and otherwise—may be a source of inspiration for local solutions to the climate crisis. “In many local commons around the world,” McGinnis and Ostrom wrote, “individuals do devise for themselves rather ingenious institutional arrangements that have enabled them to make productive use of fragile resource systems over long periods of time.”[^20] For a global commons, the users are not just individuals but also governments, nongovernmental organizations, and corporations. Whether these local solutions could be scaled up to address a global problem and incorporate all these different types of users remains to this day the key question.

This is where Lin returned to her work with Vincent on polycentricity. “Rather than seeing the diversity of actors and interests as an impediment to agreement,” McGinnis and Ostrom wrote, “it is important to put this diversity to use in order to increase the robustness of any resulting regime.”[^21] Rather than relying only on the government to monitor greenhouse gas emissions and enforce limits, McGinnis and Ostrom showed that many types of actors can monitor and, in their own ways, enforce limits. These actors include governments, nongovernmental organizations, corporations, and individuals. Climate change requires a unified response but not a uniform one.

“Contestation,” they said, “should be encouraged at all levels” while providing forums for the contesting groups to “arrive at common solutions.”[^22] Lin dedicated _Governing the Commons_ to Vincent, “for his love and contestation.”[^23] So, when she and McGinnis encouraged contestation, they mean it in a challenging, but respectful, way.

McGinnis and Ostrom’s 1992 paper might be the earliest articulation of a polycentric approach to climate governance. While prescient, their suggestions languished in an obscure conference report and were largely ignored. Ostrom turned her attention back toward forests and other natural resource commons for much of the 1990s and 2000s. World leaders, meanwhile, continued their quest for an international climate change treaty, and greenhouse gases continued to accumulate in the atmosphere. Ostrom wrote, “As a result, many analysts have presumed that an enforceable global agreement is the only way to address the threat of climate change.”[^24] And for twenty years, an enforceable global agreement was the elusive “white whale” of climate policy.

In the years following, Ostrom wrote several reports for the World Bank on economic development and the commons. As it prepared its annual World Development Report in 2010, the World Bank recognized that “climate change is a crisis of the commons.”[^25] So the World Bank recruited Ostrom to help them understand how her ideas could be applied to the global climate commons. Ostrom’s background paper for the World Bank kicked off a series of papers on governing the climate commons, a topic she tackled until her death in 2012. Her ideas of polycentric climate governance continue to influence scholars and policy makers.

“Given the severity of the threat,” Ostrom wrote nearly twenty years after the Argonne National Lab workshop, “simply waiting for resolution of these issues at a global level, without trying out policies at multiple scales because they lack a global scale, is not a reasonable stance. . . . The advantage of a polycentric approach is that it encourages experimentation by multiple actors, as well as the development of methods for assessing the benefits and costs of particular strategies adopted in one setting and comparing these with results obtained in other settings.”[^26]

Ostrom continued, “What we have learned from extensive research is that when individuals are well informed about the problem they face and about who else is involved, and can build settings where trust and reciprocity can emerge, grow, and be sustained over time, costly and positive actions are frequently taken without waiting for an external authority to impose rules, monitor compliance, and assess penalties.”[^27]

With a global commons like the climate system, there is no external authority to enforce compliance with rules. So, countries have to hold each other accountable.

“There’s a trite sense in which all international law is by necessity polycentric because there is no global government to design and enforce,” noted Daniel Cole, law professor at Indiana University, as we met in a busy Bloomington coffee shop. Cole, a Workshop member, collaborated with Ostrom and her colleagues on many research projects related to law, property rights, and the commons.

As always, Ostrom warned that polycentric governance is not perfect. “Self-organized, polycentric systems are not a panacea! There are no panaceas, however, for complex problems such as global warming.”[^28]

![[logo.png]]

Global climate policy kicked into high gear at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. High-level delegates from 155 nations, including President George H. W. Bush, signed the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and it was ratified by the US Senate. True to its name, the treaty offers a framework or structure for how the world’s countries will act on climate change. The treaty, however, does not commit countries to implement any specific activity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. That was left for future negotiations. The UNFCCC calls for an annual Conference of Parties at which all of the member countries can negotiate how they will, collectively, stabilize greenhouse gases at a safe level. The participating countries assembled for the first Conference of Parties, or COP1, in 1995.

The COPs tend to cycle through mundane working meetings punctuated by big breakthrough years. One of those breakthrough years was 1997’s COP3 in Kyoto, Japan. The meeting produced the Kyoto Protocol, which committed the richest countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Although President Bill Clinton signed the Kyoto Protocol, he never introduced it to the US Senate for ratification. As a result, the United States never joined the Kyoto Protocol. The United States, particularly the Senate, objected to it for two main reasons. First, the Senate would not approve legally binding emissions reduction commitments. Second, the UNFCCC’s “common but differentiated responsibilities” phrase was used to divide the countries into two groups: the richest and the rest. Only the richest countries, including the United States, would be legally bound to reduce their emissions. China, however, was among “the rest.” These countries were encouraged, but not legally required, to reduce emissions. The United States felt that this distinction gave China a competitive advantage. The Kyoto Protocol went into effect without US participation. Several other countries, such as Australia, Canada, Japan, and Russia, later withdrew from it.

The Kyoto Protocol, however, had an expiration date. As the Kyoto commitment period wound down, negotiators started crafting its successor. The US Senate still opposed legally binding emissions reductions. However, a voluntary agreement—not a treaty—could bypass Senate ratification. President Barack Obama could sign the agreement on behalf of the United States without making significant legally binding commitments. At COP21 in 2015, negotiators produced the Paris Agreement. Law professor Dan Cole jokingly said that the Paris Agreement’s structure “was a conspiracy of the entire global community to avoid the United States Senate. And as a result of that, the whole structure of the Paris Agreement is polycentric.”

“Everything in Paris is structured to operate through intended nationally-determined contributions,” Cole said. Each country voluntarily pledges to reduce emissions by some amount—its nationally determined contribution. Then that country’s pledge is compared with those of peer countries. If a country’s pledge is relatively weak, its peers will apply pressure on that country to increase its ambition. Countries expect one another to follow through and implement their pledges. “There’s also a rachet mechanism where they’re supposed to enhance their ambition every five years,” Cole said.

The voluntary “pledge and review” structure is essentially a polycentric approach to climate governance. It fits squarely into Ostrom’s body of work on managing the commons. Instead of a legally binding, one-size-fits-all global treaty, the Paris Agreement encourages countries—and their constituent cities, states, and provinces—to set their own targets and develop their own strategies on a voluntary basis.

In the years since the Paris Agreement was signed, countries have come forward with their pledges to reduce greenhouse gases. For example, under President Obama, the United States pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 26–28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. Unfortunately, the world’s current pledges are insufficient to avoid a catastrophe. Without further ambition, the current pledges put the world on track for a global average temperature rise of 5.0°F (2.8°C) by century’s end.[^29] This would miss the Paris Agreement’s target of “well below” 3.6°F (2.0°C) by a wide margin, resulting in widespread harm to people around the world. The world will soon know if a voluntary, polycentric approach can deliver the needed emissions reductions.

Jessica O’Reilly, an environmental anthropologist at Indiana University, was in Paris when the world reached the historic agreement. In the lead-up to the Paris COP, she and her students participated in a series of conference calls with the US Department of State. In a conversation with me, O’Reilly recalled being eager to learn what the US government’s international climate policy would be. “What are we going to do, save the world and inequality at the same time? What’s it going to be?” she recounted. The Obama Administration’s goal was something much more banal: to send a clear market signal about renewable energy and climate resilient investments.

O’Reilly and her students were a bit disappointed, at least at first. “In my bleeding heart, I was completely deflated that that was our government’s goal, to send a market signal.”

Unless you are an economist, “a clear market signal” does not spark joy in most people’s hearts. But in a very pragmatic way, the Obama Administration was saying to the world that the United States was embarking on an energy transition away from fossil fuels. The government can’t do that alone, however. A successful energy transition needs the investment dollars and expertise of the private sector; it needs vocational schools and universities to train workers in emerging fields; it needs advocacy and watchdog groups to ensure that the transition is fair and doesn’t leave anyone behind.

“I know the Department of State negotiators at the time wanted this to be robust and to be agreeable for a bipartisan United States,” O’Reilly continued. “So, whoever was in power would be able to work with the Paris Agreement in the United States.” The Obama Administration was laying down a marker: the future is green.

The Eiffel Tower was lit up green to celebrate the signing in the Paris Agreement in 2015. The joy, however, turned to despair just a year later. The delegates at COP22 in Morocco awoke to the news that Donald Trump had been elected president of the United States. Trump campaigned on a promise to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement and roll back Obama-era climate change policies.

O’Reilly recalled the mood that morning in Morocco. “I flew out on election night and woke up to learn the results of the election,” she said. “And then I was really happy about this market signal. I was like, ‘At least we’ve got the market signal!’ And I appreciated much more the wisdom of that approach.” No matter what the new administration did, the future was still green. The polycentric Paris Agreement included many diverse actors, including governments, businesses, and advocacy groups, as stakeholders. It did not hinge on the just one leader’s decisions.

Nobody, least of all the US negotiators, was prepared for Trump’s surprising victory. “The delegations, particularly the US delegation, locked themselves in their office. They were completely inaccessible for several days while they tried to figure out and talk to DC about what their approach was going to be for the remainder of the meeting,” O’Reilly recalled. “And in that vacuum, I saw civil society step up immediately.”

Trump’s election, O’Reilly said, “completely catalyzed subnational governance actors.” Cities, states, and civil society groups filled the climate leadership vacuum in the United States, “amplifying the voices of faith leaders, tribal communities, states, cities, universities.”

The COP meetings have a reputation for being a bit like a trade show. Countries, industry groups, and nongovernmental organizations all have pavilions on the conventional hall floor. They hand out flyers and host small discussions. Cultural groups give performances. The festival-like environment contrasts with the serious negotiations happening behind closed doors.

O’Reilly “looked at the design of the UN and this cacophonous, circus, trade show, and realized that everyone is brought into this space so the governments can do this handing off of power. So that it’s not just the [countries] making governance decisions.” Instead, it is a way of handing off power, scaling up and down, and testing new ideas.

“All of that to me is really an example of robust and in some ways flexible or resilient climate governance.” This is the beauty of polycentric governance. It’s messy and it doesn’t look pretty, but it’s our best hope for a sustainable climate.

The US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement is bad news for climate governance. However, it is a testament to the Paris Agreement’s polycentric structure that it just might be able to withstand such a shock. The agreement’s future, and a habitable climate, depends on whether the community of nations, firms, and civil society groups can hold to account countries that withdraw.

The US delegation kept a low public profile at COP25 as it began in December 2019 in Madrid. Unlike the United Kingdom, South Korea, and Rwanda, the United States did not have a pavilion in the convention hall. But behind the scenes, the United States was still as active as ever in the negotiations. A spokesperson for the US Department of State told me, “As discussed, the United States is participating in COP25 to ensure a level playing field and protect US economic, energy, and environmental interests.” Some of the US diplomats that negotiated the pending withdrawal from the Paris Agreement were the very same people who negotiated its passage in 2015. The job of a career foreign service officer requires putting personal partisan affiliations aside and representing whichever administration is in power. It is not easy.

The toolbox of international diplomacy includes both carrots and sticks. The twenty-fifth Conference of Parties started out with carrots. Ambition was the buzzword. The COP leaders pushed countries to increase the ambition of their pledges as much as possible before the implementation phase that would begin in 2020. The COP25 president, Carolina Schmidt of Chile, told a crowd of reporters that “this is a COP for action. ‘Time for Action’ is not a slogan. It is a need, a demand—a moral demand, a social demand, an economic demand—for transformation. And we need to work together to do so.”

At the same press conference, Lorena Aguilar, representing Costa Rica, threw down a challenge. Her country, one of the world’s leaders in sustainable development, had launched its decarbonization plan. Costa Rica would have zero carbon emissions by 2050. “I think that it is an effort from a very small country, but we call on anyone else to beat us—to win this challenge we have taken for 2050.”

“Beat us,” Aguilar said with a smile.

That was the starting pistol for a race to the top. As social scientist Michael Polanyi described in the 1950s, science advances in part based on competition for scientific prestige. Could countries similarly compete for the prestige of being the first to decarbonize?

Patricia Espinosa, Mexico’s environmental minister and the UNFCCC’s executive secretary, noted that Costa Rica may be in the lead but is not the only runner in the race. Espinosa said a group called the Climate Ambition Alliance counted sixty countries that have committed to carbon neutrality by 2050. “And not only governments,” she said. “The climate neutrality goal has been embraced by cities, by regions, by businesses, by investors.” In other words, it is polycentric.

Over at the United Kingdom’s pavilion, officials were touting the United Kingdom’s new climate policy: to have net zero[^30] carbon emissions by 2050. Days later, the European Union unveiled its decarbonization plan, called the “Green Deal.” Major economies were following Costa Rica’s lead and hoping to beat them at decarbonization.

The United States, however, felt no such inspiration. Just weeks before the COP’s start, the Trump Administration formally submitted paperwork to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement’s rulebook lays out a process for withdrawing, and the Trump Administration was serving its divorce papers as early as possible. A state department spokesperson at COP25 stated, “As the President announced, we have ceased the implementation of the previous administration’s nationally determined contribution.” The Trump Administration had, in practice, long ceased implementing any climate policy. United States carbon emissions climbed sharply in 2018. However, the “clear market signal” had already been sent. Utilities accelerated the retirement of uneconomic coal-fired power plants. In 2019, US emissions fell once again, although well short of the Obama-era nationally determined contribution.[^31]

The COP25 president, Carolina Schmidt, tried to put a positive spin on the developments. “We know that the United States has announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement,” she said. “But we know the American people want to be part of the solution. When we bring the other actors to the table, we bring the local governments, regional governments, and companies that are committed to carbon neutrality by 2050 that the science is requesting of us.”

That was also the message of “We Are Still In”—or, as one person called it, the “rogue US pavilion” at the COP25.[^32] This group of US cities, states, tribes, companies, and organizations pledged to follow through on their own voluntary Paris Agreement commitments. This is where the polycentric structure of both the Paris Agreement and our federal system of government showed its strength. A polycentric system is less fragile. President Trump might withdraw the United States, as a country, from the Paris Agreement. But other governmental units can have their own climate policies. Several US cities such as New York City, Seattle, and Boulder, have pledged carbon neutrality by 2050. Private companies such as Microsoft and Lyft have also done so. This is, however, a small portion of all US emissions.

Ostrom anticipated that a polycentric approach would be more robust to policy failures than a top-down approach. In 2012, she wrote, “Decades of research demonstrate that a variety of overlapping policies at the city, subnational, national, and international levels is more likely to succeed than are single overarching binding agreements. Such an evolutionary approach to policy provides essential safety nets should one or more policies fail.”[^33]

The COP25 leaders were relying on these subnational actors to keep the United States, to some informal degree, in the Paris Agreement. Carolina Schmidt, COP25 president, said we don’t have a Planet B. “But we do have ‘B’ people, ‘B’ businesses, ‘B’ governments that are going to push for the changes we need to start moving this from negotiations to the implementation and increase the ambition.”

The Paris Agreement has little chance of keeping additional warming within the 3.6°F (2.0°C) target without substantial US participation. The Paris Agreement is voluntary. However, voluntary does not mean free from consequences. The race to the top works for countries that actually want to reduce their emissions. Countries that remain uninterested in following through on ambitious goals will be unmoved by such appeals. Climate change, however, touches every part of our lives. Climate leaders can use that holistic nature to persuade climate laggards to rethink their ambitions. Leaders’ toolboxes also include diplomatic sticks in addition to carrots. There will be consequences for violating international norms on climate action.

During one plenary session, Spain’s minister for ecological transformation said, “We should not accept any type of withdrawal. We should not accept any type of silence” on the Paris commitments—a comment clearly aimed at the United States. “I think this goes beyond the COP venue,” she said. “Because something that is being challenged is the rule-based international order. We need the multilateralism, the global cooperation in order to face global challenges. So, we need to ensure this complicated bureaucratic process that enables the further capacity to act together. . . . Please, let’s stay together. Let’s push for more. And let’s identify and ‘name and shame’ those” who are unwilling to do more.[^34]

“Shaming and honoring are very important” for managing a commons, Ostrom told an interviewer in 2010. “A lot of communities have figured out subtle ways of making everyone contribute, because if they don’t, those people are noticeable.”[^35]

Sometimes, however, naming and shaming aren’t strong enough. “The only enforcement mechanism that we know of in international environmental law that works,” law professor Dan Cole told me, “are trade sanctions.”

As ambition waned in the middle of COP25’s second week, delegates contemplated how trade sanctions could be used against rogue countries. For example, a border adjustment tax would, effectively, put a tax on imports from noncompliant countries. This would prevent noncompliant countries from gaining a competitive advantage on trade, compared with those with ambitious climate goals. The World Trade Organization, which sets the rules on international trade, finds this acceptable. It prevents countries from undercutting one another in a “race to the bottom” on environmental regulations.[^36]

Climate law expert Markus Gehring of Cambridge University noted that informal trade talks between the United States and the United Kingdom sparked the ire of protesters. In leaked documents, the US negotiators said that climate change is a “lightning rod issue,” and they are prohibited by law from discussing “greenhouse gases” in trade deals. In a conversation with me, Gehring speculated that it would be difficult for the United Kingdom to enter into a trade agreement with the United States—something it will certainly need after leaving the European Union—while maintaining its pledge to be carbon neutral by midcentury.

But Gehring also noted there may be additional points of leverage. Take, for example, national security. Every country has an obligation to secure its citizens. Climate change poses a national security threat to every country on the planet. Even the US Department of Defense called climate change a “threat multiplier.”[^37] Climate change reduces the preparedness of the armed forces when the oceans flood naval bases and warming-enhanced storms destroy fighter jets.[^38] Climate change also can be the spark that ignites a conflict that requires US military intervention. Gehring said on Twitter, “If climate change is recognized by the UN Security Council as one of the most important security issues of the future, should it not be a precondition for NATO to participate in the Paris Agreement?” This could further isolate the United States from its trading and security partners.

In a 2009 interview, Elinor Ostrom said,

Collective action is the name for a lot of social dilemmas where if I’m a good guy and I really contribute but all the other people that I’m interacting with don’t, I become a sucker. And so, the theory earlier said because you’re worried about being a sucker, you won’t do anything. You’ll just be really narrow and selfish. Well, if I trust others to reciprocate, any action I make helps them, then all of us could be much better off!

This is the reason that social dilemmas are dilemmas. That if we are narrow and selfish we come out much worse than if we are interested in the common good. But we’ve got to somehow get over the problems that people will screw one another upon occasion. We have to find ways of using sanctions and other mechanisms to make sure that the people who are not trusting or trustworthy and using reciprocity are discovered and encouraged to change their ways or not participate—get out! So, trust and reciprocity are right smack dab in the core of the theoretical developments we’ve been taking.

One of the ways you build trust is monitoring and sanctioning so that people who are not trustworthy are made aware that they have to pay a price. And you may convince them to be trustworthy because they’ve been monitored. So, they are very closely linked. And if you have absolutely no monitoring and the son of a gun can get away with being a son of a gun, slowly but surely you unravel any level of collective action that others have taken. They just get mad.[^39]

![[ch6f3.png]]

Trust and reciprocity. Everything about sustaining a commons hinges on trust and reciprocity. Resource users, whether an individual or a country, will only restrain their consumption if they trust others to do the same. So, when a resource user says to the others, “I will not be restrained,” then the whole commons is at risk. A trust once broken is hard to recover.

One of Ostrom’s design principles for managing the commons is resource users who are most affected by the rules should have a say in rule making. This embodies the idea of reciprocity. The rules that apply to you also apply to me.

Rule making under the Paris Agreement is a highly inclusive process. Critics complain that including almost two hundred countries makes the negotiations slow and cumbersome. But inclusivity is a hallmark of the UN process, and it aligns with Ostrom’s design principles.

The United States’ withdrawal from the Paris Agreement became official on November 4, 2020. The United States could re-enter the agreement under a future president. Regardless of its Paris Agreement status, the United States remains a powerful voice on writing the Paris rulebook. The United States remains a signatory to the UNFCCC and will continue to participate in future COPs. Even though it will not have a vote on rules related to the Paris Agreement, it still holds considerable power. One COP25 attendee told Climate Home News, “If [the US] is not going to play the game, why would it continue to direct the rules of the game?”[^40] The US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement puts into question its commitment to trust and reciprocity.

The lack of strong US leadership at COP25 enabled other large emitters to weaken their commitments. Instead of enhancing the ambition of the pledges, the final documents call for countries to merely “communicate or update” their pledges by 2020. The United States, Brazil, and China were successful in their efforts to water down the language.[^41] On the other hand, eighty countries agreed to increase their emissions reduction pledges next year. The European Union joined seventy-three countries that pledged to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The COP25 finished much as it had started: with uncertainty. For a time, it was unclear if there even would be a COP in 2019 after Brazil and Chile bailed on their commitments to host the meeting. Expectations were low. Many were disappointed with the results of COP25, including UN Secretary General António Guterres. “The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation & finance to tackle the climate crisis,” he said on Twitter. “But we must not give up, and I will not give up.”

Most of the big technical decisions about the rules to implement the Paris Agreement were kicked down the road to future meetings. The executive secretary of UNFCCC reflected on the path forward. “As we head towards the UN Climate Change Conference COP26 in Glasgow,” Patricia Espinosa wrote, “we must be united and work in a true spirit of inclusive multilateralism in order to realize the promises of the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.”

Trust and reciprocity. It’s the golden rule—“Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.” We’ll need a generous helping of trust and reciprocity to keep the “son of a gun” big emitters in line and prevent the Paris Agreement from unraveling.

In November 2020, as this book goes to press, Joe Biden won the presidential election. He pledged to recommit the US to the Paris Agreement on his first day in office.  

## CHAPTER 7

## Voluntary Environmental Programs

Mayor George Heartwell wanted to leave an enduring mark, a legacy of sustainability, on the city he loved. After twelve years as mayor of Grand Rapids, Michigan, a new term-limit law prohibited Heartwell from running for re-election. Heartwell had made sustainability the core of his governing philosophy. But he had done so in the pragmatic, conservative approach for which Grand Rapids is known. Sustainability in governance was linked to sustainable business. The office furniture industry has deep roots in this part of the country. Steelcase and Herman Miller, local firms with a global reach, have been pioneering sustainable manufacturing practices such as zero-waste facilities for decades. Heartwell, in his final months as mayor, wanted to bring the private and public sectors together to continue their collaborations for a sustainable Grand Rapids.

Heartwell looked around and found the 2030 Districts program. A project of the American Institute of Architecture, the 2030 Districts are a network of cities that encourage building owners to cut their energy use, water use, and transportation emissions by 2030. The 2030 Districts are led by the private sector in partnership with local governments and community stakeholders. When Heartwell was leaving office in 2015, eleven other cities had already established 2030 Districts. A 2030 District in Grand Rapids could be the legacy project for which Heartwell was looking.

The mayor recruited the city’s chapter of the US Green Building Council to serve as the 2030 District coordinating organization. They drew the 2030 District boundary around Grand Rapids downtown core and invited building owners to join voluntarily. Commercial building owners signed on, from a small florist shop to Founders Brewing Company. Community stakeholders supported it too. Heartwell and his team were able to officially launch the Grand Rapids 2030 District just weeks before his term ended. With the new mayor’s support, the Grand Rapids 2030 District continued to grow. The Grand Rapids district soon enrolled forty-two building owners covering sixteen million square feet of building space. Building owners cut their energy and water use and saved money in the process. What’s good for business can be good for the environment. It’s a commonsense approach that resonates across the political spectrum. Today, there are twenty 2030 Districts operating across North America, from Toronto to Tucson.

Generations of economics students have endured their professors’ groan-inducing joke: Two economists walk down a busy street and see a twenty-dollar bill on the sidewalk. The young one says, “Oh look, is that a twenty-dollar bill?” The senior economist replies, “It can’t be. If it were real, someone would have picked it up already.” In an efficient economy, business owners are always looking for ways to reduce costs and maximize profits. If there were easy ways to save money, then business owners would have found them.

Building owners pay for energy use, so they already have an economic incentive to save money by saving energy. And yet, many building owners have not invested optimally in energy efficiency. It’s like leaving twenty-dollar bills all over the place. In the economists’ ideal world, building owners would have scooped up these bills by the handful long ago. They wouldn’t need the government or the 2030 District to tell them about it.

Experts call this difference between the ideal and observed investments in efficiency the “efficiency gap.” And it’s totally understandable. If you run a pizzeria, then you are going to spend your time learning how to make the best pizzas at the most reasonable cost. The pizza maker’s expertise is in mozzarella and pepperoni, not insulation and heat pumps. There are practical limits to a person’s knowledge.

Many organizations, such as the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), make energy efficiency information available and easy to find. Some products have Energy Star labels to make it even easier. But it is still up to the business owner to learn about energy efficiency and make the investment. And a pizzeria owner might rather spend money on something he knows well, like a new oven, rather than risk money on efficiency measures that might not pan out. So, despite the best efforts of efficiency advocates, the energy efficiency gap persists.

There’s a popular proverb that says, “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.”[^1] Cities are the source of 70 percent of the world’s carbon emissions. So, cities have a long way to go in reducing their reliance on fossil fuels and associated pollutants. But, as the proverb suggests, that journey might be easier if building owners and cities work together.

The 2030 District program creates a community in which building owners and other participants can work together to achieve the shared goals. The participants within a city’s 2030 District can encourage and hold each other accountable for making efficiency investments. They can share knowledge about what practices work best in their particular cities. And the 2030 Districts introduce a bit of positive peer pressure. It’s possible that this community-based approach might work better than going it alone.

The 2030 Districts are just one example of “environmental clubs” that promote the adoption of green practices.[^2] These clubs operate like the Paris Agreement but on a small scale. Companies make voluntary pledges to reduce energy use or pollution and then hold each other accountable. If it can work at this small scale, perhaps there is hope for nations to follow suit.

But questions remain. Why would building owners voluntarily join the 2030 District program? Saving a few bucks on an electricity bill is one thing. But committing to cut energy use by 50 percent compared with a national baseline? That’s a big ask. Are there really that many proverbial twenty-dollar bills laying around the pizzeria? Can 2030 District participants hold each other accountable for meeting their targets?

The 2030 District and other environmental clubs take what was a private decision—to invest in energy efficiency—and turn it into a collective action. Late in life, Elinor Ostrom turned her attention to climate change. She suggested that we need to act at multiple levels, including the local, regional, and national, and involve the public and private sectors. She called this a “polycentric” approach to climate governance. Two Indiana University graduate students, Matthew Potoski and Aseem Prakash, picked up where she left off. Potoski and Prakash used Ostrom’s foundational ideas to develop a “club theory” of voluntary environmental action. Their club theory might hold the key to solving environmental challenges across scales.

![[logo.png]]

Enlightenment-era philosopher Thomas Hobbes wrote, “Covenants, without the sword, are but words and of no strength to secure a man at all.”[^3] This phrase turns up again and again in Potoski and Prakash’s work. Voluntary environmental agreements are only as good as their enforcement.

Voluntary environmental agreements offered a reprieve from heavy-handed regulations when such agreements first gained popularity in the 1980s. Top-down, “command and control” regulations were the go-to policy during the golden years of environmental regulation. The Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and other regulations passed in the 1970s required polluters to adopt specific clean-up measures without much room for flexibility. Our air and water were common-pool resources that were being rapidly degraded. The only way to stop the “tragedy of the commons” from unfolding, so the regulators thought, was top-down rules imposed by the federal and state governments or, perhaps, market-based approaches.

The regulations often worked, but businesses complained that top-down regulations were a costly way to achieve environmental goals. Businesses wanted more flexible, less costly options. The regulating agencies didn’t have the staff to monitor pollution at all the sites and enforce the laws. Some conservative scholars suggested taking a market-based approach. Pollution taxes would provide a market-based incentive for firms to invest in clean technologies. Cap-and-trade programs set up markets in which firms could buy and sell pollution permits. Firms that reduced their pollution could sell their excess permits and make money. The regulating agency, which issued the permits, would reduce the number of permits over time. The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments created a cap-and-trade program to address the acid rain problem. Headlines about acid rain and the decimated forests and lakes of the Northeast, once common, are now rare. The cap-and-trade program largely solved the acid rain problem and did so at a lower cost than top-down regulations.

Ostrom’s work, as usual, pointed to a third way. If communities could manage common fisheries and forests without top-down government intervention or private markets, perhaps industries could reduce their pollution voluntarily in a similar way. By the 1980s and 1990s, some agencies and nongovernmental organizations were experimenting with voluntary approaches to reduce pollution. For example, the EPA ran a voluntary program called 33/50 in the early 1990s. The EPA challenged participating firms to reduce their emissions of certain toxic materials by 1995. Likewise, the International Standards Organization created the ISO 14001 standard for environmental management. Firms could choose to adopt these environmental practices voluntarily.

Some critics, however, were skeptical. Firms had no real incentive to invest voluntarily in pollution control technologies. That would cost money and cut into profits. In the meantime, the firm’s competitors might decline such measures and get a leg up on the competition. As Ostrom said, “Nobody wants to be a sucker.” Voluntary programs seemed like a sucker’s bet.

Even worse, the voluntary program might “greenwash” a polluting industry. Firms and whole industries could tout they adopted these voluntary measures and hold off the regulators. Whether the participating firms were actually reducing pollution would be a mystery. Environmentalists didn’t trust the polluters to police themselves. An unsuspecting public, however, might think the polluters cleaned up their act. Voluntary programs might just put a green coat of paint on a dirty process.

By the middle of the 1990s, industry and regulators had substantial experience with voluntary programs. Environmental and social scientists had enough examples to evaluate whether voluntary programs really worked. And that’s when graduate student Aseem Prakash started working with Elinor Ostrom.

Unlike most of Ostrom’s students, Prakash came from a business background. He was working for Proctor and Gamble in India when he happened to see Ostrom give a talk. She impressed him with her ideas about common-pool resources. Prakash thought Ostrom’s ideas might also be useful to the business community. She encouraged Prakash to apply to the doctoral program at Indiana University. Before long, he was looking up Indiana on a map. “OK, Indiana. Very similar to India,” Prakash joked in a conversation with me.

Prakash began his research on voluntary environmental programs from the perspective of “new institutionalism.” This interdisciplinary approach blended mainstream economics, economic history, political science, and sociology. “The central message of new-institutionalism,” Prakash wrote, “is that _institutions matter_ in influencing individual-level as well as collective-level outcomes.” The institutions, according to Ostrom, are systems of rules about what actions are required, prohibited, or permitted.[^4] The mainstream economic approach looks mostly at individual actions. The new institutional perspective places that individual decision inside a community that may influence the person. That individual’s choice is guided by the community’s rules. Some rules might be formal, like speed limits. The law prohibits drivers from exceeding the speed limit. Others might be informal standards of behavior; for example, local customs, not the law, require churchgoers to silence their cell phones during the service. These rules—the institutions—affect an individual’s actions. But they also influence how others in the community respond.

Prakash applied this new institutional analysis to the question of voluntary environmental programs. He assumed that the businesses joining the voluntary programs were composed of individual decisions makers. For example, a particular manager, not “the corporation,” decides whether to reduce pollution. Prakash also embraced the idea of bounded rationality. Mainstream economic models paint people as perfectly rational and efficient decision makers. Clearly, they are not—remember the economists’ joke about twenty-dollar bills? New institutionalists, on the other hand, see people as making decisions based on reasonable rules-of-thumb. People may also act to satisfy, rather than maximize, their well-being. A person seeking to maximize income, for example, would take every opportunity to work overtime. A satisficer, on the other hand, may decline an opportunity when she’s had enough. The new institutional approach is a bit more realistic, if not messier, than the standard economic model.

Prakash wanted to know why firms would adopt voluntary environmental measures that went beyond what was required by law. Under the standard economic model, adopting “beyond compliance” measures would be irrational. From an efficiency perspective, voluntarily installing beyond-compliance pollution controls would be costly and cut into corporate profits. And yet, at least some firms participated in these voluntary programs. One program that Prakash studied was the EPA’s 33/50 program. The EPA launched it in 1991 and challenged voluntary participants to reduce their release of certain pollutants by 33 percent by 1992 and 50 percent by 1995. About one-sixth of eligible firms joined the program.

The EPA publicly recognized and praised the firms that joined the 33/50 program. The EPA also promised to report only national-level results. Importantly, the EPA did not release the names of firms that did not achieve the targets. The potential for public shaming would have scared off most of the recruits. The EPA’s voluntary program worked. The participating firms hit their 50 percent reduction target in 1994—a full year early.[^5] Prakash found that the participating firms greatly reduced the release of toxic pollutants. One pharmaceutical company that Prakash studied in depth reduced its releases by a whopping 80 percent. Participating firms reduced their pollution releases much more than the nonparticipating firms.

The participating firms spent millions of dollars on pollution controls. Prakash didn’t find any evidence that the firms were saving money, at least in the short term. So, the reason why firms would do this was still a mystery. Being a good corporate citizen may enhance the firm’s long-term prospects, but a firm’s environmental manager has to sell that idea to the leadership. Sometimes, a senior manager will embrace the idea and will use her corporate authority to just make it happen. Other times, “green leaders” emerge who convince skeptics that reducing pollution is the right thing to do for the company. That is, it might cost money now, but it will pay off in some, perhaps vague, way later on. The leaders work hard to build consensus around the voluntary action. They might convince skeptics that voluntary beyond-compliance measures might keep regulators at bay. Or the measures might build goodwill in the community that might come in handy when applying for a permit to expand a factory. These strategic benefits might not show up on the accountant’s books, but they can be advantageous nonetheless. Whether the decisions are made through corporate power or leadership, the advocate for voluntary pollution reduction frames the pollution reduction commitment as being in the long-term interest of the profit-motivated firm.

After finishing his doctoral degree, Prakash worked with a friend from his Indiana University days, Matthew Potoski. The two investigated the ISO 14001 environmental management standard, which is the most widely adopted voluntary environmental standard in the world. The ISO 14001’s appeal might be due to its weak monitoring and penalties. Skeptics could reasonably think that a program with no real enforcement would fail to reduce pollution. But once again, science proved the skeptics wrong. Potoski and Prakash found that firms adopting the ISO 14001 standard improved their environmental performance.[^6] Other scholars found similar benefits in other voluntary environmental programs.

Not all voluntary programs, however, delivered on their environmental promises. Prakash and colleagues suggested a couple of reasons for the failures. First, some voluntary programs have lenient standards and no monitoring and enforcement. Firms easily sign up, but the program provides no incentive to follow through on the pollution reduction commitments. Second, firms have a choice whether to join a voluntary program. The firms that join may already have a strong environmental commitment. They may have already taken the easy steps to improve their environmental performance. Once they join, the only improvements left to make may be costly and offer few environmental benefits.[^7] The most successful programs might be lenient enough to encourage broad participation and strict enough to improve environmental performance—a “Goldilocks” sweet spot.

In the structure of scientific thinking, theories open a window onto how a particular part of the world works. Some windows offer better views than others. Looking through the window of rational choice theory—the standard economic approach—didn’t provide a good view of voluntary programs. Spending money on reducing pollution beyond what was legally required would cut into profits. And yet here was clear evidence that firms were doing just that—and were still profitable. Researchers needed a new theory to understand voluntary programs. And that’s what Potoski and Prakash developed.

The duo drew on their previous work, especially Prakash’s experience at the Ostrom Workshop, in dealing with commons and collective action to create their “club theory” of voluntary programs. Joining a voluntary environmental program is like joining a membership-based discount store such as Sam’s Club. The customers pay the membership fee. In return, they get access to the items that the store sells at a deep discount. Customers will join if the perceived savings are greater than the membership cost. In a voluntary environmental program, the “membership fee” is the cost of installing pollution reduction equipment or a similar practice. The benefits vary by program, but they may include being listed as a preferred service provider, gaining access to special information or services, enhancing a brand’s reputation, and perhaps even attaining some real savings from more efficient operations.

A successful discount club entices customers to join by balancing its membership fees and the benefits. A discount store without a membership fee would have a lot of members, but it probably won’t be able to offer cheaper goods. On the hand, that store could offer deep discounts if the membership fee was high enough. But the high fee would be out of reach for most customers. Importantly, discount club customers must show their membership cards to get in. Only members can gain access to the discounted items.

**Box 7.1 Slug Club**

Traffic jams have something in common with Maine lobsters. They both have elements of a common-pool resource. Like lobsters, each spot on a heavily traveled freeway is rival—only one car can occupy it at a time. But freeways are also nonexclusive. As a result, more drivers try to merge onto the already crowded freeway and cause a traffic jam. High-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes try to solve this problem by making one lane exclusively for cars with multiple passengers. That alleviates the congestion on the regular lanes, increases traffic flow, and even reduces pollution. But how does a driver get an extra passenger?

“Slugging” has been the casual carpool system of Washington, DC, for decades (http://www.slug-lines.com/]]). Riders, called slugs, line up at a spot, usually next to a bus stop. Drivers will swing by the slug line to see if anyone is going their way, for example, to the Pentagon. The slugs slide in, and the driver whisks everyone to work in the HOV lane. No money is exchanged. The driver’s benefit is getting to use the fast-moving HOV lane.

But like any club, there are rules. Don’t start a conversation with the driver. Don’t eat in the car. Don’t leave a woman alone in the slug line. The informal carpooling system and the norms of courtesy organized from the bottom up, without government intervention and without a private market.

Why are they called slugs? In the early days, bus drivers would see people lined up at the bus stop but they wouldn’t get on. They were fake riders, much like the fake coins, or “slugs,” that scofflaws used to board the bus. Public transit leaders soon embraced the human slugs as a creative way to alleviate road congestion and free up space on crowded buses.

Vincent and Elinor Ostrom expanded the categories that economists use to describe goods and services.[^8] One way to describe a good is whether it gets used up. They called these “subtractable” goods. Other scholars use the term “rival” to describe a similar idea in that only one person can use the item at a given time. Another category is whether a person can exclude another from using the item. Unregulated common-pool resources are rival but nonexclusive. Each patch of grass on the common pasture is rival because only one animal can graze that patch at a time. But in an unregulated commons, herders cannot exclude anyone from bringing animals to the pasture. Rival and nonexclusive goods tend to be overused.

Club goods, on the other hand, are nonrival and exclusive. The discount store can exclude people who don’t pay the membership fee. But once inside, all members can enjoy the savings. Discounts don’t get used up like a cup of coffee. The discounts, therefore, are nonrival.

Potoski and Prakash built their club theory of voluntary programs on this foundation. The successful voluntary program will keep its benefits exclusive to its members. But it will also monitor and enforce the membership “dues”—making environmental improvements. They used the club theory to explain and predict how successful voluntary programs would be. Programs with very lenient standards and no monitoring and enforcement, what they called “weak swords,” would be ineffective. They would be easy to join, but there would be no incentive for members to actually reduce pollution. At the other extreme, clubs with very high standards for reducing pollution and strong monitoring and enforcement mechanisms would be very costly to join. Firms that join such programs might reduce pollution quite a bit, but only a few firms would voluntarily join such a program. The program’s impact would be small. Programs in the middle range in terms of membership standards and enforcement might generate the most improvements. Potoski and Prakash gave the scientific community a coherent theory to explain the behaviors they saw among firms and managers joining the voluntary programs.[^9]

“If an actor values its reputation,” Prakash told me “it needs a way to signal to external stakeholders about its good intentions.” Clubs are the way that firms, nonprofits, and other organizations can signal that they are reliable and trustworthy.

Club theory might be just the thing to help the 2030 Districts reach their goals.

**Box 7.2 Responding to COVID-19 with Collective Action**

Like bar owners across Michigan, Kyle VanStrien looked forward to reopening Long Road Distillers’ tasting rooms. In March 2020, Michigan’s governor had shut down bars and restaurants to slow the spread of COVID-19. The measure worked, and the number of new cases fell. The governor then allowed restaurants and bars to open as long as they took steps to ensure everyone’s safety.

Some establishments, however, did not follow the rules. A number of employees and patrons contracted COVID-19. Health departments ordered the offending businesses to shut down temporarily.

“We suddenly saw a whole wave of closures around West Michigan as a result of two or three different establishments where people weren’t following the rules,” VanStrien told me.

VanStrien had conversations with other bar and restaurant owners who shared his concerns for their workers and their patrons.

“We really need to establish an industry-wide standard that we can follow. And it needs to be coming from a group of like-minded businesses as opposed to the government. We appreciate the guidance we are getting from the state and the CDC. But not everybody does. Some people view it differently than us.”

“We thought about it, discussed it with other folks in our group, and we went in a completely different route. We set a standard for ourselves and for others to follow. That was kind of above and beyond what the requirements by the health department were.” They called it the Michigan Restaurant Promise. Other restaurants across the region heard about it and wanted to commit to these practices. In just a few days, the Michigan Restaurant Promise went from a small group of half a dozen establishments to include more than three hundred signatories.

If participating restaurants fail to follow the best practices, then they will be dropped from the list. VanStrien thought that would be an adequate sanction for those who violate the pledge.

“Otherwise,” he said, “it’s a list that means nothing.”

Joining a local 2030 District comes with clear costs. The building owner must commit to reducing building energy use, water use, and transportation-related greenhouse gases by 50 percent by 2030 (relative to a standardized baseline). That’s a pretty strict standard. What the building owner gets in return is murkier and harder to quantify but can be transformational.

The 2030 Districts want their members to succeed. The district leaders are not trying to play “gotcha” and catch their members shirking their responsibilities. So, the districts provide services to help the participating building owners. Each 2030 District includes service-provider stakeholders who agree to help the building owners achieve their goals. The service providers might offer some limited services for free or at a discount. The Grand Rapids 2030 District, for example, created an Energy Assistance Program specifically to help members that don’t have a specialized team of energy engineers on staff. Eligible members include small businesses, nonprofit organizations, and houses of worship.

Small businesses, said Grand Rapids 2030 District leader Cheri Holman, “are worried about getting fresh shrimp for dinner tonight, to the wait staff—whatever their business might be. They don’t have a facilities manager or an energy manager, so they are just paying their bills.” Holman said the district’s Energy Assistance Program tries to fill that gap. Building owners can get a free energy audit and can compare their energy use to similar businesses in the Energy Star Portfolio Manager tool.

“If a small business owner puts themselves into Portfolio Manager, now all of a sudden they know” how much energy they are using. And they can compare their building’s energy use to other buildings in the database. For example, a restaurant might be using 300 kBtu/ft2 while the average restaurant in the database uses about 250 kBtu/ft2.[^10] “Why is my energy use so high?” Holman said. “So, just that knowledge right there—‘Do I have a problem? Why am I abnormal?’—can be very powerful.”

Holman worked as a building contractor before leading the Grand Rapids 2030 District and its sponsoring organization, the West Michigan chapter of the US Green Building Council. “I’ve sold million-dollar projects completely based on energy efficiency,” Holman said. “They weren’t even going to buy anything. And then when I showed them their baseline and then show them the money that could be saved that was basically just going to the utility company. And then we used those funds to create a project and, lo and behold, they got all their money back within 5 years and with 1.5 million dollars in their pocket after that over the course that equipment’s lifetime. So, it’s powerful stuff once you start looking at the economics.”

That’s money in the bank for a profit-oriented business. But those savings mean something much more to mission-driven nonprofit organizations. Money saved through energy efficiency gets cycled back into their programs. For example, the Detroit 2030 District has a special focus on houses of worship. Savings are put back into the churches’ ministries. A member of the Grand Rapids 2030 District, HQ, provides services to homeless and at-risk youth.

The 2030 District’s commitment for a 50 percent reduction in building energy use sounds daunting. Technically, it is a reduction against a national baseline, not a building’s current energy use. But it is challenging enough that it can scare away potential members. Holman admits that emphasizing the 50 percent cut may have been a mistake when launching the Grand Rapids 2030 District. Some of the building managers told her, “That’s too much. I’ve already reduced so much and there’s no way I can do that.” Building managers were also concerned about failing. Holman assured them that they would not be sanctioned, for example, by shaming in the newspaper, if a building didn’t achieve its goals.

“In reality, we just need everyone at the table,” Holman said. “We need to be having these conversations. . . . Whether they can or cannot make the goal is not important.” What is important, she emphasized, was that we are all working toward it together.

**Box 7.3 Grand Rapids HQ Serves Youth While Saving Energy**

Shandra Steininger didn’t expect to become an evangelist for energy efficiency. As the executive director of HQ, Steininger spends her days running a drop-in center for runaway and homeless youth in Grand Rapids. HQ is more than just a place to grab a hot meal and a shower. Steininger and her colleagues help youth connect with nurses and therapists, get a job, and sign up for Medicaid. In its first five years, HQ served more than 1,400 young people. But like any organization, HQ has bills to pay for heating and electricity.

HQ worked with a local church to purchase and renovate its building. Soon after moving in, however, the roof started to leak. Steininger enrolled the HQ building into the Grand Rapids 2030 District because the district offered free energy audits and expertise. Steininger was surprised at what the energy auditors found. “All the heat and cooling was lost through the roof,” she said. “The roof had an R-value of two,” which, she learned, was bad. “It was like a sheet” and provided no insulation. Many of the bricks in the building’s façade lacked mortar and allowed more heat to escape. With a grant and some fundraising, HQ replaced the leaking roof and improved its R-value to 30. They fixed the masonry and insulated the pipes.

Steininger explained, “We called this the Green Umbrella project.” The roof is the building’s umbrella, protecting it from the elements. But it’s also a metaphor for HQ’s mission in protecting vulnerable youth. The color green represents the environment. It’s more than insulation, though. HQ embraces environmental design throughout the building to provide a welcoming space.

Now the staff is tracking energy use and calculating the savings. That’s money that can go back into programs for the youth that HQ serves, such as its vital document recovery program.

Ostrom highlighted the value of such conversations. Her game theorist colleagues dismissed idle chit-chat as “cheap talk.” They assumed that gathering around a table and having a conversation was pointless if it didn’t directly advance some kind of negotiation. But Ostrom found that such “cheap talk” helped build trust within the community. Communication increased cooperation. People got to know each other as real people, not variables in an equation. District members who trust each other may be more willing to share information that can be useful to the whole group. Holman said, “Put us all in a room together so that we can work on solutions together.”

![[ch7f1.png]]

Gillian Giem, Holman’s colleague at the Green Building Council, agreed. “We’re trying to facilitate the spaces in which they can talk about” energy efficiency and other issues. “They see us as an opportunity to have those conversations.”

The 2030 District echoes the “beyond compliance” work that Prakash did in the chemical industry. Most buildings are constructed to meet the state or local building codes, but no more. The building constructed to code, as Holman put it, “in all actuality is the worst building you can legally build. People act like code is good. But code is the bare minimum building you can build legally. How often do you buy something that is the bare minimum? Think about that. If there were two smoke detectors, are you going to buy the bare minimum that is barely legal or the better smoke detector? So, it’s funny to think about it that way.”

The 2030 District is a beyond-compliance approach to new construction and renovations. In Michigan, only the state government can set building codes. Cities and local governments cannot pass a building code that is stricter than the state standard. So, a beyond-compliance approach like the 2030 District is a tool that communities have to encourage the construction of buildings that exceed, perhaps by a large margin, the legal, minimum efficiency standards.

The Grand Rapids 2030 District, like most others, is relatively new. The district tends to focus on the opportunities to save money. That was one of the motivations that Prakash identified in other voluntary programs. But as building owners pick the low-hanging fruit and implement the easiest efficiency practices, they will soon exhaust them. Getting to the interim target, 20 percent reduction in building energy use by 2020, takes effort, but it is not insurmountable. Four districts have already achieved it ahead of schedule. Getting a 50 percent reduction will require real sacrifices, especially without a nationwide carbon price or other regulations. The 2030 Districts will need to find new ways to motivate their members to achieve their goals. Behavioral economics, an emerging discipline the blends economics with psychology, may be helpful in this regard.

![[logo.png]]

Ostrom identified eight design principles for sustainably managing a commons (see box 4.1]]). It turns out that many of these design principles also apply to voluntary programs, like the 2030 Districts. Boundaries are important, both physical and social. In a voluntary program, the membership qualifications set the program’s social boundaries. The 2030 Districts take this a step further: each district also establishes a geographic boundary around the city’s downtown core. The district then becomes a real community with a sense of place.

Well-managed commons and voluntary programs also monitor compliance and enforce the rules, whether formal or informal. The 2030 District Network, which oversees the national program, reviews applications from prospective cities and also keeps an eye on existing districts. If a district fails to maintain its membership qualifications, the 2030 District Network could revoke its charter. Two districts faced leadership vacuums, and the groups petered out. The network demoted them to “emerging” status as they tried to regroup. The 2030 District members track their building energy use and report it, confidentially, to the district leaders. Members also commit to reducing water use and transportation-related greenhouse gases. However, most districts have not made much progress in measuring these.

In most of the cases described in this book, the community agrees on rules and sanctions those who break them. But punishing members of a voluntary program doesn’t work. They can just quit if they can’t or don’t want to achieve the program’s goals. Potential members might not even join in the first place if the penalties are too high. So, voluntary programs can’t be too hard on members if they are making a good faith effort to comply.

Reputation plays a key role here. As Prakash said, clubs offer a way for firms that care about their reputations to signal to others that they have good intentions. Firms that value their reputations want to associate with others that share that value. And they will want to distance themselves from firms that could sully that reputation. Building a reputation for environmental quality or workplace safety isn’t free. Indeed, it can be quite costly. But leading firms believe that it’s in their best long-term interest to have a sterling reputation, and they will pay for it. And they will make sure that firms who don’t share those values cannot ride on their coattails.

There is, however, yet another dimension. Instead of punishing negative behavior, clubs can encourage positive behavior. The 2030 District does this directly by providing information, access to experts, and other resources. And the 2030 District members themselves may indirectly influence the actions of other members. Experts call it a “behavioral contagion,” and it could be harnessed to achieve the 2030 District goals.

People are more likely to take up smoking if they hang around other smokers. Someone who doesn’t know any smokers is unlikely to pop into a quickie mart and buy a pack of cigarettes. Smoking is a prime example of a behavioral contagion. Social scientists have found other examples of social harms that spread by behavioral contagions. But behavioral contagions can also enhance the public good.[^11]

Two economists studied the installation of residential solar panels in California.[^12] They found that homes with solar panels tended to cluster together. One might think that certain neighborhoods are better suited for solar panels: they might get more sun or have fewer trees. But the economists took a closer look at when the panels were installed. They found that when one homeowner installed solar panels, their neighbors were more likely to get them later on. Neighbors installed panels at a higher rate when they were visible from the street. Word-of-mouth conversations also facilitated more installations.

Behavioral economists also showed that such contagions explain, in part, why gas guzzling SUVs caught on in the 1990s. Once associated with military and off-road vehicles, SUV sales took off once wealthy people started buying luxury Range Rovers. But behavioral contagions also explain why the Toyota Prius’s funky style made it the best-selling hybrid car. Other brands sold hybrids too, but they looked the same as their conventional models. The Prius’s unusual look and unique name sent a signal to other drivers. Hybrids weren’t just for hippies. The contagion spread and paved the way for plug-in hybrids and fully electric vehicles.[^13]

The 2030 Districts could facilitate positive behavioral contagions for energy and water efficiency. There is some evidence that it might be happening. People can see their neighbor’s rooftop solar panels, but building owners can’t see a new air conditioning system or insulation. Building owners can, however, talk about these things at the 2030 District meetings. That word-of-mouth sharing of information, especially from a trusted source, can encourage others to adopt an efficiency practice. It can even inspire a bit of friendly competition.

“We all know that competition is one of our greatest human motivations,” said Gillian Giem, Holman’s colleague in Grand Rapids. “But that’s why we’re competitive too, because we want to be admired.”

“As is shown in Battle of the Buildings,” Holman chimed in. The Battle of the Buildings is another energy efficiency competition organized by the US Green Building Council, separate from the 2030 District. Whoever makes the biggest improvement in building energy efficiency is crowned the winner. There’s a spirit of friendly competition. Michigan State University joined recently. Their cross-state rival, the University of Michigan, “has just been commanding the competition,” Holman said. Maybe the University of Michigan was just really wasteful to begin with and could pick the low-hanging fruit. Holman said that Michigan State “can’t wait to start getting in there to see if they can beat them. It’s interesting that just competition and transparency can go a long ways.”

The scientific research and the anecdotal stories suggest that we can intentionally create settings in which these positive behavioral contagions can flourish. The 2030 Districts might be one of them.

![[logo.png]]

Voluntary environmental programs can, under the right circumstances, be effective. That’s not to say that we don’t need legally binding policies to protect public health and the environment. Building codes set a threshold, as Cheri Holman said, for the “worst building you can legally build.” Likewise, environmental regulations set a threshold for the worst environmental quality you can legally have. But we don’t have to settle for the bare minimum.

Referring to climate change, Ostrom wisely noted, “If . . . we simply wait until the big guys make a decision, we are in deep trouble.”[^14] Major environmental policies come around once in a generation. Meanwhile, communities grapple with climate-related disasters, industrial pollution, and traffic jams. Ostrom’s words are a call to action. They remind us that we, citizens, are not powerless. Our individual actions won’t add up to much. But by working together we can achieve great things. If you want to go far, go together.  

## CHAPTER 8

## Commons in Space

It was almost lunchtime at Iridium Satellite’s Maryland headquarters at the time of the collision. Unbeknown to Iridium, one of its communication satellites was speeding toward a derelict Russian satellite at 22,300 miles per hour (36,000 kilometers per hour). Moments later, Iridium’s engineers lost contact with their spacecraft. The two satellites collided 5 miles (8 kilometers) above the Siberian tundra. “This is the first time we’ve ever had two intact spacecraft accidentally run into each other,” a US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) official told reporters the next day. “It was a bad day for both of them.”[^1]

That collision, however, was just the beginning. The high-speed impact shattered the satellites into more than 1,500 pieces. The smallest detectable pieces were about the size of dinner plates.[^2] Each piece became a new hazard. Imagine a dinner plate whizzing through space at 22,000 miles per hour, slicing through a satellite’s solar panel or an astronaut’s space suit. Luckily, the International Space Station’s orbit was well below that of the colliding satellites. The astronauts aboard were safe.

That collision in February 2009 was the most destructive accidental space collision to date. Three other spacecraft, none manned, had previously collided with space junk. But not every collision is accidental. Two years before the Iridium incident, China used a ballistic missile to intentionally destroy an old spacecraft. What was once a weather satellite was now 2,500 pieces of space junk. That was a sharp jump in what has been a steady increase in the number of useful spacecraft, old rocket bodies, and fragments of space junk orbiting Earth.[^3]

Space junk, or orbital debris as it is formally known, is such a big problem that NASA has a whole office dedicated to it. The astrophysicists and engineers use sophisticated radar systems to track the more than 18,000 pieces of space junk threatening to tear through our satellites and space stations. The number grows by about 300 pieces a year.[^4] Some pieces fall into the atmosphere and burn up while others collide and create new fragments. But even a postage-stamp-sized fleck of paint, traveling at supersonic speed, poses a threat. These are too small for NASA to track.

The International Space Station narrowly averted disaster in 2011 when NASA alerted the crew to approaching space junk. The astronauts scrambled into their emergency escape pods. “They would be one command away from releasing the hooks and undocking,” the flight director told the _New York Times_. Only a quarter of a mile (400 meters) separated the space station from a catastrophic impact.[^5]

The dedicated scientists at NASA’s Orbital Debris Program are working to keep astronauts safe and vital technology intact. They are also working to avoid a global catastrophe known as the “Kessler Syndrome.” The Kessler Syndrome has inspired many science fiction novels, but it is frighteningly real. In 1978, NASA scientist Donald Kessler was studying orbital debris.[^6] He realized that random collisions between orbiting objects would create more pieces of space junk, just like what happened when those satellites collided in 2009. Those pieces could hit other pieces, creating more space junk. If it passed a critical threshold, the cascading creation of space junk could create a debris belt that would destroy anything moving through it.

The consequences of the Kessler Syndrome in its most severe form would be nothing short of devastating for our tech-dependent society. Communication satellites, television, and even cash machines could all be knocked out in the worst-case scenarios. Stores might not be able to process credit cards. Our tech-reliant military forces would be compromised.[^7] So much of our daily lives depend on satellites. But this would not happen all at once. We won’t suddenly go dark like in a science fiction movie. More likely, it will happen slowly like a glacier retreating.

Kessler and his colleagues more recently found that much of the orbital space is already littered with a concerning amount of space junk. They wrote in 2010 that the most popular orbits for communication and other satellites “are predicted to be above the runaway threshold.”[^8] There is already enough space junk zipping around Earth to sustain an unstoppable chain reaction of collisions. That’s the fuel. All that is lacking is the match.

So, when India blew up one of its defunct satellites in April 2019, the space debris world was on high alert. Jim Bridenstine, NASA’s director, called a town hall meeting criticizing the intentional creation of space junk. “That kind of activity is not compatible with the future of human spaceflight that we need to see have happen,” he told attendees.[^9] India’s prime minister celebrated the event, which used a ballistic missile to destroy the broken satellite. In his eyes, it was a technological achievement. India joined the United States, Russia, and China in the club of nations that have shot down their own satellites—and presumably could do the same to those of their foes. Although the debris posed a short-term risk to the astronauts in the International Space Station, NASA expected most of the space junk to eventually burn up as it entered the atmosphere. This would not be the match that set off a Kessler Syndrome event. Each additional piece of space junk, however, increases the chances that it will happen.

“The orbital debris problem is a classic ‘tragedy of the commons’ problem but on a global scale,” Kessler said in a 2012 video.[^10] “If we don’t change the way we operate in space, all this results in an exponentially increasing amount of debris until all objects are reduced to a belt of orbiting fragments that are capable of destroying any spacecraft that attempts to operate anywhere in that cloud.”

Brian Weeden, a space policy expert at the Secure World Foundation, compared the Kessler Syndrome with climate change. That is, it’s a long-term issue that needs to be constantly managed rather than quickly and discretely resolved. Scientists have been warning of the dangers of climate change for decades. Similarly, Don Kessler warned about the problems of space debris back in 1978. Yet little has been done about either one.

“The reason I say it’s more like climate change is that the actual change in the risk grows rather slowly,” Weeden said to me in an interview. As the debris accumulates, “it’s just a little more costly, a little more risky.” But like the rising seas that inevitably will flood coastal cities, the day will come when it is too costly and too risky to send valuable objects—and people—into space. That is, unless we start actively managing space junk in the orbital commons.

So, how can we change the way we operate in space to reduce—or even remove—space junk? More generally, how can we sustain all of outer space’s resources, including orbital slots, mineral-rich asteroids, and even territory on the Moon or Mars? Members of the space policy community are actively discussing how to sustain space resources. Some experts consider space a “global commons” whereas others selectively apply the term commons to orbital resources. Still others are skeptical of whether outer space can really be called a commons at all.

Although she did not study space commons specifically, Ostrom did tackle the challenge of global commons. Global commons are, by one definition, regions that are beyond the legal jurisdiction of any country.[^11] These include outer space as well as Antarctica, the high seas, the deep-sea bed, the global climate system, biodiversity, and even the radio frequency spectrum and the internet.

![[logo.png]]

For much of her career, Ostrom focused on how local communities managed their common-pool resources. These resources occupied a defined geographic area and had a relatively small number of participants. Even in LA’s sprawling metropolis, only a few dozen groundwater managers were involved in each basin’s decision-making process. Establishing clear boundaries, both physical and social, was the first of Ostrom’s eight design principles.

Soon after she wrote _Governing the Commons_, however, Ostrom turned her attention to the challenge of global commons.[^12] It wasn’t immediately clear that her design principles would work for global commons. Global commons, for example, do not have clear boundaries; or, perhaps, the boundary is the entire planet. Can the lessons of lobster fishing or irrigation really help resolve global problems like climate change and space debris? Ostrom and her colleagues set to find out.

Ostrom and her Workshop colleague Michael McGinnis had an inkling that their previous work could be useful for managing global commons. They noted that the general structure of some global problems is often similar to that of local commons. Ostrom defined common-pool resources as being subtractable—that is, it can be used up—and hard to exclude people from using. With lobsters, each critter caught in a trap is subtracted from the population. And, practically speaking, anyone with a trap can catch a lobster. It’s hard to keep people out of the harbor without everyone working together. So, lobsters meet Ostrom’s definition of a common-pool resource at the local scale.

Brian Weeden, the space policy expert, made a strong case for thinking of low-Earth orbit as a common-pool resource. “The density of how we use space is very lumpy,” Weeden said. “There’s quite a lot of stuff between three hundred and roughly a thousand kilometers in orbit.” This, called low-Earth orbit, is the most valuable real estate in space. In this region, communication satellites relay phone calls, Earth-observing satellites take pictures of forest fires, and spy satellites track military movements. It’s crowded. But the orbits beyond 625 miles (1,000 kilometers) are not as useful until you get way out to about 12,500 miles (20,000 kilometers) and the stationary orbits.

Two objects can’t occupy the same orbit at the same time or else they’ll crash. As low-Earth orbit gets more crowded, the limited number of orbital “slots” gets used up. But low-Earth orbits don’t belong to any single country. No planetary police force will stop someone from putting a satellite into orbit. In Ostrom’s terms, low-Earth orbit fits the description of a common-pool resource but at a global scale. The same reasoning applies to other space resources, such as asteroids or ice on the Moon.

Ostrom and McGinnis also reasoned that their work on local commons is a pretty good place to start thinking about global commons. It would certainly save a lot of research time. Instead of starting from scratch, they could explore how global commons are similar to and different from local commons. Low-Earth orbit might be a common-pool resource but it, and other global commons, might have unique attributes and challenges.

Finally, Ostrom and McGinnis noted that some global problems result from inadequate solutions at the local scale. This is probably true for deforestation in the tropics, biodiversity loss, and global climate change. It’s less clear how this might relate to space commons. For now, space is the domain of a handful of rich countries and big corporations.

Ostrom, however, was cautious about extending the analogy of local commons to global challenges. After all, it was Hardin’s analogy of the common pasture—taken too far—that began this whole journey. Some communities did fail to manage their commons sustainably, even with just a few dozen users. What happens when you involve seven billion users of a global commons?

Ostrom and her colleagues soberly assessed the evidence.[^13] They identified several challenges that are particular to global commons. First was what she called the “scaling-up problem.” Just as adults are not simply large children, global commons are not simply enormous local commons. Adults and children have different physiologies. A treatment that works on children may not be appropriate, even at a larger dose, for adults. Likewise, the prescriptions for managing local commons may not be appropriate for global commons. Having many participants further complicates the management of a commons. Seven billion participants would be an impossible number to manage. If countries, rather than individual people, are considered the resource users, then the challenge is more manageable.

In a local commons, the residents often share the same language, ethnicity, level of income, and other traits. These commonalities are not necessary for sustainable management of a commons, but they help people to understand each other’s predicaments. The world, on the other hand, is incredibly diverse. People speak thousands of languages, hold a wide range of political opinions, and earn a wide range of incomes. This diversity makes our world a wonderful place to explore and celebrate, but it does pose a challenge for managing a global commons.

Ostrom also noted that all kinds of things, such as technology, migrations, and economic growth, are changing fast. These rapid global changes are stressing global commons in ways we do not fully understand. In the space realm, the amount of stuff in orbit keeps growing. We have already passed the threshold for a Kessler Syndrome chain reaction.

Compliance with any global treaty or agreement is, at the end of the day, voluntary. And considering that “nobody wants to be a sucker,” it is critical to have unanimous agreement on the rules for managing a global commons. These conditions make it very difficult to draft and enforce strict rules for managing a global commons.

“We have only one globe with which to experiment,” Ostrom noted.[^14] This is perhaps the most important difference between a global and local commons. At the local level, communities could experiment with different rules or enforcement mechanisms. People can learn from others’ successes and failures. But Earth is our only home. We get only one shot at sustaining a global commons.

“These new challenges clearly erode the confidence with which we can build from the past and current examples of successful management to tackle the [common-pool resource] problems of the future,” Ostrom and colleagues wrote. “Still, the lessons from successful examples of [common-pool resource] management provide starting points for addressing future challenges.”[^15]

Surmounting these challenges and sustaining a global commons, Ostrom wrote, “will require forms of communication, information, and trust that are broad and deep beyond precedent, but not beyond possibility.”

Ostrom left us with the tools to address these global challenges, but the work is up to us.

For many years and across administrations, the US government has taken a clear stance on space as a global commons: it is not. At least that is what the lawyers say.

From a legal perspective, the United States has never identified outer space or space resources as a global commons. Administrations, both Republican and Democratic, have rejected the idea of legally defining outer space as a global commons. Scott Pace, the executive secretary of the US National Space Council, clearly laid out the Trump Administration’s position on space as a global commons.

 

Finally, many of you have heard me say this before, but it bears repeating: outer space is not a “global commons,” not the “common heritage of mankind,” not “res communis,” nor is it a public good. These concepts are not part of the Outer Space Treaty, and the United States has consistently taken the position that these ideas do not describe the legal status of outer space.[^16]

An attorney advisor at the US Department of State who handles international space law issues spoke to me on background about the space commons. He suggested two reasons why the United States and some other governments reject the idea of space as a global commons.

“One is the legal reason,” he said; “it’s not actually the term used in the Outer Space Treaty.” The second reason reflected how the word “commons” could be misinterpreted. “We don’t see the commons concept as super helpful because it means so many different things to so many different people.”

The Outer Space Treaty is the Magna Carta of space policy. Ratified in 1967, the treaty lists the rights and responsibilities for space-faring countries. It has been adopted by more than one hundred countries, including the United States.

“When you read the space treaties, the word ‘commons’ never appears,” Henry Hertzfeld told me in an interview. Hertzfeld directs the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University. “But what they’re aimed at is finding solutions to common problems and common issues that all nations—it’s nations, not people, in these treaties—deal with when we’re dealing with issues of outer space. . . . This is not an argument for anarchy or no rules or governments. But it is not a commons in the way we deal with commons . . . on our terrestrial environment.”

Hertzfeld offered some guidance about the treaty’s language. “Be careful about reading the full title of the Outer Space Treaty.” The full title is the _Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies_. You can see why people refer to it simply as the Outer Space Treaty.

![[ch8f1.png]]

“Because this is not a treaty about space,” Hertzfeld continued. “It is a treaty about how humans explore and use space.” Just like Jim Acheson told his fisheries colleagues, “You’re not managing fish, you’re managing people,” Hertzfeld noted that we are not managing space, we are managing people.

True to its name, the Outer Space Treaty outlines broad principles on how to explore and use space. It does not declare space to be a nature preserve. Instead, it defines space and celestial bodies as something to be explored and used. The treaty’s first article declares:

 

The exploration and use of outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, shall be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all countries, irrespective of their degree of economic or scientific development, and shall be the province of all mankind.[^17]

According to the treaty, it is the exploration and use of outer space that is the province of all humankind, not space itself. This is a critical distinction. The treaty never defines what kind of resource outer space is—a commons, private property, or something else. It only refers to how people use it.

Ostrom used a specific, technical definition for a common-pool resource—one that is subtractable (alternatively “rival”) and nonexclusive. But not everyone knows or uses this technical definition, especially when simplified as “commons.” In nontechnical contexts, some people might interpret a commons to mean people have access to a resource, but no one really owns it. Others might think the term implies joint ownership of the resource or perhaps a moral or ethical obligation to share the benefits from a commons. With so many different interpretations of a seemingly simple word, it’s no wonder that the lawyers avoid it.

“Space—the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship _Enterprise_.”[^18] These opening lines of _Star Trek_ evoke the most optimistic qualities of the American frontier. The mythical frontier offered vast resources and individual liberty. The mythical frontier was, to nineteenth-century scholars like Frederick Jackson Turner, the source of America’s uniquely democratic character, “that restless, nervous energy; that dominant individualism, working for good and for evil.”[^19] And evil was abundant on the frontier as well. For more than a century, the United States engaged in the genocide of Native American peoples. Frontier towns could be lawless places filled with gunmen and swindlers. The frontier can be both a dream and a nightmare.

In the utopian world of _Star Trek_, space is for peaceful exploration, “to seek out new life and new civilizations.”[^20] This vision presents the space environment that is mostly free of warfare, commercialization, and corporate control. Many real scientists, engineers, and space enthusiasts in the United States shared this vision, especially during the 1960s and 1970s “golden age” of space policy. The view was so prevalent, in fact, that President Gerald Ford directed NASA to change the name of the prototype space shuttle. Its new name: the USS _Enterprise_.[^21]

But _Star Trek_’s utopian vision is not universally embraced. Brian Weeden, the space policy expert, noted that some libertarians see space as a different kind of utopia. Weeden said that some libertarians “view outer space as this one last place that you can escape to and not have to deal with regulations, and taxation and that kind of stuff.” It’s a future of innovation that is unencumbered by government red tape. Think of Elon Musk and SpaceX.

These two extreme visions more or less align with Garrett Hardin’s prescriptions for managing a commons—government regulation or privatization. A powerful central government plays the dominant role in the Trekkie scenario. It imposes restrictions and finances space exploration. National governments may even cede some of their sovereignty to some international bureaucracy that oversees resource use. In the libertarian scenario, privatizing space enables entrepreneurs to innovate and earn a profit. Like the 1849 gold rush, corporations scramble to secure claims to mineral-rich asteroids and other resources. Government’s role is limited to enforcing private property rights for the resources.

Weeden said that discussions of space policy have, for decades, been polarized between these two extremes. There was little hope that space users themselves, including governments and commercial actors, could collaboratively manage the space resources as a commons. Weeden looked for a way to frame the discussions of space resources that could bring these two polarized sides together. Ostrom’s design principles helped him identify that middle ground.

“I stumbled across Ostrom in the sense that we had this whole debate that had been going on in the space world for a long time now about how do . . . we talk about space governance, particularly as we grow into commercial uses of space and other things. I came across Ostrom’s work and I thought it was a very useful way to bridge that divide between . . . the traditional two camps of thought.” He continued, “I do think it’s added to the background discussion and debate we are still having.”

![[logo.png]]

The “golden age” of space policy began with the 1967 Outer Space Treaty and ended with the Moon Agreement, which entered force in 1984. During the intervening years, the international space community ratified three other space treaties. These dealt with rescuing stranded astronauts, defining liability for collisions and other mishaps, and keeping a registry of all objects launched into space. The United States signed all of these except the Moon Agreement.

The United States was not alone in finding the Moon Agreement problematic. None of the major space-faring nations—the United States, Russia, or China—has accepted it. These space superpowers disagree with how the Moon Agreement treats natural resources. It uses terminology that departs from the Outer Space Treaty. And, as we’ve seen, terminology can make lawyers nervous.

The Outer Space Treaty never defines a property rights regime for outer space. It does not use the words commons, common property, or common-pool resource. The treaty does say that “outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.”[^22] For example, a country cannot claim the Moon, or a portion of its surface, as part of its territory. But can a private company claim an asteroid as its private property? The Outer Space Treaty doesn’t say.

The Moon Agreement goes much further than the Outer Space Treaty in defining how lunar resources would be managed. It declares that the “Moon and its natural resources are the common heritage of mankind.”[^23] It states that the Moon’s natural resources shall not “become the property of any State, international intergovernmental or non-governmental organization, national organization or non-governmental entity or of any natural person.” Any use of lunar resources would be governed by an international regime. This governing body would oversee the resource’s rational management and equitable sharing of its benefits.

A state department official, speaking on background, described a more limited, business-friendly role for space policy moving forward. “The US is interested in providing a framework that is transparent, predictable, and pro-industry for our [US-based] industry as well as other likeminded countries that share our vision and our values in outer space.” The official noted that “we’re going to have to utilize the resources of outer space” if we are going to have a sustained presence beyond low-Earth orbit. If the Moon Agreement discourages commercial use of those lunar resources, then future exploration is unlikely to happen.

The “big government” approach to managing space commons, as exemplified by the Moon Agreement, is a nonstarter. The United States strongly opposes it as do all of the other major space-faring nations. Although commercial space activities are gaining momentum, national governments still have a major role to play. The world is not yet ready for a completely privatized, market-based approach to space. That leaves us with a middle ground where governments, the commercial sector, and nongovernmental organizations at multiple scales will need to manage outer space as a suite of commons.

![[logo.png]]

If it looks like a duck, swims like duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.

Even if the lawyers and diplomats do not define outer space as a commons, some parts of it still have the traits of a common-pool resource in the technical sense. Ostrom’s ideas about the management of global and local commons might have some practical significance for these particular space resources.

Space policy expert Brian Weeden, along with colleague Tiffany Chow, similarly concluded that describing space as a single “global commons” is not very useful.[^24] Rather, space includes many resources that may require different property rights regimes. One can imagine at least four common-pool resources in space. Low-Earth orbit is clearly one and space resources—asteroids, lunar resources, and such—are another. Satellites rely on specific radio frequencies to communicate with terrestrial receivers. So, radio frequencies, in space as on Earth, can be a commons. Finally, some weather and communication satellites hover above a particular spot on Earth in what’s called geostationary orbit. Geostationary orbits are high above low-Earth orbit and can be considered a distinct commons.

“I think my main argument here is there are probably lots of different types of economic zones in the entirety of the outer space environment,” Weeden told me. “There’s going to be, and this is heretical with some in the space world, but I think there’s going to be some things that are going to be private property rights. There are some things that are going to be a global commons. And there are some things that are going to be [local] common-pool resources. The debate we were having more robustly in the space world is what’s what.”

The challenge, according to Weeden, is that “we really don’t have a solid governance framework for space. We have the treaties that outline these broad principles. Everything else is sort of state practice and interpretation and there’s not a lot of codification. That’s why I was originally looking to Ostrom’s work to sort of help the discussions.” Ostrom’s ideas just might be the tool for which he was looking.

Most of Ostrom’s eight design principles map pretty well on to the way we govern low-Earth orbits. Three of the principles, however, stand out. First is the principle of monitoring the resource. In order to govern a common-pool resource sustainably, we need to be able to monitor the resource and those doing the monitoring should be accountable to the resource users.

“That gets to a really big issue in space which we call space situational awareness,” Weeden explained. “That’s basically knowledge about the space environment and activities in it. It’s typically done with ground-based radars and telescopes that are tracking space debris, tracking satellites, sort of monitoring what’s going on.”

Space situational awareness typically requires a big technology investment. It also has the properties of a “public good,” such as a lighthouse. The lighthouse’s beacon doesn’t get used up when ships see it, but you also can’t make the ship captains pay to use it. There is no opportunity for a commercial lighthouse to make a profit. So, governments usually built and operated lighthouses. Space situational awareness systems are like lighthouses for satellites, and the US government was space’s main lighthouse keeper.

However, Weeden noted that “there’s been a big change in that over the last decade or so. It’s gone from being essentially done by the US military and a couple other militaries to being done by a lot more countries and now commercial actors.”

Private companies, such as LEOLabs, are building for-profit monitoring systems. Companies could, in theory, do this faster and cheaper than the US government and sell their services to governments Essentially, the US government would still be responsible for the space lighthouse, but it would outsource the day-to-day operation.

“None of them are going to say, oh we’re doing it because it’s one of Ostrom’s principles,” Weeden told me. “But at least from our internal perspective, it really reaffirmed our notion that space situational awareness [SSA] and particularly encouraging broader participation in SSA was something that we really should be pushing for and would backstop some of the governance discussions.”

The second challenge is in how the space community penalizes bad actors. China’s intentional destruction of an old weather satellite in 2007 was a pivotal case. The missile test created a tremendous amount of space debris. It violated long-established norms of behavior. The action was also out of line with the Outer Space Treaty, which says that countries have an obligation to conduct activities “with due regard” and avoid generating “harmful contamination” of the space environment.[^25] The international space community needed to let China, and the world, know that this type of activity was unacceptable.

The state department official I spoke with explained how the United States led the global response to China’s actions. “So as an international community, there was a lot of pressure put on China saying, ‘Hey this is not OK, you’ve generated a lot of debris, you weren’t transparent about it, we’re now all having to figure out as a global community to deal with this global threat, if you will, of the space debris.’”

The US policy, according to the state department official, is to ensure that the international community supports responsible conduct in space. International support is critical, the official said, “because everybody really does share this space.” The most effective way to prevent a country from going rogue and violating these expectations “is a cry from the international community and almost a public shaming as if, ‘What were you thinking? You’re ruining it for all of us.’”

Space policy professor Henry Hertzfeld shared a similar sentiment. “It’s sure generated a hell of a lot of conferences and a lot of papers that are still being written. And a lot of ‘Hey you’re a bad boy or a bad person,’ I should say. And they haven’t done it again. But they accomplished what they set out to accomplish, just as India did. And other nations might follow suit.”

And what they accomplished, according to Hertzfeld, was getting “a seat at the table.” Blowing up one of their own satellites sends a strong message. “We’ve got the technology to do things,” is how Hertzfeld put it. If a country can blow up one of its own malfunctioning satellites, it can destroy a rival nation’s equipment.

The Outer Space Treaty and its siblings strongly discourage the weaponization of space. But many space objects have both civilian and military uses. For example, a satellite can observe forest fires that threaten homes or military troop movements. Similarly, de-orbiting a rogue satellite may be a legitimate activity or a display of military might. The history of space policy is inextricably tied to national security and the Cold War arms race. The Cold War officially ended decades ago, but today’s space race is perhaps even more challenging. Instead of two superpowers, today the United States, Russia, China, India, and others are all vying not only for “a seat at the table” but also deciding what’s on the menu.

The third key principle is that resource users should have a say in writing the rules. In the fifty years since the Outer Space Treaty was negotiated, the rules have been written by and for countries. The UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) is the institution through which the space treaties and rules have been negotiated. As a UN rule-making body, COPUOS historically was limited to member countries. However, the committee has relaxed this limitation as commercial space actors have become more important.

“That principle of Ostrom’s kind of reinforced this notion that we already had, that there needs to be broader say by both the commercial sector and civil society in those governance discussions,” said Weeden.

As suggested by Ostrom, bringing the people most affected by the rule making, that is the commercial space sector, to the negotiating table has led to better rules. When the UN committee allowed the space industry to participate in rule making, industry felt like they were part of the process and that their concerns were being addressed. The state department official said that the space industry felt that “we weren’t undercutting what they were trying to do.” But it was also clear that governments didn’t have a monopoly on good ideas. “They had better practices than even us at the government level that we were able to push forward as an example of, ‘Hey, this is what we should all be aiming for.’”

Space is a complex environment. The US government, along with others, has insisted that, legally, space is not a global commons. But what is it then? The US government has not yet offered a reasonable definition. And yet, the various elements of space, from orbits to asteroids, exhibit the properties of both global and local commons. Ostrom’s ideas and analytical frameworks can help us make better decisions and sustain these vital resources.

Lin and Vincent built a rustic cabin on Manitoulin Island, Ontario, near the shores of Lake Huron. Vincent particularly enjoyed the craft of woodworking. Building the cabin offered him a chance to hone those skills. The cabin lacked electricity. The couple cooked on a propane stove and heated the house with wood. The cabin’s single room included the kitchen, and they slept in a loft above. They designed and built two writing nooks where they could work separately but still have each other close by.[^26]

Each spring for forty years, the Ostroms trekked from Bloomington to Manitoulin Island. The cabin was a retreat from hectic campus life where they could focus and write, hike and swim, and get back to basics. Colleagues in Bloomington would mail them packages of manuscripts and other items that the Ostroms would pick up at the local post office. They’d spend the week reviewing them. They’d write new papers, Lin on her manual typewriter and Vincent with his pen. Then they’d mail a package back to Bloomington. It was a very analog system in an increasingly digital world.

If the Kessler Syndrome knocked out global communications while they were on the island, they would not have known it. The Ostroms’ productivity would not be impeded in the least.

On a clear night, Lin and Vincent would have seen the night sky as people saw it for millennia, before city lights obscured all but the brightest stars. The Milky Way would have stretched out from horizon to horizon. In a dark sky, satellites can be seen with the naked eye speeding along their orbital paths.

Manitoulin Island is the largest freshwater island in the world. It is also remote and dark. It’s a perfect spot for stargazing. Just to the island’s south is Bruce Peninsula National Park, which Canada has designated as a Dark Sky Preserve. In fact, the surrounding municipality has declared itself a “dark sky community.” The dark sky movement has been working on the challenge of light pollution for decades. City dwellers benefit from street lights. Lin even included street lighting in her research on municipal services in the 1970s. But there are costs associated with lighting, and not just the cost of bulbs and electricity. Light pollution prevents people from enjoying the night sky and, perhaps more importantly, has serious effects on wildlife. Light pollution can, for example, confuse migrating birds and hunting owls. Light pollution also obscures the cosmos, forcing astronomers to set up their telescopes in more remote locations.

Astronomers chose the peaks of Chile’s Andes Mountains, just south of the Atacama Desert, to build some of the largest telescopes on the planet. The air is dry and clear. The mountains are far from Chile’s cities and their streetlights. The newest scope will survey the night sky for slight changes in each faint object. A change could mean that a supernova is exploding—or that a meteor is hurtling our way.

A new kind of pollution is emerging, however, that is compromising some astronomers’ research. This new pollution consists of the satellites themselves.

SpaceX, the private space company, launched 122 small satellites into low-Earth orbit. One November night, 19 of the satellites streaked through the Atacama telescope’s gaze. It ruined the night’s observations. That was bad enough, but it’s about to get worse. SpaceX plans to launch about 42,000 more satellites.

These satellites form the communications backbone of Elon Musk’s plan for global internet coverage. This is the cutting edge of private-sector space technology. A global internet system could be of great benefit to all humanity. And, according to government officials, SpaceX has been very intentional about its corporate responsibility. These satellites were designed to be easily trackable and maneuverable. Each satellite is held in a very low orbit until tests confirm that it works. Only then is it moved into its permanent orbital slot.

The US state department official held up SpaceX as a model of corporate responsibility. SpaceX, she said, is “trying to protect their investment and they want to make sure that the environment that they are investing in is going to be there five, ten, twenty years down the line.”

In July 2020, Amazon gained federal approval to launch its own constellation of 3,200 satellites.[^27]

Ostrom herself emphasized the complexity of global commons. One can’t anticipate every impact that a huge project like SpaceX’s Starlink might have. The key question is, can the institutions handle these unanticipated challenges? Are they nimble and adaptable? Institutions, after all, are human creations and are flawed, like their creators.

As Shakespeare said, “The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, But in ourselves, that we are underlings.”[^28] We will soon find out if we can sustain our space commons.  

## CHAPTER 9

## Commons in the Digital World

Polar Humenn’s old washing machine stopped working.[^1] His father was an electrical engineer, so Humenn knows his way around machinery. After tinkering with it a bit, Humenn found the source of the problem: the mechanical rotary control unit. Unfortunately, the replacement part cost more than the old washing machine was worth. Humenn, however, was undeterred. He’s a computer scientist who writes software for a geospatial technology company. His washing machine presented an interesting do-it-yourself challenge.

Programmable microprocessors have become so common and cheap that high school students are using them to build small “cube” satellites and send them into space.[^2] Humenn knew he could program one of these control units and fix his washing machine.

“I made it control a numeric display and a bunch of relays which run my washer. And I made it do what I wanted it to do, like spin for two minutes more so the clothes would be drier,” he explained to me in an interview. “It was a fun project. And it still works!”

Humenn could have stopped there. But as a computer scientist, he’s also an advocate for free and open source software. Free and open source software, such as the Mozilla Firefox web browser or the Linux operating system, is free for anyone to use. The programmers also make the original source code available so that others can modify it, improve it, and add new features. Whole communities of programmers work on making these programs better. And they do it for free.[^3]

So, when Humenn wrote the computer code to run his washing machine, he posted it on the internet and shared it with the world. A few people have even used it to fix their washing machines. To be sure, Humenn did not expect his piece of washing machine code to change the world. He was just solving a problem that he had. Every day, thousands of people like Humenn encounter problems big and small and they write pieces of code to fix them. Then they share it.

That’s the essence of the free and open source software (FOSS) movement. In economic terms, FOSS code is a pure public good. It’s nonrival in that many people can use it without it being depleted. It’s also nonexclusive. People post their code to websites like www.Github.com]] for anyone to download and tinker with. The standard economic theory says that the free market will underprovide such goods. After all, why would people write software programs and then give them away? On the surface, it seems irrational.

“Nobody is working on a project just because they want to work on a project,” Humenn said. “That might be okay for a student or a sixteen-year-old hacker or something. But most people are working on projects that either benefit them or benefit their company somehow.”

Humenn wrote the code to benefit himself by fixing his washing machine. Other programmers have banded together to create free versions of expensive, proprietary software. The free software saved their companies many thousands of dollars each year in licensing fees that they would have paid to companies like Microsoft. Plus, those programmers might have enjoyed playing Robin Hood by taking on a corporate empire.

It makes sense why the programmers would create an alternative to an expensive product. But why give software away for free? Why not license it and sell it as a better and cheaper alternative to Microsoft? Scholars have used Elinor Ostrom’s ideas about collaborative management of the commons to understand what motivates such actions.

The digital world is all about managing information—who generates that information, who has access to it, and the means by which that information is shared. Although Ostrom herself focused primarily on natural resource commons, she inspired and encouraged colleagues to explore how “the commons dilemma” applied to the digital world. A new generation of scholars has taken the tools Ostrom developed and applied them to other emerging areas like information commons, internet governance, and cyber security.

![[logo.png]]

Solving problems and managing resources requires information. Sometimes that information is top secret. It might be highly guarded by government agencies or corporations. Other times, that information is in the public domain and free for anyone to use easily. Most information lies somewhere in the middle. It could be a recipe in a book that is for sale or medical information you want to share with your dentist but not your employer.

Angie Raymond directs the Ostrom Workshop’s program on data management and information governance. She told me, “What we’re trying to do is create this ability to share this data without having to share too much.”

We all are constantly generating and consuming data. Each swipe of a credit card or click of a mouse on social media generates data that is valuable to someone. But who controls that data?

Consider the social media giant Facebook. “Ask yourself who is paying for Facebook,” writer David Rushkoff told an audience in 2011. “If you don’t know who the customer of the product you are using is, you don’t know what the product is for. We are not the customers of Facebook, we are the product. Facebook is selling us to advertisers.”[^4]

The question of how much of our own data—our tastes and preferences, birthdays, occupations, even medical conditions—we allow Facebook and others to collect, share, and even sell is no trivial matter. In her design principles, Ostrom suggested that people who are affected by the rules should have a say in rule making. The same applies to our personal data. Raymond continued, “This all draws from both the of the Ostroms’ work. The idea is to create a system where the data generators—the individuals—have a say in” how their data are used.

Charlotte Hess, the former Workshop librarian, witnessed the transformation from analog to digital archives. Hess’ husband, Gerald Bernbom, directed Indiana University’s information technology research and academic computing division. Before the internet emerged, their fields were fairly separate. In the early 1990s, however, the internet brought their professional fields closer together. They wondered, “What do librarians know that computer scientists don’t know?” and vice versa.

“Nobody on campus was studying the confluence of conduit and content,” Hess recalled in a conversation with me.

Hess had a background in literature and the humanities, not natural resources or political science. “Good!” she remembered Ostrom saying. “Anyone with a background in political science wouldn’t understand what we are trying to do here!” Hess immersed herself in the study of common-pool resources as she created the Workshop’s library and digitized it. She fell in love with the work. Hess was struck by how the management of libraries overlapped with the management of natural resource commons. A library is a shared resource of information. Like natural resources, information resources can be defined by institutional rules and property rights. Ostrom encouraged Hess to explore this “confluence of conduit and content.”

Unlike groundwater or lobsters or orbital slots, information can be copied and shared almost infinitely. However, the physical medium in which the information is stored—books, maps, computer files, and the like—can be both depletable and excludable. The owners of the media can control how others access the information. Technological innovations, such as the photocopy machine, interlibrary loan services, and digital media, added complexity to what might be considered a knowledge commons.

Hess and Ostrom shared a concern that restrictive property rights allowed individuals and firms to enclose the knowledge commons. Corporations and indigenous communities, for example, fought over intellectual property rights for knowledge that had, until digital technology, always been open access. These analog-era disputes anticipated the debates we see today over digital curated “closed gardens” of Facebook and pay-walled newspapers like the _New York Times_. The stakes are high. “It leads to speculation that the records of scholarly communication, the foundations of an informed, democratic society, may be at risk,” they warned.[^5]

The people who generate new knowledge and those who curate the collections have developed new institutions to manage these knowledge commons. Scientists sometimes make an end-run around the publishers’ pay walls by posting unofficial “preprint” versions on their work on various websites such as [https://arxiv.org/](https://arxiv.org/\) or the Ostrom Workshop’s own Digital Library of the Commons ([https://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/](https://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/\)). Without a journal’s seal of approval, however, the free versions may lack the authority and trust found in the official, restricted versions. So, scholars and information specialists are working together to coordinate strategies and maximize the benefits of these emerging knowledge commons institutions.[^6]

![[logo.png]]

Some software developers have embraced a similar attitude toward computer code. For example, programmer Richard Stallman created the GNU[^7] operating system in the mid-1980s as an alternative to the for-profit UNIX operating system. Stallman did not simply write the GNU code and release it into the world. He created a license for it. However instead of a copyright that prohibits unauthorized uses, the GNU General Public License has a “copyleft.” Anyone using the GNU operating system must also make their program free—free to run, free to study and change, and free to redistribute.[^8]

So, when a Finnish undergraduate named Linus Torvalds used GNU to create another free alternative to UNIX, he had to make his operating system free as well. Torvalds named it Linux, after himself.[^9] Since 1991 when it launched, thousands of programmers have contributed to the continued development of Linux. While it might not be a household name, the Linux operating system supports all kinds of technologies. For example, Linux serves as the foundation of the Android operating system used by many mobile phones.[^10]

Common property regimes can be an effective alternative to privatized, market-based systems and government regulation for natural resources. Similarly, FOSS systems can be viable alternatives to the other two models in the appropriate setting for information resources. Like other pure public goods, however, FOSS code potentially suffers from free-rider problems. Software must be tended and cultivated like a garden. A useful program requires updates to conform with evolving standards and new versions of operating systems. It needs gardeners if it is to thrive in the long run.

What happens if no one tends to the software? “The tragedy of the commons comes when there are insufficient human resources available to continue to further develop and maintain the software and, as a result, the software project becomes abandoned,” scholars Charles Schweik and Robert English wrote.[^11] Institutions, therefore, are critical in maintaining the software. Schweik and English found that many of Ostrom’s ideas about institutions and rules in natural resource commons apply to the management of FOSS systems. The ideas also apply to coordinated cyberattacks, such as a distributed denial of service.

Angie Raymond, from the Ostrom Workshop, explained how FOSS products can be eroded by privatization, too. “Someone got a great idea that, in an open source world, I can cut and paste open source [code], and add a little bit of my own special sauce on top of it. Then I can sell it, packaged slightly differently, and turn it into a commercialized environment.” Open source software works, Raymond said, only as long as the community commits to sustaining those open source values.

Ostrom often said, “Nobody wants to be a sucker.” The evidence shows that people are willing to volunteer their time and expertise to maintain a knowledge commons that serves the public good. People will give their time cataloging craters on Mars for NASA[^12] or counting penguins on Antarctic ice.[^13] People are not, however, willing to volunteer their time to fix bugs in the programs of for-profit companies. Legal scholar Yochai Benkler speculated that there might be a certain prestige in contributing to FOSS code and similar projects. On the flip side, profit-oriented coding might be looked down upon. “One can imagine that free software-development communities would attach a negative social value to contributions of those who demand to be paid for their contributions,” Benkler wrote.[^14]

Programmers freely contribute their computer code to the community for a variety of reasons. Some, like Polar Humenn, are just trying to fix their own problems with broken washing machines. Sharing it is a voluntary step, but it’s basically costless. Some people enjoy the creative aspects of writing and sharing code, just like amateur musicians share their performances on YouTube. Others, Humenn noted, write and edit FOSS code for the reputational benefits. Employers look to see if job candidates have been active in the computing community and pitching in to resolve coding issues. People can also make a good living writing FOSS code. The software itself might be free and open source, but the code doesn’t write itself. Companies will pay handsomely for a good programmer’s expertise. The “peer production commons” is not as irrational as one might expect.[^15]

Large, collaborative FOSS projects can happen without much hierarchical structure because of the modular nature of most computing projects. Unlike writing a novel, writing a software program consists of units of computer code nested inside one another. These units can be broken down to relatively small and simple components. Volunteers can choose a unit to create or edit. If the task is small enough, say an hour or two of work, then people will often do the work without compensation or supervision. Similarly, flaws in the code will be spotted as volunteers review it. “Linus’s Law” (named in honor of Linus Torvalds) states that “given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.”[^16] Large, complex computing projects can therefore draw on thousands of volunteers to create simple modules that add up to a sophisticated system.

The organizational and institutional structures of these FOSS communities tie Ostrom’s work on commons with the work of other institutional economists. Ronald Coase, in the 1930s, explored why people organize into firms to produce some goods and why in other cases they outsource production. Simply put, firms will organize and produce goods in-house as long it’s cheaper than buying it on the market. But firms don’t rely on markets within them. Instead of using market prices, firms allocate resources using managerial hierarchies. Oliver Williamson, who shared the economics Nobel with Ostrom, built on Coase’s ideas to expand on the theory of the firm.

Typically, firms allocate productive resources using market prices when dealing with vendors outside the firm or managerial knowledge inside the firm. The peer production model, however, offers yet another way to allocate resources to production, especially of knowledge goods like software. “The widely distributed model of information production,” Yochai Benkler wrote, “will better identify who is the best person to produce a specific component of a project, all abilities and availability to work on the specific module within a specific time frame considered.”[^17] Just as Ostrom’s ideas represented a third way for managing natural resource commons, her ideas inform how people can collaborate outside the typical firm–market dichotomy in knowledge commons.

![[logo.png]]

The peer production model that emerged in the software community in the 1990s is a form of knowledge _coproduction_. “By coproduction,” Ostrom wrote in 1996, “I mean the process through which inputs used to produce a good or service are contributed by individuals who are not ‘in’ the same organization.”[^18]

Government agencies typically produce public goods and services (those that are nonrival and nonexclusive). The users of those goods and services are often portrayed as clients. Clients, in this model, passively accept the goods and services provided by the government agencies. For example, the National Weather Service provides weather forecasts to their clients: the American public.

Ostrom and her colleagues, however, showed the simplistic nature of this conception. Ostrom wrote that coproduction “implies that citizens can play an active role in producing public goods and services of consequence to them.”[^19] Even the National Weather Service relies on volunteers to submit local weather observations.[^20]

Ostrom arrived at this understanding of coproduction in the 1970s when she and her colleagues studied police departments. At the time, cities centralized their police departments and other service to achieve economies of scale. Ostrom and her colleagues, however, found few advantages for such consolidation. The centralized police forces failed to provide services that were better, more equitable, or lower cost than did smaller units. Independent communities, at least in some cases, engaged in more formal and informal communication with their smaller-sized police departments and therefore exerted greater control over them. The team concluded that “police agencies involving both small-scale, locally controlled components and large-scale, metropolitanwide components existing side by side may well provide a more satisfactory solution to the problem of providing police services in large urban areas.”[^21]

The provision of public safety, in other words, is not purely a function of police forces. Public safety is not imposed on a community by the government. Public safety is a service that is coproduced by police departments and citizens.

Of course, Ostrom cautioned people from proclaiming coproduction as a cure-all. Sometimes government provision or the marketplace is the most reasonable way to provide a service. Her work did, however, point to some conditions under which coproduction might be beneficial. Coproduction works best when the work done by agencies and citizens complement one another. In some cases, citizens may not have the legal authority to engage in coproduction. In cases where they do have the authority, the agencies and citizens must have credible commitments to each other for the coproduction to flourish. Incentives of various types can help encourage that long-term commitment to coproduction.[^22]

A deep, intentional coproduction enterprise may not be advantageous always and everywhere. However, solutions are rarely all or nothing. Such thinking seemed radical to some of Ostrom’s critics. “Since I think the great divide between the Market and the State or between Government and Civil Society is a conceptual trap arising from overly rigid disciplinary walls surrounding the study of human institutions, I am delighted to be considered a radical. If trying to remove artificial walls surrounding disciplines is offensive, I regret assailing individual senses of propriety.”[^23]

Some degree of coproduction is inevitable. “No market can survive without extensive public goods provided by governmental agencies,” she wrote. “No government can be efficient and equitable without considerable input from citizens. Synergetic outcomes can be fostered to a much greater extent than our academic barriers have let us contemplate.”[^24]

![[logo.png]]

In her Nobel Prize address, Ostrom noted that scholars “are slowly shifting from positing simple systems to using more complex frameworks, theories, and models to understand the diversity of puzzles and problems facing humans interacting in contemporary societies.”[^25]

Systems thinking was critical to Ostrom’s perspective as a scientist. A system is “a set of things—people, cells, molecules, or whatever—interconnected in such a way that they produce their own pattern of behavior over time.”[^26] Ostrom referred to the natural resource-using communities she studied as “social–ecological systems.” The whole community includes both the people and the natural resource. Most scientists tend to specialize in particular topics. They become experts in either social systems or ecological systems, but not both. Ostrom, on the other hand, looked at the social–ecological system as one holistic entity—a complex system.

After collecting thousands of case studies, Ostrom and her colleagues saw these social–ecological systems produce their own patterns of behavior. The communities that successfully managed their communal resources tended to share a set of traits, which Ostrom synthesized into her eight design principles. For the most part, people did not sit down and intentionally codify these principles. Rather, the design principles emerged from sustained interactions over time. The communities retained the rules and norms that worked and jettisoned those that didn’t. The community members depended on feedback loops of information from harvesters and monitors—how much water was available for irrigation, how many lobsters had been harvested this season, and so on. Successful communities could communicate the state of the resource with each other. Such communities could also control, through rules and norms, members’ access to the resource depending on its state.

Control and communication. All of Ostrom’s eight design principles can be put into one of these bins. Some principles control who can access the resource and who can make the rules, such as having clearly defined boundaries and procedures for modifying the access rules. Other principles communicate those rules and the resource’s condition, like sanctions for rule breakers and procedures for monitoring the resource.

The concepts of control and communication are fundamental to systems thinking. In fact, these terms formed the foundation of the complex adaptive system theory that Ostrom used in her social–ecological system models. These terms also have their origins in the science that would lead to the internet—cybernetics.

![[logo.png]]

Tools and more complicated machines can be thought of as extensions of the human body. Icarus’s mythical wax wings enabled him to fly, for a short time. Galileo’s telescopes enabled astronomers to see farther than ever before. The militaries fighting World War II, likewise, demanded even more ambitious machines to extend their soldiers’ abilities. As planes flew higher and faster, the soldiers on the ground could not calculate the trajectory of an antiaircraft round quickly enough. They also need ammunition that exploded in the vicinity of the enemy plane rather than on impact. So military engineers automated the process. Automation required two things: control and communication.[^27]

Engineers designed a system that could receive information about the approaching aircraft, automatically calculate the aircraft’s current speed and position, predict its future position, and fire an antiaircraft round. The specially designed round included a tiny radio transmitter. It sent information back to the base about its position and the soldiers could control when it detonated. The antiaircraft gun and round communicated with each other. The new weapon closed the information loop using control and communication.

A Massachusetts Institute of Technology mathematician, Norbert Wiener, played a bit part in the development of the automation of antiaircraft fire. He used that small role, however, to propel himself into a career as a public intellectual who changed the trajectory of art and science.

During and after World War II, Wiener convened a regular dinner gathering of scientists from diverse disciplines to discuss their research. He and his colleagues “had become aware of the essential unity of the set of problems centering about communication, control, and statistical mechanics, whether in the machine or living tissue. . . . We have decided to call the entire field of control and communication theory, whether in the machine or in the animal, by the name Cybernetics, which we form from the Greek _χυβερνήτης_ or steersman.”[^28] The verb form of that Greek word, _kybernan_, means to steer or to govern.

Wiener’s 1948 book _Cybernetics, or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine_ became an unlikely best seller. It also introduced the world to the prefix _cyber,_ which is ubiquitous today.[^29]

_Kybernan_—to govern. If common-pool resources and their users form a social–ecological system, then according to cybernetic theory, governing that system requires information, feedback, and a set or rules or institutions. Ostrom had reached the same conclusions, starting from a political science perspective, that Wiener had also reached from an engineering perspective.

In the 1950s, Austrian-born biologist Ludwig von Bertalanffy extended cybernetics to include the stocks and flows of energy and matter in the world around us. A friend described him as “one of those strategically placed thinkers whose knowledge in many fields permits them to strike at the joints between the various academic disciplines and so to penetrate to the quick of the living reality in a way which the specialist can never do.”[^30] (The same might be said of Ostrom.) He envisioned his “general system theory” as an alternative to the reductionist approach that dominated science. Rather than encourage more and more specialization, general system theory encouraged scientists to synthesize and put the pieces together.

Cybernetics focused on technology. Von Bertalanffy worried that such a technological approach would inspire fears of the “devaluation of man” and a march “towards technocratic society.” He hoped his general system theory could integrate both social and natural sciences in what he called a “humanistic concern.”[^31]

Von Bertalanffy’s words offered both hope for a broader understanding of the world around us and a dystopian vision of cybernetics that has fueled science fiction for decades. Manfred Clynes and Nathan Kline coined the term _cyborg_ in 1960 to describe an organism that is augmented with technology to survive in space.[^32] It has since been applied to any human–robot fusion character, like the Borg in _Star Trek_ or the Terminator. In his 1984 novel _Neuromancer_, William Gibson used the phrase cyberspace to describe a digital realm created by millions of networked computers.[^33] Gibson’s “consensual hallucination” of cyberspace, which people can “jack into” and escape their grim reality, directly influenced the Wachowski sisters’ _Matrix_ movies. In _The Matrix_, the world we see around us is nothing but hallucinations in cyberspace. The real, physical world is one run by machines that harvest the energy of billions of people connected to a computer network.

By the 1990s, interdisciplinary scientists expanded general system theory to include evolutionary aspects. “Complex adaptive systems theory” gave scientists like Ostrom the power to model how systems evolve over time to changes in the various elements. “The complex adaptive systems perspective,” she wrote, “provides us the view of individuals within a variety of situations structured by the biophysical world, the institutional rules, and the community in which they interact.”[^34]

Ostrom focused on complex adaptive systems in the biophysical world. But what about the digital world of cyberspace—the internet? Cyberspace is no longer the stuff of science fiction. Cyberspace itself is a complex adaptive system. The internet comprises millions of private citizens, corporations, nongovernmental organizations, and government agencies all exchanging information—communicating. Controlling that communication is critical to the internet’s function. Controlling information enables us shop, learn, date, and bank online securely.

Researchers at and affiliated with the Ostrom Workshop are applying Ostrom’s lessons from the biophysical world to study and manage the digital world of cyberspace.

![[logo.png]]

In 2019, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center received more than 450,000 complaints with associated losses of more than $3.5 billion. The value of those losses has tripled since 2015. In its annual report, the center wrote, “Cyber is the ultimate team sport. Working together we hope to create a safer, more secure cyber landscape ensuring confidence as we traverse through a digitally-connected world.”[^35]

If creating a secure and peaceful cyberspace is “the ultimate team sport” and requires “working together” as the FBI suggests, then perhaps Elinor Ostrom’s ideas about collective action might be useful. At first glance, fighting cybercrime might seem like it has nothing to do with managing a fishing or forest commons. Systems thinking and coproduction, however, can explain how citizens, firms, and government agencies work together to protect valuable information and create a secure environment in the digital world.

“Just to be clear—I think Lin would be surprised if she knew there was a program on cybersecurity in the Workshop,” Scott Shackelford told me in an interview. “But I’d like to think that after I had a chance to explain the connections, then she might appreciate and even approve of this extension of her work.”

Shackelford, now the Ostrom Workshop’s executive director, initiated the program on cybersecurity and internet governance at the Workshop several years after Lin and Vincent passed away. Some of the longtime Workshop faculty were initially skeptical. How did the digital world of cyberspace relate to the natural resource governance issues that had been the focus of the Workshop for so long? Shackelford eventually won them over. Cybersecurity and internet governance are, as Shackelford put it, “an extension of the insights and debates that have been playing out for decades” in forests, fisheries, and so many other contexts. “And it’s a testament to the strength and durability” of the Ostrom’s theories “that they find resonance in all these different frontiers all these years later.”

Scholars like Shackelford make distinctions between the internet and cyberspace. The internet is physical. It’s the computer servers, routers, fiber optics, and all the hardware the connects the world’s computers. Cyberspace, on the other hand, is the digital realm created by linking all these devices together. People access cyberspace using tools like web browsers and email.

![[ch9f2.png]]

The physical telecommunications infrastructure that supports the internet is itself a type of commons. Barbara Cherry, an Indiana University professor affiliated with the Ostrom Workshop, told me, “The provision of certain telecommunications services have historically been regulated in the US by the law of common carriage—a form of commons regulation.” This approach to managing the commons of telecommunication applies to the ongoing debate about network neutrality in the United States. The Ostrom Workshop’s experience in natural resource commons may apply to the governance of the physical structures of the internet as well.

This distinction between the physical aspects of the internet and the digital realm of cyberspace leads to two different challenges. The first is how to govern the internet. Computers need to use certain standard protocols to share information on the internet. Each device needs a unique identifier called an internet protocol (IP) address. Internet users must coordinate their activities for the system to work. That coordination is the basic duty of internet governance. There is no global government, however, to impose standards. Everyone must voluntarily agree on and comply with a standard for the whole thing to work. That has been done through a uniquely multistakeholder structure that in some ways, such as in the Internet Engineering Task Force, builds from the insights of engagement and coproduction from Lin’s work.

The second challenge relates to security. The first computers linked together in the early versions of the internet were relatively simple and slow. Encrypting messages passed along the network would have made the system even slower. So those early programmers decided not to include encryption as a default in what became the internet. The programmers probably did not foresee how that decision would, fifty years later, enable a worldwide network of cybercriminals to steal identities and corporate secrets.

Shackelford approaches these twin challenges of internet governance and cybersecurity as extensions of what Ostrom called “the commons dilemma.” Cyberspace shares many attributes of an unregulated global commons. For example, some aspects of property rights are not well-defined and it is difficult to exclude users from accessing the cyberspace resource. Some aspects of cyberspace are depletable but not in the conventional, physical sense. New networks and processing power can be added to expand the environment and how many users can access it. Unwanted email (or “spam”) can clog an email user’s inbox. Unsecured computers can even be taken over by malicious software and used to crash a bank or other business’s website.

“These abuses may lower or deplete public trust—that is, the willingness of users to go online—much like a renewable natural resource that can be overexploited,” as two scholars put it.[^36] “Trust in the ability of the network to deliver its benefits,” they argued, “is the ultimate common pool resource in cyberspace.”

Unlike a fishing or forest commons, however, private firms own much of the internet’s physical infrastructure. The owners of those servers and routers must comply with the local laws of the country in which they are physically located. Cyberspace grows as people add new networks to it. But with that growth comes the potential for hackers, criminals, and spies to launch attacks. Shackelford, therefore, describes cyberspace as “a pseudo commons” under the control of government agencies and private firms whose actions are regulated by national and international policies.[^37]

As with conventional natural resources, some experts suggest resolving the “tragedy of the cyber commons” by imposing government policies on internet use or by completely privatizing it. Shackelford, however, found Ostrom’s multistakeholder and multilevel approach to climate governance to be instrumental in his thinking about internet governance. “This is why I try to use the literature on distributed and polycentric governance. Elinor and Vincent Ostrom’s work in these areas can describe how networks operate, where the vulnerabilities exist at multiple levels, and what we can do about them.”

The challenges of coordinating action across a global network, with decisions to be made at levels of individual devices to international policies, is in many ways similar to the challenge of managing global climate change. Ostrom found that a “polycentric” approach to climate change, that is, one with many centers of power and decision making, may work better than a single top-down policy. The same approach might be similarly effective for governing the internet.

Ostrom always emphasized that there are “no panaceas”—no simple fixes for complex problems. The complexity created by all of the private firms, government agencies, and crossing of international boundaries makes governing the internet especially difficult. Shackelford suggested that managing cyberspace requires a mix of national regulations, privatization, common property solutions, as well as polycentric governance.[^38]

The Ostrom’s work showed how well-designed policies, in some cases, can encourage groups to self-organize and solve problems where they occur. Just as Lin Ostrom identified communities that set up rules for sustainable resource use, there are digital communities that behave similarly. One of the interesting challenges for Shackelford, from both a scholarly and practical perspective, is “figuring out which sectors, which communities are set up well and foster these design principles. To what extent is that a reason that some sectors are more successful than others at managing these types of risks, that are more resilient?”

![[logo.png]]

Lin Ostrom had no interest in, or knowledge of, pop culture. She and Vincent did not own a television. They spent their summers in an isolated cabin, without electricity, on the Canadian shores of Lake Huron. Longtime Workshop staff member Robin Humphrey recalled the time that, after she won the Nobel Prize, Lin’s name was the “question” to an answer on the quiz show _Jeopardy!_ The Workshop staff were very excited, but Lin shrugged it off. She had no idea what _Jeopardy!_ was.

So, it’s likely that Lin would not have known the connections between her work on complex adaptive systems and _The Matrix_ movies. And, as Shackleford noted, she probably would be surprised about the Workshop’s recent embrace of cybersecurity and data governance. In that respect, Ostrom is an unlikely person around which to build a program on digital commons. But these applications show, once again, that it’s the people and the institutions that really matter. There are universal principles at work regardless of the type of resource, whether physical or digital. Ostrom’s work unites the natural and social sciences, and her colleagues advanced her ideas by showing the similarities between the physical and digital domains. In doing so, Ostrom’s ideas represent a step toward von Bertalanffy’s dream of an interdisciplinary science that addresses the “humanistic concern.”

“The future is having the Ostroms’ influence move into the more technology driven world,” Angie Raymond told me. “I’m not going to fib to you—it’s very new! I spent a ton of time explaining to other researchers that we are still trying to figure out what a knowledge commons is. We’re still trying to figure out,” for the digital world, “what took the Ostroms a very long time to come up with” for the natural resource world.

The digital commons is all very new and exciting. In terms of understanding the workings of digital commons, Raymond said, “We are really babies!”  

## CHAPTER 10

## A Nobel Prize for Institutions and a Pathbreaking Life

The Nobel Foundation typically calls the recipients early in the morning and catches them off guard. Ostrom had always been an early riser. That day, however, she was asleep when she got the call at 6:15 a.m. on October 12, 2009. “I had been up early and gone back to bed,” she laughingly told a friend shortly after the announcement. “They woke [me] up because I had gone back—I was really sound asleep.”[^1]

The Nobel Foundation also called economist Oliver Williamson that morning, with whom Ostrom shared the prize. The Nobel Foundation and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences recognized the pair for their analyses of economic governance.[^2] Williamson studied the boundaries of the firm—why a company would perform some tasks in-house while outsourcing others. Ostrom, of course, studied how common-pool resources could be self-governed. What they had in common was an interest in how institutions—the rules that govern corporations or irrigation communities—allow people to make decisions and allocate resources outside markets. Both Ostrom and Williamson come from an academic tradition called “new institutional economics.”

Some scholars, particularly economists, greeted the news with surprise and even disdain. Steven D. Levitt, author of _Freakonomics_, wrote, “The economics profession is going to hate the prize going to Ostrom even more than Republicans hated the Peace Prize going to Obama. Economists want this to be an economists’ prize. . . . [T]he prize is moving toward a Nobel in Social Science, not a Nobel in economics. I don’t mean to imply this is necessarily a bad thing . . . just that it will be unpopular among my peers.”[^3]

Economist and _New York Times_ columnist Paul Krugman, himself a Nobel laureate, was also unfamiliar with Ostrom but acknowledged her work’s value. “I wasn’t familiar with Ostrom’s work, but even a quick scan shows why she shared the prize: if the goal is to understand the creation of economic institutions, it’s crucial to be aware that there is more variety in institutions, a wider range of strategies that work, than simply the binary divide between individuals and firms.”[^4]

Although the Nobel caught some economists off guard, it came as no surprise to those, like Douglass North, who knew Ostrom best. North, an economic historian who won the prize in 1993, knew both Ostrom and Williamson and considered them friends. He noted that Ostrom in particular was “doing work that was outside the formal economic models, as indeed I’ve done all my life. So, a lot of people were dissatisfied with it. If you come from traditional training in economics . . . you tend to sneer at anything that is outside of that and think it’s superfluous or irrelevant or just poor economics. All of which I think is a bad mistake.”[^5]

Academia rewards specialization. The most successful scholars typically spend their lives studying one corner of their discipline, like a rare butterfly that depends on the nectar from a single flower species. So, it is unsurprising that many economists were unfamiliar with Ostrom’s work in political science.

But Ostrom was unusual even among political scientists. Rather than studying elections and political parties, she studied how communities govern natural resources. And she did so in the field, not simply from the comfort of her office. Her innovative techniques influenced a new generation of social scientists who worked on questions of poverty and economic development. Ostrom also collaborated with researchers from many disciplines, including anthropologists, biologists, foresters, and economists.

The political science community, however, did recognize her unique achievements well before the Nobel Foundation did. She served as president of the American Political Science Association and the Public Choice Society. Numerous organizations and universities awarded her accolades and honorary degrees, such as being a fellow in the American Academy of Political and Social Science and receiving the John J. Carty Award for the Advancement of Science from the National Academy of Sciences. In 1999, Sweden’s Uppsala University bestowed upon Ostrom the Johan Skytte Prize in Political Science. The Skytte Prize is considered by many to be political science’s version of the Nobel.[^6]

**Figure 10.1** The Workshop’s Tocqueville Room (named after _Democracy in America_ author Alexis de Tocqueville) displays many of the awards Elinor and Vincent won during their careers. (Credit: Jason Reblando.)

Robin Humphreys, a longtime staff member at the Workshop, told me people had quietly speculated about a future Nobel Prize. He said, “She won every award in social science. She went to Sweden a lot. People whispered, ‘She might win the Nobel Prize, but don’t say anything.’ Like a guy throwing a no-hitter—don’t jinx it.”

Jim Acheson, an anthropologist who worked with Ostrom extensively, defended her award. “She not only influenced me, she influenced everybody in that entire group of people who was interested in the management of resources,” he said in an interview with me. “There’s no one who’s had as much influence as she’s had. She deserved that Nobel Prize, even though certain economists don’t seem to think so.”

Ostrom was the first woman—after sixty-two consecutive men—to earn the Nobel Prize in Economics. Ironically, the UCLA Department of Economics rejected her application for graduate studies all those years ago. The department didn’t want its reputation watered down with graduates who would not go on to prestigious research careers. In her first phone interview the morning of the award, Ostrom said, “Having lived through an era, where I was thinking of going to graduate school and was strongly discouraged because I would never be able to do anything but teach in a city college . . . Ah ha ha, life has changed!”[^7]

Ostrom served as a role model for social scientists, especially women in the field. It took another ten years before the Nobel Foundation awarded the prize to another woman, Esther Duflo (with Abhijit Banerjee and Michael Kremer). “Today, I am also proud to represent women, and in particular women in economics,” Duflo told the Nobel banquet audience in Stockholm in December 2019. “Tellingly, Elinor Ostrom, the only other woman before me also relied on field work and studied what we can learn from poorer societies, from Nepal to Indonesia. I don’t think this is an accident. Development is one field of economics that has its fair share of women.”[^8]

**Box 10.1 A New Nobel Prize**

Alfred Nobel, a native of Sweden, earned his fortune as an inventor and entrepreneur. But one invention brought him more wealth and notoriety than any other: dynamite. Tinkering ran in the Nobel family. Nobel’s father, also an inventor and engineer, used his knowledge of blasting rocks for construction projects to design sea mines for the Russian tsar. Nobel followed in his father’s footsteps and eventually developed the stable form of nitroglycerine explosive. The powerful explosive brought him immense wealth, but that came at a high price. An explosion in one of his factories killed his younger brother and four others.

When Nobel was thirty-five, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded him and his father the prestigious Letterstedt Prize. The prize recognized Nobel’s invention of dynamite as an important discovery “of practical value to humanity.” In these words, one can hear the inspiration of the prize he would later endow.

Nobel never married and had no heirs. Instead, and controversially, he bequeathed his fortune to a fund that would recognize achievements in various disciplines that “conferred the greatest benefit on mankind.” He expressly willed that the prizes be granted to the worthiest candidates regardless of nationality. The Nobel Prize embodied its benefactor’s cosmopolitan values. In his will, Nobel identified five prize categories that reflected his wide-ranging interests: physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, and the “champions of peace.”

Economics, however, was not among these.

Sweden’s central bank, called the Sveriges Riksbank, wanted to celebrate its three-hundredth anniversary with a bang. So, in 1968, the bank donated to the Nobel Foundation to establish a new prize in economics. To differentiate it from the original five disciplines, the prize is known formally as the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. At least one member of the Nobel family was displeased with economics trying to horn in on Alfred’s chosen fields. The person criticized economics for placing profits over people. Others have criticized particular awards for their political leanings from both the left and right. Unlike physics or chemistry, economic ideas, and the economists who think of them, often align with partisan agendas.

Years after the award’s establishment, the Nobel Foundation expanded the criteria to include fields that intersect with economics. The expanded criteria allowed noneconomists, such as political scientist Elinor Ostrom, psychologist Daniel Kahneman, and mathematician John Nash (of _A Beautiful Mind_ fame), to win the award. Even though they are not economists by training, their works have profoundly affected the field of economics.

 

Modern institutional economics should study man as he is, acting within the constraints imposed by real institutions. Modern institutional economics is economics as it ought to be. (Nobel laureate Ronald Coase, 1984[^9])

The way to think about this prize is that it’s an award for institutional economics, or maybe more specifically New Institutional Economics. (Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, on Ostrom and Williamson’s award in 2009[^10])

Economists study how people, including those in firms and governments, allocate scarce resources. People make decisions every day about how much time they spend watching TV or how much money the company spends on office paper. Most economists look at these decisions through the lens of demand and supply. How much money are people willing to spend on another streaming TV package? That’s the demand side. What does it cost a firm to deliver more streaming TV shows? That’s the supply. The TV viewers and the streaming companies come together in the marketplace. If people are willing to pay the firm more than the production cost, then the firm will deliver more streaming TV shows.

That was the key insight of classical economist Adam Smith. The government does not need to tell a firm to make more streaming TV shows, or tacos, or trucks. Through these market exchanges, the firms are “led by an invisible hand,” advancing the interests of society by making the goods customers want at a price they are willing to pay.[^11] This market-based system for allocating scarce resources works reasonably well. But many economists also study the conditions in which it breaks down—like the social cost of pollution or monopolies.

Market prices are an economist’s measure of relative scarcity. But well-functioning markets depend on a system of rules. Property rights, for example, define whether the person has a right to sell the object and transfer ownership. Markets would not exist without these rules. They are not some phenomena that are found in nature. Rather, markets are the creations of people.

Markets are not the only way to allocate scarce resources. Some things can’t easily be divided into discrete chunks that can be sold in a market. These include common-pool resources that might be owned by the community, not an individual. The communities may come up with their own rules about who, and when, and how such a shared resource can be harvested. Although businesses sell their products in a market, they usually don’t use a market to allocate resources within the business itself. Instead, they use other rules for determining the number of people assigned to a project or the number of machines operating in a factory.

These rules, whether formal or informal, are what interest institutional economists. The institutions are the rules themselves—the laws passed by governments, store policies, or expectations of behavior. As one economist described them, institutions are “habits of thought which prevail in a given period.”[^12] People aren’t robots that act completely rationally in every situation. People, as Ronald Coase said, act “within the constraints imposed by real institutions.”[^13] These formal and informal rules can vary from place to place, just as each lobster gang determined its own rules for who can set traps in the harbor and where they can do it.

If economics were baseball, most mainstream economists would focus on keeping track of the runs, hits, and errors. But institutional economists would be more interested in the rules of the game. Even though the rules should be the same across Major League Baseball, do the umpires vary in their calls? Are there local traditions that might influence success, like the Red Sox fans singing “Sweet Caroline”?

For many decades, the institutional tradition in economics emphasized history and observations over abstraction and mathematical formalization. One must “look and see,” as one early institutional economist put it, to understand the economic life of people.[^14]

Philosopher Immanuel Kant remarked, “Theory without practice is empty; practice without theory is blind.” To look and see, to observe and collect data about the world is critical. But it takes a theory to make sense of what is seen, to connect the dots. The early institutionalists lacked a theory. After groping in the dark and criticizing the more abstract “neoclassical” approach to economics, the “old” institutional economics faded away in the first half of the twentieth century.

The “new” institutional economics emerged a few decades later. Like their predecessors, the new institutionalists critiqued the ahistorical and placeless approach of neoclassical economics. “Their objection essentially,” Coase said to a group of like-minded economists, “is that the theory floats in the air. It is as if one studied the circulation of the blood without having a body. . . . Markets exist without laws and therefore without any clear specification of what is bought and sold.”[^15]

It’s like trying to understand baseball by looking at the box scores and slugging percentages. The statistics tell you a lot about what’s happening from a technical perspective, but they don’t explain the game’s appeal and why people, real actual people, enjoy watching it. Baseball has a rich history full of traditions and personalities. You need both, the statistics and the tradition, the theory and the practice, to fully appreciate the game.

The new institutionalists, unlike their predecessors, did not reject the neoclassical theories outright. Rather, they built upon those theories and used them to discover how the institutions—the rules and behavioral expectations—affect the workings of firms, clients, and other actors in the economy. The institutional economists added real-world complexity to the neoclassicists’ mathematical formulas to give a richer picture of the world around us. It was in this tradition that Elinor Ostrom and Oliver Williamson were awarded the 2009 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel for their work in economic governance in the commons and in firms.

But Ostrom’s award wasn’t only for governing the commons. Her methodological contribution was also significant. Ostrom blended the “old” institutional economists’ admonition to “look and see” with a solid theoretical foundation. For example, Ostrom relied on field work while conducting research on police departments in the 1970s. “Riding as an observer in a patrol car in the central district of a large American city at midnight on a Saturday evening, one sees different patterns of human interaction than in a suburb on a weekday afternoon when school is letting out. In both cases, one observes the production of a public good—local safety—by an official of a local government.”[^16] She drew upon the observations she and her colleagues made in the field and used them to build a theory. Then she tested the theory with more observations in new settings and refined it as needed. It’s a model for how good science operates.

Ostrom traveled to Stockholm in December 2009 to deliver her address and accept the Nobel Prize. Vincent, in declining health, could not accompany her. Ostrom had no siblings or children of her own. She did, however, travel with an entourage from the Workshop and Indiana University. Those traveling with her were more than coworkers. They were like an extended family who escorted Ostrom to event after event, day into night. Colleagues like Patty Lezotte, who worked with Ostrom for thirty-five years, and Nicole Todd would be her personal assistants.

“There’s a news conference, some kind of elegant event at a museum or a mansion every evening,” recalled Burney Fischer, who traveled with Ostrom’s entourage. The team members took turns escorting her to various events. They even mapped out a detailed schedule to make sure everyone knew exactly who was on duty.

Each year, Sweden’s two large banks host a special banquet in honor of the Nobel in Economics. The bank presidents and the economics faculty from Stockholm’s universities gather in an elegant room high above the city. Burney Fischer accompanied Ostrom to the gala that year. The social hour began with a receiving line in which each of the economists got to greet Ostrom.

“We’re in a receiving line and the last people we meet are the presidents of these two banks,” Fischer recalled to me in a conversation. “Lin said, ‘So what does it take to be invited to this meeting?’ And the bank president said, ‘You must be on the faculty with a Ph.D. in economics from one of the four schools in Stockholm.’ And Lin said, ‘Well, I don’t qualify because I don’t have a Ph.D. in economics!’”

“It brought a laugh! And it was one of those humorous moments, it was really funny.”

Despite all of the awards she earned, Ostrom retained a down-to-earth demeanor. Maybe it was her upbringing as a child of the Great Depression. She could engage a black-tie crowd of economists one day and marvel at a hand-dug irrigation ditch the next. “She knew how to be appropriate to the evening or the affair, but she could still be ‘aw shucks,’” Fischer said. “I think she had done enough things in her life that she had figured out how to be in a variety of settings quite well.”

Edella Schlager also accompanied Ostrom on the trip to Stockholm. Schlager was a graduate student at the Workshop who became a lifelong friend. She wasn’t at that economists’ banquet, but she recognized Ostrom’s sense of humor. “I would say her secret sauce was joy,” Schlager told a group at a Workshop roundtable discussion years later. “She brought a real joy to everything that she did. And I think that was really attractive to people.” Ostrom and her Workshop colleagues worked hard but there was a great deal of laughter and joy as well.

![[logo.png]]

Ostrom made history as the first woman to win a Nobel Prize in Economics. In the years since, she has become a feminist icon to many academics.[^17]

Edella Schlager, however, had a different perspective. “I would say I never experienced Lin as a feminist,” Schlager said at a Workshop event. “I experienced Lin as an important mentor and advocate for her students, women and men.”

In a follow-up conversation with me, Schlager elaborated on that statement. “She wasn’t a firebrand and she wasn’t an advocate for any particular cause.” In Schlager’s view, Ostrom was much more interested in “the civic space and problem solving.”

![[ch10f3.png]]

Ostrom never wanted to make herself the center of attention. She aimed the spotlight on the community members that crafted the rules for sustaining a commons and promoted her graduate students to potential employers. But in winning the Nobel Prize, the spotlight shone on her.

Workshop scholar Michael McGinnis told a group that being the first woman to win the Nobel in economics “really gave her a sense that she was a little more pathbreaking than she saw herself before.”[^18] “She started overtly talking about the problems she had when she first started out as a woman in academia and someone who had been discouraged from getting a Ph.D. in economics,” McGinnis said. At the time, UCLA discouraged women, including Ostrom, from taking higher-level math courses. The economics department then used that lack of math courses to reject her application for doctoral studies. The political science department reluctantly admitted Ostrom among a small cohort of female students after pressure from administrators. In the early days at Indiana University, administrators assigned Ostrom classes on early Saturday mornings that her male peers refused to teach.[^19]

The Nobel gave her not only the opportunity, but also perhaps an obligation, to speak out on these issues. In typical Ostrom fashion, however, she turned the spotlight on others. She framed the problem of sexism and gender discrimination as another puzzle to be solved.

McGinnis shared an anecdote with the group. “I remember right after the prize, she had a press conference with [Indiana University] President McRobbie. He was sitting there hearing stuff about the [Saturday morning] courses she had to teach. And he said, ‘Hey, I wasn’t here! Don’t blame me!’ But she did it in a very joyful, pleasant sort of way.”[^20]

“She had this opportunity to get people’s attention,” McGinnis recalled. “She would say, ‘Why am I the first [woman] to get it? This is a problem and don’t think this is solved.’”

![[logo.png]]

Burney Fischer clearly remembered the chaotic morning at the Workshop when Ostrom’s Nobel was announced. The phones rang off the hook, and news crews scrambled to interview her. Late in the morning, Ostrom suddenly announced, “Well, this all has got to stop because I teach at one o’clock!”

Ostrom was scheduled to teach her two-hour seminar class for graduate students each Monday, as she had for years. Her colleagues assured Ostrom that they would find an appropriate substitute. Professors from disciplines all over campus were associated with the Workshop and would be happy to fill in. Ostrom, however, was adamant. “It’s my class! It’s early in the semester and we have stuff to do!” Fischer recalled her saying.

Ostrom eventually relented. That story, however, shows how dedicated she was to her work and her students. It was never about the accolades, although she was awarded many. Lin and Vincent set out in 1973 to create an academic community unlike any other. They envisioned a community based on shared values and commitments to collaboration and the deep interrogation of ideas. The concept of an artisan’s workshop was essential to this vision.

Visitors to the Workshop can see several woodworking pieces made by Vincent and Lin. The couple apprenticed with a local cabinet maker to learn the craft of woodworking. They learned from the experienced artisan how to take a raw hardwood log full of knots and burls—what some might consider flaws—and draw out the beauty within. It took them years to develop the artist’s eye to see each log’s unique potential and the technique to express it. Such pieces cannot be mass produced like a two-by-four. Rather, the woodworker must learn a variety of techniques and choose the appropriate ones to create a work of art.

For forty years, that’s how Vincent and Lin operated the Workshop on Political Theory and Policy Analysis. In that realm, they were the experienced artisans and their students apprenticed with them. Edella Schlager and Abigail York both studied as graduate students with Ostrom, separated by twenty years. Schlager and York are now professors, one at the University of Arizona and the other at Arizona State University. They both noted that the Ostroms were deeply committed to this approach to mentoring. “Obviously Lin and Vincent were huge names, but they treated everyone with the utmost respect,” York told me. “As a grad student, it was remarkable to be in a place where not only were you respected as a graduate student, but you were respected as a peer. You’re sort of a peer in training, almost like an apprentice.”

Schlager recalled similar experiences. “Lin didn’t do a lot of hand holding. She expected you to be responsible for your own work. But she was there to support you, work with you, and help you. So, I try to do the same with my students because it doesn’t do them any good if they can’t make that transition from being a student to being their own independent scholar where they can stand on their own, publish on their own.”

The Ostroms’ commitment to respect and collaboration extended to all of the Workshop staff. York said that everyone who worked there was given respect for not only the spaces they controlled, but also (and more importantly), for their humanity. “I remember different times when people would be sitting in and she would ask what [nonacademic staff] thought on whatever topic.” Ostrom recognized that the Workshop functioned as a team. York said, “We all have important knowledge and there wasn’t this sort of hierarchy.”

When Ostrom won the Nobel Prize, she donated the prize money to the Workshop. The research, she said, was a collective effort by the entire staff.[^21]

Barbara Cherry did not study with the Ostroms. However, she became affiliated with the Workshop after leaving the private sector for an academic career. In a roundtable discussion on mentoring and the future of the Ostrom Workshop, Cherry marveled at the Ostroms’ commitment to collaborative scholarship. “Part of paying it forward,” she said, “is being able to continue the openness, collaboration, the welcoming, as you all described. It’s about being critical, tough, but with integrity and respect and with caring. So, it’s good research, it’s collaborative. You don’t take schlocky work but you don’t beat people down. I’ve worked in private sector, government, and academia. In academia I don’t know of any group that has this same culture right now. To me, part of continuing the legacy of the Ostroms is to facilitate that.”

![[logo.png]]

After winning the Nobel Prize in 2009, Ostrom spent a great deal of time traveling to give invited presentations. Back at home, Vincent’s health continued to decline. She realized she could not continue to lead the Workshop and juggle those other commitments. Michael McGinnis agreed to step in as Workshop director on a temporary basis through 2012.

Ostrom received a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in the fall of 2011. “Everybody knows that’s serious stuff,” Fischer said to me. “She had to adjust her lifestyle a little bit.” Doctors administered chemotherapy treatments, but Ostrom continued giving invited talks as much as she could. “Quite frankly,” Fischer recalled, “in the winter she was pretty good. She aged a little faster maybe. But everybody got comfortable. It was still Lin.”

Even though she wasn’t leading the Workshop anymore, it was constantly on her mind. Fischer said, “She understood that she needed to put some things in place.” He didn’t know the details at the time. Later, however, he learned that Lin and Vincent’s estate would be donated to the Workshop. Vincent’s two children from his previous marriage had both passed away years earlier.

With the Workshop’s finances set, Ostrom turned to who would serve as the next director. McGinnis’s term would be over in the summer of 2012. In late 2011, Ostrom called Fischer into her office. She asked Fischer to succeed McGinnis as Workshop director. He declined.

“You know, I’m a forester. I’m an applied kind of guy.” Even though he had served as State Forester for Indiana, he didn’t think of himself as a social scientist. “I turned her down. I don’t think she was very happy about that. But she said, okay.”

A few months rolled by, and she had not yet found a new director. No single person could really do all the work that Ostrom had done by herself. So, she decided there would be two codirectors. Ostrom called Fischer into her office again.

“Well, I’ve talked to some people. And I really need you to be codirector of the Workshop,” she told Fischer. Ostrom had already talked to a geography professor, Tom Evans, who agreed to codirect it. Fischer would run the day-to-day operations and Evans would handle the research side. He accepted the job. “You knew time was short and she wanted to get that resolved.”

Ostrom passed away on June 12, 2012 at age seventy-eight. Vincent died seventeen days later.

The Ostroms may no longer be with us, but their vision for the Workshop continues. Lee Alston became the Workshop’s director in 2014. He supervised the expansion of Workshop’s program areas into the digital realm, including cybersecurity and information governance. In 2020, Alston handed the Workshop director duties to Scott Shackelford.

Even though the leadership and staff have changed over the years, the Workshop still maintains its commitment to collaborative scholarship. The methods and concepts the Ostroms developed, such as the Institutional Analysis and Development Framework, social–ecological systems, and polycentricity, remain critical tools for studying common-pool resources. These tools have endured because they are specific enough to guide the analyst yet general enough to be useful in a wide range of settings. Critically, the principles center around the community members, not the analyst.

Ostrom may be remembered for refuting the “tragedy of the commons,” but she left us with much more. She reminds us that we are not trapped, doomed to deplete our resources. We have within us the capacity for self-governance. James Waithaka and the taxi drivers of Nairobi figured this out, as did Maine’s lobster harvesters, València’s irrigation communities, and the young idealists who founded the May Creek Farm. Self-governance, however, isn’t easy. It takes dedicated people to invest time, effort, and knowledge into crafting—and enforcing—an enduring system of rules. There is no single prescription to resolve the commons dilemma. Thanks to Ostrom, we have her design principles to guide us in the right direction.

In her Nobel Prize address, Ostrom emphasized that “humans have a more complex motivational structure and more capability to solve social dilemmas” that they are given credit for. Ostrom’s work showed that there are more than two solutions—“the market” or “the state”—as Garrett Hardin and countless others assumed. In between lies a vast area of solutions created by, and for, local communities. “A core goal of public policy,” Ostrom continued, “should be to facilitate the development of institutions that bring out the best in humans.”[^22]

[^28]: . The State of Maine has its own lobster conservation laws, including the double gauge and V-notch rules. However, other states with lobster industries have only a minimum size rule. The Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (1976) established eight regional fishery councils, including one for New England. In the late 1970s, the New England Fishery Management Council wanted the states to harmonize their lobster laws. The council suggested that Maine drop the double gauge and V-notch rules to be consistent with the other states. Maine’s lobster industry recoiled at the suggestion. Maine is still the only state in the region that uses those rules in lobster management.

Some of the seminal works on the topic by American scholars, such as Thomas Glick and Arthur Maass, were written in the 1970s and use Castilian Spanish terms (as did Ostrom). Franco, who ruled Spain from 1939 to 1975, tried to unite the country under a single Spanish language (Castilian). He discouraged the use of local languages like Valencià. Many Valèncians, especially farmers, still use the local language, and Valencià is now taught in schools.
