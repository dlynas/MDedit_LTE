Index]]Acknowledgments

While I was collecting the essays assembled in this book and writing the introductory narratives for each chapter, I had numerous dialogues and discussions with friends and colleagues about the history and evolution of the current change of paradigms in science and society and about a systemic perspective on current events.

I am especially grateful to Hazel Henderson, Terry Irwin, Jeremy Lent, Pier Luigi Luisi, Oscar Motomura, and Daniel Wahl for enlightening conversations; to the alumni of my online Capra Course around the world for countless stimulating discussions; and to Mira Michelle Kennedy and Phoebe Tickell for facilitating them.

I am very grateful to Miguel Altieri and to Jonathan Ashmore for their critical readings of the manuscript and for many helpful suggestions.

Special thanks are due to my agent, Andy Ross, and my publisher, Stephen Hull, for their encouragement, support, and advice.

Last but not least, I am deeply grateful to my wife, Elizabeth, and to my daughter, Juliette, for their understanding and support, and for numerous editorial suggestions.Preface

I was trained as a physicist and spent 20 years, from 1965 to 1985, doing research in theoretical high-energy physics at various European and American universities. Early on, I became interested in the philosophical implications of the conceptual revolution that took place in modern physics—a change from the mechanistic worldview of Descartes and Newton to a systemic and ecological view. In the early 1970s, I began to explore these implications systematically, publishing my findings in a series of books, as well as in numerous articles, lectures, and seminars.

Eventually, in the mid-1980s, I stopped my work in physics altogether and became a full-time writer, educator, and activist. My research and writing since that time has involved explorations of many fields of knowledge in a meandering process with many tangential (and sometimes erroneous) pursuits, but always with an explicit systemic perspective. Looking back on these explorations now, I can see that they amounted to a systematic investigation of a central theme: the fundamental change of worldview, or change of paradigms, that is now occurring in science and in society, the unfolding of a new vision of reality and the social and political implications of this cultural transformation.

The essays in this book reflect the evolution of my thinking during five decades (from 1971 to 2020). Many contain materials that never made it into any of my books, and quite a few have never even appeared in print.[^1]

These essays combine and interrelate the two sides of my professional life as a scientist and science writer, on the one hand, and as an environmental educator and activist on the other. Hence, they reflect not only the trajectory of my career but also the history of several movements for social change—from the counterculture of the 1960s to the New Age movement of the 1970s, the emergence of Green politics in the 1980s, and the rise of the global civil society from the 1990s to the present.

My research of the change of paradigms in science and society culminated in a grand synthesis, which I discuss in detail in the textbook _The Systems View of Life: A Unifying Vision_, coauthored with Pier Luigi Luisi.[^2] Unlike _The Systems View of Life_, the present book is not a summary of my worldview, but rather a personal account of my intellectual journey, documented by a series of essays together with extensive commentaries that interweave the essays and provide historical and philosophical context.

_Patterns of Connection_ shows the evolution of my thinking long before acceptance by the academic and political establishments. The essays illustrate my fascination with the philosophy of quantum physics and my encounter with Eastern mysticism, which culminated in the writing of _The Tao of Physics_;[^3] the change of focus of my research from physics to the life sciences; my 25-year-long project of formulating a grand synthesis of the systems view of life; and my activities as an environmental activist and educator.

From my student years in Vienna, I was fascinated by the dramatic changes of concepts and ideas that occurred in physics during the first three decades of the 20th century. This fascination was stimulated by my reading of the book _Physics and Philosophy_ by Werner Heisenberg,[^4] one of the founders of quantum theory. In this book, Heisenberg describes vividly how the exploration of atomic and subatomic phenomena brought a handful of physicists in contact with a strange and unexpected reality, which forced them to dramatically change their basic concepts, their language, and their whole worldview. Heisenberg’s book had a decisive influence on my thinking and determined the trajectory of my entire career as a scientist and writer.

Between my student years in Vienna and the writing of my first book lies the period of my life in which I experienced the most profound and most radical personal transformation—the period of the 1960s. The spirituality, questioning of authority, sense of empowerment, and experience of community that were characteristic of those formative years became the foundation of my values and of my activities as an environmental activist and educator. During the sixties, I experienced the memorable student uprising in Paris, which is still widely known simply as “May 68.” In the fall of that year, I moved to California, where I fully embraced the counterculture, read books about Eastern mysticism, practiced meditation, and experimented with psychedelics—all while also continuing my research in high-energy physics.

With the resulting expansion of my consciousness, I soon recognized significant parallels between the basic concepts of modern physics, as discussed in Heisenberg’s book, and the principal ideas of Eastern spiritual traditions. In 1970, while working at Imperial College in London, I decided to write a book about my discovery that modern physics leads us to a consistent view of the world that is in harmony with ancient Eastern wisdom. First published in 1975, _The Tao of Physics_ is still my best known and most successful book. It has been available in over 40 editions in over 20 languages and has sold more than a million copies worldwide.

As a consequence of this tremendous success, I was invited to give lectures and seminars to people and organizations from all walks of life. In discussions, many of them told me that a similar change of worldview—from a mechanistic to a holistic and ecological view—was now happening in their fields. These discussions stimulated me to expand my focus from physics to those other fields—biology, medicine, psychology, economics, management, and so on.

To connect the conceptual changes in science with the broader change of worldview and values in society, I had to go beyond physics and look for a corresponding broader framework. In doing so, I realized that our major social issues—health, education, human rights, social justice, political power, protection of the environment, the management of business enterprises, and the economy—all have to do with living systems, with individual human beings, social systems, and ecosystems.

With this realization, my research interests shifted from physics to the life sciences, and I began to develop a new conceptual framework that could incorporate various dimensions of life using insights from the theory of living systems, complexity theory, and ecology. I presented summaries of this framework, as it evolved, in several books: _The Turning Point_,[^5] _The Web of Life_,[^6] and _The Hidden Connections_.[^7] My final synthesis, as I have mentioned, is published in the textbook _The Systems View of Life_, coauthored by Pier Luigi Luisi. In fact, I had already used this expression, “the systems view of life,” in 1982 to describe my synthesis in its first tentative formulation in _The Turning Point_.

For me, this textbook is really a grand synthesis of my work over the past 40 years. Pier Luigi Luisi contributed many additional portions, including important sections on biochemistry, genetics, evolution, and the origin of life. What is also new in the book is an extensive section of over 60 pages dedicated to detailed discussions of effective systemic solutions (i.e., solutions based on systemic thinking) to our global crisis. These include proposals to reshape economic globalization and restructure corporations; new forms of ownership that are not extractive but generative; a wide variety of systemic solutions to the interlinked problems of energy, food, poverty, and climate change; and the large number of systemic design solutions known collectively as ecodesign, which embody the basic principles of ecology. Many of these solutions were not known in 2002 when I first published my full synthesis of the systems view of life in _The Hidden Connections_.

My interest in applying systemic thinking to solving the major problems of our time goes back to the 1980s, when I became involved in environmental activism. In 1984, I and a small group of friends and colleagues founded an ecological think tank called the Elmwood Institute, which over the next ten years built a network of thinkers and activists from many fields and in many parts of the world. In 1994, we transformed the Institute into the organization Center for Ecoliteracy, which promotes “education for sustainable living” in primary and secondary schools.

Over the years, I have realized that the two sides of my professional life—as a scientist and writer, and as an environmental educator and activist—are closely interrelated. This has been a very happy realization, because it allows me to pursue my intellectual interests as a scientist in a way that is fully consistent with my values.

The main focus of my environmental education and activism is to help build and nurture sustainable communities. To do so, we can learn valuable lessons from the study of ecosystems, which _are_ sustainable communities of plants, animals, and microorganisms. So the quest for ecological sustainability naturally leads to the question, How do ecosystems work? How do they organize themselves to sustain their life processes over time? This question, in turn, leads to the more general question, How do living systems—organisms, ecosystems, and social systems—organize themselves? In other words, what is the nature of life? And this is the focus of my theoretical work.

The essays in this book are grouped in 11 chapters according to the subject matters that were at the center of my attention during various phases of my career, and they are arranged, more or less, in chronological order. In chapter 1]], I review my philosophical roots, paying tribute to Werner Heisenberg, who had a decisive influence on my thinking, and reflecting on the counterculture of the 1960s, the formative period of my youth.

The essays in chapter 2]] chronicle my discovery of the parallels between modern physics and Eastern mysticism. They are based on my first two articles on this subject and on a talk I gave at CERN, the prestigious European research center for particle physics, in the years preceding the publication of _The Tao of Physics_. I conclude chapter 2]] with a tribute to Geoffrey Chew, whose thought deeply influenced my views of science.

In chapter 3]], I discuss the implications of the “new physics” (as I saw them at the time) for medicine, psychology, and economics, and I conclude the chapter with a review of the developments in theoretical particle physics since the publication of _The Tao of Physics_.

Chapter 4]] reflects my change of focus from physics to the life sciences. It begins with an homage to Gregory Bateson, whose influence triggered that change, followed by a summary of my first tentative synthesis of the systems view of life, as published in _The Turning Point_ in 1982. The chapter includes an assessment of the role of physics in the current change of paradigms, correcting and qualifying the arguments I advanced several years earlier in the essay reproduced in chapter 3]].

In chapter 5]], I explore various social and political implications of the systems view of life, starting with the recognition that the major problems of our time are systemic problems, all interconnected and interdependent. The essays in this chapter stem from my activities as environmental activist during the 1980s.

The essays in chapter 6]] reflect my work in environmental education during the 1990s. They are based on talks I gave to teachers and administrators in American public schools, promoting the concepts of ecological literacy and education for sustainability.

Chapter 7]] represents the next step in my synthesis of the systems view of life (published in _The Web of Life_ in 1996), in which I integrated the insights of complexity theory, as well as the theories about life’s self-organization of Ilya Prigogine, Humberto Maturana, and Francisco Varela. The first essay is an homage to the pioneering work of Russian systems thinkers during the first five decades of the 20th century. The subsequent essays, exploring the theme “complexity and life,” are based on seminars in three rather special settings—in Ireland, in Cuba, and in a theater in San Francisco.

The essays in chapter 8]] embody my full synthesis, integrating the biological, cognitive, social, and ecological dimensions of life. They include my review of a documentary film about the Scottish artist Andy Goldsworthy, whose ephemeral sculptures, in my opinion, express an intuitive understanding of the essential dynamics of life.

In chapter 9]], as in chapter 5]], I discuss the social and political implications of the systems view of life, but this time based on the conceptual framework of my full synthesis, published in _The Hidden Connections_ in 2002. The essays in this chapter analyze the systemic nature of the world’s global problems and review corresponding systemic solutions.

In March 2020, as I was about to finish the manuscript of this book, my daily life was changed dramatically, as were all our lives, by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. I put my manuscript aside and concentrated on trying to understand the origins and impact of the pandemic from a systemic perspective. While sheltering at home, I became engaged online more than ever, as I received countless requests for a systemic analysis of COVID-19. Essay 27]] is my summary of such an analysis. I argue that the coronavirus must be seen as a biological response of Gaia, our living planet, to the ecological and social emergency humanity has brought upon itself, and I discuss the valuable, life-saving lessons Gaia has offered us with this pandemic and the urgent need to apply these lessons also to the climate crisis.

In chapter 10]], I explore the ethical dimensions of the systems view of life. This includes a review of the philosophy of deep ecology and of the declaration of ethical values and principles presented in the Earth Charter.

In the final chapter, chapter 11]], I review the evolution of my thinking on science and spirituality—the theme that set me on the road, 50 years ago, of exploring the various areas of knowledge and activist strategies discussed in the essays of this book.

## Philosophical Roots

## _Heisenberg and the Sixties_

IN MY CHILDHOOD and early youth, I had three formative experiences that shaped my values and my way of thinking. The first was that I grew up on a farm. I spent most of the first 12 years of my life on a farm in the south of Austria, in the countryside. This was right after World War II. The farm belonged to my grandmother, and our whole family took refuge there from the war. We were around 10 or 15 family members, what you would call an extended family now, and there were many refugees from the surrounding countries—Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and so on—who worked on the farm, building shelters for themselves where they could sleep. The community on my grandmother’s farm was a large one. In those days, right after the war, you could not buy much; everything had broken down, and the farm was totally self-sufficient. We had our fruits and vegetables, cows for milk and butter, chickens for eggs, and pigs for meat. We baked our bread and pressed oil from sunflower seeds, and cider from apples and pears. Everything was recycled, even metal, which was used by our neighbor, who was a blacksmith.

In those first 12 years of my life, I had a very direct contact with nature. My brother, my cousins, and I spent the whole summer barefoot, and we also did some work on the farm. One of our products was apples of many different kinds, for which our valley (the Lavanttal) was famous. As a child, I not only knew the names of these species of apples, but could also identify the corresponding trees from their bark, leaves, and growth patterns. Many of the things I have written about—ecological awareness, recycling, sustainability, the sense of community—are things I experienced in my childhood on the farm.

In the early 1950s, my parents moved to Innsbruck, in the heart of the Tyrolean Alps, where I continued to feel close to nature, but this time by hiking and skiing in the mountains. During my teenage years in Innsbruck, my parents were the second formative influence on my intellectual development. My mother was a poet, playwright, and literary critic. My father was a lawyer and also an amateur philosopher. He had a large library of philosophy books and loved to talk about the great German philosophers—Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer, and others. He also had books about Hinduism and Buddhism, and he often talked about the differences between Buddhism and Christianity.

My mother read Shakespeare and other poets to my brother and me at an early age. She worked on her poetry and plays very early in the morning before taking care of her family. Her bedroom was next to my brother’s and mine, and during all those years, I would wake up every morning to the soft sounds of her typewriter. I believe that I inherited from my mother not only the gift but also the discipline of writing.

I grew up with many conversations about philosophy, art, and literature at the dinner table. Both my parents were passionate about art. Beginning in the mid-1950s, we went to Italy on our summer vacations, where I experienced both the very different Italian lifestyle and the great Renaissance and Baroque art and architecture. In short, the family milieu during my teenage years was artistic and philosophical. The third formative influence during my early youth was a very special mathematics teacher in high school, Peter Lesky, who awakened in me a fascination with abstract thought, which eventually led me to theoretical physics. Lesky was young, fresh out of university, and very enthusiastic about mathematics, an excitement he conveyed to us students, especially to those of us who were gifted for math. He had our rapt attention when he told us about mathematical problems that hadn’t been solved, and we would ask him, “If I solve this, will I get the Nobel Prize?” He really stimulated our creativity. I remember that I worked very hard on trigonometry at home and managed to derive a mathematical theorem, only to be heartbroken when my teacher told me that it had already been discovered.

I also had private tutoring sessions with Lesky after class. I remember that he taught me calculus when I was 15 or 16. I was so enthusiastic about mathematics that I decided to become a mathematician. When I enrolled in the University of Innsbruck, I chose mathematics as a major and physics as a minor. In my first course in mathematics, on calculus, I had a very boring teacher. But the professor of theoretical physics, Ferdinand Cap, was flamboyant and exciting. Cap loved his physics, and I was very inspired by him. So, I switched from mathematics to physics after my first semester. This was again the influence of an inspiring teacher.

A key event in my life as a physics student (first in Innsbruck and then in Vienna) was my reading of Werner Heisenberg’s book _Physics and Philosophy_,[^1] his classic account of the history and philosophy of quantum physics. It is a scholarly book, quite technical at times, but also full of personal and even highly emotional passages. Heisenberg, one of the founders of quantum theory and, along with Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr, one of the giants of modern physics, vividly describes how a handful of physicists in the 1920s encountered a strange and bewildering reality in their atomic experiments and how those scientists, in their struggle to grasp this new reality, became painfully aware that their basic concepts, their language, and their whole way of thinking were inadequate to describe atomic phenomena.

I read _Physics and Philosophy_ in the late 1950s, soon after it was published. As a young student, I understood no more than about half of the book, but I loved it, and it stayed with me throughout my career. I read it again and again, and I learned from Heisenberg that the “new physics” implied a whole new worldview.

In fact, with hindsight, I can pinpoint a sentence in Heisenberg’s book that planted a seed in my mind that would mature, more than a decade later, in my systematic investigation of the limitations of the Cartesian worldview. “[The Cartesian] partition,” wrote Heisenberg, “has penetrated deeply into the human mind during the three centuries following Descartes, and it will take a long time for it to be replaced by a really different attitude toward the problem of reality.”[^2]

My first essay in this book, appropriately, is a tribute to Werner Heisenberg. I explain how Heisenberg came face to face with the strange reality of atomic phenomena, how he developed the first logically consistent formulation of quantum theory, and how he recognized that this new formalism would force physicists to restrict the applicability of their intuitive notions of space and time and of cause and effect. His greatness was that he not only recognized these limitations and their profound philosophical implications, but was able to stake them out in a precise mathematical form that now bears his name, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

I met Heisenberg twice in my life: in 1972, just after beginning to work on _The Tao of Physics_, and in 1974, when I showed him my completed manuscript. Both meetings, described in detail in my book _Uncommon Wisdom_,[^3] were highly inspirational for me and gave me tremendous confidence. At the end of our long and detailed discussion of my manuscript, Heisenberg said simply, “Basically, I am in complete agreement with you.”

During our first meeting, Heisenberg told me that he had become familiar with Indian philosophy during long discussions with the celebrated Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore, in whose home he was a guest. He also mentioned that recognizing the parallels between the concepts of quantum physics and Indian wisdom had been a great comfort to him.

For many years, I was unable to find independent confirmation of this story. But recently, I came across two sources in which the Heisenberg-Tagore meeting is mentioned. They confirm my recollection with only minor differences. In my second essay, I discuss the detailed documentation of this meeting, which was a significant event in the history of modern science but is still not generally known.

The third essay in this chapter is a reflection on the 1960s, the formative period of my youth in which I experienced the most profound and most radical personal transformation. I try to evoke the spirit of the counterculture of that remarkable period, identifying its defining characteristics and its expressions in many art forms that often involved radical innovations. At the end of the essay, I address some questions that are often asked nowadays: What happened to the cultural movements of the sixties? What did they achieve, and what, if anything, is their legacy?

I attempt to answer these questions by calling attention to the acceptance of many of the sixties’ alternative cultural values in today’s mainstream society, and I discuss the significant influence of the counterculture on the inception of the information technology revolution in the 1970s, the ending of the Cold War and the rise of Green politics in the 1980s, and the emergence of a global civil society, promoting the values of human dignity and ecological sustainability, in the 1990s. This new form of alternative global community, sharing core values and making extensive use of electronic networks in addition to frequent human contacts, is perhaps the most important legacy of the sixties.

ESSAY 1|Werner Heisenberg

### _Explorer of the Limits of Human Imagination_

1976

ONE MONTH AGO, on February 1, Werner Heisenberg died at the age of 74. He was one of the founders of quantum theory and will be remembered, along with Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr, as one of the giants of modern science who played a decisive role in the intellectual evolution of humankind.

The Darwinian theory of evolution may have been shocking; the discovery of the genetic code by Watson and Crick was certainly one of the most spectacular feats of modern science. But modern physics seriously challenged the human ability to understand the universe.

At the beginning of the 20th century, physicists, for the first time, probed deep into the atomic world, into a realm of nature far removed from their everyday environment, and in doing so, they transcended the limits of sensory imagination. They found, to their great surprise and dismay, that they could no longer rely with absolute certainty on logic and common sense, that ordinary language was often completely inadequate to describe the newly discovered phenomena.

This discovery came as a great shock to most of them. Einstein experienced this shock when he first came into contact with the new reality of atomic physics. He wrote in his autobiography, “All my attempts to adapt the theoretical foundation of physics to this [new type of] knowledge failed completely. It was as if the ground had been pulled out from under one, with no firm foundation to be seen anywhere upon which one could have built.”[^1]

Modern physics forced scientists to think in new categories about the universe. It was Heisenberg’s great achievement to recognize this clearly and to build, in terms of these new categories, the firm foundation that Einstein could not see anywhere.

Heisenberg became involved in atomic physics at the age of 20, when he was a student at the University of Munich. In 1922, his teacher, Arnold Sommerfeld, invited him to attend a series of lectures given by Niels Bohr in Göttingen. The topic of the lectures was Bohr’s new atomic theory, which had been hailed as an enormous achievement and was being studied by physicists throughout Europe.

In the discussion following one of these lectures, Heisenberg disagreed with Bohr about a particular technical point. Bohr was so impressed by the clear arguments of this young student that he invited him to come for a walk so that they could carry on their discussion. This walk, which lasted for several hours, was the first meeting of two outstanding minds, whose further interaction was to become a major force in the development of atomic physics.

Niels Bohr, 16 years older than Heisenberg, was a man with supreme intuition and a deep appreciation for the mysteries of the world, a man influenced by the religious philosophy of Kierkegaard and the mystical writings of William James. He was never fond of axiomatic systems and declared repeatedly, “Everything I say must be understood not as an affirmation, but as a question.” Werner Heisenberg, on the other hand, had a clear, analytic, and mathematical mind and was rooted philosophically in Greek thought, with which he had been familiar since his early youth. Bohr and Heisenberg represented the yin and yang aspects of the human mind. The dynamic, and often dramatic, interplay of these complementary poles was a unique process in the history of modern science and led to one of its greatest triumphs.

Bohr had postulated that atoms could exist only in discrete and stationary states in which their electrons circle around the nucleus in certain orbits with definite diameters. This theory was based on a combination of classical mechanics, to describe the motion of the electrons, and of so-called quantum conditions, which were imposed on this motion to determine the diameters of the electron orbits.

The investigations of atomic physicists, meanwhile, were plagued by paradoxes and apparent contradictions between the results of different experiments. Many of these paradoxes were connected with the dual nature of subatomic matter, which appeared sometimes as particles, sometimes as waves, a most puzzling behavior that was also exhibited by light or, more generally, by electromagnetic radiation.

Light, for example, was found to be emitted and absorbed in the form of quanta, but when these particles of light (now known as photons) traveled through space, they appeared as vibrating electric and magnetic fields that showed all the characteristic behavior of waves. Electrons had always been considered to be particles, and yet when a beam of these particles was sent through a small slit, it was diffracted just like a beam of light—in other words, electrons, too, behaved like waves. The strange thing was that the more physicists tried to clarify the situation, the sharper the paradoxes became.

Here, Heisenberg made his first crucial contribution. He saw that the paradoxes in atomic physics appeared whenever one tried to describe atomic phenomena in classical terms, and he was bold enough to throw away the classical conceptual framework. In 1925, he published a paper in which he abandoned Bohr’s description of electron motion in terms of the positions and velocities of the electrons. He replaced Bohr’s description with a much more abstract framework in which physical quantities were represented by sets of numbers obeying a peculiar multiplication rule. These sets were later recognized as matrices, and the whole formalism is now known as Heisenberg’s matrix mechanics. Heisenberg’s matrix mechanics was the first logically consistent formulation of quantum theory.

It was supplemented one year later by a different formalism, worked out by Erwin Schrödinger and known as “wave mechanics.” Both formalisms are logically consistent and are mathematically equivalent; the same atomic phenomena can be described in two different mathematical languages.

At the end of 1926, then, physicists had a complete and logically consistent mathematical formalism, but they did not always know how to use it to describe a given experimental situation. Heisenberg recognized that the root of these difficulties was the lack of a definite interpretation of the formalism, and he spent the following months in intensive, exhausting, and often highly emotional discussions with Bohr, Schrödinger, and others, until the situation was finally clarified. Heisenberg himself has described this crucial period in the history of quantum theory most vividly:

An intensive study of all questions concerning the interpretation of quantum theory in Copenhagen finally led to a complete . . . clarification of the situation. But it was not a solution which one could easily accept. I remember discussions with Bohr which went through many hours till very late at night and ended almost in despair; and when at the end of the discussion I went alone for a walk in the neighboring park I repeated to myself again and again the question: Can nature possibly be to absurd as it seemed to us in these atomic experiments?[^2]

Heisenberg recognized that the formalism of quantum theory cannot be interpreted in terms of our intuitive notions of space and time, or of cause and effect, but at the same time, he realized that all our concepts are connected with these intuitive notions of space and time. He concluded that there was no other way out than to retain the classical intuitive notions, but to restrict their applicability.

#### **The Uncertainty Principle**

Heisenberg’s great achievement was to express these limitations of classical concepts in a precise mathematical form, which now bears his name and is known as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. It consists of a set of mathematical relations that determine the extent to which classical concepts can be applied to atomic phenomena and thus stake out the limits of human imagination in the subatomic world.

To understand the substance of the uncertainty principle, we have to study the relation between the wave picture and the particle picture of subatomic matter. According to classical ideas, a wave is a vibrational pattern moving through space. It is characterized by an amplitude A, the up-and-down width of the vibration; and a wavelength L, the distance between successive crests.

![[f0008-01.jpg]]

Figure 1. A wave pattern.

A particle, on the other hand, is not spread out in space but has a well- defined position at any time, and its state of motion is described in terms of its velocity. It is obvious why physicists, for a long time, found it impossible to accept that something can be simultaneously a particle—that is, an entity confined to a very small volume—and a wave, as their experiments seemed to indicate.

The apparent contradiction between the two pictures was solved in a completely unexpected way that called into question the very foundation of the classical view of matter—the concept of its reality.

At the subatomic level, matter does not exist with certainty at definite places, but rather shows—as Heisenberg has put it—“tendencies to exist.” Quantum theory expresses these tendencies as probabilities and associates those probabilities with mathematical quantities that take the form of waves. This is why particles can be waves at the same time. They are not “real” three-dimensional waves like sound or water waves. They are “probability waves,” abstract mathematical quantities with all the characteristic properties of waves that are related to the probabilities of finding the particles at particular points in space and at particular times. All the basic laws of atomic physics are expressed in terms of these probabilities. We can never predict an atomic event with certainty; we can only say how likely it is to happen, expressed in terms of “probability waves.”

Quantum theory, now, associates the properties of a probability wave with the properties of the corresponding particles in the following way. Where the amplitude of the wave is large, we are likely to find the particle if we look for it; where it is small, we are unlikely to find it. As the amplitude of the wave gives us information about the particle’s position, the information about the particle’s velocity is contained in the wavelength of the wave. The smaller the wavelength, the faster the particle.

A wave that is spread out like the one in our example does not tell us much about the position of the corresponding particle. It can be found anywhere along the wave with the same likelihood. Very often, however, we deal with situations in which the particle’s position is known to some extent, as for example in the description of an electron in an atom. In such a case, the probabilities of finding the particle in various places must be confined to a certain region. Outside this region they must be zero. This can be achieved by a wave pattern like the one in the following diagram, which corresponds to a particle located in the region X.

![[f0010-01.jpg]]

Figure 2. A wave packet corresponding to a particle located somewhere in the region X.

Such a pattern is called a wave packet. This pattern shows that the particle is located somewhere inside the region X, but it does not allow us to localize it any further. For points inside the region, we can only give the probabilities for the presence of the particle. The length of the wave packet represents therefore an uncertainty in the position of the particle. Regarding the velocity of the particle, the important property of such a wave packet is that it has no definite wavelength; that is, the distances between two successive crests are not equal throughout the pattern.

There is a spread in wavelength, the amount of which depends on the length of the wave packet: the shorter the wave packet, the larger the spread in wavelength. This has nothing to do with quantum theory, but simply follows from the properties of waves. Wave packets do not have a definite wavelength. Quantum theory comes into play when we associate the wavelength with the velocity of the corresponding particle. If the wave packet does not have a well-defined wavelength, the particle does not have a well-defined velocity. This means that there is not only an uncertainty in the particle’s position, corresponding to the length of the wave packet, but also an uncertainty in its velocity, caused by the spread in wavelength.

The two uncertainties are interrelated. The spread in wavelength (i.e., the uncertainty of velocity) depends on the length of the wave packet (i.e., on the uncertainty of position). If we want to localize the particle more precisely—that is, if we want to confine its wave packet to a smaller region—this will result in an increase in the spread of wavelength, and thus in an increase in the uncertainty of the particle’s velocity.

The precise mathematical form of this relation between the uncertainties of position and velocity of a particle is given by Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. It means that in the subatomic world, we can never know both the position and velocity of a particle with great accuracy. The better we know the position, the hazier will be its velocity, and vice versa. We can decide to undertake a precise measurement of either of the two quantities—but then we will have to remain completely ignorant about the other one.

The relation between the uncertainties of a particle’s position and velocity is not the only form of the uncertainty principle. Similar relations hold between other quantities, for example, between the time an atomic event takes and the energy it involves. Thus the uncertainty principle consists of a whole set of “uncertainty relations.”

It is important to realize that the limitations expressed by these relations are not caused by the imperfection of our measuring techniques, but rather are limitations of principle that are inherent in the atomic reality. If we decide to measure a particle’s position precisely, the particle simply _does not have_ a well-defined velocity, and vice versa.

The uncertainty principle thus measures the extent to which the scientist influences the properties of the observed objects through the decision to measure one property or the other. In atomic physics, the scientist cannot play the role of a detached objective observer but becomes involved in the world he or she observes. Heisenberg’s principle measures this involvement.

On the most fundamental level, Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is a measure of the unity and interrelatedness of the universe. We have come to realize in modern physics that the material world is not a collection of separate objects but a web of relations between the various parts of a unified whole. Our classical notions, derived from our ordinary experience, are not fully adequate to describe this world. The concept of a distinct particle, for example, is an idealization that has no fundamental significance. When we describe the properties of such an entity in terms of classical concepts—like position, energy, and velocity, for example—we always find pairs of concepts that are interrelated and cannot be defined simultaneously in a precise way. The more we impose the one concept of the physical “object,” the more the other concept becomes uncertain. The precise relation between the two is given by the uncertainty principle.

Like no one else, Werner Heisenberg explored the limits of human imagination, the limits to which our conventional concepts can be stretched, and the extent to which we have to become involved in the world we observe. His greatness was that he not only recognized these limitations and their profound philosophical implications, but was able to stake them out with mathematical clarity and precision.

ESSAY 2|Heisenberg and Tagore

2017

IN 1972, I met Werner Heisenberg, one of the giants of modern physics, whose book _Physics and Philosophy_ had a decisive influence on my thinking. I gave a detailed account of my conversations with Heisenberg and of my personal impressions of him in my book _Uncommon Wisdom_.[^1]

At that time, I had just begun to work on _The Tao of Physics_,[^2] and so I was naturally curious to hear Heisenberg’s thoughts on Eastern philosophy. He told me to my great surprise not only that he had been well aware of the parallels between quantum physics and Eastern thought, but also that his own scientific work had been influenced, at least at the subconscious level, by Indian philosophy. Here is how I recorded that part of our conversation:

In 1929 Heisenberg spent some time in India as the guest of the celebrated Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore, with whom he had long conversations about science and Indian philosophy. This introduction to Indian thought brought Heisenberg great comfort, he told me. He began to see that the recognition of relativity, interconnected-ness, and impermanence as fundamental aspects of physical reality, which had been so difficult for himself and his fellow physicists, was the very basis of the Indian spiritual traditions. “After these conversations with Tagore,” he said, “some of the ideas that had seemed so crazy suddenly made much more sense. That was a great help for me.”[^3]

After the publication of my account, I tried repeatedly, without success, to find an independent confirmation of Heisenberg’s significant meeting with Tagore. I looked through several biographies of Tagore and spoke to Tagore scholars, but I could not find anyone who knew about that meeting. While Tagore’s conversations with Albert Einstein in 1930 are well documented, there seemed to be no record of his meeting with Heisenberg several months earlier. For many years, I felt slightly uncomfortable thinking that my recollection of my conversation with Heisenberg might be the only source of this historical encounter. It was only very recently that a friend of mine, Brazilian historian of science Gustavo Rocha, showed me two sources in which the Heisenberg-Tagore meeting is mentioned. They confirmed my recollection with only minor differences.

In his biography of Werner Heisenberg, physicist Helmut Rechenberg, who was a student of Heisenberg, gives a detailed account of Heisenberg’s 1929 lecture tour around the world, which took him from Germany to the United States, Japan, India, and back to Germany.[^4]

On October 4, 1929, Rechenberg writes, Heisenberg visited the University of Kolkata, where he was received with great honors by the entire faculty, and in the afternoon of that day, he visited Rabindranath Tagore. On the following day, Heisenberg wrote to his parents: “_Nachmittags war ich bei dem indischen Dichter Rabindranath Tagore zu Gast_” (“In the afternoon, I was the guest of the Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore.”).[^5]

At our meeting in Munich, 43 years later, Heisenberg used very similar words. “_In Indien war ich bei Rabindranath Tagore zu Gast_,” he told me, “_und wir sprachen lange über Wissenschaft und indische Philosophie_” (“In India I was the guest of Rabindranath Tagore, and we spoke for a long time about science and Indian philosophy”). At that time, I misinterpreted his words “_war ich bei Rabindranath Tagore zu Gast_” as meaning that he was a house guest of Tagore and “_wir sprachen lange_” as meaning that they had several long conversations, instead of just one conversation during a long afternoon.

Another account of the Heisenberg-Tagore meeting is given in the book _Rabindranath Tagore: The Myriad-Minded Man_ by Krishna Dutta and Andrew Robinson.[^6] “Heisenberg expressed an interest in seeing RT,” the authors write, “and was taken to [Tagore’s villa] by the scientist D. M. Bose, a nephew of J. C. Bose. ‘We left Heisenberg to have a talk with the poet. I do not remember what was the substance of this talk, but Heisenberg was very much impressed by the poet’s illuminatory personality, which reminded him of a prophet of the old days’ (Bose Institute, p. 15).”

The authors then add, “However, according to Heisenberg’s wife (who was not a scientist), ‘my husband was not too much impressed by his [Tagore’s] thoughts. The mixture of eastern and western philosophy in his thoughts did not really convince him’ (Elisabeth Heisenberg to Authors, 3 Oct. 1990).” In my view, Heisenberg may not have been very impressed by Tagore’s remarks right away. But I believe that over the years, he absorbed Tagore’s expositions much more fully and that late in his life, when I met him, he had realized their influence on his thinking.

Indeed, when I sent Heisenberg a copy of my first article about modern physics and Eastern mysticism, titled “The Dance of Shiva: The Hindu View of Matter in the Light of Modern Physics” (essay 4]] in this book), he replied, “_Haben Sie den besten Dank für die Übersendung Ihrer Arbeit_ ‘_The Dance of Shiva_’. _Die Verwandtschaft der alten östlichen Lehren mit den philosophischen Konsequenzen der modernen Quantentheorie haben [_sic_] mich immer wieder fasziniert_” (“Many thanks for sending me your paper ‘The Dance of Shiva.’ The kinship between the ancient Eastern teachings and the philosophical consequences of the modern quantum theory have [_sic_] fascinated me again and again”).[^7]

Heisenberg’s acknowledgment of the parallels between quantum theory and Indian philosophy gave me tremendous moral support while I wrote _The Tao of Physics_, and I am delighted that I have now finally found confirmation of his historic encounter with Rabindranath Tagore, which he described to me so emphatically during our conversation.

ESSAY 3|Where Have All the Flowers Gone?

### _Reflections on the Spirit and Legacy of the Sixties_

2002

THE 1960S WERE the period of my life during which I experienced the most profound and most radical personal transformation. For those of us who identify with the cultural and political movements of the sixties, that period represents not so much a decade as a state of consciousness, characterized by transpersonal expansion, the questioning of authority, a sense of empowerment, and the experience of sensuous beauty and community.

This state of consciousness reached well into the seventies. In fact, one could say that the sixties came to an end only in December 1980, with the shot that killed John Lennon. The immense sense of loss felt by so many of us was, to a great extent, about the loss of an era. For a few days after the fatal shooting, we relived the magic of the sixties. We did so in sadness and with tears, but the same feeling of enchantment and community was once again alive. Wherever you went during those few days—in every neighborhood, every city, every country around the world—you heard John Lennon’s music, and the intense idealism that had carried us through the sixties manifested itself once again:

_You may say I’m a dreamer_,

_but I’m not the only one_.

_I hope some day you’ll join us_

_and the world will live as one.[^1]_

In this essay, I shall try to evoke the spirit of that remarkable period, identify its defining characteristics, and provide an answer to some questions that are often asked nowadays: What happened to the cultural movements of the sixties? What did they achieve, and what, if any, is their legacy?

#### **Expansion of Consciousness**

The era of the sixties was dominated by an expansion of consciousness in two directions. One movement, in reaction to the increasing materialism and secularism of Western society, embraced a new kind of spirituality akin to the mystical traditions of the East. This involved an expansion of consciousness toward experiences involving non-ordinary modes of awareness, which are traditionally achieved through meditation but may also occur in various other contexts, and which psychologists at the time began to call “transpersonal.” Psychedelic drugs played a significant role in that movement, as did the human-potential movement’s promotion of expanded sensory awareness, expressed in its exhortation, “Get out of your head and into your senses!”

The first expansion of consciousness, then, was a movement beyond materialism and toward a new spirituality, beyond ordinary reality via meditative and psychedelic experiences, and beyond rationality through expanded sensory awareness. The combined effect was a continual sense of magic, awe, and wonder that for many of us will forever be associated with the sixties.

#### **Questioning of Authority**

The other movement was an expansion of social consciousness, triggered by a radical questioning of authority. This happened independently in several areas. While the American civil rights movement demanded that Black citizens be included in the political process, the free speech movement at Berkeley and student movements at other universities throughout the United States and Europe demanded the same for students.

In Europe, these movements culminated in the memorable revolt of French university students that is still known simply as “May ’68.” During that time, all research and teaching activities came to a complete halt at most French universities when the students, led by Daniel Cohn-Bendit, extended their critique to society as a whole and sought the solidarity of the French labor movement to change the entire social order. For three weeks, the administrations of Paris and other French cities, public transport, and businesses of every kind were paralyzed by a general strike. In Paris, people spent most of their time discussing politics in the streets, while the students held strategic discussions at the Sorbonne and other universities. In addition, they occupied the Odéon, the spacious theater of the Comédie-Française, and transformed it into a twenty-four-hour “people’s parliament,” where they discussed their stimulating, albeit highly idealistic, visions of a future social order.

The year 1968 was also the year of the so-called Prague Spring, during which Czech citizens, led by Alexander Dubček, questioned the authority of the Soviet regime, which alarmed the Soviet Communist Party to such an extent that a few months later, it crushed the democratization processes initiated in Prague in its brutal invasion of Czechoslovakia.

In the United States, opposition to the Vietnam war became a political rallying point for the student movement and the counterculture. It sparked a huge anti-war movement, which exerted a major influence on the American political scene and led to many memorable events, including the decision by President Johnson not to seek reelection, the turbulent 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago, the Watergate scandal, and the resignation of President Nixon.

#### **A New Sense of Community**

While the civil rights movement questioned the authority of white society and the student movements questioned the authority of their universities on political issues, the women’s movement began to question patriarchal authority, humanistic psychologists undermined the authority of doctors and therapists, and the sexual revolution, triggered by the availability of birth control pills, broke down the puritan attitudes toward sexuality that were typical of American culture.

The radical questioning of authority and the expansion of social and transpersonal consciousness gave rise to a whole new culture—a “counterculture”—that defined itself in opposition to the dominant “straight” culture by embracing a different set of values. The members of this alternative culture, who were called hippies by outsiders but who rarely used that term themselves, were held together by a strong sense of community. To distinguish ourselves from the crew cuts and polyester suits of that era’s business executives, we wore long hair, colorful and individualistic clothes, flowers, beads, and other jewelry. Many of us were vegetarians who often baked our own bread, practiced yoga or some other form of meditation, and learned to work with our hands in various crafts.

Our subculture was immediately identifiable and tightly bound together. It had its own rituals, music, poetry, and literature; a common fascination with spirituality and the occult; and the shared vision of a peaceful and beautiful society. Rock music and psychedelic drugs were powerful bonds that strongly influenced the art and lifestyle of the hippie culture. In addition, the closeness, peacefulness, and trust of the hippie communities were expressed in casual communal nudity and freely shared sexuality. In our homes, we would frequently burn incense and keep little altars with eclectic collections of statues of Indian gods and goddesses, meditating Buddhas, yarrow stalks or coins for consulting the _I Ching_, and various personal “sacred” objects.

Although different branches of the sixties movement arose independently and often remained distinct movements with little overlap for several years, they eventually became aware of one another, expressed mutual solidarity, and, during the 1970s, merged more or less into a single subculture. By that time, psychedelic drugs, rock music, and hippie fashion had transcended national boundaries and forged strong ties among the international counterculture. Multinational hippie tribes gathered in several countercultural centers—London, Amsterdam, San Francisco, Greenwich Village—as well as in more remote and exotic cities like Marrakech and Kathmandu. These frequent cross-cultural exchanges gave rise to an alternative global awareness long before the onset of economic globalization.

#### **The Sixties’ Music**

The zeitgeist of the sixties found expression in many art forms that often involved radical innovations, absorbed various facets of the counterculture, and strengthened the multiple relationships among the international alternative community.

Rock music was the strongest among these artistic bonds. The Beatles broke down the authority of studios and songwriters by writing their own music and lyrics, creating new musical genres, and setting up their own production company. While doing so, they incorporated many facets of the period’s characteristic expansion of consciousness into their songs and lifestyles.

Bob Dylan expressed the spirit of the political protests in powerful poetry and music that became anthems of the sixties. The Rolling Stones represented the counterculture’s irreverence, exuberance, and sexual energy, while San Francisco’s acid rock scene gave expression to its psychedelic experiences.

At the same time, the free jazz of John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, Sun Ra, Archie Shepp, and others shattered conventional forms of jazz improvisation and gave expression to spirituality, radical political poetry, street theater, and other elements of the counterculture. Like the jazz musicians, classical composers, such as Karlheinz Stockhausen in Germany and John Cage in the United States, broke down conventional musical forms and incorporated into their music much of the sixties’ spontaneity and expanded awareness.

The fascination of the hippies with Indian religious philosophies, art, and culture led to a great popularity of Indian music. Most record collections in those days contained albums of Ravi Shankar, Ali Akbar Khan, and other masters of classical Indian music along with rock and folk music, jazz and blues.

The rock and drug culture of the sixties found its visual expressions in the psychedelic posters of the era’s legendary rock concerts, especially in San Francisco, and in album covers of ever increasing sophistication, which became lasting icons of the sixties’ subculture. Many rock concerts also featured light shows—a novel form of psychedelic art in which _resources/books//Patterns of Connection_ Essential Essays F - Fritjof Capra of multicolored, pulsating, and ever changing shapes were projected onto walls and ceilings. Together with the loud rock music, these visual _resources/books//Patterns of Connection_ Essential Essays F - Fritjof Capra created highly effective simulations of psychedelic experiences.

#### **New Literary Forms**

The main expressions of sixties’ poetry were in the lyrics of rock and folk music. In addition, the “beat poetry” of Allen Ginsberg, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Gary Snyder, and others, which had originated a decade earlier and shared many characteristics with the sixties’ art forms, remained popular in the counterculture.

One of the major new literary forms was the magical realism of Latin American literature. In their short stories and novels, writers like Jorges Luis Borges and Gabriel García Márquez blended descriptions of realistic scenes with fantastic and dreamlike elements, metaphysical allegories, and mythical _resources/books//Patterns of Connection_ Essential Essays F - Fritjof Capra. This was a perfect genre for the counterculture’s fascination with altered states of consciousness and pervasive sense of magic.

In addition to the Latin American magical realism, science fiction, especially the complex series of _Dune_ novels by Frank Herbert, exerted great fascination on the sixties’ youth, as did the fantasy writings of J. R. R. Tolkien and Kurt Vonnegut. Many of us also turned to literary works of the past, such as the romantic novels of Hermann Hesse, in which we saw reflections of our own experiences.

Of equal, if not greater, popularity were the semifictional shamanistic writings of Carlos Castaneda, which satisfied the hippies’ yearning for spirituality and separate realities mediated by psychedelic drugs. In addition, the dramatic encounters between Castandeda and the Yaqui sorcerer Don Juan symbolized in a powerful way the clashes between the rational approach of modern industrial societies and the wisdom of traditional cultures.

#### **Film and the Performing Arts**

In the sixties, the performing arts experienced radical innovations that broke every imaginable tradition of theater and dance. In fact, in companies like the Living Theater, the Judson Dance Theater, and the San Francisco Mime Troupe, theater and dance were often fused and combined with other forms of art. The performances involved trained actors and dancers as well as visual artists, musicians, poets, filmmakers, and even members of the audience.

Men and women often enjoyed equal status. Nudity was frequent. Performances, often with strong political content, took place not only in theaters but also in museums, churches, parks, and in the streets. All these elements combined to create the dramatic expansion of experience and strong sense of community that was typical of the counterculture.

Film, too, was an important medium for expressing the zeitgeist of the sixties. Like the performing artists, the sixties’ filmmakers, beginning with the pioneers of the French New Wave cinema, broke with the traditional techniques of their art, introducing multimedia approaches, often abandoning narratives altogether and using their films to give a powerful voice to social critique.

With their innovative styles, these filmmakers expressed many key characteristics of the counterculture. For example, we can find the sixties’ irreverence and political protest in the films of Godard, the questioning of materialism and a pervasive sense of alienation in Antonioni, questioning of the social order and transcendence of ordinary reality in Fellini, the exposure of class hypocrisy in Buñuel, social critique and utopian visions in Kubrick, the breaking down of sexual and gender stereotypes in Warhol, and the portrayal of altered states of consciousness in the works of experimental filmmakers like Kenneth Anger and John Whitney. In addition, the films of these directors are characterized by a strong sense of magical realism.

#### **The Legacy of the Sixties**

Many of the cultural expressions that were radical and subversive in the sixties have been accepted by broad segments of mainstream culture during the subsequent three decades. Examples would be the long hair and sixties fashion, the practice of Eastern forms of meditation and spirituality, recreational use of marijuana, increased sexual freedom, rejection of sexual and gender stereotypes, and the use of rock music (and more recently, rap) to express alternative cultural values. All of these were once expressions of the counterculture that were ridiculed, suppressed, and even persecuted by the dominant mainstream society.

Beyond these contemporary expressions of values and esthetics that were shared by the sixties’ counterculture, the most important and enduring legacy of that era has been the creation and subsequent flourishing of a global alternative culture that shares a set of core values. Although many of these values—for example, environmentalism, feminism, gay rights, global justice—were shaped by cultural movements in the seventies, eighties, and nineties, their essential core was first expressed by the sixties’ counterculture. In addition, many of today’s senior progressive political activists, writers, and community leaders trace the roots of their original inspiration back to the sixties.

#### **Green Politics**

In the sixties, we questioned the dominant society and lived according to different values, but we did not formulate our critique in a coherent, systematic way. We did have concrete criticisms on single issues, such as the Vietnam war, but we did not develop any comprehensive alternative system of values and ideas. Our critique was based on intuitive feeling; we lived and embodied our protest rather than verbalizing and systematizing it.

The seventies brought consolidation of our views. As the magic of the sixties gradually faded, the initial excitement gave way to a period of focusing, digesting, and integrating. Two new cultural movements—the ecology movement and the feminist movement—emerged during the seventies and together provided the much needed broad framework for our critique and alternative ideas.

The European student movement, which was largely Marxist oriented, was not able to turn its idealistic visions into realities during the sixties. But it kept its social concerns alive during the subsequent decade, while many of its members went through profound personal transformations. Influenced by the two major political themes of the seventies, feminism and ecology, these members of the New Left broadened their horizons without losing their social consciousness. At the end of the decade, many of them became the leaders of transformed socialist parties. In Germany, these “young socialists” formed coalitions with ecologists, feminists, and peace activists, out of which emerged the Green Party—a new political party whose members confidently declared, “We are neither left nor right; we are in front.”

During the 1980s and 1990s, the Green movement became a permanent feature of the European political landscape, and Greens now hold seats in numerous national and regional parliaments around the world. They are the political embodiment of the core values of the sixties.

#### **The End of the Cold War**

During the 1970s and 1980s, the American antiwar movement expanded into the anti-nuclear and peace movements, in solidarity with corresponding movements in Europe, especially those in the United Kingdom and West Germany. This, in turn, sparked a powerful peace movement in East Germany, led by the Protestant churches, which maintained regular contacts with the West German peace movement, and in particular with Petra Kelly, the charismatic leader of the German Greens.

When Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in the Soviet Union in 1985, he was well aware of the strength of the Western peace movement and accepted our argument that a nuclear war could not be won and should never be fought. This realization played an important part in Gorbachev’s “new thinking” and his restructuring (perestroika) of the Soviet regime, which would lead, eventually, to the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia, and the end of Soviet Communism.

All social and political systems are highly nonlinear and do not lend themselves to being analyzed in terms of linear chains of cause and effect. Nevertheless, careful study of our recent history shows that the key ingredient in creating the climate that led to the end of the Cold War was not the hardline strategy of the Reagan administration, as the conservative mythology would have it, but the international peace movement. This movement clearly had its political and cultural roots in the student movements and counterculture of the sixties.

#### **The Information Technology Revolution**

The last decade of the 20th century brought a global phenomenon that took most cultural observers by surprise. A new world emerged, shaped by new technologies, new social structures, a new economy, and a new culture. _Globalization_ became the term used to summarize the extraordinary changes and the seemingly irresistible momentum that were now felt by millions of people.

A common characteristic of the multiple aspects of globalization is a global information and communications network based on revolutionary new technologies. The information technology revolution is the result of a complex dynamic of technological and human interactions, which produced synergistic effects in three major areas of electronics—computers, microelectronics, and telecommunications. The key innovations that created the radically new electronic environment of the 1990s all took place 20 years earlier, during the 1970s.

It may be surprising to many that like so many other recent cultural movements, the information technology revolution has important roots in the sixties’ counterculture. It was triggered by a dramatic technological development—a shift from data storage and processing in large, isolated machines to the interactive use of microcomputers and the sharing of computer power in electronic networks. This shift was spearheaded by young technology enthusiasts who embraced many aspects of the counterculture, which was still very much alive at that time.

The first commercially successful microcomputer was built in 1976 by two college dropouts, Steve Wosniak and Steve Jobs, in their now legendary garage in Silicon Valley. These young innovators and others like them brought the irreverent attitudes, freewheeling lifestyles, and strong sense of community they had adopted in the counterculture to their working environments. In doing so, they created the relatively informal, open, decentralized, and cooperative working styles that became characteristic of the new information technologies.

#### **Global Capitalism**

However, the ideals of the young technology pioneers of the seventies were not reflected in the new global economy that emerged from the information technology revolution 20 years later. On the contrary, what emerged was a new materialism, excessive corporate greed, and a dramatic rise of unethical behavior among our corporate and political leaders. These harmful and destructive attitudes are direct consequences of a new form of global capitalism, structured largely around electronic networks of financial and informational flows. The so-called global market is a network of machines programmed according to the fundamental principle that profit should take precedence over human rights, democracy, environmental protection, or any other value.

Since the new economy is organized according to this quintessential capitalist principle, it is not surprising that it has produced a multitude of interconnected harmful consequences that are in sharp contradiction to the ideals of the global Green movement: rising social inequality and social exclusion, a breakdown of democracy, more rapid and extensive deterioration of the natural environment, and increasing poverty and alienation. The new global capitalism has threatened and destroyed local communities around the world, and with the pursuit of an ill-conceived biotechnology, it has invaded the sanctity of life by attempting to turn diversity into monoculture, ecology into engineering, and life itself into a commodity.

It has become increasingly clear that global capitalism in its present form is unsustainable and needs to be fundamentally redesigned. Indeed, scholars, community leaders, and grassroots activists around the world are now raising their voices, demanding that we must change the game and suggesting concrete ways of doing so.

#### **The Global Civil Society**

At the turn of this century, an impressive global coalition of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), many of them led by men and women with deep personal roots in the sixties, formed around the core values of human dignity and ecological sustainability. In 1999, hundreds of these grassroots organizations interlinked electronically for several months to prepare for joint protest actions at the meeting of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Seattle. The Seattle Coalition, as it is now called, was extremely successful in derailing the WTO meeting and in making its views known to the world. Its concerted actions have permanently changed the political climate around the issue of economic globalization.

Since that time, the Seattle Coalition, or global justice movement, has not only organized further protests but has also held several World Social Forum meetings in Porto Alegre, Brazil. At the second of these meetings, the NGOs proposed a set of alternative trade policies, including concrete and radical proposals for restructuring global financial institutions, that would profoundly change the nature of globalization.

The global justice movement exemplifies a new kind of political movement that is typical of our Information Age. Because of their skillful use of the Internet, the NGOs in the coalition are able to network with each other, share information, and mobilize their members with unprecedented speed. As a result, the new global NGOs have emerged as effective political actors who are independent of traditional national or international institutions. They constitute a new kind of global civil society.

This new form of alternative global community, sharing core values and making extensive use of electronic networks in addition to frequent human contacts, is one of the most important legacies of the sixties. If it succeeds in reshaping economic globalization so as to make it compatible with the values of human dignity and ecological sustainability, the dreams of the “sixties revolution” will have been realized:

_Imagine no possessions_,

_I wonder if you can_,

_no need for greed or hunger_,

_a brotherhood of man_.

_Imagine all the people_

_sharing all the world_ . . .

_You may say I’m a dreamer_,

_but I’m not the only one_.

_I hope some day you’ll join us_

_and the world will live as one.[^2]_

## Modern Physics and Eastern Mysticism

## _First Discoveries of the Parallels_

MY EXPLORATION OF the parallels between modern physics and Eastern mysticism was triggered by a unique experience I had in California in 1969. I was sitting on a beach one late-summer afternoon, watching the waves rolling in and feeling the rhythm of my breathing, when I suddenly became aware of my whole environment as being engaged in a gigantic cosmic dance. Being a physicist, I knew that the sand, rocks, water, and air around me were made of vibrating molecules and atoms, and that these consisted of particles that interacted with one another by creating and destroying other particles. I knew also that the Earth’s atmosphere was continually bombarded by showers of so-called cosmic rays—particles of high energy undergoing multiple collisions as they penetrate the air.

All this was familiar to me from my research in high-energy physics, but until that moment, I had only experienced it through graphs, diagrams, and mathematical theories. As I sat on that beach in meditation, my former experiences came to life. I “saw” cascades of energy coming down from outer space, in which particles were created and destroyed in rhythmic pulses. I “saw” the atoms of the elements and those of my body participating in this cosmic dance of energy. I felt its rhythm and I “heard” its sound, and that moment I _knew_ that this was the Dance of Shiva, the Lord of Dancers worshipped in Hinduism.

In 1970, I returned to Europe to continue my research at Imperial College in London. Shortly before leaving California, I had designed a photo montage of a dancing Shiva, superimposed by tracks of colliding particles in a bubble chamber, to commemorate my “epiphany on the beach.” One day, I took this photomontage to Imperial College to show it to an Indian colleague of mine with whom I happened to share an office.

His reaction was astonishing. When I showed him the photomontage, without any comment, he was deeply moved. Tears came to his eyes and he spontaneously began reciting sacred verses in Sanskrit that he remembered from his childhood. He told me that he had grown up as a Hindu but had forgotten everything about his spiritual heritage when he became “brainwashed” by Western science, as he put it. He himself would never have thought of the parallels between particle physics and Hinduism, he said, but upon seeing my photomontage, they immediately became evident to him.

This moving encounter was a confirmation for me that I had discovered something important, and I decided to write a book about it. However, I did not feel quite ready to embark on such a big project. I was a young physicist who had never published anything except a dissertation and a few technical papers. Over the next two-and-a-half years, I undertook a systematic study of Eastern spiritual traditions—Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism—and of the parallels I saw between these traditions and the basic concepts and theories of modern physics, and in 1971, I wrote two articles summarizing my first discoveries of these parallels. The first two essays in this chapter are based on these two articles. In the spring of 1973, I felt ready to write _The Tao of Physics_. I finished my manuscript in December 1974. In January 1975, I moved back to California and have been living here ever since.

Essay 4]], “The Dance of Shiva: The Hindu View of Matter in the Light of Modern Physics,” opens with the photomontage of Shiva Nataraja, the divine cosmic dancer, superimposed by particle tracks in the foreground. In the essay, I concentrate on two key ideas common to Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism: the fundamental unity of the cosmos and of all life, and the view of the universe as being intrinsically dynamic with time and change as essential features. I show how both of these ideas are also key elements of quantum theory, relativity theory, and quantum field theory.

In essay 5]], “Bootstrap and Buddhism,” I concentrate on the parallels between Buddhism and “bootstrap physics,” the theoretical model and philosophy developed by Geoffrey Chew, who would become, after Heisenberg, my second important mentor in physics for the next 14 years. The bootstrap theory is based on the idea that nature cannot be reduced to fundamental entities, like fundamental constituents of matter, but has to be understood through self-consistency, that is, through the requirement that all the theory’s components be consistent with one another and with themselves.

As I explain in the essay, this idea constitutes a radical departure from the traditional spirit of basic research in physics. In the bootstrap model of subatomic particles, each particle contains (or better, involves) all other particles, and none of them is fundamental. Similarly, the philosophy of Mahayana Buddhism holds that an enlightened person perceives the world as a perfect network of mutual relations where each individual object contains in itself all other objects.

The bootstrap theory was very popular in the 1970s, but during the 1980s and 1990s, it was eclipsed by the success of the so-called standard model, which is very different, as it postulates the existence of fundamental fields and their corresponding particles. And today, bootstrap physics has virtually disappeared from the scene. However, I continue to believe that the bootstrap philosophy is a valid expression of the fundamental interrelation of all subatomic particles. In the subsequent chapter, I shall offer a reassessment of Chew’s bootstrap theory in the light of the new developments in particle physics during the 40 years after the publication of _The Tao of Physics_.

The third essay in this chapter, essay 6]], is based on a colloquium lecture I gave at CERN, the European research center for particle physics, in April 1972. I was invited to give this talk by my friend Joël Scherk, a brilliant young physicist who was one of the principal theorists developing string theory before his untimely death at the age of 34, and who was also a practicing Zen Buddhist. The lecture was one of my first public presentations of my discoveries. It represents my conception of _The Tao of Physics_ in a nutshell.

Speaking to a group that included many of the world’s leading particle physicists, I was naturally quite circumspect. I carefully explained the epistemological context of my comparison between physics and Eastern philosophy, I emphasized that these were intuitive insights rather than logical deductions, I conceded that I was not an expert on Eastern philosophy, and I avoided the term _mysticism_, which I knew would be perceived as controversial, if not threatening.

I introduced some basic characteristics of Eastern philosophies, concentrating on the two key ideas of the unity and dynamic nature of the universe. I then contrasted these characteristics with the views of the Greek atomists and the mechanistic worldview of Descartes, before comparing the concepts of Eastern philosophy with the basic ideas of quantum theory, relativity theory, and quantum field theory. I concluded with a discussion of Chew’s bootstrap theory and its parallels to the view of nature in Mahayana Buddhism. (I should mention that in this lecture to an audience of physicists, I naturally used technical terms without explaining them when I discussed concepts of modern physics. The corresponding nontechnical explanations can be found in essays 4]] and [^5].)

The response from most of my fellow physicists at CERN was hardly more than polite, slightly amused interest. I am happy to note, however, that things have changed quite dramatically since then. In the years after the publication of _The Tao of Physics_, numerous books appeared in which physicists and other scientists presented similar explorations of the parallels between physics and Eastern mysticism. Some of those physicists might even have been in the audience of my CERN lecture. Other authors extended their inquiries beyond physics, finding similarities between Eastern thought and certain ideas about free will, death and birth, and the nature of life, mind, and consciousness.

In fact, more than three decades after my visit to CERN, the administration of the research center officially acknowledged my discovery of the parallel between Shiva’s cosmic dance and the dance of subatomic matter. In 2004, a 2-meter-tall Shiva statue was given to CERN by the Indian government to celebrate the research center’s long association with India. In choosing the image of Shiva Nataraja, the Indian government acknowledged the profound significance of the metaphor of Shiva’s dance for the cosmic dance of subatomic particles, which is observed and analyzed by CERN’s physicists. Today the statue stands in a courtyard, surrounded by research laboratories, and next to it CERN has installed a plaque explaining the significance of the metaphor of Shiva’s cosmic dance with several quotations from _The Tao of Physics_.

I conclude this chapter with a tribute to Geoffrey Chew (essay 7]]), written shortly after his death in April 2019. His thought deeply influenced my views of science and significantly shaped my career as a scientist and writer. Chew was a systemic thinker par excellence, and I recently realized that my regular scientific discussions with him over almost 15 years were also my training in systemic thinking. Thus, between the mid-1970s and the late 1980s, systems thinking became second nature to me long before I studied its history and achievements and discussed them in my books.

ESSAY 4|The Dance of Shiva

### _The Hindu View of Matter in the Light of Modern Physics_

1972

THE MODERN PHYSICIST who studies Eastern philosophies will find many fascinating parallels between the two subjects. This may at first seem of little importance. Parallels have been found between modern physics and almost every school of philosophy, from the atomistic theory of Democritus to the dialectic materialism of Marx and Lenin. The reason for this is simple. Both the scientist and the philosopher seek to understand the world, and since the structure of the world is too complex to be grasped completely by the human brain, they are forced to make up _resources/books//Patterns of Connection_ Essential Essays F - Fritjof Capra that more or less fit the reality. The _resources/books//Patterns of Connection_ Essential Essays F - Fritjof Capra of the philosopher are myths, poetical _resources/books//Patterns of Connection_ Essential Essays F - Fritjof Capra, symbols, and the like; those of the scientist are usually called models. Since both work with the same brain, they will often invent similar _resources/books//Patterns of Connection_ Essential Essays F - Fritjof Capra. Occasional similarities of thought patterns belonging to different disciplines are therefore not too astonishing.

If, however, such similarities occur frequently and consistently, one is led to believe that the general spirit of the two disciplines is the same. This seems to be the case for modern physics and Eastern philosophy. It is fascinating to see how basic ideas of modern physical theories are again and again reflected in Eastern mythological _resources/books//Patterns of Connection_ Essential Essays F - Fritjof Capra of great power and beauty. The more one studies Oriental philosophic and religious thought, the more one realizes how much the Eastern way of seeing the world is in agreement with modern scientific views.

In this article, we wish to concentrate on the image of the Hindu god Shiva and compare his cosmic dance to the description of matter and its interactions in quantum field theory. The dance of Shiva expresses two ideas that are basic to Eastern philosophy: the idea of the unity of the cosmos, and the idea that the cosmos is alive. We shall show how these two ideas arise in quantum mechanics and in relativity theory and how they find their clearest expression in quantum field theory.[^1]

In comparing a modern physical theory with a mythological image that is several thousand years old, we should, of course, not push the parallels too far. Being of mythological and poetic nature, the _resources/books//Patterns of Connection_ Essential Essays F - Fritjof Capra of Eastern religions do not lend themselves to logical analysis as scientific models do. Usually, they are also expressed in terms that have no exact counterparts in Western languages. In addition, there is as yet no complete scientific theory of matter and its interactions. The particular model under study is partly inconsistent with other models, just as the image of the Hindu god may partly contradict other myths of Hinduism. Therefore, it is not much use to press too hard for similarities. What should be obtained is an intuitive feeling of the basic harmony between the spirit of Eastern wisdom and Western science, rather than precise statements. This is the purpose of the present article.

#### **Eastern Philosophy**

In the paragraphs above, we have used the term _Eastern philosophy_ to refer to the religious philosophies of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism.[^2] Although these comprise a vast number of subtly interwoven theologies, spiritual disciplines, and philosophical systems, there are some basic features common to all of them. We shall, in the following, concentrate on two of these features that are relevant for our comparison with modern physics.

The first aspect is an idea that lies at the very basis of Eastern philosophy: the unity of the cosmos and of all life. According to the Eastern view, all things and phenomena we perceive with our senses are interrelated, being but different forms of the same divine reality. This reality has different names in different religions. It is called Brahman in Hinduism, Dharmakaya in Buddhism, Tao in Taoism, and so on. Under whatever name, it represents the basic universal concept that pervades all things:

He who, dwelling in all things, yet is other than all things, whom all things do not know, whose body all things are, who controls all things from within—He is your Soul, the Inner Controller, the Immortal.[^3]

Our normal attentive consciousness is not aware of this unity, but sees the world as composed of individual separate things and ourselves as isolated egos in this world. Such a state is called _avidya_ (ignorance) in Buddhist philosophy. It is seen as the state of a disturbed mind that has to be overcome:

When the mind is disturbed, the multiplicity of things is produced; but when the mind is quieted, the multiplicity of things disappears.[^4]

Our highest aim is therefore to become aware of the unity and mutual interrelation of all things, to transcend the notion of an isolated individual self and to identify ourselves with the divine reality. For the Hindu or Buddhist, this realization, which is known as enlightenment, is much more than a mere intellectual act. It is a religious experience involving a total change in the state of consciousness. Eastern philosophy can therefore never be separated from religion.

In Hinduism, the various forms of the divine are symbolized by numerous gods. Through their worship, the Hindu approaches the supreme Brahman, knowing, if he or she is intelligent and educated, that all these gods are ultimately identical. They are creations of the mind—_resources/books//Patterns of Connection_ Essential Essays F - Fritjof Capra through which reality is approached. In science, their counterparts are the scientific models whose purpose is exactly the same: to convey something about reality which cannot be stated explicitly.

In the Eastern view, then, the division of nature into separate objects is artificial and comes from our measuring and categorizing mind. Such artificial discrimination of objects that in reality are fluid and ever changing, without identity of their own, is called _maya_, “illusion,” in Hinduism. Eastern philosophies make no difference between living and dead things, nor between spirit and matter: “The Dharmakaya can manifest itself in various corporeal forms just because it is the real essence of them. Matter and mind from the beginning are not a duality.”[^5]

All things are forms of the same universal reality that is simultaneously spiritual and material. The whole cosmos is a unity and the whole cosmos is alive.

This dynamic view of the universe that contains time and change as essential features is the second basic idea relevant for the comparison with physics. We shall show below how both the idea of the unity of the universe and the idea of its intrinsically dynamical character arise in 20th-century physics.

Before going to modern physics, however, let us briefly reflect on the contrast between the views just described and those commonly held in the West. Most Western individuals are in the state of avidya, being aware of themselves as isolated egos that exist inside their bodies and are separated from the world “outside.” This world is seen as a multitude of different objects assembled into a huge machine. Such a way of thinking is a consequence of the dualism between spirit and matter, between mind and body, which is characteristic of Western thought. It has been formulated in its sharpest form by Descartes, who based his view of nature on the fundamental division between res cogitans and res extensa. The former category, the I, is completely separated from the latter, the world. All they have in common is their relation to God, who is separated from both the I and the world.

#### **Greek Philosophy**

Since Western thought is based on Greek philosophy, it is interesting to see how the spirit-matter dualism arose in the philosophy of the Greeks. It did not exist in the first period of Greek philosophy in the sixth century BCE. The philosophers of the Milesian school saw the world very much in the same way the Hindus do. Thales teaches that “all things are full of gods,” and Anaximander talks about an infinite and eternal divine substance that embraces everything—a perfect description of the Hindu Brahman.

The split in this unity of all things begins in the Eleatic school, which assumes a divine principle standing above gods and humans. This principle is first identified with the unity of the universe, but then is seen as an intelligent and personal God who stands above the world and directs it. Here lies the origin of the spirit-matter dualism.

Parmenides of Elea calls the basic principle the “being” and holds that it is unique and invariable. The external world is apparently a being, but in reality it is a becoming. The perceptions of the senses are therefore deceptive; the only true being is to be found in thought. Heraclitus is in sharp contrast to Parmenides. He says that there is only an eternal becoming in nature. All static being is based on deception. His fundamental statement is “Everything flows,” and his universal principle is the fire, a symbol for the continuous flow and change of all things.

In the fifth century BCE, the Greek philosophers tried to overcome the sharp contrast between the views of Parmenides and Heraclitus. To reconcile the unchangeable being of the one with the becoming of the other, they assumed that the being is given by certain invariable substances whose mixture and separation gives rise to the changes in the world. This led to the various atomistic models that culminated in the philosophy of Democritus. The essential difference between the primary substances of the atomists and the primary substance of the Milesian school or of Heraclitus is that the former do not contain any living force, but are purely passive and intrinsically dead. An external force that moves the material elements, which is of spiritual origin and thus fundamentally different from them, is added as a separate assumption. This way, the dualism between spirit and matter is clearly stated. Matter is dead and the mind is something fundamentally different.

#### **Western Thought**

Alan Watts has repeatedly pointed out the dangerous consequences of the dualism described above, which has become an essential feature of the Western way of thinking.[^6] It leads us to believe that the mind has to control the body and thus causes an apparent conflict between the conscious will and the involuntary instincts. Instead of finding our identity in our full organism, we Westerners find it in our mind only. What we call self-consciousness is therefore nothing but the sensation of the conflict between mind and body that leads to continuous metaphysical frustration.

A further consequence of such a view is the hostile attitude of Western civilization toward nature. Instead of living in harmony with nature, we want to conquer it and thereby destroy the environment on which our whole life depends. It is only very recently that people have become aware of this dangerous neglect of ecological balance.

Thus, the Cartesian split between spirit and matter has led Western civilization to metaphysical frustration and to a dangerous attitude toward its environment. On the other hand, however, it has been extremely useful for natural science. The view of matter as being dead and completely separated from human life led to the mechanistic models of classical physics which are the basis of Western science and technology. The Indians and Chinese, who have always had an organic view of the universe, developed philosophies of great wisdom and beauty but, until recently, were comparatively poor scientists. The fascinating development in modern physics is that the same science that originated in the split between spirit and matter has overcome this dualism and now leads us back to the views of the early Greek and Eastern philosophies.

We shall try to show in the following that the views of modern physics are in agreement with the two ideas basic to Eastern philosophy that have been described above: the idea that the universe is an organic unity whose parts are interdependent and inseparable, and the idea that the cosmos is alive. Both of these ideas also arise in quantum mechanics and in relativity theory and find their clearest modern expression in quantum field theory.

#### **Quantum Mechanics**

To begin with, the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics made it clear that a sharp separation between the I and the world is not possible.[^7] The analysis of an atomic experiment shows that the description of the object under study (an atom, or particle, etc.) has to take into account its interaction with the experimental apparatus and thus, in fact, with the rest of the world. For an accurate description of the experiment, we would therefore have to know the microscopic structure of the whole world. But even if we had such knowledge, we could not describe atomic phenomena with complete accuracy, because we are always forced to state the measurements in terms of classical physics. Although we know that the concepts of classical physics do not fit nature accurately, we cannot do without them, since they are an essential part of the language on which natural science is based. Therefore, our description will always reflect our incomplete knowledge of the world. We cannot describe the world without this reference to ourselves. As Werner Heisenberg has put it, “Natural science does not simply describe and explain nature; it is part of the interplay between nature and ourselves.”

The idea that matter is “alive” arises in modern physics as a consequence of the wave-particle character of matter that is one of the main concepts of quantum mechanics. It says that matter has two aspects, a particle aspect and a wave aspect. The two are, of course, mutually exclusive, but they are complementary. Depending on the circumstances, matter will appear sometimes as particles, sometimes as waves. The wave aspect introduces an essential “fuzziness” into nature. Since a wave cannot be said to be at this or that point, but is spread out over space, the corresponding particle can only be localized approximately. This is expressed mathematically by Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle:

Δx Δp ≥ h/2π

Here Δx is the uncertainty of an object’s position and Δp the uncertainty of its momentum. Their product can never be less than the constant h/2π. This means that we can never, even in principle, know both the position and momentum of a particle with great accuracy. A similar relation holds for other “complementary” quantities, for example, for time and energy.

The uncertainty principle implies that a particle can never be completely at rest. For if it were localized sharply at some point in space, this would imply a large uncertainty of momentum and therefore kinetic energy. The minimal kinetic energy is not zero, as in classical physics, but has some value that gives rise to a fluctuation of the particle in the region of the corresponding uncertainty of position. According to quantum mechanics, then, matter is never completely quiescent, but always in a state of motion. How much this is in the spirit of Eastern philosophy is best shown with a quotation from a Taoist text:

The stillness in stillness is not the real stillness. Only when there is stillness in movement can the spiritual rhythm appear which pervades heaven and earth.[^8]

If we now look at atoms, the uncertainty principle tells us that the electrons that are kept inside a very small volume by electrostatic forces must start to “jiggle around” with extreme rapidity. In fact, the confinement to about 10–8 cm results in enormous velocities of about 1,000 km/sec. If we go deeper into the atom and look at the nucleus, the situation is even more extreme. There, protons and neutrons are confined to 10–13 cm by the strong nuclear forces. Accordingly, they race about with fantastic velocities of 100,000 km/sec. Far from being dead and passive, atomic and nuclear matter is “cooking and boiling” most vehemently.

The velocities achieved in nuclear matter come close to the velocity of light, and therefore any theory of subnuclear particles must take relativity theory into account. This brings us to the second important part of modern physics: relativity theory.

#### **Relativity Theory**

Einstein’s special theory of relativity brought about a drastic change in our concepts of space and time. It showed us that space is not three dimensional and time is not a separate entity, both being intimately connected and forming a four-dimensional medium called space-time. Describing nuclear matter with a relativistic theory means, therefore, that whenever we think about nuclear matter, we have to think about it in terms of a four-dimensional reality involving space and time.

The Hindus and Buddhists certainly did not know anything about relativity theory, but they somehow sensed the space-time character of reality intuitively, for most of their concepts, _resources/books//Patterns of Connection_ Essential Essays F - Fritjof Capra, and myths contain time and change as essential elements. Examples of such concepts are the Hindu maya doctrine mentioned above, the concept of “interpenetration” in Mahayana Buddhism,[^9] or the _I Ching_, the basis of Chinese thought, which is called, characteristically, the _Book of Changes_. This time-minded intuition is perhaps one of the main reasons why Indian and Chinese views of matter seem to correspond more closely to modern scientific views than those of the Greeks, which were essentially static and largely determined by geometric considerations.

Let us now see how relativity theory has influenced our picture of matter. One of the immediate consequences of relativistic space-time concepts is the equivalence of mass and energy. This equivalence tells us that energy is not only connected with motion, but is also contained in the mere being of matter. This is a first indication of how the contrast between the being of Parmenides and the becoming of Heraclitus is overcome in a relativistic theory of matter. Energy can have both aspects: it can be an energy of being and it can be the energy of motion and change.

The fact that energy is contained in the mass of a material body suggests that even matter at rest is always connected with some activity. But if not motion, what is this activity? The answer to this question is given by quantum field theory, one of the most successful attempts to combine quantum mechanics and relativity theory into a relativistic theory of subatomic matter. In this theory, the activity of matter at rest appears in a new light. At the same time, the dualism between matter and force, between being and becoming, is overcome completely and the unity of the universe is expressed in a clear and beautiful way.

#### **Field Theory**

In order to see how this comes about, we have to study the central concept of field theory, the concept of a quantum field. The field concept was first developed in classical physics in an attempt to overcome the dualism between bodies and forces. The forces in classical mechanics are forces acting at a distance, rigidly connected with the bodies they act upon. This view was changed by the work of Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell, who showed that electric and magnetic fields, from which the corresponding forces can easily be calculated, have their own reality and possess an intrinsic dynamics expressed in Maxwell’s field equations. These fields were first pictured as disturbances of a substance, “ether,” spread out over the whole of space, but when Einstein formulated his theory of relativity, he realized that such an ether does not exist and that the electromagnetic fields are physical entities in their own right that can propagate through empty space. Light, for instance, is an electromagnetic field traveling through space in the form of waves.

The next step in the development of the field concept came through quantum mechanics, with the realization that electromagnetic waves, and in particular light waves, can appear as particles, just as material particles can appear as waves. The particles corresponding to light waves, the so-called photons, are massless and travel—by definition—at the speed of light. They are thus essentially relativistic particles, and the formalism of quantum mechanics alone is not adequate for their description.

In quantum field theory, now, relativity theory is combined with quantum mechanics to describe the photons in terms of quantum fields, that is, as fields that can take the form of quanta, or particles. The creation and destruction of particles, which is now well confirmed by experiments, is the crucial new feature of quantum field theory, and the field concept is extended to describe all particles, different particles being represented by different fields.

Whereas the classical field concept does not solve the dualism between matter and forces, but merely re-expresses it in terms of matter and fields, this dualism is overcome in quantum field theory. The quantum fields are considered as fundamental entities that give rise to the forces and to matter and thus establish the unity of these two concepts that seemed so irreconcilable to the Greek atomists.

The dual nature of quantum fields—forces or quanta—makes it possible for field theory to picture the interaction between particles as the exchange of other particles. In such exchange processes, energy is not conserved, and they should therefore be forbidden. However, if they occur during a very short time interval, the uncertainty principle will give rise to an uncertainty in energy that is sufficient to cover the violation of the law of energy conservation. In this way, the creation and subsequent destruction of the exchanged particles is possible during the short time interval. These particles are called virtual particles. They are not “real,” because they cannot exist longer than the uncertainty principle allows. All interactions between particles can be pictured to occur through such an exchange of virtual particles. The stronger the interaction force, the higher is the probability for such exchanges, that is, the more frequently virtual particles are exchanged.

The role of virtual particles is not limited to these interactions. A nucleon (proton or neutron), for instance, may very well emit a virtual particle and reabsorb it shortly afterward. The probability for such a “self-interaction” is again very high, since the nucleon is a strongly interacting particle, and the emission and absorption processes therefore occur very frequently. When a second nucleon comes near enough, some of the virtual particles may be exchanged; this constitutes the nuclear interaction.

According to quantum field theory, then, every strongly interacting particle must be regarded as a center of continuous activity surrounded by a cloud of virtual particles. The dynamical character of matter thus appears as motion in non-relativistic quantum theory and as the creation and destruction of particles in the relativistic theory.

The energy involved in the self-interaction is equivalent to a certain amount of mass, which contributes to the mass of the self-interacting particle. Mass is therefore not an intrinsic property of matter, but arises from its interaction. We are still very far from understanding this relation between mass and interaction in detail, but it becomes increasingly clear that the being of matter and its interaction cannot be separated. What we call an isolated particle is in reality the product of its interaction with its surroundings. It is therefore impossible to separate any part of the universe from the rest. This, however, is exactly the view that is so basic to Eastern philosophy and is emphasized repeatedly in its scriptures:

There is on earth no diversity.

He gets death after death,

Who perceives there seeming diversity.

As a unity only is It to be looked upon—

This indemonstrable, enduring Being.[^10]

In this connection, it is interesting to note that in Sanskrit, there are two terms used for “object,” _samskara_ and _vastu_, both of which mean first of all “an event” or “a happening,” and secondarily “an existing thing.”[^11] This shows how the Indians realized intuitively that the being and the activity of matter cannot be separated.

Coming back to field theory, we can see that the main idea that emerges is that the creation and destruction of matter is an essential feature of nature. It is the basis of all particle interactions and thus of all natural laws and ultimately of all life. More than that, it is an essential part of the existence of matter. Matter, far from being inert and dead, is pulsating all the time, creating and destroying particles at a dazzling rate. It is truly alive.

#### **Shiva**

When one imagines this continuous creation and destruction that goes on everywhere in the universe, the idea of a gigantic cosmic dance comes naturally into mind. Indeed, physicists often use expressions like “energy dance.” The most beautiful image of this dance, however, is represented in Hinduism by the god Shiva, the cosmic dancer. According to Hindu belief, all life is part of a great rhythmic process of creation and destruction, of death and rebirth, and Shiva’s dance symbolizes this eternal life-death rhythm. Shiva is the manifestation of the primal rhythmic energy that keeps the cosmos alive. This image is frequently expressed in Indian literature in lines such as the following:

Our Lord is the Dancer who, like the heat latent in firewood, diffuses His power in mind and matter and makes them dance in their turn.[^12]

We have seen above that modern physics reveals the creation-destruction rhythm of the universe in a new light. According to quantum field theory, this rhythm is not only expressed in the turn of the seasons and the death and rebirth of all creatures (in which the Hindus believe), but is also the basis of the existence of matter and of all laws of nature. Indian artists have expressed the eternal cosmic dance in magnificent sculptures of dancing Shivas. For the modern physicist, an equally beautiful expression of Shiva’s dance is found in the bubble chamber photographs of interacting particles that bear testimony to the continuous creation and destruction of matter in the universe. Modern science and ancient mythology express here the same basic intuition of life.

ESSAY 5|Bootstrap and Buddhism

1974

IN A RECENT article, we have pointed out some of the interesting parallels existing between modern physics and Eastern philosophy.[^1] We believe that these parallels are not superficial but come from a profound agreement between the Eastern way of seeing the world and the concepts of modern science. To give further support to this view, we study, in this essay, the so-called bootstrap model of strongly interacting particles and compare both its general philosophy and its more detailed features to the concepts of Mahayana Buddhism. The reader should not expect such a comparison to result in precise statements that can be put to logical analysis but should rather obtain an intuitive feeling for the basic harmony between the spirit of Eastern wisdom and Western science.

#### **Fundamentalists and Bootstrappers**

The originator and main advocate of the bootstrap model is Geoffrey Chew, and we shall follow his presentation of it closely throughout this paper.[^2] According to Chew, there are presently two schools of high-energy physicists with strongly opposed views concerning the constituents of matter. The majority of physicists are “fundamentalists” who try to reduce nature to fundamentals and look for the “basic building blocks” of matter. Opposed to them are the “bootstrappers” who seek to understand nature through self-consistency, believing that all of physics follows uniquely (i.e., without containing any arbitrary parameters) from the requirement that its components be consistent with one another and with themselves. Since a fundamental component is by definition one that is arbitrarily assignable, a bootstrap model should not contain any fundamental components.

Carried to its extreme, the bootstrap model leads beyond science. To quote Chew, “In the broad sense, the bootstrap idea, although fascinating and useful, is unscientific. . . . Science, as we know it, requires a language based on some unquestioned framework. Semantically, therefore, an attempt to explain everything can hardly be called scientific.”[^3]

The problem is the following. Since all phenomena are ultimately interconnected, in order to explain any one of them we have to understand all the others, which is obviously impossible. What makes science so successful is the discovery that approximations are possible. If one is satisfied with an approximate understanding, one can explain many phenomena in terms of a few and thus understand different aspects of nature in an approximate way without having to understand everything at once. This is the scientific method. All scientific theories and models are approximations to the true nature of things, but the error involved in the approximation is often small enough to make such an approach meaningful. Usually, the approximations inherent in a scientific theory are reflected in its arbitrary parameters or “fundamental constants.” A bootstrap theory should not contain any such parameters, but nevertheless it will, as we shall see below, contain some arbitrariness that reflects its approximate nature.

The main thesis of this article can now be summarized in the following way: there is a profound agreement between the bootstrap idea and Eastern philosophy. The fundamentalist view, on the other hand, has grown out of the general Western way of thinking, which is in turn based on Greek philosophy. The reason why the bootstrap model is accepted so reluctantly by physicists is that the Western way of thinking is so deeply ingrained in them. The contrast between fundamentalists and bootstrappers thus reflects the contrast between the Western and the Eastern view of seeing the world.

#### **The Western View**

The reduction of nature to fundamentals is basically a Greek attitude that arose in Greek philosophy together with the dualism between spirit and matter.[^4] The atomists pictured matter as being made of several fundamental elements, or atoms, that are purely passive and intrinsically dead. They were thought to be moved by some external force that was assumed to be of spiritual origin and was often identified with God. This marked the split between spirit and matter, between God and the world.

This way, the notion of “basic building blocks” and of God imposing his “fundamental laws” on the world arose. In subsequent centuries, this image became an essential part of the Western way of thinking. It was formulated in its sharpest form by Descartes, who based his philosophy on the fundamental division between the I, the world, and God. Classical physics was constructed after this model and proved extremely successful. When the discovery of quantum mechanics at the beginning of this century showed that the Cartesian split cannot be made when dealing with atomic matter, scientists therefore had great conceptual difficulties is accepting this fact. Heisenberg writes on this point, “The Cartesian partition has penetrated deeply into the human mind during the three centuries following Descartes, and it will take a long time for it to be replaced by a really different attitude toward the problem of reality.”[^5]

The same situation is now encountered by the bootstrap idea. It is accepted with great reluctance because the fundamentalist thinking is so intimately connected with the cultural and philosophical background of most physicists.

#### **The Eastern View**

Eastern philosophy, as we shall see below, is much more akin to the bootstrap idea.[^6] The Eastern view of the world is an organic one. All things and phenomena we perceive with our senses are interrelated and are manifestations of the same ultimate reality. This reality, called _Dharmakaya_ (the “body of being”) in Buddhism, is simultaneously spiritual and material, and hence there is no difference between mind and matter.

According to Eastern philosophy, our tendency to divide the perceived world into individual and separate things and to see ourselves as isolated egos in this world is an illusion that comes from the narrowness of our attentive consciousness. It is called _avidya_ (“ignorance”) in Buddhist philosophy:

When the oneness of the totality of things is not recognized,  
then ignorance as well as particularization arises.[^7]

The highest aim for the Hindu or Buddhist is to become aware of the unity and mutual interrelation of all things, to transcend the notion of an isolated individual self, and to identify oneself with the ultimate reality. The acquisition of this knowledge, which is known as “enlightenment,” is not a mere intellectual act but becomes a religious experience involving the whole person. Eastern philosophies are therefore always religions at the same time.

The idea of the unity and mutual interrelation of all things and events has found its clearest expression and its most far-reaching elaboration in Buddhism, and in particular in the Mahayana school, one of the two main schools of Buddhism. Mahayana Buddhism is therefore the one that comes closest to the bootstrap philosophy, since the consistency of nature that is so much emphasized by the bootstrappers, and the unity and interrelation of all phenomena on which the Buddhists insist, are just different ways of expressing the same idea.

The notion of basic building blocks, on the other hand, is seldom encountered in Asia and would generally be regarded as a product of _avidya_. In the _Discourse on the Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana_, one of the earliest treatises on Mahayana from which we have already quoted above, we find this significant passage:

When we divide some gross (or composite) matter, we can reduce it to atoms. But as the atom will also be subject to further division, all forms of material existence, whether gross or fine, are nothing but the shadow of particularization produced by the subjective mind, and we cannot ascribe any degree of (absolute or independent) reality to them.[^8]

The important difference between the scientific bootstrap and the Buddhist approach is that Buddhists are not interested in approximate knowledge, which they call “relative knowledge.” They are concerned with the absolute knowledge that corresponds to the complete bootstrap mentioned above. In such a world, where everything is interconnected, the properties of any one phenomenon follow from the properties of _all_ the others. To explain something means therefore to show how it is connected with all the rest of the world. This is obviously impossible, and Buddhists insist therefore on the fact that no single phenomenon can be explained:

Therefore all things in their fundamental nature are not namable or explicable. They cannot be adequately expressed in any form of language. (6)

For this reason, Buddhists are not interested in explaining things but rather in obtaining a direct experience of the unity of all things and events.

Coming back to the bootstrap, we note that the uniqueness of the model is an additional assumption. All of physics is believed to follow uniquely from the requirements of self-consistency. Now, a complete bootstrap that contains all phenomena and all concepts is necessarily also unique. Whether this is also true for the approximate scientific bootstrap is far from obvious. The uniqueness assumption for the scientific bootstrap thus reflects the optimism of the bootstrappers. Let us now see how such a model is constructed.

#### **The Hadron Bootstrap**

The approximation to which the bootstrappers limit themselves consists in neglecting all but the strong interactions. Since these interaction forces are about a hundred times stronger than the electromagnetic ones and many more orders of magnitude stronger than weak and gravitational interactions, such an approximation seems reasonable. This model is called the hadron bootstrap, hadrons being the name usually given to the strongly interacting particles.

The language that is appropriate for a bootstrap model of hadrons is the so-called S- matrix theory, the S-matrix being the collection of all possible particle reaction amplitudes expressed as functions of the momenta and spins of the colliding particles before and after the collision. In this theory, several basic constraints are imposed on the S-matrix, most of which correspond to our concepts of observation and of macroscopic space-time. These constraints constitute what Chew calls the “unquestioned framework” in the passage quoted above. Other constraints may reflect the arbitrariness of the model due to the approximations made and may have to be explained in a future, more precise model.

One of the constraints of the latter kind is the requirement that all hadrons be composite objects, none of them being any more elementary than the other. In view of the great number of “elementary particles” known at present, this requirement is esthetically appealing, but it is not necessary.[^9] It is hoped to emerge as a result of the complete hadron bootstrap.

The bootstrap picture of hadrons, then, is the following. All hadrons are composite structures whose components are again hadrons. The binding forces holding these structures together are the same forces through which hadrons mutually interact. The crucial point, which makes the calculation of these forces possible, is that a force between particles can be pictured as the exchange of other particles. This picture is very crude, because we do not know the properties of microscopic space-time, but it can be given a precise mathematical meaning in the S-matrix formalism.

In the hadron bootstrap, the exchanged particles are again hadrons. Each hadron plays therefore three roles: it is a composite structure, it may be a constituent of another hadron, and it may be exchanged between constituents and thus constitute part of the force holding the structure together. Each particle thus helps to generate other particles that in turn generate it. The whole set of hadrons generates itself this way, or “pulls itself up by its bootstraps,” which is the origin of the model’s name.

The idea, now, is that this extremely complex dynamical mechanism is self-determining, that is, that there is only one way in which it can be realized. This means that there is only one possible set of hadrons found in nature. The properties of hadronic matter follow uniquely, then, from the self-consistency of the hadron bootstrap and do not have to be introduced as fundamental quantities.

Physicists will perhaps never be able to carry out this ambitious program, but Chew envisages a series of partially successful models of smaller scope. Each of them would be intended to cover only part of hadron physics and would therefore contain some arbitrary parameters representing its limitations, but the parameter of one bootstrap model may be explained by another. Thus, wider and wider parts of hadron physics may gradually be covered with greater and greater accuracy by a combination of models whose net number of “arbitrary” parameters keeps decreasing.

#### **Mahayana**

We have already said that Mahayana Buddhism, whose central theme is the unity and interrelation of all phenomena, comes very close to the general bootstrap philosophy. What is more striking, however, is that its concepts agree to a surprising degree with those of the scientific bootstrap model.

The Mahayana doctrine is considered to be the climax of Buddhist thought that has developed in India, China, and Japan.[^10] It is based on the _Avatamsaka Sutra_, which is said to have been preached by the Buddha two weeks after his enlightenment. The core of the _Avatamsaka_ is a vivid description of how the world is seen in such a state of enlightenment when “the solid outlines of individuality melt away and the feeling of finiteness no more oppresses us.”[^11]

According to the _Avatamsaka Sutra_, an enlightened person perceives the world as a perfect network of mutual relations where each individual object, besides being immersed in the universal _Dharmakaya_, contains in itself all other individual objects as such. This is known as the theory of “interpenetration” and it is illustrated in the _Avatamsaka_ by the following parable:

In the heaven of Indra, there is said to be a network of pearls, so arranged that if you look at one you see all the others reflected in it. In the same way each object in the world is not merely itself but involves every other object and in fact _is_ everything else. In every particle of dust, there are present Buddhas without number.[^12]

The similarity of this image with the hadron bootstrap is indeed striking. The parable of Indra’s net of pearls may justly be called the first bootstrap model, created by the inquiring human mind some 2,500 years before the beginning of particle physics.[^13]

Mahayana Buddhists insist that the theory of interpenetration is not comprehensible intellectually but is to be experienced by an enlightened mind that transcends the dualism of logic. In modern physics, we do not have to be enlightened but are forced by nature to accept concepts that are no longer intelligible. In the present case of the hadron bootstrap, such a concept is the fact that a force can be represented by a particle. Because of this fact, a single hadron can be said to contain all the other hadrons and at the same time be part of each of them. This is exactly the view of the Mahayana school:

When the one is set against all the others, the one is seen as pervading them all and at the same time embracing them all in itself.[^14]

It is truly amazing that the human mind should have arrived at this image in two so different ways.

The similarity between the Mahayana theory of interpenetration and the bootstrap model is emphasized further by noting that the Sanskrit terms used for the individual interpenetrating objects are _samskara_ or _vastu_, both of which mean first “an event” or “a happening” and secondarily “an existing thing.”[^15] This clearly shows that Mahayana Buddhists conceive all objects in a dynamical way in complete agreement with the bootstrap view of hadrons as composite _dynamical_ structures.

#### **Enlargement of the Bootstrap**

In conclusion, we wish to speculate on some very exciting possibilities concerning the future of the bootstrap idea. If the bootstrap model proves successful for hadron physics, physicists will try to extend it to the other interactions. They will then have to find a more general framework, and some of the concepts that are now accepted a priori will have to be derived. These might include our concepts of macroscopic space-time and, as Eugene Wigner has argued, even of human consciousness.[^16]

This opens new and exciting possibilities for a direct interaction between physics and Eastern philosophy. The concept of human consciousness has been playing a central role in Eastern philosophy, and especially in Buddhism, for more than a millennium, and the conclusions Buddhists have reached differ often radically from the ideas held in the West. If we really want to include human consciousness in our realm of research, a study of Eastern ideas might conceivably provide us with the new viewpoint which many physicists feel is very much needed in physics today.

ESSAY 6|Particle Physics and Eastern Philosophy

1972

#### **Introduction**

When physicists lecture or write about their work, they usually try to prove or disprove certain things, and they do so by writing down equations or by presenting experimental results. In a slight departure from this standard process, here I am going to discuss intuitive insights I had into a surprising and, to me, fascinating relationship between particle physics and Eastern philosophy.

By “Eastern philosophy,” I mean mainly the religious philosophies of Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, and so on. I am far from being an expert on these philosophies, as I have come in contact with them only about three years ago. But the more I become acquainted with Oriental thought, the more I realize how the Eastern view of seeing the world is in agreement with modern scientific views.

Before spelling this out in greater detail, I would like to clarify a question that immediately comes into mind. How can we make a comparison between an exact science with a highly sophisticated mathematical formalism and a philosophy that is mainly based on meditation and insists on the fact that its insights cannot be communicated by words?

To answer this question, let us see how knowledge is obtained in the two disciplines. In physics, we make experiments and then look for a theory to explain them. We do this by correlating the experimental facts with mathematical symbols and by working out a mathematical scheme that interconnects these symbols in a consistent way. As physicists, we may be satisfied when we have found such a scheme and know how to use it to predict experiments. But eventually, we will have to talk about our results also to non-physicists and thus will have to express them in plain language. This means that we will have to formulate a model in ordinary language, which interprets our mathematical scheme. Even for ourselves, the formulation of such a model will be a criterion of the understanding we have reached.

It is important to realize that although the mathematical framework is rigorous and consistent, the interpreting verbal model, because of the inaccuracy inherent in everyday language, will never be rigorous. A further difficulty arises in modern physics. At the atomic and subatomic levels, our common language is not only inaccurate but quite inadequate and inconsistent. Physicists have learned to live with this inconsistency and are used to applying alternatively different classical concepts that would lead to contradictions if applied simultaneously.

Now let us see how knowledge is obtained in Eastern philosophies. All schools of Eastern thought insist on the fact that knowledge must be gained by a direct meditative insight. Such an insight, they say, lies outside the framework of analysis and intellectual thought. It is obtained by watching rather than by thinking. Therefore, it would seem that this stage corresponds more to the experimental than to the theoretical part of physics. The knowledge obtained by meditative insight is then transmitted through myths, symbols, poetic _resources/books//Patterns of Connection_ Essential Essays F - Fritjof Capra, and so on. These various forms of communication correspond to the verbal models in science, and it is at this stage that we shall make the comparison.

Eastern philosophies repeatedly emphasize the fact that any verbal communication of knowledge is inadequate, that true knowledge transcends logic and common sense, and that it can therefore not be adequately expressed in ordinary language. The extreme standpoint is taken by a certain Zen school that does not use any statements to transmit its teaching, but rather uses carefully devised nonsensical riddles, so-called koans, that are meant to throw the mind of the student off its familiar tracks of logical reasoning to make it ready for the meditative insight.

I think that here lies one of the roots of the relation to modern physics. Quantum mechanics has taught us that our common concepts cannot be applied to atoms. The atomic and subatomic reality transcends classical logic, and we cannot talk about it in ordinary language. Yet we must do so, and the resulting puzzles and paradoxes, which stand at the beginning of quantum mechanics, play very much the same role as the koans in the Zen teaching, with the difference that in physics, nature is the teacher.

#### **Eastern Philosophy**

Having clarified and put in perspective the comparison I want to make, I must now turn to a brief review of what I call “Eastern philosophy,” a shorthand term that refers to a vast number of subtly interwoven theologies, spiritual disciplines, and philosophical systems whose richness and complexity cannot be adequately represented in a short presentation such as this.[^1] I shall therefore concentrate on some features that, I think, are basic and common to most of these systems and that I shall then relate to particle physics. In fact, I want to talk mainly about two basic concepts of Eastern philosophy.

#### UNITY OF THE UNIVERSE

The first aspect I want to talk about is an idea which lies at the very basis of Eastern philosophy. It is the idea of the unity of the cosmos and the unity of all life. The Eastern view of the world is an organic one. All things and phenomena we perceive with our senses are interrelated and are manifestations of the same ultimate reality. This reality has different names in different religions. It is called Brahman in Hinduism, Dharmakaya in Buddhism, Tao in Taoism, and so on. Whatever the name, it represents the basic universal reality which is simultaneously spiritual and material. Hence there is no essential difference between mind and matter in Eastern religions.

According to Eastern philosophy, our tendency to divide the perceived world into individual and separate things and to see ourselves as isolated egos in this world is an illusion which comes from the narrowness of our attentive consciousness. It is called _avidya_ (“ignorance”) in Buddhist philosophy and is seen as the state of a disturbed mind which has to be overcome. In a Buddhist scripture we find the words:

When the mind is disturbed, the multiplicity of things is produced; but when the mind is quieted, the multiplicity of things disappears.[^2]

The highest aim for the Hindu or Buddhist is therefore to become aware of the unity and mutual interrelation of all things, to transcend the notion of an isolated individual self and to identify himself or herself with the ultimate reality. The acquisition of this knowledge, which is known as “enlightenment,” is not a mere intellectual act, but becomes a religious experience involving the whole person. Eastern philosophy are therefore always religions at the same time.

#### DYNAMIC VIEW OF THE UNIVERSE

In the Eastern view, then, the division of nature into separate objects is artificial and comes from our measuring and categorizing mind. Such objects, which are called _maya_ in Hinduism, have a fluid and ever changing character. Eastern philosophies make no difference between living and dead matter. The whole cosmos is a unity and the whole cosmos is alive. This dynamic view of the universe, which contains time and change as essential features, is the second basic idea which is relevant for the comparison with physics. I shall show you in this talk how the idea of the unity of the universe and of its intrinsically dynamic character arise in 20th-century physics.

#### **Western Thought**

Before going into modern physics, let me briefly remind you of the contrast between Eastern and Western thought. The early Greek philosophers saw the world very much in the way the Hindus do, but then they produced the dualism between spirit and matter. The atomists pictured matter as being made of several “basic building blocks,” called atoms, which are purely passive and intrinsically dead. They were thought to be moved by some external force which was assumed to be of spiritual origin and was often identified with God. This marked the split between spirit and matter, between God and the world.

In subsequent centuries, this image became an essential part of the Western way of thinking and was formulated in its sharpest form by Descartes. The view of matter as being dead and completely separate from ourselves was extremely successful, as it led to the mechanistic models of classical physics which are the basis of Western science and technology. The Indians and Chinese, who always have had an organic view of the universe, developed philosophies of great wisdom and beauty, but were comparatively poor scientists until recently.

The fascinating development in modern physics is that the same science which originated in the split between spirit and matter overcomes this dualism, and now leads us back to the views of the early Greek philosophers and of the Eastern philosophies. Let me show you how this comes about.

#### **Modern Physics**

When I talk about “modern physics,” I mean mainly quantum mechanics and relativity theory. I shall try to show you how both theories force us to see the world in a way which is very similar to the Eastern views I just described. These similarities become even stronger when we look at the models which attempt to combine quantum mechanics and relativity theory into a relativistic theory of the subnuclear world.

#### QUANTUM MECHANICS

To begin with, the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics made it clear that the Cartesian split between the I and the world, which is so deeply rooted in Western thinking, cannot be made when dealing with atomic matter. Without going into further details, let me just quote Heisenberg on this point:

The Cartesian partition has penetrated deeply into the human mind during the three centuries following Descartes, and it will take a long time for it to be replaced by a really different attitude toward the problem of reality.[^3]

The next point is also connected with the name of Heisenberg. It is the uncertainty principle or, more generally, the wave-particle character of matter which provides an essential feature of our picture of atomic and nuclear matter. The uncertainty principle implies that a particle can never be completely at rest. For if it were localized sharply at some point in space, this would imply a large uncertainty of momentum and therefore kinetic energy. As a consequence, the particle will start moving around. According to quantum mechanics, matter is thus never completely quiescent, but always in a state of motion. How much this is in the spirit of Eastern philosophy is best shown with the following quotation from a Taoist text:

The stillness in stillness is not the real stillness. Only when there is stillness in movement can the spiritual rhythm appear which pervades heaven and earth.[^4]

This is a very poetic expression of the same image we get from the uncertainty principle.

If we now look at atoms, the uncertainty principle tells us that the electrons which are kept inside a very small volume by electrostatic forces must start to “jiggle around” very fast. In fact, the confinement to 10–8 cm results in enormous velocities of about 1000 km/sec. If we go deeper into the atom and look at the nucleus the situation is even more extreme. There, protons and neutrons are confined to 10–13 cm by the strong nuclear forces. Accordingly, they race about with the fantastic velocities of 100,000 km/sec. Far from being dead and passive, atomic and nuclear matter is “cooking and boiling” most vehemently. The closer we look at matter, the more alive it appears.

The velocities achieved in nuclear matter come close to the velocity of light, and therefore any adequate theory of subnuclear particles must be a relativistic theory. This brings us now to the second important part of modern physics: relativity theory.

#### RELATIVITY THEORY

As you all know, relativity theory brought about a drastic change of our concepts of space and time. It showed us that space is not three-dimensional and time is not a separate entity. Both are intimately connected and forming a four-dimensional medium called space-time. Describing nuclear matter with a relativistic theory means therefore that, whenever we think about nuclear matter, we have to think about it in terms of a four-dimensional reality involving space and time.

The Indian and Chinese philosophers certainly did not know anything about relativity theory, but they somehow sensed the “space-time character” of reality intuitively, as most of their concepts, _resources/books//Patterns of Connection_ Essential Essays F - Fritjof Capra and myths contain time and change as an essential element. Examples of such concepts are the Hinduist _maya_ doctrine mentioned above, the concept of “interpenetration” in Mahayana Buddhism, about which I shall talk later on, or the _I Ching_, the basis of Chinese thought,[^5] the title of which, characteristically, means the “Book of Changes.”

This time-minded intuition is one of the main reasons, I think, why the Indian and Chinese views of matter seem to correspond more closely to modern scientific views than those of the Greeks, which were essentially static and largely determined by geometric considerations. Greek natural philosophy was extremely “nonrelativistic,” if I may say so, and I think that its strong influence on Western thought is one of the reasons why we have great conceptual difficulties with relativistic models. The Eastern philosophies, on the other hand, are “space-time” philosophies, and it should therefore not be too surprising that they express their ideas in models which parallel those encountered in relativistic particle physics. I strongly believe that this will become more and more apparent as we make progress in formulating relativistic models. Let me now show you some of these parallels.

In particle physics, we have at present mainly two relativistic models, quantum field theory and S-matrix theory, and I shall now talk about these.

#### FIELD THEORY

The central concept of field theory is the concept of a quantum field. As you know, the field concept was abstracted from the concept of the force in classical physics, but then obtained an independent status when it was realized that fields are physical entities in their own right which can propagate through empty space.

In quantum field theory, finally, the fields acquire the new and very special property of being able to take the form of material particles. The quantum fields are considered as fundamental entities which give rise to the forces and to matter and thus establish the unity of these two concepts which seemed irreconcilable to the Greek atomists.

The dual aspect of quantum fields—forces or quanta—makes it possible for field theory to picture all interactions between matter as the exchange, i.e. the creation and subsequent destruction, of virtual particles. The virtual character of the exchanged particles leads then to the concept of a self-interacting particle which implies that all particles have to be regarded as centers of continuous activity surrounded by a cloud of virtual particles, which they emit and absorb. The dynamic character of matter thus appears as motion in the non-relativistic quantum theory, and as the creation and destruction of particles in the relativistic theory.

The fact that the energy involved in the self-interaction contributes to the mass of the self-interacting particle shows that mass is not an intrinsic property of matter, but arises from its interaction. Although we are still far from understanding this relation between mass and interaction in detail, field theory has made it clear that the being of matter and its interaction cannot be separated. What we call an isolated particle is in reality the product of its interaction with its surrounding. It is therefore impossible to separate any part of the universe from the rest. This, however, is exactly the view which is so basic to all Eastern philosophies.

In this connection, it is interesting to note that in Sanskrit there are two terms used for “object,” _samskara_ and _vastu_, both of which mean first of all “an event” or “a happening,” and secondarily “an existing thing.”[^6] This shows how the Indians realized intuitively that the being and the activity of matter cannot be separated.

Coming back to field theory, we can see that the main idea that emerges is that the creation and destruction of matter is an essential feature of nature. It is the basis of all particle interactions and thus of all natural laws and ultimately of all life. More than that, it is an essential part of the existence of matter. Matter is not at all passive and dead, but is really very much alive, pulsating all the time, creating and destroying particles.

When you imagine this continuous creation and destruction which goes on everywhere in the universe, the idea of a gigantic cosmic dance comes naturally into mind. Indeed, physicists often use expressions like “energy dance.” The most beautiful image of this dance, however, is given in Hinduism.[^7] One of the main Hindu gods is Shiva, the cosmic dancer. According to Hindu belief, all life is part of a great rhythmic process of creation and destruction, of death and rebirth, and Shiva’s dance symbolizes this eternal rhythm.

Indian artists have expressed it in magnificent sculptures of dancing Shivas. The modern physicist, however, can find an equally beautiful expression of Shiva’s dance in the bubble chamber photographs of interacting particles which bear testimony to the continuous creation and destruction of matter in the universe. Modern science and ancient mythology express here the same basic intuition of life.

#### S-MATRIX THEORY

I am now coming to S-matrix theory, the second important relativistic model in particle physics. What we call “S-matrix theory” is really not, or not yet, a theory but rather consists of a collection of models formulated in S-matrix language. I want to concentrate here on the most ambitious of these, the bootstrap model, because this model shows the most striking parallels to Eastern philosophy.[^8]

#### BOOTSTRAP

The basis of the bootstrap model is that nature cannot be reduced to fundamental entities, like fundamental constituents of matter, but has to be understood entirely through self-consistency.[^9] All of physics has to follow uniquely—i.e. without containing any arbitrary parameters—from the requirement that its components be consistent with one another and with themselves. Since a fundamental component is by definition one that is arbitrarily assignable, a bootstrap model should not contain any fundamental components.

We can see immediately that this idea is very much in the spirit of Eastern thought. We have seen before that Hinduism regards all forms in the universe as fluid and ever changing _maya_, and therefore it has no room for any fixed fundamental quantity. The notion of fundamental constituents of matter, which comes from the Greek concept of “basic building blocks,” is completely foreign to Eastern thought. In a Buddhist text we find the following significant passage:

When we divide some gross (or composite) matter, we can reduce it to atoms. But as the atom will also be subject to further division, all forms of material existence, whether gross or fine, are nothing but the shadow of particularization produced by the subjective mind, and we cannot ascribe any degree of (absolute or independent) reality to them.[^10]

We might also say that the principle of self-consistency, which forms the basis of the bootstrap model, and the unity and interrelation of all phenomena, which is so strongly emphasized in Eastern philosophy, are just different ways of expressing the same idea. In the East this idea has found its clearest expression in Buddhism, and in particular in the so-called Mahayana school. We can therefore expect that this school of Buddhism is the one which comes closest to the bootstrap philosophy, and we shall see that it has indeed the most striking parallels to the bootstrap model of particles.

Before talking about these parallels, let me summarize the relation of the bootstrap model to Eastern philosophy by putting it in the context of what Chew has called the contrast between “fundamentalists” and “bootstrappers” in high-energy physics.[^11]

I want to argue that the attempt to reduce nature to fundamental basic building blocks has grown out of Greek natural philosophy and corresponds to the general Western way of thinking, whereas the bootstrap idea corresponds to the Eastern view of nature. The reason why the bootstrap model is accepted with great reluctance is that the fundamentalist thinking is intimately connected with the cultural and philosophical background of most physicists. The contrast between fundamentalists and bootstrappers thus reflects the contrast between the Western and the Eastern view of seeing the world.

Although the fundamentalist models were historically expressed in the framework of field theory and the bootstrap model was formulated in the framework of the S-matrix, I would not extend my argument to the contrast between these two approaches. It is true that field theory, with its quantum fields as fundamental entities, looks like a fundamentalist model, but there have also been attempts to construct “field theory bootstraps,” a concept which has been suggested by Salam back in 1962,[^12] and it may well be that the bootstrap idea can be expressed in the language of field theory as well. I would therefore like to see both frameworks as complementary, one being more appropriate for the description of hadronic matter, the other better for the description of electromagnetic and weak interactions. In both frameworks parallels to the models of Eastern philosophy appear, and I would like to think that a future theory of matter will contain both approaches and will be based on the bootstrap concept.

I shall now briefly review the bootstrap model and then point out its parallels to Mahayana Buddhism. First of all, we have to realize that we run into difficulties if we want to carry the bootstrap idea to its extreme. Let me quote Chew on this point:

In the broad sense, the bootstrap idea, although fascinating and useful, is unscientific . . . Science, as we know it, requires a language based on some unquestioned framework. Semantically, therefore, an attempt to explain everything can hardly be called scientific.[^13]

The problem is the following: since all phenomena are ultimately interconnected, in order to explain any one of them we have to understand all the others, which is obviously impossible. What makes science so successful is the discovery that approximations are possible. If one is satisfied with an approximate “understanding,” one can explain many phenomena in terms of a few and thus understand different aspects of nature in an approximate way without having to understand everything at once. This is the scientific method. All scientific theories and models are approximations to the true nature of things, but the error involved in the approximation is often small enough to make such an approach meaningful.

The important difference between the scientific bootstrap and the Buddhist approach is that Buddhists are not interested in approximate knowledge, which they call “relative knowledge.” They are concerned with the absolute knowledge which corresponds to the complete bootstrap. In such a world, where everything is interconnected, the properties of any one phenomenon follow from the properties of _all_ the others. To explain something means therefore to show how it is connected with all the rest of the world. This is obviously impossible, and Buddhists insist therefore on the fact that no single phenomenon can be explained. For this reason, they are not interested in explaining things, but rather in obtaining a direct experience of the unity of all things.

Now let us see how the scientific bootstrap model is constructed. As I said before, it has to be approximate, and its main approximation consists in its limitation to hadrons, i.e. in neglecting all but the strong interactions. In this “hadron bootstrap,” several basic constraints are imposed on the S-matrix, most of which correspond to our concepts of observation and of macroscopic space-time. These constraints, which are essentially Poincaré invariance, analyticity and unitarity, constitute what Chew calls the “unquestioned framework” in the passage quoted before. Other constraints may reflect the arbitrariness of the model due to the approximations made and may have to be explained in a future, more precise model.

One of the constraints of the latter kind is the requirement that all the poles of the S-matrix be Regge poles which is equivalent to requiring that all hadrons be composite objects, none of them being any more elementary than the other. In view of the great number of “elementary particles” known at present, this requirement is esthetically appealing, but it is not necessary. It is hoped to emerge as a result of the complete hadron bootstrap.

The bootstrap picture of hadrons, then, is the following: all hadrons are composite structures whose components are again hadrons. The binding forces holding these structures together are the same forces through which hadrons mutually interact. The crucial point, which makes the calculation of these forces possible, is that a force between particles can be pictured as the exchange of other particles. This picture is very crude, because it uses a non-relativistic image for a situation where relativity is crucial. But it is the best we can do to illustrate the concept of a bound state in the crossed channel.

In the hadron bootstrap, the exchanged particles are again hadrons. Each hadron plays therefore three roles: it is a composite structure; it may be a constituent of another hadron; and it may be exchanged between constituents and thus constitute part of the force holding the structure together. Each particle thus helps to generate other particles which in turn generate it.

The idea, now, is that this extremely complex dynamical mechanism is self-determining, i.e., that there is only one way in which it can be realized. This means that there is only one possible set of hadrons which is the one found in nature. The properties of hadronic matter follow uniquely, then, from the self-consistency of the hadron bootstrap and do not have to be introduced as fundamental quantities.

Having described the bootstrap model of particles, let me now show how its features are paralleled by the _resources/books//Patterns of Connection_ Essential Essays F - Fritjof Capra used in the Buddhist Mahayana school. The Mahayana doctrine is considered to be the climax of Buddhist thought which has developed in India, China, and Japan.[^14] It is based on the Avatamsaka Sutra whose central theme is the unity and interrelation of all things and events, as realized in a state of enlightenment. It gives a vivid description of how the world is seen in such a state. According to this scripture, an enlightened person perceives the world as a perfect network of mutual relations where each individual object contains in itself all other individual objects. This is known in the Buddhist literature as the theory of “interpenetration” and it is illustrated in the Avatamsaka by the following parable:

In the heaven of Indra, there is said to be a network of pearls, so arranged that if you look at one you see all the others reflected in it. In the same way each object in the world is not merely itself but involves every other object and in fact _is_ everything else. In every particle of dust, there are present Buddhas without number.[^15]

The similarity of this image with the hadron bootstrap is indeed striking. The parable of Indra’s net of pearls may justly be called the first bootstrap model, created by the inquiring human mind some 2500 years before the beginning of particle physics.

Mahayana Buddhists insist that the theory of interpenetration is not comprehensible intellectually but is to be experienced by an enlightened mind which transcends the dualism of logic. In modern physics, as I have pointed out at the beginning of this talk, we do not have to be enlightened but are forced by nature to accept concepts which are no longer intelligible. In the present case of the bootstrap, such a concept is the fact that a force can be represented by a particle. I have emphasized before that this is a specifically relativistic feature of the model, based on the crossing property of the S-matrix. I think that our main difficulty in visualizing the bootstrap picture of particles consists in imagining a particle containing other particles in a relativistic way, i.e. not statically but dynamically, in a “space-time” way. Since we are unfamiliar with such a four- dimensional way of thinking, it is extremely hard for us to imagine how a single particle can contain all other particles and at the same time be part of each of them. This, however, is exactly the view of the Mahayana school, and here let me quote again from a Buddhist text:

When the one is set against all the others, the one is seen as pervading them all and at the same time embracing them all in itself.[^16]

Whether you believe in Buddhist enlightenment, or whether you think that Buddhists had an intuitive feeling for the relativistic space-time reality, as I have suggested, you must admit that it is truly amazing that the human mind should have arrived at this image in two so different ways.

In conclusion, I would like to speculate on a very exciting possibility concerning the future of the bootstrap idea. If the bootstrap model proves successful for hadron physics, physicists will try to extend it to the other interactions. They will then have to find a more general framework, and some of the concepts which are now accepted a priori will have to be derived. These might include our concepts of macroscopic space-time and, as Wigner has argued, even of human consciousness.[^17]

This opens new and exciting possibilities for a direct interaction between physics and Eastern philosophy. The concept of human consciousness has been playing a central role in Eastern philosophy, and especially in Buddhism, throughout centuries, and the conclusions Buddhists have reached differ often radically from the ideas held in the West. If we really want to include human consciousness in our realm of research, a study of Eastern ideas might conceivably provide us with the new viewpoint which many physicists feel is very much needed in physics today.

GEOFFREY CHEW, WHO died in April of 2019 at the age of 94, was one of the deepest and most radical thinkers of 20th-century physics. His bootstrap theory, technically known as S-matrix theory, is based on the idea that nature cannot be reduced to fundamental entities, like fundamental constituents of matter, but must be understood entirely through self-consistency. According to Chew, all of physics must follow uniquely from the requirement that its components be consistent with one another and with themselves.[^1]

This idea constitutes a radical departure from the traditional spirit of basic research in physics, which has always concentrated on finding the fundamental constituents of matter. At the same time, it can be seen as the culmination of the conception of particles as interconnections in an inseparable web of relationships, which arose in quantum theory and acquired an intrinsically dynamic nature in relativity theory.

The bootstrap philosophy not only abandons the idea of fundamental constituents of matter but accepts no fundamental entities whatsoever—no fundamental laws or equations, and not even a fundamental structure of space and time. The universe is seen as a dynamic web of interrelated events. None of the properties of any part of this web is fundamental; each follows from the properties of the other parts, and the overall consistency of all their mutual interrelations determines the structure of the entire web.

During the 1980s and 1990s, the bootstrap theory was eclipsed by the success of the so-called standard model, which is very different, as it postulates the existence of fundamental fields and their corresponding particles. Today, bootstrap physics has virtually disappeared from the scene.

However, the standard model does not include gravity, and hence fails to integrate all known particles and forces into a single mathematical framework. The currently most popular candidate for such a framework is string theory, which pictures all particles as different vibrations of mathematical “strings” in an abstract nine-dimensional space. The mathematical elegance of string theory is compelling, but the theory has serious deficiencies. If these difficulties persist, and if a theory of quantum gravity continues to remain elusive, the bootstrap idea may well be revived someday, in some mathematical formulation or other.

Geoffrey Chew was the main reason I moved to Berkeley in the 1970s. My close association with him during 14 years (1975–1988) was a source of continuing inspiration for me and has decisively shaped my entire outlook on science. I first studied Chew’s writings on bootstrap physics in the early 1970s in London while working at Imperial College and also preparing myself for writing _The Tao of Physics_. I was immediately struck by the parallels between the bootstrap philosophy and that of Mahayana Buddhism, which I summarized in a paper titled “Bootstrap and Buddhism.” I sent Chew a copy of the paper and asked him for his comments. His answer was very supportive and extremely exciting to me. “Your way of describing the [bootstrap] idea,” he wrote, “should make it more palatable to many and to some, perhaps, so esthetically appealing as to be irresistible.”

When I wrote _The Tao of Physics_, I made the close correspondence between Chew’s bootstrap physics and Buddhist philosophy its high point and finale. I finished the book in London in December 1974, and in January 1975, I moved to Berkeley and joined Chew’s theory group at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL). Physicists in the group included Henry Stapp, Jerry Finkelstein, Stanley Mandelstam, and several graduate students. During the next ten years, I attended the group’s regular meetings every week I was in Berkeley. In addition, Geoff (as he was known to his friends and colleagues) would send weekly handwritten letters to the group in which he chronicled the evolution of his thinking about the bootstrap theory. These weekly interactions with Geoff Chew gave me a unique understanding of his thinking process and established a close relationship between us.

At the same time, I began a gradual transition from physicist to writer and consequently spent a fair amount of time of time away from LBL. I was the only member in Chew’s theory group who did not work on physics full time. However, this also had a positive effect. Because of my breaks from the group, I could often see the evolution of our theory with fresh eyes. Geoff often told me that he appreciated very much that I was able to ask probing questions and contribute significant insights because of my special position in the group.

Looking back on that time in my life, I have come to realize that my regular scientific discussions with Chew over almost 15 years were also my training in systemic thinking. The bootstrap theory is a theory of networks of subatomic particles in which the properties of each particle derive from its relationships to the others. This is systemic thinking par excellence. Thus, from the mid-1970s to the late 1980s, systems thinking became second nature to me, long before I studied its history and achievements and discussed them in my books. Geoff Chew was a tremendous inspiration for me, an intellectual father figure whose thought deeply influenced my views of science and significantly shaped my career as a scientist and writer. My memories of our discussions over so many years will be with me forever.

## Implications of the “New Physics”

_The Tao of Physics_ was published in 1975 and was tremendously successful.[^1] As a consequence of this success, I received many invitations to lecture to professional and lay audiences in Europe, North and South America, and Asia. During these lectures and seminars, I discovered that the change of concepts in quantum physics from a mechanistic to a holistic view was part of a much broader change of paradigms in many other fields and in society at large. And so I expanded my focus from physics to these other fields—biology, medicine, psychology, economics, and so on.

At first I believed (erroneously, as I would soon discover) that the “new physics” could be a model for the other sciences and for society in general, just as the old Newtonian physics had been, for many centuries, the model for other sciences and for social organization. Essay 8]] in this chapter, which is based on several articles dated 1978–1980, expresses this view. I argue that now that physicists have gone far beyond the Newtonian model, it will become necessary for the other sciences to become aware of this development and to expand their underlying philosophies accordingly.

What I did not realize when I wrote these articles was that our major social issues—health, education, social justice, protection of the environment, political power, and so on—all have to do with living systems, with individual human beings, social systems, and ecosystems. Physics cannot say very much about these living systems. This realization came to me just a few months later in a series of conversations with Gregory Bateson (see my homage to Bateson in chapter 4]]). Bateson pointed out to me that systems thinking was a more appropriate approach. This would set me on a road of exploring the systems view of life for the next 30 years.

Even though I subsequently modified my views on physics as a model for other sciences, I have included essay 8]] in this collection. The conceptual error I made then and recognized while writing _The Turning Point_, is well worth documenting, since it is still perpetuated by many scientists today.[^2] Besides, my critique of the mechanistic worldview in various sciences, as presented in the essay, remains fully valid.

I begin the essay by summarizing the mechanistic Newtonian worldview and its influences on other sciences (biology, medicine, psychology, and economics). I then summarize the worldview implied by modern physics, and I conclude by discussing its implications for medicine, psychology, and the social sciences.

Regarding medicine, I suggest that a framework inspired by the traditional Chinese view of the body and of health would be consistent with the most advanced theories of physical reality. (I fail to add, however, that the physical reality most relevant to health is that of self-organizing living systems.) Similarly, I point out that psychologists and psychotherapists have recently looked for inspirations toward the East, where maps of consciousness have been developed, especially in Buddhism, for thousands of years.

At the end of the essay, I suggest that physics may not always be appropriate as a model; and, looking at the essay now, I notice that the title is followed by a question mark. I believe that subconsciously I was getting ready for the shift from physics to the life sciences that began for me while writing _The Turning Point_.

Essay 9]] summarizes developments in theoretical particle physics since the publication of _The Tao of Physics_ in 1975. I published different versions of this essay over the years in forewords to various editions of the book in response to frequent questions from my readers. I updated the essay for the last time in 2014, two years after the celebrated discovery of the Higgs boson.

I explain at the outset that the big challenge of the unification of physics is to unify quantum theory and relativity theory into a complete theory of subatomic matter. Physicists have not yet been able to formulate such a complete theory, but in the essay, I review several partial theories that describe quite well some of the fundamental forces of nature and the phenomena associated with them. These theories include quantum electrodynamics (QED), developed in the 1940s; the Weinberg-Salam theory of “electroweak” interactions, developed in the 1960s; and quantum chromodynamics (QCD), developed in the 1970s, in which quantum fields are associated with quarks and gluons. Together, these last two theories are known as the standard model of particle physics. It has been confirmed by countless experimental tests over more than three decades. I also review the modification of the standard model known as the Higgs mechanism, and the subsequent discovery of the celebrated Higgs boson.

Finally, I review string theory, which attempts to integrate gravity with the other fundamental forces. String theory is of compelling mathematical elegance, picturing all subatomic particles as different states of vibrating mathematical “strings.” However, the theory has serious conceptual deficiencies and has not been verified experimentally. I conclude the essay by revisiting Chew’s bootstrap theory, which was eclipsed by the success of the standard model but may well be revived someday in some mathematical formulation or other.

ESSAY 8|The New Physics as a Model for a New Medicine, Psychology, and Economics?

1978–1980

#### **Introduction**

20th-century physics has had a profound influence on general philosophical thought because it has revealed a surprising limitation of classical ideas and has led to a profound revision of many of our basic concepts about reality. In atomic and subatomic physics, concepts such as matter, object, space, time, and cause and effect are totally different from the corresponding classical ideas, and with their radical transformation, our whole worldview has begun to change.

The changes in our worldview brought about by modern physics have been widely discussed by physicists and philosophers over the past decades, but very seldom has it been noticed that they all seem to go in the same direction.[^1] Modern physics is showing us that the classical, mechanistic, reductionist view of the world has to be replaced by a holistic, organic, and dynamic view, a view similar to that held by mystics of all ages and traditions.[^2]

The dramatic changes in the philosophy of physics will necessarily affect the other sciences—the natural sciences and the humanities and social sciences alike—because all these sciences have modeled themselves after physics. To be more precise, they have taken classical, Newtonian physics as their model, and now that physicists have gone far beyond the Newtonian model, it will become necessary for the other sciences to become aware of this development and to expand their underlying philosophies. In this essay, I would like to discuss the relevance of this new awareness to medicine, psychology, and economics.

#### **The Mechanistic Cartesian Worldview**

The worldview of classical physics, which could also be called the traditional Western worldview, has its roots in the philosophy of the Greek atomists who saw matter as being made of several basic building blocks, the atoms, which are purely passive and intrinsically dead. They were thought to be moved by external forces that were often assumed to be of spiritual origin and thus fundamentally different from matter.

This image became an essential part of the Western way of thinking. It gave rise to the dualism between spirit and matter, between the mind and the body, which is characteristic of Western thought. This dualism was formulated in its sharpest form by Descartes, who based his view of nature on a fundamental division into two separate and independent realms: that of mind (res cogitans) and that of matter (res extensa). The Cartesian division allowed scientists to treat matter as dead and completely separate from themselves and to see the material world as a multitude of different objects assembled into a huge machine. Such a mechanistic view was held by Newton, who constructed his mechanics on its basis and made it the foundation of classical physics.

The mechanistic view of nature is closely related to a rigorous determinism. The giant cosmic machine was seen as being completely causal and determinate; all that happened had a definite cause and gave rise to a definite effect. The philosophical basis of this strict determinism was the fundamental division between the I and the world introduced by Descartes. As a consequence of this division, it was believed that the world could be described objectively, that is, without ever mentioning the human observer, and such an objective description of nature became the ideal of all science.

#### **Influence of the Newtonian Model On Other Sciences**

From the second half of the 17th century to the end of the 19th, the mechanistic Newtonian model of the universe dominated all scientific thought. The natural sciences, as well as the humanities and social sciences, all modeled themselves after Newtonian physics, and many of them hold on to this model even now that physicists have gone far beyond it.

Before discussing the impact of Newtonian physics on other fields, I want to make an important point. The new conception of the universe that has emerged from modern physics does not mean that Newtonian physics is wrong or that our current theories are right. We have come to realize in modern science that all our theories are approximations to the true nature of things. Each theory is valid for a certain range of phenomena. Beyond this range, it no longer gives a satisfactory description of nature, and new theories must be found to replace it—or better, to extend it by improving the approximation.

The question, then, will be, How good an approximation is the Newtonian model as a basis for the other sciences? In physics itself, it had to be abandoned at the level of the very small (in atomic and subatomic physics) and at the level of the very large (in astrophysics and cosmology). In other fields, the limitations may be of a different kind. It should be noticed that what we are talking about is not so much the application of Newtonian physics to other phenomena but rather the application of the mechanistic and reductionist worldview on which Newtonian physics is based. It will be necessary for each science to find out where the limitations of this worldview lie in a particular context.

#### **Biology and Medicine**

In biology, the Cartesian view led to the idea that a living organism could be regarded as a machine constructed from separate parts. Such a mechanistic biology was first expounded by Descartes himself and has dominated the life sciences up to the present day. The machine analogy suggests that living organisms can be understood by taking them into pieces and trying to put them together again from the knowledge of their parts. This approach, indeed, still constitutes the backbone of most contemporary biological thinking. A current textbook contains the following significant passage: “One of the acid tests of understanding an object is the ability to put it together from its component parts. Ultimately, molecular biologists will attempt to subject their understanding of cell structure and function to this sort of test by trying to synthesize a cell.”[^3]

The mechanistic model of biology had a strong influence on medicine and led to the formulation of what is known as the biomedical model. Western medicine has come to regard the human body as a machine that can be analyzed in terms of its parts. Disease is seen as an outside entity that invades the body and attacks a particular part. The doctor’s role is to intervene, either physically (through surgery) or chemically (through drugs) and to treat the afflicted part, different parts being treated by different specialists.

To associate a particular illness with a definite part of the body is, of course, very useful in many cases. But Western medicine has overemphasized this reductionist approach and has developed its specialized disciplines to a point where doctors are no longer able to view disease as a disturbance of the whole organism, nor to treat it as such. Disease is reduced to biological mechanisms that are studied from the point of view of cellular and molecular biology, leaving out completely the psychological and social aspects of illness. Although knowledge of the physiological aspects is, of course, useful, the reductionist approach gives only part of the story, and thus it is not surprising that it has not been too successful. According to Lewis Thomas, “we are left with approximately the same roster of common major diseases which confronted the country in 1950 and, although we have accumulated a formidable body of information about some of them in the intervening time, the accumulation is not yet sufficient to permit either the prevention or the outright cure of any of them.”[^4]

#### **Psychology**

Classical psychology, like classical physics, is based on the Cartesian division between the res cogitans and the res extensa. Based on this division, two approaches have been developed to study the mind. Behaviorism chose to study the effects of mind on matter by studying behavior and applied the methodology of classical physics to this task. Psychological phenomena were reduced to psychic building blocks and were related to physiological stimuli that were assumed to be their causes. As in classical biology, living organisms were seen as machines that react to external stimuli, and this stimulus-response mechanism was modeled after Newtonian physics.

In the standard behaviorist textbook, _Science and Human Behavior_, by B. F. Skinner, we are told from the very outset that mind, consciousness, ideas, and so on are non-existent entities, “invented to provide spurious explanations.”[^5] In other words, the only serious explanation is one that is based on the mechanistic view of the human organism. Behaviorists, who still constitute the mainstream of academic psychology, defend their approach by claiming that it is the only scientific approach to psychology, thus clearly identifying the reductionist, mechanistic framework with science.

Freud started from the other side of the Cartesian division. Instead of just studying behavior, he chose to study the res cogitans itself through introspection. Although not dealing with matter, he nevertheless wanted to develop a scientific psychology, and to do so, he established a conceptual relationship between psychoanalysis and classical physics.

Like physicists, Freud searched for basic building blocks. He focused on basic instincts and postulated the ego, id, and superego as basic psychological structures, located and extended in psychological space. These structures are seen as some kind of internal objects that are in conflict. The mechanisms and machineries of the mind are all driven by forces modeled after Newtonian mechanics.

As in classical physics, the mechanistic model is closely related to strict determinism. Psychiatry assumes that what is inside a person was fixed at birth, and reduces pathology to self-defined single causes. Furthermore, it is assumed that the psychoanalyst is an objective observer who does not influence the observed phenomena and is not influenced by them. The Cartesian division is also reflected in the strict separation of mind and body. Psychoanalysis neglects the body just as medicine neglects the mind.

#### **Economics**

From psychology, I shall now turn to the social sciences and, in particular, to economics. Present-day economics, like most social sciences, is fragmentary and reductionist. It fails to recognize that the economy is merely one aspect of a whole ecological and social fabric. The basic error of the social sciences is to divide this fabric into fragments, assumed to be independent and to be dealt with in separate academic departments—psychology, economics, political science, and so on.

Economists neglect social and ecological interdependence, treating all goods equally, without consideration of the many ways in which they are related to the rest of the world, and reducing all values to that of private profit making. Conventional economics is thus inherently anti-ecological. It uses its concepts—efficiency, productivity, profit—without their wider social and ecological context. Corporate efficiency is measured in terms of corporate profits, but these profits are being made increasingly at public costs.

The current framework of economics disregards our dependence on the natural world. Such an attitude is not only in sharp contrast to that of traditional cultures, but is also inconsistent with the views of modern physics. The basic theories of modern physics force us to see the natural world as an organic whole in which all parts are interdependent, a dynamic system that is self-balancing and self-adjusting, unlike our current economy and technology that recognize no self-limiting principle.

The faith in undifferentiated economic and technological growth has become central to our culture. Our economic system is based on continuing expansion, but unlimited expansion on a finite Earth can never lead to a state of dynamic balance. In the subtle system of nature, our technology acts like a foreign body, and there are now numerous signs of rejection. We urgently need a new philosophical basis for economics and technology, a new underlying worldview. Such a worldview is provided by modern physics, the science on which our technology is based.

#### **The Worldview of Modern Physics**

In contrast to the Cartesian mechanistic view of the world, the view of modern physics could be characterized by words like _organic, holistic_, or _ecological_. The universe is no longer seen as a machine made up of a multitude of objects, but rather as a harmonious, unified whole that is fundamentally inseparable. This inseparable whole, however, is not uniform but is structured to form patterns.

Examples of such patterns would be—from large dimensions to smaller dimensions—galaxies, solar systems, stars, planets; then, on our planet, oceans, continents, islands, mountains, trees, flowers, birds, insects; and finally, down to very small patterns, crystals, snowflakes, molecules, atoms, particles.

All these are patterns within a unified whole, and it is important to realize that none of them can be separated from the whole without being destroyed. This is quite obvious when we think of living organisms, for example, of a bird being separated from its natural environment, including the air surrounding it. What modern physics has shown us is that it is true also for so-called inorganic matter. All material patterns—atoms, nuclei, particles, as well as the more complex structures composed of them—can only exist through mutual interconnections and through their connections to the whole.

What we can do, however, is separate some patterns from the rest conceptually and deal with them as if they were isolated, independent entities. This is what we have done successfully in the past, and very often this method still works. Thus, we can often think about various objects in a room as being separate and of ourselves as separate individuals. But modern physics has shown us very vividly that we make an error whenever we think in such a way. The critical question is, How big is the error?

When we study the physics of common phenomena in our everyday environment, the error is negligibly small, and hence we are very successful in dealing with the world as if it consisted of separate objects at this level. At the same, macroscopic level, we may be much less successful when dealing with people in such a way, as in psychotherapy, for example. And even in physics, we have to give up the reductionist, mechanistic way of thinking when we go to very small dimensions, to the world of atoms and subatomic particles.

Moreover, atomic physics has shown that the cosmic web of relations includes the human observer and his or her consciousness in an essential way. In quantum theory, the observed “objects” can only be understood in terms of the interaction between various processes of observation and measurement, and the end of this chain of processes lies always in the consciousness of the human observer.

The crucial feature of quantum theory is that the human observer is not only necessary to observe the properties of an atomic phenomenon, but is necessary even to bring about these properties. My conscious decision about how to observe, say, an electron will determine the electron’s properties to some extent. In other words, the electron does not have objective properties independent of my mind. In atomic physics, the sharp Cartesian split between mind and matter, between the I and the world, is no longer valid. We can never speak about nature without at the same time speaking about ourselves.

A further important insight of modern physics has been the recognition that probability is a fundamental feature of the atomic and subatomic reality that governs all processes and even the existence of matter. Subatomic particles do not exist with certainty at definite places but show “tendencies to exist.” We can never predict an individual event with certainty; we can only predict the odds.

It is important to realize that such a statistical formulation of the laws of atomic and subatomic physics does not reflect our ignorance of the physical situation, like the use of probabilities by insurance companies or gamblers. In atomic physics, we have come to recognize probability as a fundamental feature of the atomic reality that governs all phenomena.

This fundamental role of probability implies a new notion of causality. Individual atomic events do not have a well-defined cause. For example, a subatomic particle may disintegrate spontaneously without any single event causing the disintegration. We can only predict the probability for the event to happen. This does not mean that atomic events occur in completely arbitrary fashion; they are governed by statistical laws. The narrow classical notion of causality is thus replaced by the wider concept of statistical causality in which the probabilities for atomic events are determined by the dynamics of the whole system.

The basic lesson of modern physics, then, is that the separation of the world into separate objects is an idealization. It is often very useful but we shall never understand any pattern fully if we look at it as an isolated entity of phenomenon. We have to study the universe as a whole. Once we understand it as a whole, we can concentrate on its parts and treat them as separate objects in an approximate way. But if we start from the parts and think that they are the basic building blocks out of which the universe is made, we will never understand the whole.

Another important aspect of the worldview of modern physics is the recognition that the patterns we are studying are intrinsically dynamic. At the subatomic level, space and time can no longer be separated but are intimately and inseparably connected, forming a four-dimensional continuum called space-time. When we picture particles in this space-time continuum, we can no longer see them as static three-dimensional objects, such as small billiard balls or small grains of sand, but must picture them (if we can!) as four-dimensional entities. Their forms must be understood dynamically as forms in space and time. Subatomic particles are dynamic patterns, patterns of energy, or patterns of activity.

The energy patterns of the subatomic world form the stable atomic and molecular structures that, again, are not static but are in a state of dynamic balance: electrons whirling around the nuclei within the atoms, atoms vibrating within the molecular structures according to their thermal energy and in harmony with the thermal vibrations of their environment. The molecules, in turn, build up matter and give it its macroscopic solid aspect, thus making us believe that it is made of some material substance.

At the macroscopic level, the notion of substance is a useful approximation, but at the atomic level, it no longer makes sense. Atoms consist of particles, and these particles are not made of any material stuff. When we observe them, we never see any substance; what we observe are dynamic patterns continually changing into one another—a continuous dance of energy.

In summary, we can say that the two basic theories of modern physics have transcended the principal concepts of the Newtonian worldview; among them are the concepts of basic building blocks of matter consisting of some material substance, and of an objective description of nature independently of the human observer. Quantum theory has shown that particles are not isolated grains of matter, but are probability patterns, interconnections in an inseparable cosmic web that includes human consciousness. Relativity theory, so to speak, has made the cosmic web come alive by revealing its intrinsically dynamic character, by showing that its activity is the very essence of its being.

#### **Implications for Science and Society**

What, then, are the implications of the “new physics” for science and for society? One of the main lessons physicists had to learn in the 20th century has been the fact that all the concepts and theories we use to describe nature are limited. Whenever we expand the realm of our experience, we have to modify, or even abandon, some of these concepts.

The experience of questioning the very basis of one’s conceptual framework and to be forced to accept profound modifications of one’s most cherished ideas has been dramatic and often painful for physicists, especially during the first three decades of the 20th century, but it was rewarded by deep insights into the nature of matter and the human mind. I believe that this experience may be very useful for other scientists, many of whom have now reached the limits of the classical Cartesian worldview in their fields. To transcend the classical models, they will need to go beyond the mechanistic and reductionist approach, as we have done in physics, and develop holistic and ecological views.

#### MEDICINE

Physicians will have to widen their perspective, shifting their focus from disease to health, seeing the human organism as a dynamic system that shows interrelated physical and psychological aspects, and relating the general; condition of the system to its physical, emotional, and social environment.

To develop such a new approach to health and healing, physicians need not break completely fresh ground but can learn from models existing in other societies. The worldview of modern physics is closely related to that of Eastern cultures, to the traditions of India, China, and Japan.[^6] These, however, are traditions in which—especially in China—knowledge of the human body and of medicine has always been an integral part of natural philosophy and of spiritual disciplines. The study of traditional Chinese medicine could therefore be extremely helpful.

The Chinese idea of the body has always been predominantly functional. The body is seen as an indivisible system of interrelating parts, and Chinese medicine is not so much concerned with individual organs but rather with their mutual interactions.[^7] It is evident that this view of the body comes much closer to the modern physicist’s view of reality than that of the conventional Western view of medicine.

#### PSYCHOLOGY

Similarly, psychologists and psychotherapists will have to expand the framework of classical psychology to gain a deeper understanding of the human psyche. Like physicians, they will have to deal with the whole organism, seeing it as a dynamic system that involves interdependent physical and psychological patterns, a system that is an integral part of interacting larger systems of physical, social, cultural, and cosmic dimensions.

Jung was perhaps the first to expand psychology into these new realms with concepts that come much closer to those of modern physics than Freud’s. In fact, many of the differences between Freud and Jung parallel those between classical and modern physics.

Jung’s notion of the collective unconscious, for example, provides a link between the individual and the whole cosmos, which cannot be studied within a mechanistic framework. Jung was well aware of the fact that we even have to go beyond the rational approach in advancing into these new realms. The collective unconscious and its patterns, the archetypes, defy precise definition.

More recently, humanistic psychologists, transpersonal psychologists, and other schools have continued to go beyond the various mechanistic aspects of behaviorism and the Freudian model and have developed holistic and dynamic approaches to understanding the human psyche. These approaches are forcing psychologists and psychotherapists to leave many conventional Western concepts behind. At the same time, the new approaches involve concepts and attitudes that are also present in modern physics. For example, the new approaches to psychotherapy emphasize the mutual interaction between therapist and patient, just as quantum physicists emphasize the relation between the observer and the observed phenomena. In this view, therapy should flow from the personal encounter between therapist and patient that involves the whole being of both and should result in a process of mutual transformation.

As physicists now find many of our concepts to be consistent with those of Eastern mysticism, so psychologists and psychotherapists have recently looked toward the East for new insights and techniques. Maps of consciousness have been developed in the East for thousands of years, and some of the Eastern traditions, especially in Buddhism, can be said to be psychotherapies much more than religions or philosophies.

#### SOCIAL SCIENCES

While physicians, psychologists, and psychotherapists will have to see the human organism as an integral part of interacting larger systems of physical, social, and cultural dimensions, the social sciences will have to deal with these larger systems accordingly. To do so, they will need to transcend current disciplinary boundaries and expand their basic concepts from their narrow, reductionist connotations to a broad social and ecological context. This will be the only hope for modeling and managing our present economic and social institutions, which have developed to a point where they have become a major threat to our well-being.

In many of these fields, scientists will be able to model their new concepts after those of modern physics. For others, physics may not be appropriate as a model but will still be helpful. Scientists will not need to be reluctant to adopt a holistic framework, as they often are today, for fear of being unscientific. Modern physics will have shown them that such a framework not only would be scientific; it would be consistent with the most advanced scientific theories of physical reality.

ESSAY 9|The Unification of Physics

2014

THE TWO BASIC theories of 20th-century physics—quantum theory and relativity theory—transcended the principal aspects of the Cartesian worldview and of Newtonian physics. Quantum theory showed that subatomic particles are not isolated grains of matter but are probability patterns, interconnections in an inseparable cosmic web that includes the human observer and his or her consciousness. Relativity theory revealed the intrinsically dynamic character of this cosmic web by showing that its activity is the very essence of its being.

Current research in physics aims at unifying quantum theory and relativity theory into a complete theory of subatomic matter. Such a theory would need to give a full account of the four fundamental forces that operate at the subatomic level: electromagnetism (which binds electrons to the nucleus and controls all chemical processes); gravity; the strong nuclear force (which holds atomic nuclei together); and the weak nuclear force (which is responsible for the radioactive decay known as beta decay). Physicists have not yet been able to formulate such a complete theory, but we now have several partial theories that describe very well some of the four fundamental forces and the phenomena associated with them.

The first successful quantum-relativistic theory was developed in the 1940s and is known as quantum electrodynamics, or QED. It involved the integration of the principles of quantum mechanics with Einstein’s relativistic theory of electromagnetism (the special theory of relativity). This led to the novel concept of the quantum field, a fundamental entity that can exist in continuous form, as a field, and in discontinuous form, as particles, different kinds of particles being associated with different fields. For example, the photon is the particle version of the electromagnetic field. Because of the central role of quantum fields, QED is known as a quantum field theory. It was developed independently by Sin-Itiro Tomonaga in Japan and by Richard Feynman and Julian Schwinger in the United States.

After the completion of QED, physicists concentrated their efforts on extending the formalism of quantum field theory to the strong and weak nuclear forces, which would take another quarter century. QED owes its success to the fact that the electromagnetic interactions are relatively weak and thus make it possible, to a large extent, to maintain the classical distinction between particles and the forces acting between them. It was soon noticed that this is also true for the weak interactions, but the formulation of a corresponding field theory was anything but easy.

The crucial breakthrough occurred in the 1960s with the discovery that a certain mathematical symmetry, known as gauge symmetry, is shared by the electromagnetic and weak interactions. Mathematical symmetries are used very widely in modern physics as fundamental principles that provide structure and coherence to the laws of nature. To a mathematician, the symmetry of an object is a transformation that leaves the object looking exactly the same. For example, we can rotate a square about its center through one or more right angles, and we will always end up with an identical square. In the case of gauge symmetries, the transformation acts on the quantum fields without affecting the value of any measurable physical quantity.

The discovery of a common gauge symmetry of electromagnetic and weak interactions led to the development of a new type of quantum field theories, called gauge theories, which made it possible to unify the two interactions. In the resulting unified field theory—known as the Weinberg-Salam theory after its two main architects, Steven Weinberg and Abdus Salam—the two interactions remain distinct but become mathematically intertwined and are referred to collectively as electroweak interactions.

The extension of the gauge-theory approach to the strong interactions remained highly problematic for many years, since the forces between the so-called hadrons (protons, neutrons, and other strongly interacting particles) are so strong that the distinction between particles and forces becomes blurred. However, during the 1960s, an unexpected solution to the problem emerged with the discovery that hadrons were not elementary after all. Physicists Murray Gell-Mann and Georg Zweig independently discovered that hadrons are made of smaller elementary units, called quarks. The proton and neutron each contain three quarks, while other hadrons, called mesons, are composed of two (a quark and an anti-quark, to be precise). Quarks, however, are not particles in the conventional sense. None has ever been observed in isolation, and yet the strong interactions between hadrons exhibit striking regularities that can be explained by the quark model. Over the years, physicists have come to accept this strange fact and to think of quarks as being permanently confined within hadrons, bound together by so-called gluons, the carriers of the strong nuclear force.

The discovery of the quark structure was an essential step toward extending the gauge-theory approach to hadrons, because now, the strong interactions could be described in terms of the interactions between quarks and gluons, which are much simpler than those among hadrons. The result was a field theory called quantum chromodynamics (QCD), in which the fields are associated with quarks and gluons, and “chromo” refers to three types of gluons, arbitrarily labeled “red,” “green,” and “blue.”

The development of QCD in the 1970s completed the representation of three of the four fundamental forces within the single theoretical framework of gauge theory. Like the Weinberg-Salam quantum field theory, QCD is modeled after quantum electrodynamics. In all three theories, the forces are transmitted by so-called gauge fields: the electromagnetic field (carried by the photon) in QED, two gauge fields (carried by particles labeled W and Z) in the Weinberg-Salam theory, and three gauge fields (carried by “colored” gluons) in QCD. Both the Weinberg-Salam theory of electroweak interactions and QCD, the theory of strong interactions, have been confirmed by rigorous experimental tests over more than three decades. Together, these theories are known today as the standard model of particle physics. The most spectacular confirmation came with the discovery of the W and Z gauge particles, exactly as predicted by the standard model, in the early 1980s by a team of experimenters at CERN, the European center of particle physics, under the leadership of Carlo Rubbia.

In the initial formulations of the standard model, the two gauge particles W and Z needed to be massless, because an exact gauge symmetry requires that the gauge fields correspond to massless particles. This is correct for the photon, the original gauge field, but not for the W and Z, which are very massive particles. In fact, in the original formulation of the standard model, all particles were massless. This was an obvious flaw, and physicists immediately set out to search for modifications of the model that would contain the massive particles observed in nature.

The challenge was to modify the standard model in such a way that the gauge symmetry would be maintained in the model’s basic equations but would be broken in their solutions (the various fields and their associated particles) in such a way that the particles could acquire their observed masses. In 1964, three teams of physicists independently proposed such a mechanism of “spontaneous symmetry breaking,” which became known as the Higgs mechanism after one of the authors, the British physicist Peter Higgs, who presented the most complete formulation of the underlying mathematics.

The Higgs mechanism required an additional field, known as the Higgs field, which permeates space and interacts with all particles in such a way that their gauge symmetries are broken spontaneously and they acquire their masses. This explained not only how particles acquire mass; it also predicted the mass ratio between the W and Z masses, as well as their couplings with all particles in the standard model. These predictions were subsequently confirmed by precise measurements in large particle accelerators, which dramatically increased the physicists’ confidence in the Higgs mechanism.

However, the particle corresponding to the Higgs field, the so-called Higgs boson, eluded detection for half a century, until the Large Hadron Collider, a gigantic particle accelerator at the European research center CERN with a circumference of 27 km, made it possible to analyze trillions of particle collisions at extremely high energies. In March 2012, after five decades of searching, scientists reported that the hunt for the elusive Higgs boson might finally be rewarded, and in July 2012, they announced that a “Higgs-like” particle had been discovered.

If this particle indeed turns out to have all the required properties of the Higgs boson, this would represent a triumphant completion of the standard model. (Since then, the Large Hadron Collider has continued to produce findings that confirm the earlier understanding of the Higgs field and particle. These results have increased the confidence of physicists that the Higgs boson has now been discovered.)

The representation of all three forces as expressions of a single unifying principle—the gauge principle—must be ranked as one of the greatest achievements in particle physics. However, a grand unified theory, in which all subatomic particles and the forces between them are seen as different manifestations of just one kind of particle and one gauge field, still remains elusive dream. Many physicists believe that this dream will not be realized until gravity, the fourth fundamental force, is integrated with the other three forces in a grand unification.

Integrating the force of gravity with the other three fundamental forces requires the unification of quantum theory with Einstein’s general theory of relativity. Despite more than half a century of strenuous efforts, such a unification—known as quantum gravity—has not been achieved. The most popular and most impressive approach, which is still evolving, has been that of string theory, in which all subatomic particles are represented as different states of vibrating mathematical “strings” in an abstract 9-dimensional space.

By picturing all particles, including the gauge particles, as different vibrations of the same fundamental object, string theory presents a unified picture of particles and forces, and by naturally including gravitons as vibrating closed strings, it unifies quantum theory and general relativity. The mathematical elegance of the theory, as it has been developed so far, is utterly compelling. Indeed, one of the best non-technical introductions to string theory, a book by physicist Brian Greene, is titled _The Elegant Universe_.[^1]

In spite of its conceptual elegance, however, string theory has serious deficiencies. To begin with, there are several versions with different numbers of spatial dimensions, and the process of reducing these dimensions to the four dimensions of our actual space-time is not unambiguous. Even more serious is the problem that the theory has not been verified experimentally. There are many different string theories, none of them capable of uniquely explaining the values of the basic parameters of the standard model.

The great potential of string theory, as well as its serious problems, are analyzed in fascinating detail by physicist Lee Smolin in his provocatively titled book _The Trouble with Physics_.[^2] Smolin argues that the principal weakness of string theory as a theory of quantum gravity lies in the fact that it is formulated in terms of vibrating strings moving against a fixed background of geometries of space that do not evolve in time. This is inconsistent with general relativity, which shows that the geometry of space and time is not fixed but changes as matter moves about. Hence, any theory consistent with general relativity must be formulated in such a way that the structure of space-time emerges from it rather than being assumed as the arena in which the physical phenomena take place. According to Smolin, the fact that string theory is not formulated in such a “background-independent” way is its most serious shortcoming.

Moreover, Smolin argues that a major obstacle standing in the way of unifying quantum theory with general relativity may be that both are formulated in terms of continuous space-time, but still-unresolved problems in the interpretation of quantum theory (associated with the processes of observation and measurement) point to the possibility that there may be a deeper level of reality that exhibits some kind of fundamental quantum structure out of which continuous space-time emerges as a result of a unified theory of quantum gravity. In Smolin’s view, the complete unification of physics will not be possible until the foundational problems of quantum theory are resolved.

I would like to end this essay on a personal note. In the last two chapters of my book _The Tao of Physics_, I discussed a theory known as bootstrap theory, which was very popular in the 1970s and on which I worked myself during my 10 years at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. This theory, proposed by Geoffrey Chew, is based on the idea that nature cannot be reduced to fundamental entities, like fundamental constituents of matter, but has to be understood entirely through self-consistency. All of physics has to follow uniquely from the requirement that its components be consistent with one another and with themselves.

This idea constitutes a radical departure from the traditional spirit of basic research in physics, which has always concentrated on finding the fundamental constituents of matter. At the same time, it can be seen as the culmination of the conception of particles as interconnections in an inseparable cosmic web, which arose in quantum theory and acquired an intrinsically dynamic nature in relativity theory.

The bootstrap philosophy not only abandons the idea of fundamental constituents of matter but accepts no fundamental entities whatsoever—no fundamental laws or equations, and not even a fundamental structure of space-time. The universe is seen as a dynamic web of interrelated events. None of the properties of any part of this web are fundamental; they all follow from the properties of the other parts, and the overall consistency of their mutual interrelations determines the structure of the entire web.

During the 1980s and 1990s, the bootstrap theory was eclipsed by the success of the standard model, which is very different, as it postulates the existence of fundamental fields and their corresponding particles. And today, bootstrap physics has virtually disappeared from the scene. However, if a theory of quantum gravity continues to remain elusive, and if the a priori assumption of the structure of space-time is broadly recognized as the essential flaw of string theory, the bootstrap idea may well will be revived someday, in some mathematical formulation or other.

## The New Vision of Reality

## _An Early Synthesis_

IN MY SECOND book, _The Turning Point_, I connected the conceptual changes in science with the broader changes of worldview and values in society. At first I thought that physics could be a model for the paradigm shift in other fields, but while I was working on my manuscript, I realized that I needed to go beyond physics and look for a broader conceptual framework. As I mentioned in chapter 3]], this realization came to me in a series of conversations with Gregory Bateson. The first essay in this chapter is an homage to Bateson, whom I consider to be one of the most influential thinkers of the 20th century. The essay is based on a talk I gave at the premiere screening of a documentary film by Bateson’s daughter Nora, “An Ecology of Mind: A Daughter’s Portrait of Gregory Bateson.” (In my book _Uncommon Wisdom_, published in 1988, I gave a detailed account of my discussions with Bateson during the years 1978–1980.[^1])

Bateson made me realize that our major social issues—health, education, social justice, protection of the environment, political power, and so on—all have to do with living systems, with individual human beings, social systems, and ecosystems. Physics cannot say very much about these living systems, and Bateson pointed out to me that systems thinking, and cybernetics in particular, were more appropriate approaches.

With this realization, my research interests shifted from physics to the life sciences, and I spent the next three decades developing a conceptual framework that would allow me to integrate life’s biological, cognitive, social, and ecological dimensions, using insights from the theory of living systems, complexity theory, and ecology. _The Turning Point_, published in 1982, was my first tentative synthesis of that conceptual framework.[^2] Already in this early formulation I called my synthesis “the systems view of life.”

This book represents not only the first tentative formulation of my synthesis, but also my first attempts to apply systems thinking to address our multifaceted global crisis, which I identified as being largely a “crisis of perception.” In the last chapter of _The Turning Point_, titled “The Passage to the Solar Age,” I predicted that the ecology movement, the feminist movement, the peace movement, and other grassroots movements would soon form alliances and coalesce into new political parties. Indeed, while I was writing these words, the first Green Party was already forming in Germany. In March 1983, the Greens, as they called themselves, entered the German national parliament. One month later, I went to Germany to interview their leaders, following a suggestion by my colleague Charlene Spretnak, and in 1984, Spretnak and I published _Green Politics_, which introduced the Green movement to the United States and was instrumental in the formation of the American Green Party.[^3]

Essay 11]] represents the first concise summary of my synthesis at the time of publication of _The Turning Point_. As in previous essays, I begin with a review of the mechanistic worldview and imbalanced value system and its impact on medicine and economics. I contrast this worldview with the new paradigm that emerged in physics during the early 20th century, but then I state explicitly that we have to go beyond physics to extend the holistic and ecological worldview to living organisms and social systems.

I summarize the main characteristics of the systems view of life, as I saw them in 1982. At that time, I had not yet studied the history of systems thinking, but I knew that there was as yet no coherent theory, and so I decided to use the term _the systems view of life_. I identified the principle of self-organization as the key characteristic of life, using the term in the sense it was used by Ilya Prigogine. Several years later, I would refine that term by outlining a synthesis of the theories of Prigogine and Humberto Maturana (see essay 12]]).

My summary in essay 11]] includes the new concept of mind as a systems phenomenon, proposed by Gregory Bateson. However, I was not yet familiar with the theory of cognition by Maturana and Varela, which would become central to subsequent formulations of my synthesis.

I conclude the essay with some reflections on the social and political implications of the emerging systems view of life and corresponding change of values. At the end of the essay, I predict the emergence of the Green movement, which had already begun to form in Germany but of which I was unaware at the time. Reading this conclusion now, I notice that it was full of optimism. The existential threat of the climate crisis was not yet apparent at that time.

In essay 12]], based on a talk I gave at a meeting of physicists and philosophers at Colorado State University in 1986, I discuss the role physics in the emergence of the systems view of life. I propose to generalize Thomas Kuhn’s concept of a scientific paradigm to that of a social paradigm, and then I discuss the paradigm shift within the context of the emerging systems view of life. I argue that in the new paradigm, physics can no longer be the model and source of metaphors for the other sciences. Even though the paradigm shift in physics is still of special interest, since it was the first to occur in modern science, physics has now lost its role as the science providing the most fundamental description of reality. In other words, this essay gives the scientific and philosophical rationale for my own change of focus from physics to the life sciences.

The main body of the essay contains a summary of my synthesis of the systems view of life, as of 1986. It is developed considerably further than that in essay 11]] because in the meantime, my understanding had greatly increased after extensive discussions with Humberto Maturana and, especially, with Francisco Varela.

In the essay, I identify five criteria of systems thinking to specify what I meant by “the systems approach,” and I illustrate them with examples from modern physics (as appropriate for my talk to a group of physicists, on which the essay is based). I then discuss the concept of self-organization, as I did in essay 11]], but this time by defining three interdependent perspectives on self-organizing systems: their pattern of organization, their structure, and their organizing activity.

I identify the pattern of organization of these systems with the concept of autopoiesis, as described by Maturana and Varela; their structure as a dissipative structure, as defined by Prigogine; and their organizing activity as mental activity, as defined by Bateson; or, equivalently, as cognition, as defined by Maturana and Varela.

In the essay, I identify this conceptual framework with an emerging _theory of self-organizing systems_ (a term I would not use again in my subsequent writings). I also argue that this theory provides the ideal scientific framework for an ecologically oriented ethics, which is urgently needed in science today. Such an “Earth ethics” would be formulated in great detail several years later in the Earth Charter, as I discuss in essay 29]].

Essay 12]] represents the first outline of my synthesis of the theories of Prigogine, Bateson, Maturana, and Varela, which I would refine during the subsequent ten years. This process took me that long because during the remainder of the 1980s, my extensive activities as environmental educator and activist left me very little time for theoretical research.

ESSAY 10|Homage to Gregory Bateson

2010

I HAD THE great fortune to have had frequent discussions with Gregory Bateson during the last two years of his life, which he spent at the Esalen Institute. He was, in my opinion, one of the most influential thinkers of the 20th century. The uniqueness of his thought came from its broad range and its generality. In an age characterized by fragmentation and overspecialization, Bateson challenged the basic assumptions and methods of several sciences by looking for patterns connecting different phenomena and for processes beneath structures.

![[f0105-01.jpg]]

He made significant contributions to several sciences—anthropology, cybernetics, psychiatry, and, most important of all, to the new interdisciplinary field of cognitive science, which he pioneered. But perhaps even more important is the fact that he championed a new way of thinking, which is extremely relevant to our time—thinking in terms of relationships, connections, patterns, and context. As we replace the Newtonian metaphor of the world as a machine by the metaphor of the network, and as complexity becomes a principal focus in science, the kind of systemic thinking that Bateson advocated is becoming crucial.

To use a popular phrase, Bateson taught us how to connect the dots, and this is critical today not only in science but also in politics and civic life, as most of our political and corporate leaders show a striking inability to do so. If, for example, we improved the fuel efficiency of our cars by just three miles per gallon, which could be very easily done, we would not have to import any oil from the Persian Gulf. But instead, politicians prefer to fight a war that kills tens of thousands of innocent people while the greenhouse gases produced by our cars increase the force and frequency of hurricanes, droughts, and floods, which make millions homeless and cause billions of dollars of damages.

If we served organically grown food in our schools, to use another example, we would not have the current epidemic of obesity among our children, we would not poison our farm workers, and the increased carbon content of the organic soil would draw down significant amounts of carbon dioxide and thus contribute to reversing climate change. In short, to solve the major problems of our time, we need exactly the type of thinking Bateson pioneered.

Gregory Bateson was not only an outstanding scientist but also a highly original philosopher. He was very charismatic, and, like a Zen master, he liked to jolt people’s minds by asking astonishing and seemingly mysterious questions. “What is the pattern,” Bateson would ask, “that connects the crab to the lobster and the orchid to the primrose, and all four of them to me? And me to you?”

Bateson’s style of presentation was an essential and intrinsic part of his teaching. His central message was that relationships are the essence of the living world, and that we need a language of relationships to understand and describe it. One of the best ways to do so, in his view, is by telling stories. “Stories are the royal road to the study of relationships,” he would say. What is important in a story, what is true in it, is not the plot, the things, or the people in a story, but the relationships between them.

Since Bateson’s favorite method was to present patterns of relationships in the form of stories, the essays and books he wrote do not give us the full flavor of his teaching. To experience the essence of Bateson’s message, you would really have had to have experienced his own live delivery of that message. Fortunately, this is still possible, because we have many hours of film footage of Gregory Bateson talking, teaching, telling stories. This is why Nora’s film is so important, in my view. It is not only a priceless souvenir of one of the greatest thinkers of our time, but also an essential vehicle to deliver his message, which today is more important than ever.

ESSAY 11|The Turning Point

### _A New Vision of Reality_

1982

WE FIND OURSELVES today in a state of profound worldwide crisis. We can read about the various aspects of this crisis every day in the newspapers. We have an energy crisis, a health care crisis, high inflation and unemployment, pollution and other environmental disasters, the ever increasing threat of nuclear war, and a rising wave of violence and crime.

All these threats are actually different facets of one and the same crisis—essentially a crisis of perception. We are trying to apply the concepts of an outdated worldview—the mechanistic worldview of Cartesian-Newtonian science—to a reality that can no longer be understood in these terms.

We live in a globally interconnected world in which biological, psychological, social, and environmental phenomena are all interdependent. To describe this world appropriately, we need an ecological perspective that the Cartesian worldview cannot offer.

What we need, then, is a fundamental change in our thoughts, perceptions, and values. The beginnings of this change are already visible in all fields, and the shift from a mechanistic to a holistic conception of reality is likely to dominate the entire decade. The gravity and global extent of our crisis indicate that the current changes are likely to result in a transformation of unprecedented dimensions, a turning point for the planet as a whole.

#### **The Mechanistic Worldview**

Descartes, Galileo, Bacon, Newton, and others developed the mechanistic view of the world in the 17th century. Descartes based his view of nature on a fundamental division into two separate and independent realms: that of mind and that of matter.

The material universe was a machine and nothing but a machine. Nature worked according to mechanical laws. Everything in the material world could be explained in terms of the arrangement and movement of its parts. Descartes extended this mechanistic view of matter to living organisms. Plants and animals were considered simply machines; human beings were inhabited by a rational soul, but the human body was indistinguishable from an animal-machine.

The essence of Descartes’s approach to knowledge was his analytic method of reasoning by breaking up thoughts and problems into pieces and arranging them in logical order. This approach has become an essential characteristic of modern scientific thought and has proved extremely useful in the development of scientific theories and the realization of complex technological projects.

On the other hand, overemphasis on the Cartesian method has led to the fragmentation characteristic of both our general thinking and our academic disciplines and to the widespread attitude of reductionism in science—the belief that _all_ aspects of complex phenomena can be understood by reducing them to their constituent parts.

The conceptual framework created by Descartes was completed triumphantly by Newton, who developed a consistent mathematical formulation of the mechanistic view of nature. From the second half of the 17th century to the end of the 19th, the mechanistic Newtonian model of the universe dominated all scientific thought. The natural sciences, humanities, and social sciences all accepted the mechanistic view of classical physics as the correct description of reality and modeled their own theories accordingly Whenever sociologists or economists, for example, wanted to be scientific, they naturally turned toward the basic concepts of Newtonian physics, and many of them hold on to these concepts even now that physicists have gone far beyond them.

#### **Cartesian Impact on Medicine**

In biology, the Cartesian view of living organisms as machines, constructed from separate parts, still provides the dominant conceptual framework. Although Descartes’s simple mechanistic biology had to be modified considerably during the subsequent 300 years, the belief that all aspects of living organisms can be understood by reducing them to their smallest constituents and studying the mechanisms through which these interact lies at the basis of most contemporary biological thinking.

The influence of reductionist biology on medical thought resulted in the so-called biomedical model, which constitutes the conceptual foundation of modern scientific medicine. The human body is regarded as a machine that can be analyzed in terms of its parts; disease is seen as a malfunction of biological mechanisms that are studied from the point of view of cellular and molecular biology; the doctor’s role is to intervene, either physically or chemically, to correct the malfunctioning of a specific mechanism, with different parts of the body being treated by different specialists.

To associate a particular illness with a definite part of the body is, of course, very useful in many cases. But modern scientific medicine has overemphasized the reductionist approach and developed its specialized disciplines to a point where doctors are often no longer able to view illness as a disturbance of the whole organism, nor to treat it as such. They tend to treat a particular organ or tissue, usually without taking the rest of the body into account, let alone considering the psychological and social aspects of the patient’s illness.

#### **Fragmented Economics**

Most social sciences are also fragmentary and reductionist. Present-day economics, for example, fails to recognize that the economy is merely one aspect of a whole ecological and social fabric. Economists tend to dissociate the economy from this fabric and to describe it in terms of highly unrealistic theoretical models. Most of their basic concepts—efficiency, productivity, gross national product—have been narrowly defined and are used without their wider social and ecological context. In particular, the social and environmental costs generated by all economic activity are generally neglected.

Consequently, current economic concepts and models are no longer adequate to map economic phenomena in a fundamentally interdependent world, and economists have generally been unable to understand the major economic problems of our time. For example, economists have been quite unable to understand inflation. Hazel Henderson, one of the most eloquent critics of conventional economics, defines inflation as “the sum of all variables that economists have left out of their models.”

Because of its narrow, reductionist framework, conventional economics is inherently anti-ecological. Whereas the surrounding ecosystems are self-balancing and self-adjusting organic wholes, our current economies and technologies recognize no self-limiting principle. Undifferentiated growth—economic, technological, and institutional—is still regarded by most economists as a sign of a “healthy” economy, although it is now causing ecological disasters, widespread corporate crime, social disintegration, and the ever increasing likelihood of nuclear war.

The situation is further aggravated by economists who, in a misguided attempt at scientific rigor, avoid explicitly acknowledging the value system on which their models are based. In doing so, they tacitly accept the highly imbalanced set of values that dominates our culture and is embodied in our social institutions.

#### **Imbalanced Value Systems**

The Chinese terminology of yin and yang is useful for describing this cultural imbalance. Together with the development of the mechanistic worldview, our culture has consistently favored yang values and attitudes and has neglected their complementary yin counterparts. We have favored self-assertion over integration, analysis over synthesis, rational knowledge over intuitive wisdom, science over religion, competition over cooperation, expansion over conservation.

Today, the most severe consequence of this imbalance is the growing threat of nuclear war, brought about by an overemphasis on self-assertion, control and power, excessive competition, and a pathological obsession with “winning” in a situation where the whole concept of winning has lost its meaning because there can be no winners in a nuclear war. Nuclear weapons, then, provide the most tragic example of people holding on to an old paradigm that has long lost its usefulness.

From the earliest times of Chinese culture, yin has also been associated with the feminine and yang with the masculine, and in our time, feminists have repeatedly pointed out that the values and attitudes favored by our society—and, in particular, those that have led to the current nuclear madness—are traits typical of a patriarchal culture. The Cartesian worldview and the yang-oriented value system have been supported by patriarchy, but like the Cartesian paradigm, patriarchy is now in its decline, and the feminist perspective will be an essential aspect of the new vision of reality.

#### **The New Worldview**

The new vision of reality emerged in physics at the beginning of the 20th century and is now surfacing in various other fields. It consists not only of new concepts but also of a new value system, and it is reflected in new forms of social organization and new institutions. It is being formulated largely outside our academic institutions, which remain too closely tied to the Cartesian framework to appreciate the new ideas.

The material world, according to contemporary physics, is not a mechanical system, composed of separate objects, but instead appears as a complex web of relationships. Subatomic particles cannot be understood as isolated, separate entities but must be seen as interconnections, or correlations, in a network of events. The notion of separate objects is an idealization that is often very useful but has no fundamental validity. All such objects are patterns in an inseparable cosmic process, and these patterns are intrinsically dynamic.

Physicists, following the reductionist approach, tried to take matter apart to discover its basic building blocks. Substances could be isolated in molecular form, molecules broken into atoms, and atoms broken into subatomic particles. But at this point, the reductionist approach falls apart. For when we get to subatomic particles, we find that they are actually not made of any material substance. They have a certain mass, but this mass is a form of energy. Energy is always associated with processes, with activity; it is a measure of activity. Subatomic particles, then, are bundles of energy, or patterns of activity. The energy patterns of the subatomic world form the stable atomic and molecular structures that build up matter and give it its macroscopic solid appearance, thus making us believe that it is made of some material substance. At the everyday, macroscopic level, the notion of a substance is quite useful, but at the atomic level, it no longer makes sense. When we observe the particles that make up atoms, we never see any substance; what we observe are continually changing dynamic patterns continually—a perpetual dance of energy.

#### **The Systems View of Life**

The worldview of modern physics is holistic and ecological. It emphasizes the fundamental interrelatedness and interdependence of all phenomena and the intrinsically dynamic nature of physical reality. To extend this view to the description of living organisms, we must go beyond physics, and there is now a framework that seems to be a natural extension of the concepts of modern physics.

The framework is known as systems theory, sometimes also called general systems theory. Actually, the term is somewhat misleading, since systems theory is not a well-defined theory, like relativity theory or quantum theory. Rather, it is a particular approach, a language, a perspective.

The systems view looks at the world in terms of relationships and integration. Systems are integrated wholes with unique properties of their own that cannot be reduced to, or understood by, simply combining, the properties of smaller units. Instead of concentrating on basic building blocks or basic substances, the systems approach emphasizes basic principles of organization.

Examples of systems abound in nature. Every organism—from the smallest bacterium through the wide range of plants and animals to humans—is an integrated whole and thus a living system. Cells are living systems, and so are the various tissues and organs of the body, the human brain being the most complex example.

But systems are not confined to individual organisms and their parts. The same aspects of wholeness are exhibited by social systems—such as a family or a community—and by ecosystems, which consist of a variety of organisms and inanimate matter in mutual interaction.

All these natural systems are wholes whose specific structures arise from the interactions and interdependence of their parts. Systemic properties are destroyed when a system is dissected—either physically or theoretically—into isolated elements. Although we can discern individual parts in any system, the nature of the whole is always different from the mere sum of its parts.

Another important aspect of systems is their intrinsically dynamic nature. Their forms are not rigid structures but are flexible, yet stable, manifestations of underlying processes. Systems thinking is process thinking: form becomes associated with process, interrelation with interaction, and opposites are unified through oscillation.

An important aspect of living systems is their tendency to form multileveled structures of systems within systems. For example, the human body contains organ systems composed of several organs, each organ being made up of tissues and each tissue made up of cells. All of these are living organisms, or living systems, which consist of smaller parts and, at the same time, act as parts of larger wholes. Living systems, then, exhibit a stratified order, and there are interconnections and interdependencies between all systems levels, each level interacting and communicating with its total environment.

The systems view is an ecological view. Like the view of modern physics, it emphasizes the interrelatedness and interdependence of all phenomena and the dynamic nature of living systems. All structure is seen as a manifestation of underlying processes, and living systems are described in terms of patterns of organization.

What, then, are the patterns of organization that are characteristic of life? They include a variety of processes and phenomena that can be seen as different aspects of the same dynamic principle, the principle of self-organization. A living organism is a self-organizing system, which means that its order is not imposed by the environment but is established by the system itself.

Self-organizing systems exhibit a certain degree of autonomy. For example, they tend to establish their size according to internal principles of organization, independent of environmental influence. This does not mean that living systems are isolated from their environment; on the contrary, they interact with it continually, but this interaction does not determine their organization.

A theory of self-organizing systems has been worked out over the last decade in considerable detail by researchers from various disciplines, under the leadership of Ilya Prigogine, the Belgian physical chemist and Nobel laureate.[^1] The aspects of self-organization described by this theory include not only the various processes of self-maintenance—such as self-renewal, regeneration, and adaptation to environmental changes—but also the tendency of self-transcendence, which manifests itself in the processes of learning, development, and evolution.

#### **A New Concept of Mind**

In order to apply the systems view of life to higher organisms—and in particular to human beings—it is necessary to deal with the phenomenon of mind. Anthropologist Gregory Bateson proposed to define mind as a systems phenomenon characteristic of living organisms, societies, and ecosystems.[^2] He has listed a set of criteria that systems have to satisfy for mind to occur. Any system that satisfies those criteria will be able to process information and develop various phenomena that we associate with mind—thinking, learning, memory, and so on.

In Bateson’s view, mind is a necessary and inevitable consequence of a certain complexity that begins long before organisms develop a brain and a higher nervous system. Indeed, mind is an essential property of living systems. As Bateson put it, “Mind is the essence of being alive.”[^3] From the systems point of view, life is not some substance or force, and mind is not an entity interacting with matter. Both life and mind are manifestations of the same set of systemic properties, a set of processes that represent the dynamics of self-organization.

The new concept of mind will be of tremendous value in our attempts to overcome the Cartesian dichotomy. Mind and matter no longer appear to belong to two separate categories, but can be seen as merely different aspects of the same phenomenon. For example, the relationship between mind and brain, which has confused countless scientists since Descartes, now becomes quite clear. Mind is the dynamics of self-organization, and the brain is the biological structure through which this dynamics is carried out.

Since the living world is organized in multileveled structures, the mind must also be organized on such levels. In the human organism, for example, there are various levels of mentation, or mental activity, involving cells, tissues, and organs. At the highest level is the neural mentation of the brain, which itself consists of multiple levels corresponding to different stages in our evolution. The totality of these mentations constitutes what I would call the human mind, or psyche. This integrated whole of mental activity includes self-awareness, conscious experience, conceptual thought, symbolic language—characteristics that exist in rudimentary form in various animals but unfold fully in human beings.

In the stratified order of nature, individual human minds are embedded in the larger minds of social and ecological systems, and these are integrated into the planetary mental system, which in turn must participate in some kind of universal or cosmic mind. This view of mind has radical implications for our interactions with the natural environment, implications that are fully consistent with spiritual traditions.

#### **Social Implications**

The systems view of life has many important consequences not only for science but also for society and everyday living. It will influence our way of dealing with health and illness, our relation to the natural environment, and many of our social and political structures. All these changes are already taking place.

The paradigm shift is not something that will happen sometime in the future; it is happening right now. The sixties and seventies generated a whole series of social movements that all seemed to go in the same direction; they all emphasized different aspects of the new vision of reality.

There is a rising concern with ecology, expressed by citizen movements that are forming around social and environmental issues, pointing out the limits to growth, advocating a new ecological ethic, and developing appropriate “soft” technologies. They are the sources of emerging counter-economies based on decentralized, cooperative, and ecologically harmonious lifestyles. In the political arena, the anti-nuclear movement is fighting the most extreme outgrowth of our self-assertive technology and in doing so is rapidly becoming the most powerful political force of this decade.

At the same time, there is the beginning of a significant shift in values from the admiration of large-scale enterprises and institutions to the notion of “small is beautiful,” from material consumption to voluntary simplicity, from economic and technological growth to inner growth and development.[^4] These new values are being promoted by the human-potential movement, the holistic-health movement, and by movements that re-emphasize the quest for meaning and the spiritual dimension of life. Lastly, but perhaps most importantly, the old value system is being challenged and profoundly changed by the rise of feminist awareness, originating in the women’s movement, which may well become a catalyst for the coalescence of many other movements.

So far, most of these movements still operate separately and have not yet recognized how their purposes interrelate. However, coalitions between some movements have recently begun to form. During this decade, the various movements are bound to recognize the communality of their aims and flow together to form a powerful force for social transformation. This projection may seem idealistic in view of the recent political swing to the right in the United States and the crusades of Christian fundamentalists promoting medieval notions of reality. However, when we look at the situation from a broad evolutionary perspective, these phenomena become understandable as inevitable aspects of change and transformation.

Cultural historians have often pointed out that cultural evolution is characterized by a regular pattern of rise, culmination, decline, and disintegration.[^5] The decline occurs when a culture has become too rigid in its technologies, ideas, or social organization to meet the challenge of changing conditions. During this process of decline and disintegration, while the cultural mainstream becomes petrified by clinging to fixed ideas and rigid patterns of behavior, creative minorities appear on the scene and transform some of the old elements into new configurations that become part of a new rising culture.

This pattern is now quite apparent in Europe and North America. The traditional political parties, the large multinational corporations, and most of our academic institutions are all part of the declining culture. They are in the process of disintegration. The social movements of the sixties and seventies represent the rising culture.

While the transformation takes place, the declining culture will refuse to change, clinging ever more rigidly to its outdated ideas; nor will the dominant social institutions simply hand over their leading roles to the new cultural forces. But they will inevitably go on to decline and disintegrate while the rising culture will continue to ascend and eventually assume its leading role.

As the turning point approaches, the realization that evolutionary changes of this magnitude cannot be prevented by short-term political activities provides our greatest hope for the future.

ESSAY 12|The Role of Physics in the Current Change of Paradigms

1986

#### **Crisis and Transformation in Science and Society**

The dramatic change in concepts and ideas that happened in physics during the first three decades of the 20th century has been widely discussed by physicists and philosophers for more than 50 years. It led Thomas Kuhn to the notion of a scientific paradigm, a constellation of achievements—concepts, values, techniques, and so on—shared by a scientific community and used by that community to define legitimate problems and solutions.[^1] Changes of paradigms, according to Kuhn, occur in discontinuous, revolutionary breaks called paradigm shifts.

Today, 25 years after Kuhn’s analysis, we recognize paradigm shifts in physics as an integral part of a much larger cultural transformation.[^2] The intellectual crisis of quantum physicists in the 1920s is mirrored today by a similar but much broader cultural crisis. The major problems of our time—the growing threat of nuclear war, the devastation of our natural environment, our inability to deal with poverty and starvation around the world, to name just the most urgent ones—are all different facets of a single crisis, which is essentially a crisis of perception. Like the crisis in quantum physics, it derives from the fact that most of us, and especially our large social institutions, subscribe to the concepts of an outdated worldview, inadequate for dealing with the problems of our overpopulated, globally interconnected world. At the same time, researchers in several scientific disciplines, various social movements, and numerous alternative organizations and networks are developing a new vision of reality that will form the basis of our future technologies, economic systems, and social institutions.

What we are seeing today is a shift of paradigms not only within science but also in the larger social arena. To analyze this cultural transformation, I have generalized Kuhn’s account of a scientific paradigm to that of a social paradigm, which I define as “a constellation of concepts, values, perceptions, and practices shared by a community, which form a particular vision of reality that is the basis of the way the community organizes itself.”[^3]

The social paradigm now receding has dominated our culture for several hundred years, during which it has shaped our modern Western society and significantly influenced the rest of the world. This paradigm consists of a number of ideas and values, among them the view of the universe as a mechanical system composed of elementary building blocks, the view of the human body as a machine, the view of life in a society as a competitive struggle for existence, the belief in unlimited material progress to be achieved through economic and technological growth, and—last but not least—the belief that a society, in which the female is everywhere subsumed under the male, is one that follows from some basic law of nature. During recent decades, all these assumptions have been found severely limited and in need of radical revision.

Indeed, such a revision is now taking place. The emerging new paradigm may be called a holistic, or an ecological, worldview, using the term _ecological_ here in a much boarder and deeper sense than it is commonly used. Ecological awareness, in that deep sense, recognizes the fundamental interdependence of all phenomena and the embeddedness of individuals and societies in the cyclical processes of nature.

Ultimately, deep ecological awareness is spiritual or religious awareness. When the concept of the human spirit is understood as the mode of consciousness in which the individual feels connected to the cosmos as a whole, which is the root meaning of the world _religion_ (from the Latin _religare_ meaning “to bind strongly”), it becomes clear that ecological awareness is spiritual in its deepest essence. It is, therefore, not surprising that the emerging new vision of reality, based on deep ecological awareness, is consistent with the “perennial philosophy” of spiritual traditions, for example, that of Eastern spiritual traditions, the spirituality of Christian mystics, or with the philosophy and cosmology underlying the Native American traditions.[^4]

#### **The Systems Approach**

In science, the language of systems theory, and especially the theory of living systems, seems to provide the most appropriate formulation of the new ecological paradigm.[^5] Since living systems cover such a wide range of phenomena—individual organisms, social systems, and ecosystems—the theory provides a common framework and language for biology, psychology, medicine, economics, ecology, and many other sciences, a framework in which the so urgently needed ecological perspective is explicitly manifest.

The conceptual framework of contemporary physics, and especially those aspects that will be the focus of this conference, may be seen as a special case of the systems approach, dealing with nonliving systems and exploring the interface between nonliving and living systems. It is important to recognize, I believe, that in the new paradigm, physics is no longer the model and source of metaphors for the other sciences. Even though the paradigm shift in physics is still of special interest, since it was the first to occur in modern science, physics has now lost its role as the science providing the most fundamental description of reality.

I would now like to specify what I mean by the systems approach. To do so, I shall identify five criteria of systems thinking that, I claim, hold for all the sciences—the natural sciences, the humanities, and the social sciences. I shall formulate each criterion in terms of the shift from the old to the new paradigm, and I will illustrate the five criteria with examples from contemporary physics. However, since the criteria hold for all the sciences, I could equally well illustrate them with examples from biology, psychology, or economics.

1. _Shift from the parts to the whole_. In the old paradigm, it is believed that in any complex system, the dynamics of the whole can be understood from the properties of the parts. The parts themselves cannot be analyzed any further, except by reducing them to still smaller parts. Indeed, physics has been progressing in that way, and at each step there has been a level of fundamental constituents that could not be analyzed any further.

In the new paradigm, the relationship between the parts and the whole is reversed. The properties of the parts can be understood only from the dynamics of the whole. In fact, ultimately, there are no parts at all. What we call a part is merely a pattern in an inseparable web of relationships. The shift from the parts to the whole was the central aspect of the conceptual revolution in quantum physics in the 1920s. Heisenberg was so impressed by this aspect that he titled his autobiography _Der Teil und das Ganze_ (The part and the whole).[^6] More recently, the view of physical reality as a web of relationships has been emphasized by Henry Stapp, who showed how this view is embodied in S-matrix theory.[^7]

2. _Shift from structure to process_. In the old paradigm, there are fundamental structures, and then there are forces and mechanisms through which these interact, thus giving rise to processes. In the new paradigm, every structure is seen as the manifestation of an underlying process. The entire web of relationships is intrinsically dynamic. The shift from structure to process is evident, for example, when we remember that mass in contemporary physics is no longer seen as measuring a fundamental substance but rather as a form of energy, that is, as measuring activity or processes. The shift from structure to process is also apparent in the work of Ilya Prigogine, who titled his classic book _From Being to Becoming_.[^8]

3. _Shift from objective to “epistemic” science_. In the old paradigm, scientific descriptions are believed to be objective, that is, independent of the human observer and the process of knowing. In the new paradigm, it is believed that epistemology—the understanding of the process of knowledge—must be included explicitly in the description of natural phenomena. This recognition entered into physics with Heisenberg and is closely related to the view of physical reality as a web of relationships. Whenever we isolate a pattern in this network and define it as a part or an object, we do so by cutting through some of its connections to the rest of the network, and this may be done in different ways. As Heisenberg (1958, p. 58) put it, “What we observe is not nature itself, but nature exposed to our method of questioning.”[^9] This method of questioning—in other words, epistemology—inevitably becomes part of the theory. At present, there is no consensus about what is the proper epistemology, but there is an emerging consensus that epistemology will have to be an integral part of every scientific theory.

4. _Shift from “building” to “network” as metaphor of knowledge_. The metaphor of knowledge as a building has been used in Western science and philosophy for thousands of years. There are _fundamental_ laws, _fundamental_ principles, basic building blocks, and so on. The edifice of science must be built on firm foundations. During periods of paradigm shifts, it was always felt that the foundations of knowledge were shifting, or even crumbling, and that feeling induced great anxiety. Einstein (1949), for example, wrote in his autobiography about the early days of quantum mechanics, “All my attempts to adapt the theoretical framework of physics to this (new type of) knowledge failed completely. It was as if the ground had been pulled out from under one, with no firm foundation to be seen anywhere, upon which one could have built.”[^10]

In the new paradigm, the metaphor of knowledge as a building is being replaced by that of the network. Since we perceive reality as a network of relationships, our descriptions, too, form an interconnected network of concepts and models in which there are no foundations. For most scientists, this metaphor of knowledge as a network with no firm foundations is extremely uncomfortable. It is explicitly expressed in physics in Geoffrey Chew’s bootstrap theory of particles.[^11]

According to Chew, nature cannot be reduced to any fundamental entities, but must be understood entirely through self-consistency. There are no fundamental equations or fundamental symmetries in the bootstrap theory. Physical reality is seen as a web of interrelated events. Things exist by virtue of their mutually consistent relationships, and all of physics has to follow uniquely from the requirement that its components be consistent with one another and with themselves. This approach is so foreign to our traditional ways of thinking that it is pursued today only by a small minority of physicists.

When the notion of scientific knowledge as a network of concepts and models, in which no part is any more fundamental than the others, is applied to science as a whole, it implies that physics can no longer be seen as the most fundamental level of science. Since there are no foundations in the network, the phenomena described by physics are not any more fundamental than those described, for example, by biology or psychology. They belong to different systems-levels, but none of those levels is any more fundamental than the others.

5. _Shift from truth to approximate descriptions_. The four criteria of systems thinking presented so far are all interdependent. Nature is seen as in interconnected, dynamic web of relationships in which the identification of specific patterns as “objects” depends on the human observer and the process of knowledge. This web of relationships is described in terms of a corresponding network of concepts and models, none of which is any more fundamental than the others.

This new approach immediately raises an important question: If everything is connected to everything else, how can we ever hope to understand anything? Since all natural phenomena are ultimately interconnected, in order to explain any one of them we need to understand all the others, which is obviously impossible.

What makes it possible to turn the systems approach into a scientific theory is the fact that there is such a thing as approximate knowledge. This insight is crucial to all of modern science. The old paradigm is based on the Cartesian belief in the certainty of scientific knowledge. In the new paradigm, it is recognized that all scientific concepts and theories are limited and approximate. Science can never provide any complete and definitive understanding. Scientists do not deal with truth in the sense of a precise correspondence between the description and the described phenomena. They deal with limited and approximate descriptions of reality. Heisenberg often pointed out that important fact. For example, he wrote in _Physics and Philosophy_, “The often discussed lesson that has been learned from modern physics [is] that every word or concept, clear as it may seem to be, has only a limited range of applicability.”[^12]

#### **Self-Organizing Systems**

The broadest implications of the systems approach are found today in the theory of living systems, which originated in cybernetics in the 1940s and emerged in its main outlines over the last 20 years.[^13] As I mentioned before, living systems include individual organisms, social systems, and ecosystems, and thus the new theory can provide a common framework and language for a wide range of disciplines—biology, psychology, medicine, economics, ecology, and many others.

The central concept of the new theory is that of self-organization. A living system is defined as a self-organizing system, which means that its order is not imposed by the environment but is established by the system itself. In other words, self-organizing systems exhibit a certain degree of autonomy. This does not mean that living systems are isolated from their environment; on the contrary, they interact with it continually, but this interaction does not determine their organization

In this essay, I can give only a brief sketch of the theory of self-organizing systems. To do so, let me distinguish three aspects of self-organization:

1. _Pattern of organization_: the totality of relationships that define the system as an integrated whole.

2. _Structure_: the physical realization of the pattern of organization in space and time.

3. _Organizing activity_: the activity involved in realizing the pattern of organization.

For self-organizing systems, the pattern of organization is characterized by a mutual dependency of the system’s parts, which is necessary and sufficient to understand the parts. This is quite similar to the pattern of relationships between subatomic particles in Chew’s bootstrap theory. However, the pattern of organization has the additional property that it gives the whole system an individual identity.

The pattern of self-organization has been studied extensively and described precisely by Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela, who have called it _autopoiesis_, which means literally “self-production.”[^14] Sometimes it is also called operational closure.

An important aspect of the theory is the fact that the description of the pattern of self-organization does not use any physical parameters, such as energy or entropy, nor does it use the concepts of space and time. It is an abstract mathematical description of a pattern of relationships. This pattern can be realized in space and time in different physical structures, which are then described in terms of the concepts of physics and chemistry. But such a description alone will fail to capture the biological phenomenon of self-organization. In other words, physics and chemistry are not enough to understand life; we also need to understand the pattern of self-organization, which is independent of physical and chemical parameters.

The structure of self-organizing systems has been studied extensively by Ilya Prigogine,[^15] who has called it a dissipative structure. The two main characteristics of a dissipative structure are (1) that it is an open system, maintaining its pattern of organization through continuous exchange of energy and matter with its environment; and (2) that it operates far from thermodynamic equilibrium and thus cannot be described in terms of classical thermodynamics. One of Prigogine’s greatest contributions has been to create a new thermodynamics to describe living systems.

The organizing activity of living, self-organizing systems, finally, is cognition, or mental activity. This implies a radically new concept of mind, which was first proposed by Gregory Bateson.[^16] Mental process is defined as the organizing activity of life. This means that all interactions of a living system with its environment are cognitive, or mental interactions. With this new concept of mind, life and cognition become inseparably connected. Mind, or more accurately, mental process, is seen as being immanent in matter at all levels of life.

I have taken some time to outline the emerging theory of self-organizing systems because it is today the broadest scientific formulation of the ecological paradigm with the most wide-ranging implications. The worldview of contemporary physics, in my view, will have to be understood within that broader framework. In particular, any speculation about human consciousness and its relation to the phenomena described by physics will have to take into account the notion of mental process as the self-organizing activity of life.

#### **Science and Ethics**

A further reason why I find the theory of self-organizing systems so important is that it seems to provide the ideal scientific framework for an ecologically oriented ethics.[^17] Such a system of ethics is urgently needed, since most of what scientists are doing today is not life-furthering and life-preserving but life-destroying. With physicists designing nuclear weapons that threaten to wipe out all life on the planet, with chemists contaminating our environment, with biologists releasing new and unknown types of microorganisms into the environment without really knowing what the consequences are, with psychologists and other scientists torturing animals in the name of scientific progress, with all these activities occurring, it seems that it is most urgent to introduce ethical standards into modern science.

It is generally not recognized in our culture that values are not peripheral to science and technology but constitute their very basis and driving force. During the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century, values were separated from facts, and since that time, we have tended to believe that scientific facts are independent of what we do and, therefore, independent of our values. In reality, scientific facts emerge out of an entire constellation of human perceptions, values, and actions—in other words, out of a paradigm—from which they cannot be separated. Although much of the detailed research may not depend explicitly on the scientist’s value system, the larger paradigm within which this research is pursued will never be value free. Scientists, therefore, are responsible for their research not only intellectually but also morally.

One of the most important insights of the new systems theory of life is that life and cognition are inseparable. The process of knowledge is also the process of self-organization, that is, the process of life. Our conventional model of knowledge is one of a representation, or an image, of independently existing facts, which is the model derived from classical physics. From the new systems point of view, knowledge is part of the process of life, of a dialogue between object and subject.

Knowledge and life, then, are inseparable, and therefore, facts are inseparable from values. Thus, the fundamental split that made it impossible to include ethical considerations in our scientific worldview has now been healed. At present, nobody has yet established a system of ethics that expresses the same ecological awareness on which the systems view of life is based, but I believe that this is now possible. I also believe that it is one of the most important tasks by scientists and philosophers today.

## Crisis of Perception

WRITING _The Turning Point_, in a way, was a collaborative effort. As I branched out beyond physics into various other fields—medicine, psychology, economics, and so on—I realized very soon that because I had no expertise in any of those disciplines, I could not acquire this new knowledge on my own. I would not even know where to start. So I developed a technique—and this has stayed with me until today—of learning things from people through dialogues. I acquired a talent of seeking out and recognizing individuals who were experts in their fields—systemic thinkers—who shared my general worldview and values. I would meet them at lectures, seminars, or conferences and would subsequently engage them in dialogues, often sustained over long periods. Eventually, I found four advisers (Stanislav Grof, Hazel Henderson, Margaret Lock, and Carl Simonton) who would formally help me with the book, writing position papers for me about psychology, economics, and medicine, which I then wove into various chapters of _The Turning Point_.[^1]

As I discussed the paradigm shift in various fields with numerous experts, I found that many of them were very frustrated. They were academics who either had dropped out or were thinking of dropping out of the academic world because they found it too restrictive for the new vision of the world they were pursuing. So I decided around the mid-1980s to gather some of these people, who had become friends, and to found an alternative institute with them. I called it the Elmwood Institute after the neighborhood in Berkeley where I lived at the time, and we referred to it as an ecological “think-and-do tank.”

I financed the enterprise initially with royalties for my first two books, and during the subsequent ten years, we built a global network of thinkers and activists. We organized numerous symposia, lectures, and public dialogues, applying the systemic and ecological perspective to a broad range of issues—from peace and nonviolence to anti-nuclear activism, health and healing, Green politics, environmental education, systemic and ecological management, and many more. Thus, from 1984 to 1994, I did very little theoretical research (except for my part-time physics research in Chew’s theory group until 1988) but worked mainly as an environmental educator and activist. The essays in this and the following chapter reflect my work during that period.

As I explored various social and political implications of the systems view of life, I became keenly aware of the fact that the major problems of our time are systemic problems—all interconnected and interdependent—and that systems thinking is therefore critical to address them successfully. In fact, I came to realize that all these problems must be seen as just different facets of a single crisis that, ultimately, is a crisis of perception. This insight would become central to my applications of systems thinking to environmental, social, and political issues during the subsequent three decades.

The systemic nature of our global problems is the main theme of the two essays in this chapter. My analysis in essay 13]] is based on the annual reports _State of the World_ by the Worldwatch Institute, which have been a major source of data for me ever since their first publication in the mid-1980s.[^2] (See also my homage to Lester Brown, founder of the Worldwatch Institute, in chapter 9]].)

I begin the essay by stating my thesis about the systemic nature of the major problems of our time and the fact that taken together, they constitute a crisis of perception. I then summarize the characteristics of the emerging new paradigm in terms of systems thinking and the values of deep ecology. To illustrate the power of systems thinking, I offer an analysis of the similarities between the mechanistic and systemic views of health and peace, two important areas of my activist work in the 1980s.

Returning to the essay’s main theme, I argue that the real issues of our time are excluded from the political dialogue because most of our political leaders are not capable of the systemic and ecological thinking required for understanding and solving them. I end the essay on a highly optimistic note with an homage to the “new thinking” of Mikhail Gorbachev and my hopes for an imminent expansion of the political dialogue.

Essay 14]] continues the theme of essay 13]], but this time addressed specifically to the business community. I assert that in the 1990s, concern about the environment can no longer be seen as one of many “single issues,” but will be the _context_ of everything else—our lives, our businesses, our politics. The essay includes a conceptual map of the interdependence of world problems, which I designed based on the report _State of the World: 1988_.[^3] This map includes my first reference to the causes and consequences of climate change.

After discussing the systemic nature of our global problems and the need for corresponding systemic solutions, I concentrate on the urgent need of rejecting the ideology of economic growth, which I see as the driving force of most of those systemic problems. I explain, however, that this does not mean rejecting all growth, and I advocate a shift from quantitative to qualitative growth. I would elaborate this point 20 years later in a substantial paper, coauthored with Hazel Henderson, titled “Qualitative Growth.”[^4]

I end the essay with a brief discussion of systemic and ecologically conscious management, which was an important theme in my work during the late 1980s and through the 1990s.

ESSAY 13|Why Are the Real Issues of Our Time Excluded from the Political Dialogue?

1989

WHY ARE THE real issues of our time excluded from the political dialogue? By “the real issues of our time” I mean the major problems that threaten our well-being and survival, and even more so the well-being and survival of future generations. We have ample documentation about the extent and significance of these problems. One of the best sources is the series of annual reports, _State of the World_, published by the Worldwatch Institute.[^1]

There are three major problem areas: the arms race and the threat of nuclear war, the devastation of the natural environment, and the persistence of poverty, side by side with progress, even in the richest countries, but especially in the Third World. Each of these problem areas comprises many issues—world population growth, deforestation, the greenhouse warming, depletion of the ozone layer, pollution and contamination of air, soil, and water, and so on. Of all these issues, I would say, only the arms race and the threat of nuclear war have become part of the political dialogue in a serious way.

Why not the other problems? Why did our last two presidential candidates never talk about preserving the rainforest, curbing population growth, protecting the ozone layer, preventing the greenhouse effect, or saving the lives of millions of children in the Third World? I believe that there are two reasons why these issues have been excluded from the political dialogue and will remain excluded until we introduce them ourselves through our grass-roots political movements. One of the reasons concerns concepts, the other concerns values. Both of them are closely connected. This is the subject I would like to explore.

The more we study the major problems of our time, the more we come to realize that none of them can be understood in isolation. They are all interconnected and interdependent. Stabilizing world population will only be possible when poverty is reduced worldwide. The massive extinction of animal and plant species will continue as long as the Third World is burdened by massive debts. The resources required to arrest the destruction of our biosphere will not be available unless the international arms race can be stopped.

The connections between some of these problems are obvious; others are not so easy to see. I recently took the _State of the World 1988_ report and actually wrote down all the major problems mentioned in it on a large sheet. Then, connecting them along the lines suggested in the report, I ended up with a multiply interconnected conceptual map (see p. 143]]). This was a very enlightening exercise, which I highly recommend.

#### **Crisis of Perception**

What you can learn from such a study is that the major problems of our time are systemic, as we say in science—problems that are interrelated and interdependent. In fact, the more you study the situation, the more you realize that these problems are just different facets of one single crisis, essentially a crisis of perception. It derives from the fact that most of us, and especially our large social institutions, subscribe to the concepts of an outdated worldview, a perception of reality inadequate for dealing with our overpopulated, globally interconnected world.

At the same time, researchers at the leading edge of science, various social movements, and numerous alternative networks are developing a new vision of reality that will form the basis of our future technologies, economic systems, and social institutions. I can say that with great confidence, because either our future technologies and social institutions will be based on this new vision, or there will be no future for humanity.

We are at the beginning of a fundamental change of worldview in science and society, a change of paradigms that amounts to a profound cultural transformation. But this realization has not yet dawned on our political leaders. The recognition that a profound change of perception and thinking is needed if we are to survive has not yet reached our corporate leaders either, nor the representatives of our large universities. In fact, their resistance to change almost looks like a conspiracy.

The technologies and business practices of the corporate community, which are generally unhealthy if not downright destructive, are firmly supported by the scientific establishment—the scientific advisers to our governments, the grant-giving foundations, and so on. The reason for this massive support of dangerous and harmful activities, however, is not a conspiracy. It comes from the fact that the judgments and activities of the corporate and academic communities, as well as those of our political leaders, are based on the same outdate worldview. Our major social institutions are tied to the same outdated perceptions whose limitations are now producing the multiple facets of our global crisis.

These views and perceptions form the so-called old paradigm, which has dominated our culture for several hundred years, during which time it has shaped our modern Western society and significantly influenced the rest of the world. This paradigm consists of a number of ideas, among them the view of the universe as a mechanical system composed of elementary building blocks (the influence of Cartesian philosophy and Newtonian science); correspondingly, the view of the human body as a machine, which is still the conceptual basis of the theory and practice of our medical science; the view of life in a society as a competitive struggle for existence (inherited from the Social Darwinists); and the belief in unlimited material progress to be achieved through economic and technological growth. During recent decades, all of these assumptions have been found severely limited and in need of radical revision. Such a revision is now indeed taking place.

#### **The New Paradigm**

The emerging new paradigm can be described in various ways. It may be called a holistic worldview, emphasizing the whole rather than the parts. It may also be called an ecological view, using the term _ecological_ in the sense of “deep ecology.” The distinction between “shallow” and “deep” ecology was made in the early seventies by the philosopher Arne Naess and is now widely accepted as a useful terminology for referring to a major division within contemporary environmental thought.[^2]

Shallow ecology is anthropocentric. It views humans as above or outside of nature, as the source of all value, and ascribes only instrumental or use-value to nature. Deep ecology does not separate humans, or anything else, from the natural environment. It does not see the world as a collection of isolated objects but rather as a network of phenomena fundamentally interconnected and interdependent. Deep ecology recognizes the intrinsic values of all living beings and views humans as just one particular strand in the web of life.

Ultimately, deep ecological awareness is spiritual or religious awareness. When the concept of the human spirit is understood as the mode of consciousness in which the individual feels connected to the cosmos as a whole, it becomes clear that ecological awareness is spiritual in its deepest essence. It is therefore not surprising that the emerging new vision of reality, based on deep ecological awareness, is consistent with the so-called perennial philosophy of spiritual traditions: with that of Eastern spiritual traditions, the spirituality of Christian mystics, or with the philosophy and cosmology underlying the Native American traditions.

In science, the theory of living systems, which originated in cybernetics in the 1940s but emerged fully only during the last ten years or so, provides the most appropriate scientific formulation of the new ecological paradigm.

The systems approach looks at the world in terms of relationships and integration. Systems are integrated wholes whose properties cannot be reduced to those of smaller units. Examples of systems abound in nature. Every organism—from the smallest bacterium through the wide range of plants and animals to humans—is an integrated whole and thus a living system. Cells are living systems, and so are the various tissues and organs of the body, the human brain being the most complex example. But systems are not confined to individual organisms and their parts. The same aspects of wholeness are exhibited by social systems, such as a family or a community, and by ecosystems, which consist of a variety of organisms and inanimate matter in mutual interaction.

All these natural systems are wholes whose specific structures arise from the interactions and interdependence of their parts. Systemic properties are destroyed when a system is dissected, either physically or theoretically, into isolated elements. Although we can discern individual parts in any system, the nature of the whole is always different from the mere sum of its parts. Accordingly, the systems approach does not concentrate on basic building blocks but rather on basic principles of organization.

Within this framework, the question “What is life?” can be rephrased as “What are the principles of organization of living systems?” What is so exciting about this new theory is that it provides the outlines of an answer to this age-old question, an answer that for the first time in modern science presents a unified view of life, mind, and matter. It would take me too long to go into this theory of living systems now, but I can recommend _The Tree of Knowledge_, a book by Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela, two of the principal scholars who contributed to this theory.[^3]

The systemic or ecological way of thinking has many important implications, not only for science and philosophy but also for society and our daily lives. Because living systems span such a wide range of phenomena, involving individual organisms, social systems, and ecosystems, systems theory provides the ideal language for unifying many fields of study that have become isolated and fragmented. It is one of the great advantages of the systems approach that the same concepts can be applied at different systems levels, which often leads to important insights. Let me illustrate that with an example.

#### **The Systems View of Health and Peace**

I want to compare the state of health of a human individual to the state of peace of a nation, and in both cases, I want to contrast the mechanistic, old-paradigm view with the systemic, new-paradigm view.

The mechanistic view of health dominates our medical institutions, and the mechanistic view of peace dominates the thinking of most of our politicians and the military. Medical scientists define health as the absence of disease, and disease is seen as the malfunctioning of biological mechanisms. The doctor’s role is to intervene, using medical technology, to correct the malfunctioning of a specific mechanism.

Similarly, military strategists define peace as the absence of war, and the engineering approach to health has its counterpart in an engineering approach to peace. Politicians and military men tend to perceive all problems of defense as problems of technology. The idea that social and psychological considerations could also be relevant is mostly not entertained.

In contemporary health care the human organism is generally dissociated from the natural and social environment, and the large network of phenomena that influence health is reduced to its physiological and biochemical aspects. In very similar ways, the conventional approach to defense reduces the large network of phenomena that influence peace to its strategic and technological aspects.

Those aspects are further reduced as politicians and the military continue to talk about “national” security without recognizing the dangerous fallacy of this simplistic and fragmented notion. They still seem to think that we can increase our own security by making others feel insecure. Since today’s nuclear weapons threaten to extinguish life on the entire planet, the new thinking about peace must necessarily be global. In the nuclear age, the entire concept of national security has become outdated. There can only be global security.

In conventional medical thinking, treatment involves technological intervention. The self-organizing and self-healing potential of the patient is not taken into account. Similarly, conventional military thinking holds that conflicts are best resolved by technological intervention. The self-organizing potential of people, communities, and nations is not taken into account.

Finally, in both areas, the mechanistic views are perpetuated not only by scientists, politicians, and generals, but also—and perhaps even more forcefully—by the pharmaceutical and military industries, which have invested heavily in the old paradigm and strongly resist change.

Nevertheless, the shift from the mechanistic to the systemic view is now occurring for both health and peace. Scientists, philosophers, and various health professionals are developing a systems view of health, while military strategists (most of them, unfortunately, retired) and politicians (primarily in the European Green parties) are developing a corresponding systems view of peace.

At the core of the systems view of health lies the notion of dynamic balance. Health is an experience of well-being resulting from a dynamic balance that involves physical and psychological aspects of the organism and its interactions with its natural and social environment. The natural balance of living organisms includes, in particular, the balance between their self-assertive and integrative tendencies. To be healthy, an organism must preserve its individual autonomy, but at the same time, it must be able to integrate itself harmoniously into larger systems.

Similarly, the health and dynamic balance of social systems is a necessary condition for true peace. To be in such a peaceful state, a social group or nation must preserve its autonomy and, at the same time, be able to integrate itself harmoniously into the larger national or global community.

Imbalance manifests itself as stress, and as we know, excessive stress is harmful and often leads to illness. Social imbalance manifests itself as conflict, and excessive conflict is harmful and likely to lead to violence and war.

From the systems point of view, effective health care consists largely in finding healthy ways of managing stress. This means restoring and maintaining the dynamic balance of individuals and social groups by recognizing the web of interrelated patterns that lead to ill health and changing them in such a way that the stress is minimized. Such an approach may involve a whole range of therapies.

A systemic approach to peace consists in finding nonviolent forms of conflict resolution. This means, first of all, developing a systemic view of the network of economic, social, and political patterns out of which conflicts arise. Once these patterns have been understood, a wide range of methods may be used to resolve the conflicts.

#### **Sustainable Solutions**

Let me now return to my initial question, “Why are the real issues of our time excluded from the political dialogue?” The point I have tried to make so far is that these issues—the major problems of today—are global, systemic problems that require a systemic approach to be understood and solved. They are excluded from the political dialogue because most of our political leaders are not capable of this kind of global, systemic, and ecological thinking. Confined by the narrow vision of the old paradigm, they follow the fragmented approach that has become so characteristic of our academic disciplines and government agencies. Such an approach can never resolve any of the problems but merely shifts them around in a complex web of social and ecological relations. One year it’s inflation, then it’s drugs and crime, then Love Canal, then the greenhouse effect—but it’s really always the same problem in different guises, the same crisis of perception.

It is also important to realize that the narrow perspective of the old paradigm concerns both space and time. Not only do our politicians and corporate leaders fail to see how different problems are interrelated, they also fail to consider how their so-called solutions affect future generations. They fail to see, for example, that our prosperity, praised so excessively by Reagan and Bush, is false, because it is based on borrowing from the future—in terms of money and in terms of nonrenewable resources.

From the systemic, ecological point of view, the only solutions that are viable are sustainable solutions. This concept of sustainability—as in “sustainable agriculture,” “sustainable economics,” and so on—has become a key concept in the environmental movement and is indeed a crucial criterion. What does it mean? Lester Brown, in _State of the World: 1988_, gives a simple, clear, and beautiful definition: “A sustainable society is one that satisfies its needs without diminishing the prospects of future generations.”[^4]

So far, I have emphasized perceptions and thinking. If that were the whole problem, the paradigm shift would be much easier. There are enough brilliant thinkers among the proponents of the new paradigm who could convince our political and corporate leaders of the merits of systemic thinking. However, the shift of paradigms requires not only an expansion not only of our perceptions and ways of thinking but also of our values.

Here it is interesting to note a striking connection between these changes of thinking and of values. Both of them may be seen as shifts from self-assertion to integration. I mentioned before that the self-assertive and integrative tendencies are both essential aspects of all living systems. Neither of them is intrinsically good or bad. What is good, or healthy, is a dynamic balance. What is bad, or unhealthy, is imbalance—overemphasis of one tendency and neglect of the other. In the old paradigm, we have been overemphasizing the self-assertive values and ways of thinking and have neglected their integrative counterparts. What I am suggesting is not to replace one mode with the other but rather to establish a better balance between the two.

With that in mind, let us look at the various manifestations of the shift from self-assertion to integration. As far as thinking is concerned, we are talking about a shift from the rational to the intuitive, from analysis to synthesis, from reductionism to holism, from linear to nonlinear thinking. As far as values are concerned, we are observing a corresponding shift from competition to cooperation, from expansion to conservation, from quantity to quality, from domination to partnership.

You may have noticed that the self-assertive values—competition, expansion, domination—are generally associated with men. Indeed, in a patriarchal society, they are not only favored but are given economic rewards and political power. This is one of the reasons why the shift to a more balanced value system is difficult for most people, and especially for most men.

Power, in the sense of domination over otters, is excessive self-assertion. The social structure in which it is exerted most effectively is the hierarchy. Indeed, our political, military, and corporate structures are hierarchically ordered, with men occupying the upper levels and women the lower levels. Most of these men, and also quite a few women, have come to see their position in the hierarchy as part of their identity, and thus the shift to a different system of values generates existential fear in them.

However, there is also another kind of power, which is more appropriate for the new paradigm—power as influence on others. The ideal structure for exerting this kind of power is not the hierarchy but the network, which is also one of the central metaphors of systemic thinking. Thus, the paradigm shift includes a shift in social organization from hierarchies to networks.

#### **Mikhail Gorbachev’s “New Thinking”**

The new values, together with new attitudes and lifestyles, are now being promoted by a large number of grassroots movements: the ecology movement, the peace movement, the feminist movement, the holistic-health and human-potential movements, numerous citizens’ movements and initiatives, Third World and ethnic liberation movements, and many others. During the sixties and seventies, these movements operated separately, for the most part, without realizing how their purposes interrelated. But since the beginning of the eighties, the various movements have begun to coalesce, recognizing that they represent merely different facets of the same new vision of reality, and thus forming a powerful force of social transformation. The political success of the European Green movement is the most impressive example of that process of coalescence.

During the past two years, this new social force, which in my book _The Turning Point_ I called the “rising culture,” has received help from an unexpected quarter. Of all the nations in the world, one would have thought that the Soviet Union, with its rigid political hierarchy, its authoritarian regime, and its lack of many human rights, would be the last to embrace the new paradigm. Yet in Mikhail Gorbachev, we now have a world leader who is aware of the current shift of thinking and of values and who tries to implement it both nationally and internationally.

To show you to what extent Gorbachev’s thinking—the “new thinking,” as he calls it—is of the kind I have presented to you, let me quote a few passages from his recent speech to the United Nations.

It would be naïve to think that the problems plaguing mankind today can be solved with means and methods which were applied or seemed to work in the past. . . . [New] realities are changing the entire world situation. . . . Some of the past differences and disputes are losing their importance. . . . Life is making us abandon outdated views. . . . This is one of the signs of the crucial nature of the current phase in history.

[We are witnessing] the process of the emergence of a mutually interrelated and integral world. . . . Efforts to solve global problems require a new scope and quality of interaction of states.

The use or threat of force can no longer and must no longer be an instrument of foreign policy. This is the first and most important component of a non-violent world as an ideal. . . . We are speaking of cooperation, which could be more accurately termed co-creation and co-development. . . . We must build a new world—and we must do it together.[^5]

These are not quotations taken out of context. You can read Gorbachev’s other speeches and his book, _Perestroika_, and you will find in them the same global, systemic view of reality, the same dramatic shift of values.[^6]

I feel that because of this unexpected development in the Soviet Union, we can now be much more optimistic, even though awareness of the emergence of a new paradigm has not yet reached the other world leaders. Gorbachev and the European and American peace movement together forced Reagan to negotiate seriously and to sign the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. If Gorbachev continues to introduce new-paradigm thinking and values from the top and we continue to introduce them from the grassroots level, we can indeed expand the political dialogue to include the real issues of our time.

ESSAY 14|The Challenge of the Nineties

1990

THERE IS WIDESPREAD agreement today that the ’90s will be a critical decade. The survival of humanity and the survival of the planet are at stake. The ’90s will be the decade of the environment, not because we say so but because of events almost beyond our control. Concern with the environment is no longer one of many “single issues”; it is the _context_ of everything else—our lives, our businesses, our politics.

Today we face a series of problems that are harming human life and the biosphere in alarming ways that may soon become irreversible. We have ample documentation about the extent and significance of those problems. One of the best sources is the series of annual reports, _State of the World_, published by the Worldwatch Institute.[^1]

In assessing the environmental health of the planet, these reports have observed the same alarming trends year after year. The Earth’s forests recede while its deserts expand. Topsoil on our croplands diminishes, and the ozone layer, which protects us from harmful ultraviolet radiation, is depleted. Concentrations of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere rise while the number of plant and animal species shrink. World population continues to grow while the gap between rich and poor widens.

The more we study these critical problems, the more we come to realize that none of them can be understood in isolation. They are _systemic_ problems—all interconnected and interdependent (see chart below). Stabilizing world population will only be possible when poverty is reduced worldwide. The extinction of animal and plant species on a massive scale will continue as long as the Third World is burdened by massive debts. And only if we stop the international arms race will we have the resources to prevent the many destructive effects on the biosphere and on human life.

Ultimately, these problems must be seen as different facets of one single crisis, a crisis of perception—for only if we _perceive_ the world differently will we be able to act differently. We need a shift of perception, a radical change in our worldview and value system. Indeed, such a shift is now occurring.

The old perceptions, which have shaped modern Western society and have significantly influenced the rest of the world, include the view of the universe as a mechanical system composed of separate building blocks, the view of the human body as a machine, the view of life in a society as a competitive struggle for existence, and the belief in unlimited material progress to be achieved through economic and technological growth.

A radical revision of all these assumptions is now taking place, at the forefront of both science and society. The emerging worldview may be called a holistic view, seeing the world as an integrated whole rather than a disassociated collection of parts. It may also be called an ecological view—using the term in a much broader and deeper sense than usual—because deep ecological awareness is the understanding of _the fundamental interdependence of all phenomena_: the awareness that as individuals and as societies, we are embedded in the cyclical processes of nature.

In science, the theory of living systems, which originated in cybernetics in the 1940s and emerged fully only during the last 10 years or so, provides the most appropriate scientific formulation of the new ecological vision of reality.

Systems are integrated wholes whose properties cannot be reduced to those of smaller units. The systems approach sees the world in terms of relationships and integration. Examples of systems abound in nature. Every organism—from the smallest bacterium through plants and animals to humans—is an integrated whole and, thus, a living system. Cells are living systems, and so are the various tissues and organs of the body, the human brain being the most complex example.

But systems are not confined to individual organisms and their parts. The same aspects of wholeness are exhibited by social systems—such as a family or a community—and by ecosystems, which consist of a variety of organisms and inanimate matter in mutual interaction.

Systemic properties are destroyed when a system is dissected, either physically or theoretically, into isolated elements. Although we can discern individual parts in any system, the nature of the whole is always different from the mere sum of its parts. Accordingly, the systems approach does not concentrate on basic building blocks but rather on basic principles of _organization_.

So an essential aspect of the current change of worldviews is the shift of perception from the world as a series of building blocks, or discrete components, to the world as a living system. This change concerns our perception of nature, of the human organism, of society, and also our perception of a business organization.

Companies are also living systems that cannot be comprehended from an economic point of view alone. As a living system, a company has a certain degree of autonomy. Managers who think and act “systemically” recognize the company’s own logic and emotionality and try to influence the system rather than attempt to control it. Such a style of leadership is perhaps the most distinctive feature of a new approach to management, which is often called systemic management in European management schools and consulting groups. Systemically oriented managers no longer see themselves as dominators and controllers within the company, but rather as cultivators or catalysts. Being aware of the company as a living, relatively autonomous system, they give _impulses_ rather than instructions.

This change of attitude _from control to partnership_ is characteristic of a profound change of values that is implicit in the shift from the mechanistic to the ecological worldview. Whereas a machine is properly comprehended through domination and control, the understanding of a living system will be much more successful if approached through cooperation and partnership. Cooperative relationships are an essential characteristic of the web of life.

The shift of emphasis from domination to partnership is connected with other value shifts—from competition to cooperation, from expansion to conservation, from quantity to quality. As far as business organizations are concerned, the most important example of this shift is the shift from economic growth to ecological sustainability.

Unrestricted growth is the main driving force of today’s economic policies and, tragically, of global environmental destruction. Rejecting the ideology of economic growth does not mean rejecting all growth. Growth, of course, is characteristic of all life. However, in the living world, it has not only a quantitative but also a qualitative meaning. For a human being, for example, to grow means to develop to maturity, not only by getting bigger, but also qualitatively through inner growth. The same is true for all living systems.

The task, then, will be to establish criteria that determine when an enterprise should grow and when it shouldn’t. This is where _sustainability_ has emerged as a key concept of ecological thinking and of ecologically conscious business practices. What does it mean? Lester Brown of the Worldwatch Institute has given a simple and clear definition: “A sustainable society is one that satisfies its needs without diminishing the prospects of future generations.”[^2]

This, in a nutshell, is the challenge of the ’90s: to create social and cultural environments in which we can satisfy our needs without diminishing the opportunities and options of future generations to satisfy _their_ needs. And this is also the challenge of ecologically conscious management: to modify corporate growth by introducing sustainability as a key criterion for all business activities.

To bring about these radical shifts in our thinking and our values—at a time when it is almost too late—we need dialogue, discussion, and a massive campaign of public education. These are the missions of the Elmwood Institute, an intellectual think tank dedicated to fostering new concepts and values for a sustainable future.

Elmwood’s newest project, _Global File_, is designed to educate the corporate community. It consists of a series of reports on successful ecological practices in business and government worldwide. The most recent—and most substantial—report in this series is _EcoManagement: The Elmwood Guide to Ecological Auditing and Sustainable Business_.[^3]

This 130-page book is a conceptual guide that maps the cultural framework and sets standards for eco-auditing. An eco-audit, as understood by Elmwood, is an examination and review of a company’s operations from the perspective of deep ecology. It is motivated by a shift of values in the corporate culture from management by domination to partnership and teamwork, from the ideology of economic growth to that of ecological sustainability. It involves a corresponding shift from mechanistic to systemic thinking and, accordingly, a new style of management known as systemic management. The result is an action plan for minimizing a company’s environmental impact and making all its operations ecologically sound.

The practices of eco-auditing and of ecologically conscious management are essential tools for business to meet the challenge of the ’90s if we are to create and sustain social and cultural environments in which we can satisfy our personal and professional needs without diminishing the options of future generations. I hope that, brought together in a deeper understanding of the interdependence of all things, we can—and will—make the changes that are now so crucial to the well-being of ourselves and the planet.

## Ecological Literacy

EDUCATION BECAME A major focus of the Elmwood Institute during the early 1990s. Our basic premise was that sustainable communities need to be designed in such a way that their ways of life do not interfere with nature’s inherent ability to sustain life, and that, to do so, we need to first become “ecologically literate,” understanding the basic principles of ecology. This, in turn, requires thinking in terms of patterns and relationships—in other words, systems thinking.

In 1994, we transformed the Elmwood Institute into a new organization, the Center for Ecoliteracy, dedicated exclusively to promoting ecological literacy and systems thinking in primary and secondary education.[^1] The essays in this chapter are based on my workshops and discussions about ecological literacy with teachers and school administrators during the years 1994–1997.

In 1993, I participated in a conference of environmental activists in Washington, DC, at which some of my friends challenged me to define the basic principles of ecology. During the subsequent discussion, it became evident that no clear enumeration of basic principles, or fundamental concepts, of ecology existed. Over the next few months, I discussed the issue with several leading ecologists. The result was essay 15]], which I disseminated widely but did not publish. During the subsequent years, the principles of ecology became a major teaching tool at the Center for Ecoliteracy. Their number and names changed several times. To teach them in schools, we eventually found it useful to narrow them down to six fundamental ecological concepts: networks, nested systems, cycles, flows, development, and dynamic balance.

Essay 16]] is based on a series of workshops I gave for the faculty and administrators of the Mill Valley School District (a city near San Francisco). The style of this essay is somewhat different from the others, as I have tried to keep the colloquial and informal tone characteristic of my workshops with teachers during weekend retreats.

In the essay, I define the principles of ecology as basic patterns of organization that ecosystems have evolved to sustain the web of life. I emphasize that they can also be seen as principles of community, because ecosystems are sustainable communities of plants, animals, and microorganisms. I also emphasize that understanding these patterns of organization requires a new way of thinking known as systems thinking—thinking in terms of relationships, patterns, and context.

In the main body of the essay I discuss ten basic ecological concepts (the “principles of ecology”): interdependence, networks, nesting systems, self-organization, and so on. I present them as merely different aspects of one and the same pattern of organization—the basic pattern of life.

Essay 17]] is based on a talk I gave at an educational conference, A Garden in Every School, organized by the Center for Ecoliteracy. I introduce three principles of ecology—the web of life, the flow of energy, and the cycles of nature—as essential characteristics of the new systemic understanding of life. I then illustrate how these principles can be experienced by children in a school garden. I conclude that learning in the school garden is beneficial for the development of the individual student and the school community and is one of the best ways for children to become ecologically literate and thus able to contribute to building a sustainable future. I know from my own experience of having grown up on a farm that such a direct experience of nature will stay with those students for the rest of their lives.

ESSAY 15|The Principles of Ecology

1994

ECOLOGY—FROM THE GREEK _oikos_, “household”—is the study of how the Earth Household works. More precisely, it is the study of the relationships that interlink all members of the Earth Household. As John Muir put it, “When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the universe.”[^1] Ecology, then, is the study of the “connectedness of things,” of interrelatedness.

The most appropriate theoretical framework for ecology is the theory of living systems. Living systems are integrated wholes whose properties cannot be reduced to those of smaller parts. Although we can distinguish parts in any living system, the nature of the whole is always different from the mere sum of its parts.

Every organism—animal, plant, microorganism, or human being—is an integrated whole, a living system. Parts of organisms—for example, leaves or cells—are again living systems. Throughout the living world, we find living systems nesting within other living systems.

Living systems include more than individual organisms and their parts. They include social systems—for example, a family or a community—and also ecosystems, which consist of a great variety of organisms and inanimate matter in mutual interaction. All these living systems are integral wholes, and systems theory tells us that they all exhibit the same basic principles of organization. Those are the principles of ecology we shall explore here.

Most organisms are not only embedded in ecosystems but are complex ecosystems themselves, containing a host of smaller organisms that have considerable autonomy and yet are integrated harmoniously into the functioning of the whole.

The most complex ecosystems on Earth are the tropical coral reef and the tropical rainforest. Both are characterized by large numbers of species, a rapid turnover of matter and energy, and extensive recycling of all essential materials. In both of these ecosystems, the principles of ecology are exhibited clearly and beautifully.

#### **Principle 1: Interdependence**

All members of an ecosystem are interconnected in a web of relationships, in which all life processes depend on one another.

An ecosystem is a dynamic, integrated web of living and nonliving forms (chemical elements, minerals, etc.). All members of the ecosystem community are interconnected in this vast and intricate network of relationships, the web of life. They derive their essential properties from their relationships to other things and, in fact, could not exist apart from those relationships. What is preserved in a wilderness area is not individual trees or organisms but the complex web of relationships between them.

Interdependence—the reciprocal dependence of one life process on another—defines the nature of the relationships among the individual members of an ecosystem, and between each member and the whole system. The behavior of every living member of the ecosystem depends on the behavior of many others. The success of the whole system depends on the success of its individual members, while the success of each member depends upon the success of the system as a whole.

#### **Principle 2: Sustainability**

The long-term survival (sustainability) of each species in an ecosystem depends on a limited resource base.

Living systems are open systems, which means that they have to maintain a continuous exchange of energy and matter with their environment to stay alive. Each member of the ecosystem community, therefore, depends on a resource base for its survival.

We sometimes speak of “food chains,” as if each species only fed on one other, but in fact, living organisms generally feed on a variety of species, and thus the food chains become interlinked in a complex food web.

The resource bases in an ecosystem are always finite, even though the system is open with respect to energy. The concept of carrying capacity is used on ecology to characterize the limits of an ecosystem prescribed by the limits of its resources. For each species, the ecosystem’s carrying capacity is the maximum number of individuals of that species that can be sustained for an indefinite period of time by the system’s resources.

In a balanced ecosystem, each population of organisms undergoes periodic fluctuations around the optimal size at which its patterns of material consumption are sustainable; that is, its resource base is maintained. The sustainability of individual populations and the sustainability of the entire ecosystem are interdependent.

Because of a series of alarming global environmental problems that threaten the survival of humanity and the planet, sustainability must become a critical principle of ecology for all human societies. A sustainable society is one that is able to satisfy its needs while maintaining its natural resources and life support systems. In the words of Lester Brown, “Sustainable societies satisfy their needs without diminishing the chances of future generations.”[^2]

#### **Principle 3: Ecological Cycles**

The interdependencies among the members of an ecosystem involve the exchange of matter and energy in continual cycles.

Like all living systems, ecosystems are self-generating and self-regulating systems in which animals, plants, microorganisms, and inanimate substances are interlinked in a complex web of interdependencies involving the exchange of energy and matter in continual cycles (e.g., water cycle, nitrogen and other nutrient cycles). Most ecosystems are so complex that the cycles are not simply circular paths but contain many branches that interlink in a network of interactions.

The communities of organisms in an ecosystem have evolved over billions of years, continually using and recycling the same molecules of minerals, water, and air. And this continual recycling of components takes place not only in the ecosystem as a whole but also in each individual organism. A living organism is primarily engaged in renewing itself, cells continuously breaking down and building up their structures, tissues and organs replacing their cells in continual cycles. While these continual structural changes take place, however, the organism maintains its identity and overall pattern of organization. This coexistence of stability and change is one of the hallmarks of life.

All ecological processes are fundamentally nonlinear. Linear cause-and-effect relationships exist only very rarely in ecosystems. Thus, any serious disturbance will not be limited to a single effect but is likely to spread out through the ecosystem in ever widening patterns. It may even be amplified by interdependent feedback loops, which may completely obscure the original source of the disturbance.

#### **Principle 4: Energy Flow**

Solar energy, transformed into chemical energy by the photosynthesis of green plants, drives all ecological cycles.

All living organisms in an ecosystem need complex organic substances—proteins, carbohydrates, fats, etc. These are produced by green plants from water and minerals, and taken up by the animals feeding on the plants. Microorganisms reduce the animals’ organic waste to inorganic substances, which eventually end up as minerals to be taken up again by plants.

Solar energy drives these basic ecological cycles, and green pants play a vital role in the flow of energy. They take in water and mineral salts from the earth, and these juices rise up to the leaves where they combine with carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air to form sugar and other organic compounds. In this marvelous process, known as photosynthesis, solar energy is converted into chemical energy and bound in the organic substances, while oxygen (O2) is released into the air. The whole CO2–O2 cycle is a kind of breathing process.

#### **Principle 5: Partnership**

All living members of an ecosystem are engaged in a subtle interplay of competition and cooperation involving countless forms of partnership.

Because of the finiteness of the ecosystem’s resources there is competition at all levels. But this competition takes place within a larger framework of cooperation and partnership. The fundamental interdependence of animals, plants, and microorganisms and their cyclical exchanges of energy and matter are sustained by pervasive cooperation. Even predatory-prey relationships that are destructive for the individual prey are generally beneficial for both species. Partnership—the tendency to associate, establish links, live inside one another, and cooperate—is an essential characteristic of living organisms.

The widespread phenomenon of symbiosis is the most highly developed form of partnership in ecosystems. It involves two or more different species in such intimate biological association that they are often mistaken for a single organism. Symbiotic relationships are mutually beneficial to associated partners and they involve animals, plants, and microorganisms in almost every imaginable combination. Many of these have formed their union in the distant past and evolved toward ever greater interdependence and exquisite adaptation to one another.

Bacteria frequently live in symbiosis with other organisms in a way that makes both their own lives and the lives of their hosts dependent on the symbiotic relationship. Soil bacteria, for example, alter the configurations of organic molecules so that they become usable for the energy needs of plants. To do so, the bacteria incorporate themselves so intimately into the roots of the plants that they seem part of these roots.

At an even smaller scale, symbiosis takes place within the cells of all higher organisms and is crucial to the organization of cellular activities. For example, the chloroplasts of green plants, which contain the chlorophyll and the apparatus for photosynthesis, are autonomous self-replacing inhabitants in the plants’ cells.

#### **Principle 6: Fluctuating Flexibility**

Ecological cycles have the tendency to maintain themselves in a flexible state characterized by interdependent fluctuations of their variables.

When changing environmental conditions—for example, an unusually warm summer—disturb one link in an ecological cycle, the entire cycle acts as a self-regulating feedback loop and soon brings the situation back into balance. Since these environmental disturbances happen all the time, the population densities and other variables in an ecological cycle undergo continual interdependent fluctuations. These fluctuations represent the ecosystem’s flexible response to external changes.

All ecological fluctuations take place between tolerance limits. There is always the danger that the whole system will collapse when a fluctuation goes beyond those limits and the system can no longer compensate for it. In such cases, exponential “runaways” will start to appear. Some plants may turn into “weeds” and some animals into “pests,” and other species may be exterminated.

Old ecosystems like the tropical rainforest are especially prone to upsets of this kind because most of their nutrients are fixed in organisms; there are hardly any reserves left in the soil. Thus clear-cutting or fire are likely to cause irreversible damage. These old ecosystems have not evolved to cope with such disruptions, unlike, for example, mixed forests and grassland communities, which are often subjected to fires caused by lightening.

#### **Principle 7: Diversity**

The stability of an ecosystem depends on the degree of complexity of its network of relationships, in other words, on the diversity of the ecosystem.

In a highly diverse ecosystem, many species with overlapping ecological functions coexist and can partially replace and shelter one another. The more diverse the system, the more alternative relationships are available when any particular link in the network breaks down.

#### **Principle 8: Coevolution**

Most species in an ecosystem coevolve through an interplay of creation and mutual adaptation

Living systems display not only the striking phenomenon of self-renewal—the ability to continuously renew and recycle their components while maintaining their overall integrity—but also the equally striking phenomenon of self-transcendence, the ability to reach out creatively and form new structures and new patterns of behavior. This creative reaching out into novelty, a fundamental property of life, manifests itself in the processes of learning, development, and evolution.

In an ecosystem, evolution is not limited to the gradual adaptation of organisms to their environment, because the environment is itself a network of living systems capable of adaptation and creativity. So which adapts to which? Each adapts to the other—they coevolve. Thus evolution—the unfolding of life forms of ever increasing complexity—proceeds through an interplay of creation and mutual adaptation. Coevolution is an ongoing dance, an ongoing conversation.

All forms of life on Earth have coevolved in this way as integral components of ecosystems for billions of years. The ingenuity, efficiency, and durability of these systems are vastly superior to those of human technologies. Thus the profound respect for the wisdom of nature shown by many tribal cultures is totally consistent with the insights of modern ecology.

ESSAY 16|Ecology and Community

1994

I WANT TO discuss here the link between ecology and community and to encourage you to really pay attention to that link, even if it requires time and new ways of thinking, even if it means overcoming obstacles in your community. This is by no means a side issue. It is _the_ critical issue of our time.

The great challenge of our time is to create and nurture sustainable communities, that is, communities that satisfy their needs and aspirations without diminishing the chances of future generations. If we care about the fate of our children and grandchildren and of future generations, this is what we need to do. In our attempts to build sustainable communities, we can learn valuable lessons from nature’s ecosystems, which _are_ sustainable communities—of plants, animals, and microorganisms. In over three billion years of evolution, ecosystems have developed the most intricate and subtle ways of organizing themselves so as to maximize their long-term survival, or sustainability. These are the lessons is we can learn.

To understand these lessons, we must learn the basic principles of ecology—the language of nature. We must become ecologically literate. Once we really understand these principles of ecology—interdependence, diversity, partnership, and so on—we will realize that they can also be called principles of community. In our schools, or learning communities, we can then apply these principles of ecology as principles of education.

The link between ecological communities and human communities exists because both are living systems. The principles of ecology, or principles of community, are nothing but the principles of organization that are common to all living systems. So the parallel between ecosystems and human communities is not just a metaphor. It is a real connection, because both are living systems.

#### **Laws of Sustainability**

There are laws of sustainability that are natural laws, just as the law of gravity is a natural law. In our science in past centuries, we have learned much about the law of gravity and similar laws of physics, but we have not learned much about the laws of sustainability. If you go up to a high cliff and step out over the cliff, disregarding the law of gravity, you will surely die. If we live in a community, disregarding the laws of sustainability, we will just as surely die in the long run as a community. These laws are just as stringent as the laws of physics, but until recently, they have not been studied.

The law of gravity, as you know, was formalized by Galileo and by Newton. Of course, people knew about not stepping off a cliff long before Galileo and Newton. Similarly, people have known about the laws of sustainability, or principles of ecology, long before ecologists in the 20th century began to discover them. In fact, what I’m talking about here is nothing that a 10-year- old Navaho boy, or Hopi girl, who grew up in a traditional Native American community would not understand and know.

#### **Principles of Ecology**

My purpose here is not to enable you to list ten principles of ecology. What I want you to understand is the essence of how ecosystems organize themselves. You can formalize that and abstract certain principles of organization, and you can call those the principles of ecology, but it is not a list of principles that I want you to learn. It is a pattern of organization I want you to understand. And you will see that whenever you formalize it and say, “This is a key principle, and that is a key principle,” you don’t really know where to start, because they all hang together. You have to understand all of them at the same time. So when you teach them in school, you can’t say, “In third grade we do interdependence and then in fourth grade we do cooperation.” One cannot be taught or practiced without the other.

What I’m going to do, then, is to show you in an abstract way how ecosystems organize themselves. I’ll present to you the very essence of their patterns of organization. As I do so, you will discover very soon that to understand these patterns, we need to learn a new way of thinking.

The fundamental change in our way of thinking is a shift of emphasis from the parts to the whole. The emphasis on the parts has been called by various names, the best known being “mechanistic.” This comes, of course, from “machine.” In order to understand a machine, you need to take it apart. But you can’t do this with living systems. If you take a living thing apart, you kill it. So the mechanistic approach is not appropriate for living systems. This approach is also sometimes called reductionist thinking, because one reduces the functioning of the whole to the understanding of its parts.

The emphasis on the whole has been called holistic thinking—from the Greek _holos_, the whole—or organismic thinking, because organisms are one of the main manifestations of living systems. It has also been called ecological thinking, because ecology is the study of the living communities to which this thinking applies.

These are terms that were coined in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Around the 1930s, and from then on, the holistic perspective became known as “systemic” and the way of thinking it implies as “systems thinking.” So before I show you the basic principles of ecology, I would like to talk very briefly about the basic characteristics of systems thinking.

#### **Systems Thinking**

Systems thinking emerged during the first decades of the 20th century simultaneously in several disciplines. It was pioneered by biologists, who emphasized the view of living organisms as integrated wholes whose properties cannot be reduced to those of smaller parts. This school of biology was called organismic biology. Systems thinking was further enriched by psychologists in the new school of gestalt psychology. _Gestalt_ is a German word meaning “organic form.” What these psychologists discovered was that living organisms do not perceive things in terms of isolated elements but in terms of integrated perceptual patterns—meaningful organized wholes that exhibit qualities that are absent in their parts. This is what they called a _gestalt_. The famous saying that “The whole is more than the sum of its parts” was actually coined by a gestalt psychologist.

The third discipline in which systems thinking emerged was ecology, which actually began as a science in those days. Its forerunners were the naturalists of the 19th century. And then, in the 1920s, the term _ecosystem_ was coined, and with that term, ecology began as an independent science. Ecologists focused on the study of animal and plant communities, and again they encountered this irreducible wholeness. In particular, they observed networks of relationships—the web of life.

By the 1930s, most of the key characteristics of systems thinking had been formulated by organismic biologists, gestalt psychologists, and ecologists. In all these fields, the explorations of three types of living systems—organisms, parts of organisms, and communities of organisms—had led scientists to the same new way of thinking in terms of relationships, patterns, and context. This is what became known as systems thinking.

So let me now summarize the key characteristics of systems thinking.

#### **Shift from the Parts to the Whole**

The first, and most general, characteristic is a shift of perspective from the parts to the whole. According to the systems view, the essential properties of a living system—an organism or a community—are properties of the whole, which none of the parts have. They arise from the interactions and relationships between the parts. These properties are destroyed when the system is dissected, either physically or theoretically, into isolated elements. Although we can discern individual parts in any system, these parts are not isolated, and the nature of the whole is always different from the mere sum of its parts.

To give you an example, when you go out into nature and study ecosystems, you will find that the various species there are all interconnected. They form a community and are interconnected through feeding relationships. The main patterns you discover, as I will show you, are networks and cycles within those networks, which act as feedback loops. These are properties that can only be understood if you observe the whole ecosystem. If you split it into a number of species and make a list of those, you will never discover that there are these cyclical patterns that interconnect them. This is what we mean when we say that the system as a whole has to be studied, that it cannot be reduced to the properties of its parts.

The belief that in every complex system the behavior of the whole can be understood from the properties of its parts was central to the mechanistic worldview. The great shock of 20th-century science has been that living systems cannot be understood in this way. In a living system, the properties of the parts are not intrinsic properties but can be understood only within the context of the larger whole. Thus, the relationship between the parts and the whole has been reversed. In the systems approach, the properties of the parts can be understood only from the organization of the whole. The new rule is that to understand something, you don’t take it apart, you put it into a larger context. Systems thinking is contextual thinking.

Let me give you an example. If you look around in nature and see a bird, or any other animal, you will see that it has feathers, or fur, certain colors, and certain other attributes. To understand these, you need to understand the animal in the context of its environment. You need to know what its habitat is, what its seasonal habits are, and so forth. Only then will you understand, for example, why a bird has certain colors. Then, if you know something about evolution, you will know how these colors originated and evolved. So you will understand the properties within the context of the environment of this animal and within its evolutionary context.

#### **From Objects to Relationships**

The shift from the parts to the whole can also be seen as a shift from objects to relationships. In a sense, this is a figure/ground shift. In the mechanistic view, the world is seen as a collection of objects, and the relationships between them are secondary. In the systems view, we realize that the objects themselves—the organisms in an ecosystem or the people in a community—are networks of relationships, embedded in larger networks. For the systems thinker, the relationships are primary. The boundaries of the discernible patterns—the “objects”—are secondary.

The world is a world of relationships, and within these relationships we draw circles around certain patterns, and then we say, “Well, this is what I call an object.” For example, this network of relationships between leaves and twigs and branches I will call a “tree.” It’s significant that when we draw a tree—and psychologists sometimes ask people to do this as a test—most of us don’t draw the roots. Yet the roots are often as expansive as what we see in a tree. If we draw the relationships contained within the tree both above and below the earth, we get a very different picture. This is just one example of the shift of perception from objects to relationships.

#### **From Structure to Process**

The characteristics discussed so far can be seen as different aspects of one great strand of systemic thinking, which we may call contextual thinking. Contextual thinking means thinking in terms of relationships, patterns, and context. Actually, if you look up the Latin root of the word _context_, you find that it means “weaving together.”

There is another strand in systems thinking that is of equal importance. This second strand is process thinking. In the mechanistic framework of Cartesian science, there are fundamental structures, and then there are forces and mechanisms through which these interact, thus giving rise to processes. In systems science every structure is seen as the manifestation of underlying processes. Structure and process always go together; they are two sides of the same coin. Systems thinking is always process thinking.

I shall come back to the nature of the processes we observe in ecosystems shortly. So let me now describe to you the basic patterns of organization of ecosystems—in other words, the basic principles of ecology.

#### **Interdependence**

When you look at an ecosystem—say at a meadow—when you study it and try to understand what it is, the first thing you will recognize is that there are many species there. There are many plants, many insects, many microorganisms. And they’re not just an assemblage, or collection, of species. They are a community, which means that they are interdependent. They depend on one another in many ways, and the most important way, in which they depend on one another, is a very existential way: they eat one another. That’s the most existential interdependence you can imagine.

Indeed, when ecology was developed in the 1920s, one of the first things people studied were feeding relationships. That’s what struck them: feeding relationships. At first, ecologists formulated the concept of food chains. They studied the bigger fish eating the smaller fish, which eat still smaller fish, and so on. Soon these scientists discovered that these are not linear chains but cycles. So then they studied food cycles. The concept shifted from food chains to food cycles.

And then they found out that various food cycles are actually interlinked, so the focus again shifted from food cycles to food webs, to networks. In ecology, this is what people are now talking about. They’re talking about food webs, networks of feeding relationships.

These are not the only examples of interdependence. The members of an ecological community, for example, also give shelter to one another. You have birds nesting in trees and fleas nesting in dogs and bacteria attaching themselves to the roots of plants. Shelter is another important kind of interdependent relationships.

Understanding ecosystems, then, leads us to understanding relationships. This is not easy because it is something that runs counter to the traditional scientific enterprise in Western culture. Traditionally in science, we have tried to measure and weigh things, but relationships cannot be measured and weighed. Relationships must be mapped. You can draw a map of relationships, interconnecting different elements or different members of the community. When you do that, you will discover certain configurations of relationships that appear again and again. This is what we call patterns. The study of relationships leads you to the study of patterns. A pattern is a configuration of relationships appearing repeatedly.

And here we discover a tension that has been characteristic in Western science and philosophy throughout the ages. It is a tension between the study of substance and the study of form.

#### **Substance and Form**

The study of substance starts with the question, What is it made of? The study of form starts with the question, What is its pattern? Those are two very different approaches. Both of them have existed throughout our scientific and philosophical tradition. The study of pattern began with the Pythagoreans in Greek antiquity, and the study of substance began at the same time with Parmenides, Democritus, and various philosophers who asked, What is matter made of? What is reality made of? What are the ultimate constituents? What is its essence?

In asking these questions, the Greeks came up with the idea of four fundamental elements: earth, fire, air, and water. In modern times, these were recast into the chemical elements of Dalton—many more than four, but still the basic elements of which all matter consists. Then, with atomic physics, the elements were identified with atoms, then the atoms were further reduced to nuclei and electrons, and then the nuclei to other subatomic particles.

Similarly, in biology, the basic elements first were organisms, or species. In the 18th and 19th centuries, you had very complex classification schemes of species. Then, with the discovery of cells as the common elements in all organisms, the focus shifted from organisms to cells. Cellular biology was at the forefront of biology. Then the cell was broken down into its macromolecules, into the enzymes and proteins and amino acids and so on, and molecular biology was the new frontier. In all this endeavor, the question always was, What is it made of? What is the ultimate substance?

At the same time, throughout the same history of science, the study of pattern was always there. At various times it came to the forefront, but most times it was neglected, suppressed, or sidelined by the study of substance. Now, in the 20th century, the study of pattern, of form, is coming to the forefront again. Systems thinking includes the shift of emphasis from substance to pattern, from measuring to mapping, from quantity to quality.

#### **Patterns in Art**

As I mentioned, the study of forms, or of patterns, requires visualizing and mapping. This is a very important aspect of studying patterns, and it is the reason why, every time the study of patterns was in the forefront, artists contributed significantly to the advancement of science. Perhaps the two most famous examples are Leonardo da Vinci, whose whole scientific life was a study of patterns, and the German poet Goethe in the 18th century, who made significant contributions to biology through his study of patterns.

This is very important to us, because it is what comes naturally to kids. When my daughter, who is now eight, does her homework, she always includes a drawing, whether it’s math, or spelling, or whatever. She always puts a drawing on it. This is typical of kids. The study of patterns is natural to them; to visualize patterns, to draw patterns, is natural. In traditional schooling this has not been encouraged. Art was sort of on the side. We can make this a central feature of ecoliteracy: the visualization and study of patterns through the arts.

#### **Networks**

Once we understand that the study of patterns is central to ecology, we can ask the crucial question, What is the pattern of life? At all levels of life—organisms, parts of organisms, and communities of organisms—we have patterns of organization, and we can ask, What is the characteristic pattern of life?

The first step in answering this question, and perhaps the most important step, is a very easy and obvious one: the pattern of life is a network pattern. Whenever you see the phenomenon of life, you observe networks. This was brought into science with ecology in the 1920s, when people studied food webs, networks of feeding relationships. They began to concentrate on the network pattern. Later on, a whole set of mathematical tools was developed to study networks. Then scientists realized that the network pattern is characteristic not only of ecological communities but of every member of that community. Every organism is a network of organs, of cells, of various components, and every cell is a network of molecules. So what you have is networks within networks. Whenever you look at life, you look at networks.

#### **Cycles**

The network, then, is the basic pattern of organization of all life. So we can ask, What can we say about networks? A network, as everybody knows, is a certain pattern of links, of relationships. Therefore, to understand networks, we need to learn how to think in terms of patterns and relationships. This is what systems thinking is all about.

Next, we immediately notice when we draw a network that it is a nonlinear pattern; it goes in all directions. So the relationships in a network pattern are nonlinear relationships. For instance, an influence can go from one node to another in the network, then to a third and a fourth, and from there it may go back to the first. In other words, the sequence of cause and effect forms a cycle.

This happens to be the case for all living networks. They all have cycles embedded in them. These cycles are closed loops that act as feedback loops. The important concept of feedback, which was discovered in the 1940s in cybernetics, is intimately connected with the network pattern. Because you have feedback in networks, because an influence travels around a loop and comes back to you, you can have self-regulation—not only self-regulation, but self-organization. When you have a network, for instance a community, the community can regulate itself. It can learn from its mistakes, because the mistakes will travel and come back along these feedback loops. Then you can learn, and next time around you can act differently. Then the effect will come back again and you can learn again, in steps.

#### **Self-Organization**

So a community can organize itself and learn. It does not need an outside authority to tell it, “You guys did something wrong.” A community has its own intelligence, its own learning capability. In fact, every living community is always a learning community. Development and learning are always part of the very essence of life, because of this network pattern. As soon as you understand that life is networks, you understand that the key characteristic of life is self-organization.

So when somebody asks you, “What is the essence of life? What is a living organism all about?,” you could say, “It is a network, and because it is a network, it organizes itself.” This answer is simple, but at the same time it comes from the very forefront of science today. And it is not generally known. When you go around in academic departments and ask people, “What is the essence of life?,” this is not the answer you will hear. What you will hear is, “Amino acids,” “Enzymes,” “DNA,” and things like that, because that is the inquiry into substance—what is it made of?

It is important to understand that in spite of the great triumphs of molecular biology, biologists still do not know how we breathe, or how a wound heals, or how an embryo develops into an organism. All these coordinating activities of life can only be understood when you understand life as a self- organizing network. So self-organization is the very essence of life, and it’s connected with the network pattern.

#### **Nesting Systems**

When we look at all these networks in nature, we see that there are different levels. A striking property of living systems is their tendency to form multileveled structures of systems within systems. Let’s take our own organism as an example. At the smallest level, we have cells, and each cell is a living system. These cells combine to form tissues, the tissues form organs, and the organs form organ systems (e.g., the nervous system or the digestive system). Then the organism as a whole exists within social systems and within ecosystems, which are again networks. At each level, we have systems that are integrated wholes while at the same time being parts of larger wholes. Throughout the living world, we find living systems nesting within other living systems.

Since the early days of ecology, these multileveled arrangements have been called hierarchies. However, this term can be misleading, since it is derived from human hierarchies, originally from the Catholic Church and now from the military and corporate worlds. These have fairly rigid structures of domination and control, quite unlike the multileveled order found in nature.

The view of living systems as networks provides a helpful new perspective on the so-called hierarchies of nature. For example, we can picture an ecosystem schematically as a network with a few nodes. Each node represents an organism, which means that each node, when magnified, appears itself as a network. Each node in the new network may represent an organ, which in turn will appear as a network when magnified, and so on.

In other words, the web of life consists of networks within networks. At each scale, the nodes of the network reveal themselves as smaller networks under closer scrutiny. We tend to arrange these systems, all nesting within larger systems, in a hierarchical scheme by placing the larger systems above the smaller ones in pyramid fashion. But this is a human projection. In nature, there is no “above” or “below”; there are no pyramids and no hierarchies. There are only networks nesting within other networks.

#### **Flows**

Let me now come back to the idea of systems thinking as process thinking and ask, What kind of processes do we observe in ecosystems? This is an old question in the history of biology. For centuries it has been evident to biologists that biological form is more than just shape, more than a static configuration of components in a whole. There is a continual flow of matter and energy through a living organism, while its form is maintained. Systems theorists have coined the term _open system_ to describe this situation. All living systems are open systems, which means they need to feed on a continual flow of matter and energy to stay alive.

In organisms, this flow of matter and energy is the process of metabolism—taking in food, digesting it, using the energy to grow and maintain structures and to fuel activities, and discarding the waste products. In an ecosystem there is a corresponding flow of matter and energy throughout the community of plants and animals.

In the process of photosynthesis, green plants take up energy from the sun, transform it into chemical energy, and use it to build complex organic substances out of minerals and water—proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and so on. These are then taken up by the animals feeding on the plants and on other animals, and finally, the animals’ organic wastes (and ultimately the animals themselves) are reduced to inorganic substances by microorganisms, ending up as minerals to be taken up again by plants.

So there is a continual cyclical flow through the ecosystem, each organism passing on matter and energy and each maintaining itself in a state of dynamic balance as matter and energy flow through it. The cyclical flows of energy and matter—that’s another principle of ecology. In fact, you can define an ecosystem as a community where there is no solid waste. Everything is continually recycled.

Of course, this is an extremely important lesson we must learn from nature. Our businesses, at present, are designed in a linear way—consuming resources, producing goods, and then throwing them away as waste. Our key challenge is to redesign them so as to imitate the cyclical processes of nature. Paul Hawken has recently written about this very eloquently in his book _The Ecology of Commerce_.[^1]

#### **Partnership**

To summarize the principles of ecology I have mentioned so far, we have interdependence, network relationships, feedback loops, and self-organization; we have cyclical flows, and we have nesting systems with communities of many species. When you take all this together, it implies cooperation and partnership. As the various nutrients are passed along through the ecosystem, the relationships we observe are various forms of partnership, of cooperation.

In the 19th century, the Social Darwinists talked about competition in nature, the fight—“Nature red in tooth and claw,” as poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson put it famously. In the 20th century, ecologists discovered that in the self-organization of ecosystems, cooperation is actually much more important than competition. We constantly observe partnerships, linkages, associations—species living inside one another, depending on one another for survival. Partnership is a key characteristic of life. Self-organization is a collective enterprise.

#### **Flexibility through Fluctuations**

The principles of ecology I have discussed are all different aspects of one and the same pattern of organization. They are, if you wish, the basic pattern of life. Once you have gained this understanding, you can ask more detailed questions, such as, What is the resilience of such an organization? How does it react to outside disturbances? In this way, you will discover two further principles that enable ecological communities to survive disturbances, to adapt to changing conditions. One is flexibility; the other is diversity. Flexibility manifests itself in the network structure, because it is not a rigid network; it is a fluctuating network. Whenever you have these feedback loops, when there is a deviation, the system brings itself back into balance.

And since these disturbances happen all the time, because things in the environment change all the time, the net effect is a continual fluctuation. Everything in an ecosystem fluctuates—the population densities, the various occupations of habitats, whatever you can observe in an ecosystem fluctuates. And that is true also for an individual organism. Whatever we observe in our body—our body temperature, our hormonal balance, our skin humidity, our brain waves, our breathing patterns—all that fluctuates. This is how we can be flexible and adapt, because when these fluctuations are disturbed, they will return to a healthy fluctuating state. So flexibility through fluctuations is the way ecosystems remain resilient.

#### **Diversity**

Of course, this does not always work, because there can be very severe disturbances that will actually kill a particular species, just wipe it out. What you have then is that one of the links in this network will be destroyed. An ecosystem, or any community, will be resilient when this destroyed link is not the only one of its kind, when there are other links that can at least partially fulfill its function. In other words, the more complex the network is and the more complex all these connecting links are, the more resilient it will be, because it can afford to lose some of the links. There will still be plenty there, fulfilling the same function.

This, my friends, translates into diversity. Diversity means many links, many different approaches to the same problem. So a diverse community is a resilient community. A diverse community is one that can adapt to changing situations, and therefore diversity is another very important principle of ecology.

Now, in human communities, we must be careful when we talk about diversity. We all know that it’s politically correct to celebrate diversity and to say it’s a great advantage. But it’s not always a great advantage, and this is what we can learn from ecosystems. Diversity is a strategic advantage for a community if, and only if, there is an active network of relationships, if there is a flow of information through all the links of the network. Then diversity will be a tremendous strategic advantage. However, if there is fragmentation, if there are subgroups in the network or individuals that are not really part of the network, then diversity will generate prejudice, it will generate friction, and, as we know well from our inner cities, it will often generate violence.

All the research about diverse learning styles, diverse intelligences, and all that will be extremely useful if, and only if, there is a vibrant community where you have interdependence, a vibrant network of relationships, cyclical flows of energy and information. When the flows are restricted, then you will create suspicion and distrust, and diversity will be a hindrance. But when the flows are open, then diversity will be a great advantage. In an ecosystem, of course, the flows are always open. All the doors are always open in an ecosystem. Everything exchanges energy, matter, and information with everything else; so, diversity is one of the key strategies of nature for survival and for evolution.

These, then, are the basic principles of ecology: interdependence, network patterns, nesting systems, feedback loops, self-organization, the cyclical flows of energy and matter, flexibility, diversity, cooperation, and partnership. They are all different aspects, different perspectives on one and the same phenomenon. This is how ecosystems organize themselves to sustain life.

ESSAY 17|Turn, Turn, Turn

### _Understanding Nature’s Cycles_

1997

THE ORGANIZERS OF this conference believe, as they state in the brochure, “that gardening will reconnect children to the fundamentals of food while integrating and enlivening virtually every activity that takes place at a school.” I want to take this statement a step further by showing you that gardening will reconnect children not only to the fundamentals of food, but also to the fundamentals of life.

Over the past two decades, a new systemic conception of life has emerged at the forefront of science. I won’t have time here to describe this new conception of life in any detail, but I want to mention some of its most important features. The central insight is that there is a basic pattern of life that is common to all living systems—living organisms, ecosystems, or social systems. That basic pattern is the network. There is a web of relationships among all the components of a living organism, just as there is a network of relationships among the plants, animals, and microorganisms in an ecosystem or among people in a human community.

One of the key characteristics of these living networks is the fact that all their nutrients are passed along in cycles. In an ecosystem, energy flows through the network, while the water, oxygen, carbon, and all other nutrients move in these well-known ecological cycles. Similarly, the blood cycles through our body, and so does the air, the lymph fluid, and so on. Wherever we see life we see networks, and wherever we see living networks, we see cycles.

These three insights—the network pattern, the flow of energy, and the nutrient cycles—are essential to the new scientific conception of life. Scientists have formulated them in complicated technical language. They speak of “autopoietic networks,” “dissipative structures,” and “catalytic cycles.” But the basic phenomena described by those technical terms are the web of life, the flow of energy, and the cycles of nature. And these are exactly the phenomena that are experienced, explored, and understood by children through gardening.

The understanding of life in terms of networks, flows, and cycles is relatively new in science, but it is an essential part of the wisdom of spiritual traditions, such as the Native American traditions, the Christian tradition, or the Buddhist tradition. Some of the older ones among you will remember that the title of my talk is the title of an old Pete Seeger song—“Turn! Turn! Turn! (To everything there is a season).” The lyrics of this song are taken straight out of the Bible, and I have chosen this title to remind us that the awareness of the cycles of nature is part of humanity’s age-old wisdom.

Unfortunately, we have lost this wisdom to a large extent during the recent, relatively short period of the industrial era. There is a major clash today between ecology and the economies of the industrial world. It derives from the fact that nature is cyclical, whereas our industrial systems are linear. Our businesses take resources, transform them into products plus waste, and sell the products to consumers, who discard more waste when they have consumed the products. Sustainable patterns of production and consumption need to be cyclical, imitating the cyclical processes in nature. To achieve such cyclical patterns, we need to fundamentally redesign our businesses and our economy.

At the root of this problem lies our obsession with unrestricted economic growth. Growth is a key characteristic of all living things, but on a finite planet not all things can grow at the same time. To everything there is a season. While some things grow, others have to diminish. Just as the decay of last year’s fallen leaves provides nutrients for new growth this spring, some institutions must be allowed to decline and decay, so that their capital and human talents can be released and recycled to create new organizations.

This age-old wisdom can be experienced and understood directly through gardening. As we move toward the 21st century, the great challenge of our time is to create ecologically sustainable communities, communities in which we can satisfy our needs and aspirations without diminishing the chances of future generations. For this task, we can learn valuable lessons from the study of ecosystems, which are sustainable communities of plants, animals, and microorganisms. To understand these lessons, we need to learn the basic principles of ecology. We need to become ecologically literate, and the best place to acquire ecological literacy is the school garden.

It is not a coincidence that gardening and preparing food from what grows in the garden have been integral parts of religious practice in many spiritual traditions, for example in the monastic traditions of Christianity and Buddhism. Gardening and cooking are examples of cyclical work—work that has to be done over and over again, work that does not leave any lasting traces. You cook a meal that is immediately eaten. You clean the dishes, but they will soon be dirty again. You plant, tend the garden, harvest, and then plant again. This work is part of monastic practice, because it helps us recognize the natural order of growth and decay, of birth and death, and thus makes us aware of how we are all embedded in those cycles of nature.

In the garden, we learn about food cycles, one of the earliest and most important ecological concepts. From the beginning of the science of ecology, ecologists have been studying feeding relationships. At first, they formulated the concept of the food chain, which we still use today—small creatures being eaten by bigger ones, which are eaten in turn by still bigger ones, and so on. Soon ecologists realized that all the big creatures are eaten by smaller ones when they die, by the so-called decomposer organisms. This led to the concept of food cycles. And finally, ecologists recognized that these food cycles are all interconnected, because most species feed on several other species, as we do, and thus the food cycles become part of one interconnected network. So, the contemporary concept in ecology is that of the food web, a network of feeding relationships.

In the garden, we learn that green plants play a vital role in the flow of energy through all ecological cycles. Their roots take in water and mineral salts from the earth, and the resulting juices rise up to the leaves, where they combine with carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air to form sugars and other organic compounds. In this marvelous process, known as photosynthesis, solar energy is converted into chemical energy and bound in the organic substances, while oxygen is released into the air to be taken up again by other plants, and by animals, in the process of respiration.

By blending water and minerals from below with sunlight and CO2 from above, green plants link the earth and the sky. We tend to believe that plants grow out of the soil, but in fact most of their substance comes from the air. The bulk of the cellulose and the other organic compounds produced through photosynthesis consists of heavy carbon and oxygen atoms, which plants take directly from the air in the form of CO2. Thus, the weight of a wooden log comes almost entirely from the air. When we burn a log in a fireplace, oxygen and carbon combine once more into CO2, and in the light and heat of the fire we recover part of the solar energy that went into making the wood. All this we can learn from gardening.

In a typical food cycle, the plants are eaten by animals, which in turn are eaten by other animals, and thus the plants’ nutrients are passed on through the food web, while energy is dissipated as heat through respiration and as waste through excretion. The wastes, as well as dead animals and plants, are decomposed by insects and bacteria, the decomposer organisms, which break them down into basic nutrients, to be taken up once more by green plants.

In gardening, we integrate the natural food cycles into our cycles of planting, growing, harvesting, composting, and recycling. Through this practice, we also learn that the garden as a whole is embedded in larger systems that are again living networks with their own cycles. The food cycles intersect with these larger cycles—the water cycle, the cycle of the seasons, and so on, all of which are links in the planetary web of life.

Through gardening, we also become aware of how we ourselves are part of the web of life. To quote from the famous speech attributed to Chief Seattle, “We did not weave the web of life; we are merely a strand in it. Whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves.”[^1]

In the garden, we learn that a fertile soil is a living soil containing billions of living organisms in every cubic centimeter. These soil bacteria carry out various chemical transformations that are essential to sustain life on Earth. Because of the basic nature of the living soil, we need to preserve the integrity of the great ecological cycles in our practice of gardening and agriculture. This principle is embodied in traditional farming methods, which are based on a profound respect for life. Farmers used to plant different crops every year, rotating them so that the balance in the soil was preserved. No pesticides were needed, since insects attracted to one crop would disappear with the next. Instead of using chemical fertilizers, farmers would enrich their fields with manure, thus returning organic matter to the soil to reenter the ecological cycle.

About four decades ago, this age-old practice of organic farming changed drastically with the massive introduction of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Chemical farming has seriously disrupted the balance of our soil, and this has had a severe impact on human health, because any imbalance in the soil affects the food that grows in it and thus the health of the people who eat the food. Fortunately, a growing number of farmers have now become aware of the hazards of chemical farming and are turning back to organic, ecological methods. The school garden is the ideal place to teach the merits of organic farming to our children.

Another type of cycle we encounter in the garden is the life cycle of an organism—the cycle of birth, growth, maturation, decline, death, and new growth of the next generation. In the garden, we experience growth and development on a daily basis. We can follow the development of a plant from the seed to the first shoot, the growth of the stem and leaves, the buds, the flowers, and the fruits. And when we look into a fruit, we find that at its very core are the new seeds; and so the life cycle begins again.

The understanding of growth and development, of course, is essential not only for gardening but also for education. While the children learn that their work in the school garden changes with the development and maturing of the plants, the teachers’ methods of instruction and the entire discourse in the classroom changes with the development and maturing of the students. This is systems thinking in action—applying the same principle to different systems levels.

Since the pioneering work of Jean Piaget in the 1920s and 30s, a broad consensus has emerged among scientists and educators about the unfolding of cognitive functions in the growing child.[^2] Part of that consensus is the recognition that a rich, multisensory learning environment—the shapes and textures, the colors, smells, and sounds of the real world—is essential for the full cognitive and emotional development of the child. Learning in the school garden is learning in the real world at its very best. It is beneficial for the development of the individual student and the school community, and it is one of the best ways for children to become ecologically literate and thus able to contribute to building a sustainable future.

## Complexity and Life

EVEN THOUGH I spent most of the late 1980s and early 1990s as an educator and activist, I continued my dialogues with leading scientists. During those years I met Humberto Maturana, Francisco Varela, and Lynn Margulis, all of whom exerted major influences on my thinking. And after ten years of activism, during which I did very little theoretical work, I thought, “Gosh, I would love to write another theoretical book.” And so I did. During the years 1994 and 1995, I synthesized what I had learned from my recent scientific dialogues in _The Web of Life_, published in 1996.[^1]

This book represents a major advance of my synthesis of the systems view of life in several ways. To begin with, I undertook a systematic study of the history of systems thinking. This was much more difficult than I had imagined. I thought, maybe naïvely, that I would start by going to the university library in Berkeley, pull out the Encyclopedia Britannica, and look up “systems theory, history of,” and that I would find a coherent summary. In fact, there was no entry of “systems theory,” nor of “systems thinking.” There were “systems engineering” and “systems analysis,” which had nothing to do with living systems. I looked through several other big encyclopedias—German, French, Italian, Russian—without finding anything.

Eventually, I pieced the story together from various books and articles, and in _The Web of Life_ I tell it in five chapters—from organismic biology, gestalt psychology, and ecology to general systems theory, cybernetics, the concept of self-organization, and complexity theory. Still today, this is one of the few places, maybe even the only place, where one can find a full and coherent account of this important intellectual development in 20th-century science.

In my research on the history of systems thinking, I soon discovered the pioneering works of Russian scientists, and in 1991, I had a unique opportunity to explore their contributions in dialogues with Russian scientists and philosophers when I was invited to give a four-day seminar at the USSR Academy of Sciences (now Russian Academy of Sciences) in Moscow. The first essay in this chapter is an homage to those pioneers of systems thinking. It is based on a lecture I gave at the University of California Berkeley in 2012 to commemorate the life and work of a Russian colleague and friend, the ecologist and systems thinker Svetlana Chernikova.[^2] The pioneering ideas of Russian systems thinkers I discuss and honor in the essay include the first conception of the Earth as a living system by the geochemist Vladimir Vernadsky; the first systematic theory of living and nonliving systems, known as “tektology,” by the medical researcher and philosopher Alexander Bogdanov; and the radical idea of a molecular, “prebiotic” evolution by the chemist Alexander Oparin. I also pay homage to Ilya Prigogine’s theory of dissipative structures and to the experimental work by the chemist Boris Belousov and the biochemist Anatoly Zhabotinsky, on which it is based.

The second new element in _The Web of Life_, in addition to my account of the history of systems thinking, is the chapter on complexity theory. This was easier to write than the chapters about the early history of systems thinking, because a couple of good books on complexity and chaos theory, which were among the most exciting developments in science at that time, had already been published.[^3] This new understanding allowed me to introduce a critical distinction between the old, “classical” systems theories and the new, more recent theories and models, which incorporate the insights from complexity theory.

The three essays on complexity theory in this chapter (essays 19]], [^20], and [^21]) are based on lectures and seminars in quite special settings—the first in Ireland, the second in Cuba, and the third in a theater in San Francisco. As I explain in these essays, complexity theory—technically known as “nonlinear dynamics”—is a new mathematical language that has allowed scientists for the first time to handle the enormous complexity of living systems mathematically. Chaos theory and fractal geometry are important branches of complexity theory. This new nonlinear mathematics is a mathematics of patterns, of relationships, which has raised systems thinking to a whole new level.

The two most important new systems theories are the theory of dissipative structures by Ilya Prigogine and the theory of autopoiesis and cognition by Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela.[^4] The two theories are very different. They use different languages to describe two different phenomena, both of which are essential characteristics of life.

Prigogine uses the language of physics and chemistry to describe flows of energy and matter through “open systems” that he calls “dissipative structures.” The concept of “open systems” was known before, but Prigogine was able to identify nonlinearity as their key characteristic and to formulate a mathematical theory of these nonlinear systems, for which he got the Nobel Prize. The most important achievement of Prigogine’s theory, in my view, is to identify and precisely describe the phenomenon of emergence in these nonlinear systems. In fact, I see this as the most important achievement of complexity theory as a whole.

Maturana describes biological life in terms of patterns of organization. He started from the recognition that all living systems are networks, which was also known before (in fact, since the early days of ecology). He realized that living networks are self-organizing (something he had learned from the cyberneticists), and then he added the new idea that the essence of this self-organization is that living networks are self-_generating_. This is the main insight of the theory of autopoiesis, formulated by Maturana and Varela. The second revolutionary idea that Maturana and Varela added to their theory is the link between autopoiesis and cognition in the so-called Santiago theory of cognition. Cognition, the process of knowing, is associated in this theory with the very process of life, with the continual self-generation of living networks.

In the early 1990s, I had reached an understanding of both Prigogine’s theory of dissipative structures and Maturana’s (and Varela’s) theory of autopoiesis and cognition. To my great surprise, I found that there were these two camps in the developing systems view of life, the Maturana camp and the Prigogine camp, and there was practically no communication between them. I discussed this with both Varela and Prigogine, and I found that neither of them was very interested in the other’s work. So I set out to build a bridge, a synthesis between Maturana and Prigogine, between the descriptions of living systems in terms of networks and in terms of flows.

My starting point was the distinction, made by Maturana and Varela, between a system’s organization (which I changed to “pattern of organization”) and its structure. The pattern of organization is a configuration of relationships among the system’s parts that determines the system’s essential characteristics. For example, there are specific relationships between a bicycle’s frame, wheels, pedals, handlebars, and so on that make it function like a bicycle. That configuration of relationships is the bicycle’s pattern of organization. The structure is the physical embodiment of the pattern of organization. The bicycle could be made of light or heavy metal, of bamboo, or other materials. The same pattern “bicycle” can be embodied in many different structures.

The key insight for me—the essence of my synthesis—was the realization that in living systems, the embodiment of the system’s pattern of organization in a certain physical and chemical structure is a continual process. There is a ceaseless flow of matter through a living organism and its components change continually. This striking characteristic of biological life suggested _process_ to me as a third perspective on life, in addition to pattern and structure. So my synthesis of Maturana and Prigogine, of the descriptions of life in terms of patterns and structures, is to recognize process as the link between the two. The process of life is the activity involved in the continual embodiment of the system’s pattern of organization.

In _The Web of Life_, I formally defined the three perspectives on life—pattern, structure, and process—and I emphasized that they are fundamentally interlinked, that all three are necessary for a full systemic understanding of biological life. And finally, I identified the pattern perspective with the theory of autopoiesis, the structure perspective with the theory of dissipative structures, and the process perspective with the Santiago theory of cognition.

One year after publication of _The Web of Life_, I had a unique opportunity to present my new synthesis of the systems view of life in a prestigious forum. I was invited to give the 1997 Erwin Schrödinger Lecture at Trinity College in Dublin, where Schrödinger had worked and taught in the 1940s and 1950s and where he had written his pioneering book _What Is Life?_

Essay 19]] is based on my Schrödinger Lecture. I open it with an homage to Schrödinger’s influential lectures and book about the nature of life, which opened a new frontier of science, molecular biology. Molecular biologists, I argue, have discovered the fundamental building blocks of life, but this great scientific achievement has not brought them much closer to answering Schrödinger’s provocative question, because they still do not understand the vital integrative actions of living organisms.

In the main body of the essay, I present a concise summary of my synthesis of the systems view of life, which, I claim, provides us with the proper language to answer Schrödinger’s question. I begin my summary with a brief review of the characteristics and history of systems thinking, from its emergence in the 1920s to the “classical” systems theories of the 1940s and the radical advance of complexity theory in the 1970s.

I then present Prigogine’s theory of dissipative structures and Maturana’s and Varela’s theory of autopoiesis and cognition as the two most important “new” theories of living systems, and I conclude with my synthesis of these two theories in terms of the integration of three perspectives on life—pattern, structure, and process. For the first time, I claim, we have a scientific theory that unifies mind, matter, and life.

Essay 20]] is based on a paper, “Complexity and Life,” I gave at a seminar called “The Philosophical, Epistemological, and Methodological Implications of Complexity Theory” in Havana, Cuba, in January 2002. It is a review (in slightly more technical language than the other essays in this book) of the basic concepts, current achievements, and status of complexity theory from the perspective of the new systemic understanding of biological life. Models and theories I discuss include the theory of dissipative structures for nonlinear chemical systems, the application of bifurcation theory to genetic networks and cell differentiation, the study of the origin of biological form (morphology), a new approach to the understanding of developmental stability in embryology, and a model of the “origin of life” and prebiotic evolution.

Essay 21]] is based on a seminar about complexity theory I gave to the cast of the play _Arcadia_ by Tom Stoppard at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco. I began my seminar by reviewing the origin and development of thermodynamics in the 19th century, including the discovery of irreversible processes and of the “arrow of time.” I then moved on to the rise of complexity theory in the 1970s and 1980s with particular emphasis on fractal geometry. As I explained the key concepts of complexity theory to the actors, I illustrated them with abundant quotations from the play. _Arcadia_ is such an exciting play for a scientist because all the references to the new mathematics and science of complexity are absolutely correct.

ESSAY 18|Russian Pioneers of Systems Thinking

2012

I AM VERY honored to give this first Svetlana Chernikova memorial lecture and very moved by the occasion. Svetlana was an accomplished ecologist and systems thinker, and as such followed a long Russian tradition. To honor her, I want to show you why systems thinking is crucial for building a sustainable future, one of Svetlana’s great passions, and how it emerged and evolved in Europe in the 20th century, and I want to highlight the significant contributions to this intellectual tradition by Russian scientists.

#### **Ecological Sustainability**

The great challenge of our time is to build and nurture sustainable communities—social, cultural, and physical environments in which we can satisfy our needs and aspirations without diminishing the chances of future generations.

Since its introduction in the early 1980s, the concept of sustainability has often been distorted, co-opted, and even trivialized by being used without the ecological context that gives it its proper meaning. A good example is the agreement signed by world leaders at the Rio +20 conference. The first draft began with “sustainable development.” This was changed to “sustainable growth” in subsequent versions, and in the final document we find “sustained growth,” which is manifestly unsustainable from the ecological perspective.

What is sustained in a sustainable community is not economic growth but the entire web of life on which our long-term survival depends. In other words, a sustainable community is designed in such a way that its ways of life, businesses, economy, physical structures, and technologies do not interfere with nature’s inherent ability to sustain life. The first step in this endeavor, naturally, must be to understand how nature sustains life. It turns out that this involves a new ecological understanding of life, as well as a new kind of thinking—thinking in terms of relationships, patterns, and context.

Indeed, such a new understanding of life has emerged over the last 30 years. At the forefront of contemporary science, the universe is no longer seen as a machine composed of elementary building blocks. We have discovered that the material world, ultimately, is a network of inseparable patterns of relationships, that the planet as a whole is a living, self-regulating system. The view of the human body as a machine and of the mind as a separate entity is being replaced by one that sees not only the brain, but also the immune system, the bodily tissues, and even each cell as a living, cognitive system. Evolution is no longer seen as a competitive struggle for existence, but rather as a cooperative dance in which creativity and the constant emergence of novelty are the driving forces. And with the new emphasis on complexity, networks, and patterns of organization, a new science of qualities is slowly emerging.

#### **Living Networks**

One of the most important insights of this new understanding of life is the recognition that networks are the basic pattern of organization of all living systems. Ecosystems are understood in terms of food webs (i.e., networks of organisms); organisms are networks of cells, organs, and organ systems; and cells are networks of molecules. The network is a pattern that is common to all life. Wherever we see life, we see networks.

It is important to realize that these living networks are not material structures, like a fishing net or a spider’s web. They are _functional_ networks, networks of relationships between various processes. In a cell, for example, these processes are chemical reactions between the cell’s molecules. In a food web, the processes are processes of feeding, of organisms eating one another. In both cases, the network is a nonmaterial pattern of relationships.

Closer examination of these living networks has shown that their key characteristic is that they are _self-generating_. In a cell all the biological structures—the proteins, the DNA, the cell membrane, and so on—are continually produced, repaired, and regenerated by the cellular network. Similarly, at the level of a multicellular organism, the bodily cells are continually regenerated and recycled by the organism’s metabolic network. Living networks continually create, or recreate themselves by transforming or replacing their components.

Life in the social realm can also be understood in terms of networks, but here we are not dealing with chemical reactions; we are dealing with communications. Social networks, as you know, are networks of communications. Like biological networks, they are self-generating, but what they generate is mostly nonmaterial. Each communication creates thoughts and meaning, which give rise to further communications, and thus the entire network generates itself.

#### **Systems Thinking**

Since a network is a pattern of relationships, understanding life in terms of networks requires that we learn how to think in terms of patterns and relationships. In science, this way of thinking is known as “systemic thinking,” or “systems thinking.” It emerged in Europe in the 1920s from a series of interdisciplinary dialogues among biologists, psychologists, and ecologists. In all these fields, scientists realized that a living system—an organism, ecosystem, or social system—is an integrated whole whose properties cannot be reduced to those of smaller parts. The “systemic” properties are properties of the whole, which none of its parts have. So systems thinking involves a shift of perspective from the parts to the whole. The early systems thinkers coined the phrase, “The whole is more than the sum of its parts.”

What exactly does this mean? In what sense is the whole more than the sum of its parts? The answer is relationships. All the essential properties of a living system depend on the relationships among the system’s components. Systems thinking means thinking in terms of relationships. Understanding life requires a shift of perspective, not only from the parts to the whole but also from objects to relationships.

Now, understanding relationships is not easy for us, because it is something that goes counter to the traditional scientific enterprise in Western culture. In science, we have been told, things must be measured and weighed. But relationships cannot be measured and weighed; relationships must be mapped. So there is another shift of perspective from measuring to mapping, or from quantity to quality.

#### **Systems Theories**

The early systems thinkers identified the basic concepts to describe living systems as integrated wholes—concepts like “organization,” “pattern,” and “complexity,” the idea of “emergent properties,” the notion of living systems as self-organizing, the concept of the ecosystem and the associated notions of ecological cycles and food webs, and so on. By the end of the 1930s, most of these key concepts had been identified and well defined. The 1940s, then, saw the formulation of actual systems theories. This means that the systemic concepts were integrated into coherent theoretical frameworks describing the principles of organization of living systems.

The Austrian biologist Ludwig von Bertalanffy is commonly credited with the formulation of the first such theoretical framework, which he called “general systems theory.”[^1] However, 20 to thirty 30 years before Bertalanffy published his first papers, Alexander Bogdanov, a Russian medical researcher, philosopher, and economist, developed a systems theory of equal sophistication and scope, which unfortunately is still largely unknown outside of Russia.[^2]

Bogdanov called his theory tektology, from the Greek _tekton_ (“builder”), as in “architect.” Tektology can be translated as “the science of structures.” Bogdanov’s main goal was to clarify and generalize the principles of organization of all living and nonliving structures. Tektology was the first attempt in the history of science to arrive at a systematic formulation of the principles of organization operating in living and nonliving systems. It anticipated the conceptual framework of Ludwig von Bertalanffy’s general systems theory, and it also included several important ideas that were formulated four decades later, in a different language, as key principles of cybernetics by Norbert Wiener.

The stability and development of all systems can be understood, according to Bogdanov, in terms of two basic organizational mechanisms: formation and regulation. The dynamics of formation consists in the joining of complexes through various kinds of linkages, which Bogdanov analyzes in great detail. He emphasizes in particular that the tension between crisis and transformation is central to the formation of complex systems. Foreshadowing the work of another Russian, Ilya Prigogine, Bogdanov shows how organizational crisis manifests itself as a breakdown of the existing systemic balance and at the same time represents a transition to a new state of balance.[^3] By defining categories of crises, Bogdanov even anticipated the concept of catastrophe developed in the 1960s by the French mathematician René Thom, which later on, under the name of “bifurcation,” became a key concept of complexity theory.[^4]

#### **Gaia—The Living Earth**

The view of living systems as integrated wholes led some scientists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries to extend their search for wholeness to the entire planet and see the Earth as an integrated whole, a living being. The view of the Earth as being alive, of course, has a long tradition. Mythical _resources/books//Patterns of Connection_ Essential Essays F - Fritjof Capra of the Earth Mother are among the oldest in human religious history. Gaia, the Earth Goddess, was revered as the supreme deity in early, pre-Hellenic Greece, and this is why the modern scientific conception of our planet as a living system is known as Gaia theory.

The term _biosphere_ was first used in the late 19th century by the Austrian geologist Eduard Suess to describe the layer of life surrounding the Earth. A few decades later, the Russian geochemist Vladimir Vernadsky developed the concept into a full-fledged theory in his pioneering book, _Biosphere_, published in 1926.[^5] Vernadsky saw life as a “geological force” that partly creates and partly controls the planetary environment. Among all the early theories of the living Earth, Vernadsky’s comes closest to our contemporary Gaia theory.

#### **Complexity Theory**

The view of living systems as self-organizing networks whose components are all interconnected and interdependent was expressed repeatedly by the early systems thinkers. However, detailed models of self-organizing systems could be formulated only very recently when new mathematical tools became available that allowed scientists for the first time to describe and model the fundamental interconnectedness of living networks mathematically.

The intricacy of these networks defies the imagination. Even the simplest living system, a bacterial cell, is a highly complex network involving literally thousands of interdependent chemical reactions. Before the 1970s, there was simply no way in which these networks could be modeled mathematically. But then powerful high-speed computers appeared on the scene, which made it possible for scientists and mathematicians to develop a new set of concepts and techniques for dealing with that enormous complexity. During the subsequent two decades, these new conceptions coalesced into a coherent mathematical framework, popularly known as complexity theory. Its technical name is nonlinear dynamics, because it is a nonlinear mathematics. Complex systems are nonlinear systems. Chaos theory and fractal geometry are important branches of this new mathematics of complexity.

#### **Dissipative Structures**

The discovery of nonlinear dynamics has led to major breakthroughs in our understanding of biological life and is widely regarded as the most exciting scientific development of the late 20th century. One of the first scientists to apply complexity theory to the study of living systems was the Russian-born Nobel Laureate Ilya Prigogine at the University of Brussels.

Prigogine was intrigued by the fact that living organisms are able to maintain their life processes under conditions of nonequilibrium. They remain in a stable state, even though energy and matter flows through them and their structures are continually changing. Prigogine became fascinated by these systems far from thermal equilibrium and began an intensive investigation to find out under exactly what conditions nonequilibrium situations may be stable.

In order to solve the puzzle of stability far from equilibrium, Prigogine actually did not study living systems but turned to much simpler chemical nonequilibrium systems, in particular the so-called chemical clocks. These are reactions far from chemical equilibrium, which produce very striking periodic oscillations. The first chemical oscillation of this kind was discovered in the 1950s by the Russian chemist Boris Belousov and was studied in more detail later by the biochemist Anatoly Zhabotinsky. Accordingly, the whole family of oscillating chemical reactions it is now known as the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction.[^6] When Prigogine tried, in the early 1960s, to construct a mathematical model of the behavior of this reaction, the crucial breakthrough occurred for him when he realized that these systems must be described by nonlinear equations.

The clear recognition of this link between “far from equilibrium” and “non-linearity” opened a new avenue of research for Prigogine. By applying the newly developed mathematics of complexity to these systems, he was able to develop a new nonlinear thermodynamics to describe the self-organization of open systems far from equilibrium. He called it the theory of dissipative structures, and it won him the Nobel Prize.[^7]

According to Prigogine’s theory, dissipative structures not only maintain themselves in a stable state far from equilibrium, but may even evolve. When the flow of energy and matter through them increases, they may encounter points of instability, known as bifurcation points, at which the system may branch off into an entirely new state, where new structures and new forms of order emerge.

This spontaneous emergence of order at critical points of instability, which is often referred to simply as “emergence,” is one of the hallmarks of life. It has been recognized as the dynamic origin of development, learning, and evolution. In other words, creativity—the generation of new forms—is a key property of all living systems.

#### **Molecular Evolution**

Prigogine’s theory of dissipative structures has another important implication. Since all dissipative structures have the potential to evolve, and since not all of them are living systems, this means that there must have been a “pre-biotic” evolution before the emergence of the first living cells. This view is widely accepted among biologists today, but it was radical when it was first proposed by the Russian chemist Alexander Oparin. Oparin stated boldly that life on Earth must have originated from inanimate matter via a very long series of chemical steps that brought about a spontaneous and continuous increase of molecular complexity, until the emergence of the first living cells. He illustrated his idea of molecular evolution with a speculative scenario in a seminal book, _The Origin of Life_, published in Moscow in 1924.[^8]

#### **Ecological Literacy**

After this brief review of the contributions by some of the pioneers of systems thinking, let me now return to sustainability. As I mentioned before, a sustainable community must be designed in such a way that its ways of life, businesses, economy, physical structures, and technologies do not interfere with nature’s inherent ability to sustain life. The first step in this endeavor must be to understand how nature sustains life.

To do so, we must move from biology to ecology, because sustained life is a property of an ecosystem rather than a single organism or species. Over billions of years of evolution, the Earth’s ecosystems have evolved certain principles of organization to sustain the web of life. Knowledge of these principles of organization, or principles of ecology, is what has become known as “ecological literacy.”

In the coming decades, the survival of humanity will depend on our “ecological literacy”—our ability to understand the basic principles of ecology and to live accordingly. This means that ecological literacy must become a critical skill for politicians, business leaders, and professionals in all spheres and should be the most important part of education at all levels—from primary and secondary schools to colleges, universities, and the continuing education and training of professionals.

We must teach our children, our students, and our political and corporate leaders the fundamental facts of life—for example, that one species’ waste is another species’ food; that matter cycles continually through the web of life; that the energy driving the ecological cycles flows from the sun; that diversity assures resilience; that life, from its beginning more than three billion years ago, did not take over the planet by combat but by networking.

#### **Systemic Problems—Systemic Solutions**

Once we become ecologically literate, once we understand the processes and patterns of relationships that enable ecosystems to sustain life, we will also understand the many ways in which our human civilization, especially since the Industrial Revolution, has ignored these ecological patterns and processes and has interfered with them. And we will realize that these interferences are the fundamental causes of many of our current world problems. Thinking systemically, we will recognize the major problems of our time as systemic problems—all interconnected and interdependent.

To solve these problems, we need systemic solutions, in which we can turn the interconnectedness of the problems to an advantage, so that one action can solve several problems at the same time. For example, if we changed from our chemical, large-scale industrial agriculture to organic, community- oriented, sustainable farming, this would contribute significantly to solving three of our biggest problems. It would greatly reduce our energy dependence, because we are now using one-fifth of our fossil fuels to grow and process food. The healthy, organically grown food would have a huge positive effect on public health, because many chronic diseases are directly linked to our diet. And finally, organic farming would contribute significantly to fighting climate change, because an organic soil is a carbon-rich soil, which means that it draws CO2 from the atmosphere and locks it up in organic matter.

Today, there are numerous NGOs around the world that have developed and applied such systemic solutions. They make it evident that we have the knowledge and the technologies to build a sustainable future. What we need is political will and leadership. This leadership must come from four sectors of society: government, business, the academic world, and the global network of NGOs that constitutes the new global civil society. In my view, we shall be able to move toward a sustainable future only if all these sectors collaborate. Svetlana Chernikova dedicated her life to promoting such collaborations between government, business, civil society, and academic scholars, and we can honor her best by continuing this work.

ESSAY 19|“What is Life?” Revisited

1997

IN FEBRUARY 1943, the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger, one of the founders of quantum theory, gave a series of three lectures at Trinity College in Dublin with the title “What is Life?,” which changed the course of the life sciences.[^1] In the lectures, and in the subsequent book with the same title, Schrödinger advanced clear and compelling hypotheses about the molecular structure of genes, which stimulated biologists to think about genetics in a novel way and in so doing opened a new frontier of science, molecular biology.

During subsequent decades, this new field generated a series of triumphant discoveries, culminating in the unraveling of the genetic code. However, these spectacular advances did not bring biologists any closer to answering the question posed by Schrödinger: What is Life? Nor were they able to answer the many associated questions that have puzzled scientists and philosophers for hundreds of years: How did complex structures evolve out of a random collection of molecules? What is the relationship between mind and brain? What is consciousness?

Molecular biologists have discovered the fundamental building blocks of life, but this has not helped them understand the vital integrative actions of living organisms. Twenty-five years ago, one of the leading molecular biologists, Sidney Brenner, made the following reflective comments:

In one way, you could say all the genetic and molecular biological work of the last 60 years could be considered a long interlude . . . Now that that program has been completed, we have come full circle—back to the problems left behind unsolved. How does a wounded organism regenerate to exactly the same structure it had before? How does the egg form the organism? . . . I think in the next twenty-five years we are going to have to teach biologists another language. . . . I don’t know what it’s called yet; nobody knows. . . . It may be wrong to believe that all the logic is at the molecular level. We may need to get beyond the clock mechanisms.[^2]

Since the time Brenner made these comments, a new language for understanding the complexity of living systems—that is, of organisms, social systems, and ecosystems—has indeed emerged. You may have heard about some of the key concepts of this new way of understanding complex systems—chaos, attractors, fractals, dissipative structures, self-organization, and so on.

In the early 1980s, I conceived a synthesis of these new discoveries, a new conceptual framework for the scientific understanding of life. I developed and refined my synthesis for ten years, discussed it with numerous scientists, and published it in my book _The Web of Life_.[^3]

The intellectual tradition of systems thinking and the models of living systems developed during the early decades of the century form the conceptual and historical roots of the new scientific framework that I want to present to you here. In fact, my synthesis of current models and theories may be seen as an outline of an emerging new theory of living systems. What is now emerging at the forefront of science is a coherent scientific theory that offers, for the first time, a unified view of mind, matter, and life.

Since modern society has been dominated by the Cartesian split between mind and matter and by the ensuing mechanistic paradigm for the past three hundred years, this new vision that finally overcomes the Cartesian split will have not only important scientific and philosophical consequences, but also tremendous practical implications. It will change the way we relate to each other and to our living natural environment, the way we deal with our health, the way we perceive our business organizations, our educational systems, and many other social and political institutions.

In particular, the new vision of life will help us build and nurture sustainable communities—the great challenge of our time—because it will help us understand how nature’s communities of plants, animals, and microorganisms—the ecosystems—have organized themselves so as to maximize their ecological sustainability. We have much to learn from this wisdom of nature, and to do so, we need to become ecologically literate. We need to understand the basic principles of ecology, the language of nature. The new framework I present in my book shows that these principles of ecology are also the basic principles of organization of all living systems.

#### **Emergence of Systems Thinking**

Let me begin my outline of the new understanding of life with a brief historical perspective on the tradition of systems thinking. Systems thinking emerged during the 1920s simultaneously in three different fields: organismic biology, gestalt psychology, and ecology. In all these fields, scientists explored living systems, that is, integrated wholes whose properties cannot be reduced to those of smaller parts. Living systems include individual organisms, parts of organisms, and communities of organisms, such as social systems and ecosystems. They span a very broad range, and systems thinking is therefore, by its very nature, an interdisciplinary, or better still, a “transdisciplinary” approach.

From the beginning of biology, philosophers and scientists had realized that the form of a living organism is more than shape, more than a static configuration of components in a whole. The first systems thinkers expressed this realization in the famous phrase, “The whole is more than the sum of its parts.”

For several decades, biologists and psychologists struggled with the question, In what sense exactly is the whole more than the sum of its parts? At that time, there was a fierce debate between two schools of thought, known as mechanism and vitalism. The mechanists said, “The whole is nothing but the sum of its parts. All biological phenomena can be explained in terms of the laws of physics and chemistry.” The vitalists disagreed and maintained that a nonphysical entity—a vital force, or field—must be added to the laws of physics and chemistry to explain biological phenomena.

The school of organismic biology emerged as a third way out of this debate. Organismic biologists opposed both mechanists and vitalists. They agreed that something must be added to the laws of physics and chemistry to understand life, but that something, in their view, was not a new entity. It was the knowledge of the living system’s organization, or, as they put it, of its “organizing relations.”

Organismic biologists were the first to emphasize that the essential properties of a living system are properties of the whole, which none of the parts have. They arise from the interactions and relationships between the parts. These properties are destroyed when the system is dissected, either physically or theoretically, into isolated elements. Although we can discern individual parts in any system, these parts are not isolated, and the nature of the whole is always different from the mere sum of its parts. It took many years to formulate this insight clearly, and several key concepts of systems thinking were developed during that period.

The new science of ecology, which began during the 1920s, enriched the emerging systemic way of thinking by introducing a very important concept, the concept of the network. From the beginning of ecology, ecological communities have been seen as consisting of organisms linked together in network fashion through feeding relations. At first, ecologists formulated the concepts of food chains and food cycles, and these were soon expanded to the contemporary concept of the food web.

The “web of life” is, of course, an ancient idea, which has been used by poets and philosophers throughout the ages to convey their sense of the interwovenness and interdependence of all phenomena. As the network concept became more and more prominent in ecology, systems thinkers began to use network models at all systems levels, viewing organisms as networks of organs and cells, just as ecosystems are understood as networks of individual organisms. This led to the key insight that the network is a pattern that is common to all life. Wherever we see life, we see networks.

#### **Characteristics of Systems Thinking**

Let me now summarize some of the key characteristics of systems thinking. Living systems are integrated wholes, and thus systems thinking implies a shift of perspective from the parts to the whole. The whole is more than the sum of its parts, and what is more is relationships. So systems thinking is thinking in terms of relationships. The shift from the parts to the whole requires another shift of focus, from objects to relationships.

Understanding relationships is not easy for us, because it is something that goes counter to the traditional scientific enterprise in Western culture. In science, we have been told, things need to be measured and weighed. But relationships cannot be measured and weighed; relationships need to be mapped. So here is another shift from measuring to mapping.

When you map relationships, you will find certain configurations that occur repeatedly. This is what we call a pattern. Patterns are configurations of relationships that appear again and again. The study of relationships, then, leads to the study of patterns. Systems thinking involves a shift of perspective from contents to patterns.

Moreover, mapping relationships and studying patterns is not a quantitative but a qualitative approach. Indeed, in the new mathematics of complexity, _qualitative analysis_ is now used as a technical term. So systems thinking implies a shift from quantity to quality.

Finally, the study of relationships concerns not only the relationships among the system’s components, but also those between the system as a whole and surrounding larger systems. Those relationships between the system and its environment are what we mean by context. The word _context_, from the Latin _contexere_—“to weave together”—also implies the idea of the web and is perhaps the most appropriate to characterize systems thinking as a whole. Systems thinking is “contextual thinking.”

There is another important strand of systems thinking, to which I shall return later. It is thinking in terms of processes, which historically emerged somewhat later. Systems thinking means both contextual thinking and process thinking.

#### **Classical Systems Theories**

The key concepts of systems thinking were developed during the 1920s and 1930s. The 1940s, then, saw the formulation of actual systems theories. This means that systems concepts were integrated into coherent theoretical frameworks describing the principles of organization of living systems. These theories, which I call the “classical systems theories,” include general systems theory and cybernetics.

General systems theory was formulated in the 1940s by Ludwig von Bertalanffy, an Austrian biologist who set out to replace the mechanistic foundations of science with a holistic vision.[^4] Like other organismic biologists, Bertalanffy believed that biological phenomena required a new way of thinking. His goal was to construct a “general science of wholeness” as a formal mathematical discipline.

Bertalanffy’s greatest contribution, in my view, was the concept of an “open system” as a key distinction between biological and physical phenomena. Living systems, he recognized, are open systems, which means that they need to feed on a continual flux of matter and energy from their environment to stay alive.

These open systems maintain themselves in a balanced state far from equilibrium, characterized by continual flow and change. Bertalanffy coined the German term _Fließgleichgewicht_, “flowing balance,” to describe such a state of dynamic balance. He recognized that such open systems cannot be described by classical thermodynamics, which was the theory of complex systems available at his time, and he postulated that a new thermodynamics of open systems was needed to describe living systems.

Ludwig von Bertalanffy’s concepts of an open system and of a general systems theory established systems thinking as a major scientific movement. In addition, his emphasis on flow and flowing balance introduced process thinking as a new and important aspect of systemic thought. He was not able to formulate the new thermodynamics of open systems he was looking for, because he lacked the appropriate mathematics for that purpose. Thirty years later, Ilya Prigogine accomplished this feat, using the mathematics of complexity that had been developed in the meantime.

Cybernetics, the other classical systems theory, was formulated by an interdisciplinary group of scientists, including the mathematicians Norbert Wiener and John von Neumann, the neuroscientist Warren McCulloch, and the social scientists Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead.[^5]

Cybernetics soon became a powerful intellectual movement, which developed independently of organismic biology and general systems theory. The central focus of the cyberneticists was the attention to patterns of organization. In particular, they were concerned with patterns of communication, especially in closed loops and networks. Their investigations led them to the concepts of feedback and self-regulation and then, later on, to self-organization.

The concept of feedback, one of the greatest achievements of cybernetics, is intimately connected with the network pattern. In a network, you have cycles and closed loops, and these loops can become feedback loops. A feedback loop is a circular arrangement of causally connected elements in which an initial cause propagates around the links of the loop so that each element has an effect on the next, until the last “feeds back” the effect into the first element of the cycle.

The cyberneticists distinguished between two kinds of feedback: balancing (or “negative”) feedback and reinforcing (or “positive”) feedback. Examples of the latter are the commonly known runaway effects, or vicious circles, which the initial effect continues to be amplified as it travels repeatedly around the loop.

The feedback phenomenon is extremely important for living systems. Because of feedback, living networks can regulate themselves and can organize themselves. A community, for example, can learn from its mistakes, because the mistakes will travel and come back along these feedback loops. So the community can learn and can organize itself. Because of feedback, a community has its own intelligence, its own learning capacity.

Networks, feedback, and self-organization are closely linked concepts. Living systems are networks capable of self-organization.

#### **The New Mathematics of Complexity**

And now I come to the most important point of my brief historical review. There is a watershed in systems thinking between the classical systems theories of the 1940s and the theories of living systems developed during the past 25 years. The distinctive feature of the new theories is a new mathematical language that allowed scientists for the first time to handle the enormous complexity of living systems mathematically.[^6]

We need to realize that even the simplest living system, a bacterial cell, is a highly complex network involving literally thousands of interdependent chemical reactions. A new set of concepts and techniques for dealing with that enormous complexity has now emerged, which is beginning to form a coherent mathematical framework. Chaos theory and fractal geometry are important branches of this new mathematics of complexity.

The crucial characteristic of the new mathematics is that it is a nonlinear mathematics. In science, until recently, we were always taught to avoid nonlinear equations, because they are very difficult to solve. For example, the smooth flow of water in a river in which there are no obstacles is described by a linear equation. But when there is a rock in the river, the water begins to swirl—it becomes turbulent, there are eddies, there are all kinds of vortices—and this complex motion is described by nonlinear equations. The movement of water becomes so complicated that it seems quite chaotic.

Whenever we encountered such nonlinearity in science, the main task was to find a linear approximation of these nonlinear equations. Thus, virtually all of science up to the 1970s was formulated in terms of linear equations. In the 1970s, scientists for the first time had powerful high-speed computers that could help them tackle and solve nonlinear equations. In doing so, they devised a number of techniques, a new kind of mathematical language that revealed very surprising patterns underneath the seemingly chaotic behavior of nonlinear systems, an underlying order beneath the seeming chaos. Indeed, chaos theory is really a theory of order, but of a new kind of order that is not visible to the naked eye but is revealed by this new mathematics. When you solve a nonlinear equation with these new techniques, the result is not a formula but a visual shape, a pattern traced by the computer. So the new mathematics is a mathematics of patterns, of relationships. The so-called attractors are examples of these mathematical patterns. They picture the dynamics of a particular system in terms of visual shapes.

During the 1970s, the strong interest in nonlinear phenomena generated a whole series of new and powerful theories that have dramatically increased our understanding of many key characteristics of life. These theories, which I discuss in some detail in _The Web of Life_, form the components of my own synthesis of the new conception of life.

#### **A New Synthesis**

I have come to believe that the key to a comprehensive theory of living systems lies in the synthesis of two approaches to our understanding of nature that have been in competition throughout our scientific history: the study of pattern (or relationships, order, quality) and the study of structure (or constituents, matter, quantity).

The emergence and refinement of the concept of “pattern of organization” has been a central theme in systems thinking. The early systems thinkers defined pattern as a configuration of relationships. The ecologists recognized the network as the general pattern of life. The cyberneticists identified feedback as a circular pattern of causal links, and the new mathematics of complexity is a mathematics of visual patterns.

So the understanding of pattern is of crucial importance to the scientific understanding of life. But that is not enough. We also need to understand the system’s structure. To show you how the pattern approach and the structure approach can be integrated, let me now define these two terms more precisely.

The pattern of organization of any system, living or nonliving, is the configuration of relationships among the system’s components that determines the system’s essential characteristics. In other words, certain relationships must be present for something to be recognized as, say, a chair, a bicycle, or a tree. That configuration of relationships, which gives a system its essential characteristics, is what I mean by its pattern of organization.

Let me illustrate this with a bicycle. If I took all the parts of a bicycle—the saddle, the handle bars, the frame, the wheels, and so on—and put them here in front of you in a heap, you would all say, “This is not a bicycle; these are the parts of a bicycle.” How do I turn them into a bicycle? By putting them together in a certain order! This order, this configuration of relationships among the parts, is what I call the pattern of organization.

To describe the bicycle’s pattern of organization, I can use an abstract language of relationships. I don’t need to tell you whether the frame is made of heavy iron or light aluminum, what kind of rubber went into the tires, and so on. In other words, the physical materials are not part of the description of the pattern of organization. They are part of the description of the structure, which I define as the material embodiment of the system’s pattern of organization.

Whereas the description of the pattern of organization involves an abstract mapping of relationships, the description of the structure involves describing the system’s actual physical components—their shapes, chemical compositions, and so on.

Well, this is all quite simple with a bicycle. You can visualize its pattern of organization, you can draw a sketch of it, you can get the actual materials and build the bicycle according to your design sketch, and then the bicycle will just stand there and will not do much on its own.

With a living system, the situation is very different. Every living system, as I mentioned before, involves thousands of interlinked chemical processes. In a living system, there is a ceaseless flux of matter; there is growth, development, and evolution. From the very beginning of biology, the understanding of living structure has been inseparable from the understanding of metabolic and developmental processes. This striking property of living systems suggests process as a third criterion for a comprehensive description of the nature of life. The process of life is the activity involved in the continual embodiment of the system’s pattern of organization. Thus the process criterion is the link between pattern and structure.

The process criterion completes the conceptual framework of my synthesis. All three criteria are totally interdependent. The pattern of organization can only be recognized if it is embodied in a physical structure, and in living systems this embodiment is an ongoing process. One could say that the three criteria—pattern, structure, and process—are three different but inseparable perspectives on the phenomenon of life. They form the three conceptual dimensions of my synthesis.

What this means is that in order to define a living system—in other words, to answer Schrödinger’s question, “What is Life?”—we must answer three questions: What is the structure of a living system? What is its pattern of organization? What is the process of life? Let me now answer these questions in that order.

#### **Dissipative Structures**

The structure of a living system has been described in detail by Ilya Prigogine in his theory of dissipative structures.[^7] Like Ludwig von Bertalanffy, Prigogine recognized that living systems are open systems that are able to maintain their life processes under conditions of nonequilibrium. A living organism is characterized by continual flow and change in its metabolism, involving thousands of chemical reactions. Chemical and thermal equilibrium exists when all these processes come to a halt. In other words, an organism in equilibrium is a dead organism. Living organisms continually maintain themselves in a state far from equilibrium, which is the state of life. Although very different from equilibrium, this state is nevertheless stable: the same overall structure is maintained in spite of the ongoing flow and change of components.

Prigogine called the open systems described by his theory “dissipative structures” to emphasize this close interplay between structure on the one hand, and flow and change (or dissipation) on the other.

It turns out that not all dissipative structures are living systems, and to visualize the coexistence of continual flow and structural stability, it is easier to turn to simple, nonliving dissipative structures. One of the simplest structures of this kind is a vortex in flowing water, for example a whirlpool in a bathtub. When you let the water run out of a bathtub, you observe a whirl forming around the hole, a characteristic shape of spirals and a narrowing funnel. This characteristic shape of the whirlpool remains remarkably stable, and yet water continually flows through it.

This is what Prigogine means by dissipative structures. A cell, or any other living system, is a stable structure with matter and energy continually flowing through it, as in a whirlpool. However, the forces and processes that are at work in a cell are quite different and vastly more complex. Whereas in a whirlpool the dominant force is gravity, in the cell there are chemical interactions; there is a chemical network of metabolic processes.

According to Prigogine’s theory, dissipative structures not only maintain themselves in a stable state far from equilibrium, but may even evolve. When the flow of energy and matter through them increases, they may go through points of instability and transform themselves into new structures of increased complexity. This phenomenon—the spontaneous emergence of order—is also known as self-organization. It is the basis of development, learning, and evolution.

Prigogine’s detailed analysis of this striking phenomenon showed that, while dissipative structures receive their energy from outside, the instabilities and jumps to new forms of organization are the result of fluctuations amplified by positive feedback loops. Thus, amplifying “runaway” feedback, which had always been regarded as destructive in cybernetics, appears as a source of new order and complexity in the theory of dissipative structures.

#### **Autopoiesis**

Let me now turn to the second perspective on the nature of life, the pattern perspective. The pattern of organization of a living system is a network of relationships in which the function of each component is to transform and replace other components of the network. This pattern has been called autopoiesis by Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela.[^8] _Auto_, of course, means “self,” and _poiesis_—which is the same Greek root as in the word _poetry_—means “making.” So autopoiesis means “self-making.” The network continually “makes itself.” It is produced by its components and in turn produces those components. In a cell, for example, all the biological structures—the proteins, the DNA, the cell membrane, and so on—are continually produced, repaired, and regenerated by the cellular network. Similarly, at the level of a multicellular organism, the bodily cells are continually regenerated and recycled by the organism’s metabolic network.

#### **Cognition—The Process of Life**

The third conceptual dimension of my synthesis is the process perspective. The understanding of the life process is perhaps the most revolutionary aspect of the emerging theory of living systems, as it implies a new conception of mind, or cognition. This new conception was proposed by Gregory Bateson and elaborated more completely by Maturana and Varela, and it is now known as the Santiago theory of cognition.[^9]

The central insight of the Santiago theory is the identification of cognition, the process of knowing, with the process of life. Cognition, according to Maturana and Varela, is the activity involved in the self-generation and self- perpetuation of living networks. In other words, cognition is the very process of life. “Living systems are cognitive systems,” writes Maturana, “and living as a process is a process of cognition.”[^10]

It is obvious that we are dealing here with a radical expansion of the concept of cognition and, implicitly, the concept of mind. In this new view, cognition involves the entire process of life—including perception, emotion, and behavior—and does not necessarily require a brain and a nervous system. Plants, for example, and even bacteria, neither of which have a nervous system, are constantly engaged in cognitive activities involving their sensory apparatus and various self-organizing processes. In the human realm, cognition includes language, conceptual thought, self-awareness, and all the other attributes of human consciousness.

The Santiago theory of cognition, I believe, is the first scientific theory that overcomes the Cartesian division of mind and matter and will thus have the most far-reaching implications. Mind and matter no longer appear to belong to two separate categories, but can be seen as representing two complementary aspects of the phenomenon of life—the process aspect and the structure aspect. At all levels of life, beginning with the simplest cell, mind and matter, process and structure, are inseparably connected. Mind is immanent in living matter as the process of self-organization. For the first time, we have a scientific theory that unifies mind, matter, and life.

ESSAY 20|Complexity and Life

2002

DURING THE LAST two decades of the 20th century, a new understanding of life emerged at the forefront of science. The intellectual tradition of systemic thinking, or “systems thinking,” and the models of living systems developed during the earlier decades of the century form the conceptual and historical roots of this new scientific understanding of life.

Systemic thinking means thinking in terms of relationships, patterns, processes, and context. Over the past 25 years, this scientific tradition was raised to a new level with the development of complexity theory. Technically known as nonlinear dynamics, complexity theory is a new mathematical language and a new set of concepts for describing and modeling complex nonlinear systems. Complexity theory now offers the exciting possibility of developing a unified view of life by integrating life’s biological, cognitive, and social dimensions.[^1] In this essay, I shall review the current achievements and status of complexity theory from the perspective of the new scientific understanding of biological life.

#### **Metabolism—The Essence of Life**

Let us begin with the age-old question: What is the essential nature of life in the realm of plants, animals, and microorganisms? To understand the nature of life, it is not enough to understand DNA, proteins, and the other molecular structures that are the building blocks of living organisms, because these structures also exist in dead organisms, for example, in a dead piece of wood or bone.

The difference between a living organism and a dead organism lies in the basic process of life—in what sages and poets throughout the ages have called the “breath of life.” In modern scientific language, this process is called metabolism. It is the ceaseless flow of energy and matter through a network of chemical reactions, which enables a living organism to continually generate, repair, and perpetuate itself.[^2]

The understanding of metabolism includes two basic aspects. One is the continuous flow of energy and matter. All living systems need energy and food to sustain themselves, and all living systems produce waste. But life has evolved in such a way that organisms form communities—the ecosystems—in which the waste of one species is food for the next, so that matter cycles continually through the ecosystem.

The second aspect of metabolism is the network of chemical reactions that processes the food and forms the biochemical basis of all biological structures, functions, and behavior. The emphasis here is on “network.” One of the most important insights of the new scientific understanding of life is the recognition that networks are the basic pattern of organization of living systems. Ecosystems are organized in terms of food webs, that is, networks of organisms; organisms are networks of cells, organs, and organ systems; and cells are networks of molecules. The network is a pattern that is common to all life. Wherever we see life, we see networks.

It is important to realize that these living networks are not material structures, like a fishing net or a spider’s web. They are functional networks, networks of relationships between various processes. In a cell, for example, these processes are chemical reactions between the cell’s molecules. In a food web, the processes are processes of feeding, of organisms eating one another. In both cases the network is a nonmaterial pattern of relationships.

Closer examination of these living networks has shown that their key characteristic is that they are self-generating.[^3] In a cell, for example, all the biological structures—the proteins, the DNA, the cell membrane, and so on—are continually produced, repaired, and regenerated by the cellular network. Similarly, at the level of a multicellular organism, the bodily cells are continually regenerated and recycled by the organism’s metabolic network.

Living networks are self-generating. They continually create, or recreate, themselves by transforming or replacing their components. In this way, they undergo continual structural changes while preserving their web-like patterns of organization.

#### **Nonlinear Dynamics**

The process of metabolism can be summarized in terms of the following four key characteristics of biological life.

1. A living system is materially and energetically open; it needs to take in food and excrete waste to stay alive.

2. It operates far from equilibrium; there is a continual flow of energy and matter through the system.

3. It is organizationally closed—a metabolic network bounded by a membrane.

4. It is self-generating; each component helps to transform and replace other components.

These four characteristics all have one thing in common: they are characteristics of a system whose dynamics and pattern of organization are nonlinear. Nonequilibrium systems are described mathematically by nonlinear equations; networks are nonlinear, multidirectional, patterns of organization. This is why complexity theory is so important for understanding living systems. As its technical name “nonlinear dynamics” indicates, it is a nonlinear mathematical theory.

Nonlinear equations have properties that are strikingly different from those of the linear equations commonly used in science. In a linear differential equation, small changes produce small effects and large effects are obtained by adding up many small changes. Mathematically, this means that the sum of two solutions is again a solution, which makes linear equations relatively easy to solve. They are called linear because they can be represented on a graph by a straight line. Nonlinear equations, by contrast, are represented by graphs that are curved, are very difficult to solve, and display a host of unusual properties.

In science, until recently, we always avoided the study of nonlinear systems because of the mathematical difficulties involved in the equations describing them. Whenever nonlinear equations appeared, they were replaced by linear approximations. Instead of describing the phenomena in their full complexity, the equations of classical science deal with _small_ oscillations, _shallow_ waves, _small_ changes of temperature, and so on, for which linear equations can be formulated. This became such a habit that most scientists and engineers came to believe that virtually all natural phenomena could be described by linear equations.

The decisive change over the last 25 years has been to recognize the importance of nonlinear phenomena and to develop mathematical techniques for solving nonlinear equations. The use of computers has played a crucial role in this development. With the help of powerful, high-speed computers, mathematicians are now able to solve complex equations that had previously been intractable. In doing so, they have devised a number of techniques, a new kind of mathematical language that revealed very surprising patterns underneath the seemingly chaotic behavior of nonlinear systems, an underlying order beneath the seeming chaos.[^4]

Let me now review some of the main features of nonlinear dynamics, the theory of complexity.[^5] When you solve a nonlinear equation with these new mathematical techniques, the result is not a formula but a visual shape, a pattern traced by the computer, known as an “attractor.” An attractor is a geometrical figure in two, three, or more dimensions that represent the variables needed to describe the system. These dimensions form a mathematical space called phase space. Each point in phase space is determined by the values of the system’s variables, which in turn completely determine the state of the system.

In other words, each point in phase space represents the system in a particular state. As the system changes, the point representing it traces out a trajectory that represents the dynamics of the system. The attractor, then, is the pattern of this trajectory in phase space. It is called “attractor” because it represents the system’s long-term dynamics. A nonlinear system will typically move in a variety of ways in the beginning, depending on how it is started it off, but then will settle down to a characteristic long-term behavior, represented by the attractor. Metaphorically speaking, the trajectory is “attracted” to this pattern, whatever its starting point may have been.

Over the past 20 years, scientists and mathematicians explored a wide variety of complex systems. In case after case, they would set up nonlinear equations and have computers trace out the solutions as trajectories in phase space. To their great surprise, these researchers discovered that there is a very limited number of different attractors. Their shapes can be classified topologically, and the general dynamic properties of a system can be deduced from the shape of its attractor.

The analysis of nonlinear systems in terms of the topological features of their attractors is known as “qualitative analysis.” A nonlinear system can have several attractors, and they may be of several different types. All trajectories starting within a certain region of phase space will lead sooner or later to the same attractor. This region is called the “basin of attraction” of that attractor. Thus, the phase space of a nonlinear system is partitioned into several basins of attraction, each embedding its separate attractor.

When we try to assess the achievements and current status of complexity theory, we must remember, first of all, that nonlinear dynamics is not a scientific theory, in the sense of an empirically based analysis of natural or social phenomena. It is a _mathematical_ theory, that is, a body of mathematical concepts and techniques for the description of nonlinear systems. The most important achievement of nonlinear dynamics, in my view, is to provide the appropriate language for dealing with nonlinear systems. The key concepts of this language—chaos, attractors, fractals, qualitative analysis, and so on—did not exist 25 years ago. Now we know what kinds of questions to ask when we deal with nonlinear systems.

Having the appropriate mathematical language does not mean that we know how to construct a mathematical model in a particular case. We need to simplify a highly complex system by choosing a few relevant variables, and then we need to set up the proper equations to interconnect these variables. This is the interplay between science and mathematics. So the creation of a new language is, in my view, the overall achievement of nonlinear dynamics. And then there are partial achievements in various fields; among them I shall now concentrate on those achievements that have led to major breakthroughs in our understanding of biological life.

#### **Theory of Dissipative Structures**

The Russian-born chemist and Nobel laureate Ilya Prigogine was one of the first to use nonlinear dynamics to explore basic properties of living systems. What intrigued Prigogine most was that living organisms are able to maintain their life processes under conditions of nonequilibrium. During the 1960s, he became fascinated by systems far from equilibrium and began a detailed investigation to find out under exactly what conditions nonequilibrium situations may be stable.

The crucial breakthrough occurred when he realized that systems far from equilibrium must be described by nonlinear equations. The clear recognition of this link between “far from equilibrium” and “nonlinearity” opened an avenue of research for Prigogine that would culminate a decade later in his theory of dissipative structures, formulated in the language of nonlinear dynamics.[^6]

A living organism is an open system that maintains itself in a state far from equilibrium, and yet is stable; the same overall structure is maintained in spite of an ongoing flow and change of components. Prigogine called the open systems described by his theory dissipative structures to emphasize this close interplay between structure, on the one hand, and flow and change (or dissipation) on the other. The farther a dissipative structure is from equilibrium, the greater is its complexity and the higher is the degree of nonlinearity in the mathematical equations describing it.

The dynamics of these dissipative structures specifically include the spontaneous emergence of new forms of order. When the flow of energy increases, the system may encounter a point of instability, or bifurcation point, at which it can branch off into an entirely new state where new structures and new forms of order may emerge.

This spontaneous emergence of order at critical points of instability, often simply referred to as “emergence,” is one of the most important concepts of the new understanding of life. Emergence is one of the hallmarks of life. It has been recognized as the dynamic origin of development, learning, and evolution. In other words, creativity—the generation of new forms—is a key property of all living systems. And since emergence is an integral part of the dynamics of open systems, this means that open systems develop and evolve. Life constantly reaches out into novelty.

The theory of dissipative structures explains not only the spontaneous emergence of order, but also helps us to define complexity. Whereas traditionally the study of complexity has been a study of complex structures, the focus is now shifting from the structures to the processes of their emergence. For example, instead of defining the complexity of an organism in terms of the number of its different cell types, as biologists often do, we can define it as the number of bifurcations the embryo goes through in the organism’s development. Accordingly, the British biologist Brian Goodwin speaks of “morphological complexity.”[^7]

#### **Cell Development**

The theory of emergence, known technically as bifurcation theory, has been studied extensively by mathematicians and scientists, among them the American biologist Stuart Kauffman. Kauffman used nonlinear dynamics to construct binary models of genetic networks and was remarkably successful in predicting some key features of cell differentiation.[^8]

A binary network, also known as Boolean network, consists of nodes capable of two distinct values, conventionally labeled ON and OFF. The nodes are coupled to one another in such a way that the value of each node is determined by the prior values of neighboring nodes according to some “switching rule.”

When Kauffman studied genetic networks, he noticed that each gene in the genome is directly regulated by only a few other genes, and he also knew that genes are turned on and off in response to specific signals. In other words, genes do not simply act; they must be activated. Molecular biologists speak of patterns of gene expression. This gave Kauffman the idea of modeling genetic networks and patterns of gene expression in terms of binary networks with certain switching rules. The succession of ON-OFF states in these models is associated with a trajectory in phase space and is classified in terms of different types of attractors.

Extensive examination of a wide variety of complex binary networks has shown that they exhibit three broad regimes of behavior: an ordered regime with frozen components (i.e., nodes that remain either ON or OFF), a chaotic regime with no frozen components (i.e., nodes switching back and forth between ON and OFF), and a boundary region between order and chaos where frozen components just begin to change.

Kauffman’s central hypothesis is that living systems exist in that boundary region near the so-called edge of chaos. He believes that natural selection may favor and sustain living systems at the edge of chaos, because these may be best able to coordinate complex and flexible behavior. To test his hypothesis, Kauffman applied his model to the genetic networks in living organisms and was able to derive from it several surprising and rather accurate predictions.

In terms of complexity theory, the development of an organism is characterized by a series of bifurcations, each corresponding to a new cell type. Each cell type corresponds to a different pattern of gene expression, and hence to a different attractor. The human genome contains between 30,000 and 100,000 genes. In a binary network of that size, the possibilities of different patterns of gene expression are astronomical. However, Kauffman could show that at the edge of chaos, the number of attractors in such a network is approximately equal to the square root of the number of its elements. Therefore, the human network of genes should express itself in approximately 245 different cell types. This number comes remarkably close to the 254 distinct cell types identified in humans.

Kauffman also tested his attractor model with predictions of the number of cell types for various other species, and again the agreement with the actual numbers observed was very good. Another prediction of Kauffman’s attractor model concerns the stability of cell types. Since the frozen core of the binary network is identical for all attractors, all cell types in an organism should express mostly the same set of genes and should differ by the expressions of only a small percentage of genes. This is indeed the case for all living organisms.

In view of the fact that these binary models of genetic networks are quite crude, and that Kauffman’s predictions are derived from the models’ very general features, the agreement with the observed data must be seen as a remarkable success of nonlinear dynamics.

#### **Morphology**

A very rich and promising area for complexity theory in biology is the study of the origin of biological form, known as morphology. This is a field of study that was very lively in the 18th century, but then was eclipsed by the mechanistic approach to biology, until it made a comeback very recently with the emphasis in nonlinear dynamics on patterns and shapes.

A key insight of the new understanding of life has been that biological forms are not determined by a “genetic blueprint,” but are emergent properties of an entire epigenetic network of metabolic processes. To understand the emergence of biological form, we must understand not only the genetic structures and the cell’s biochemistry, but also the complex dynamics that unfold when the epigenetic network encounters the physical and chemical constraints of its environment. In this encounter, the interactions between the organism’s physical and chemical variables are highly complex and can be represented in simplified models by nonlinear equations. The solutions of these equations, represented by a limited number of attractors, correspond to the limited number of possible biological forms. This technique has been applied to a variety of biological forms, from branching patterns of plants and the coloring of sea shells to the nest building of termites.[^9]

A good example is the work of Brian Goodwin, who used nonlinear dynamics to model the stages of development of a single-celled Mediterranean alga, called _Acetabularia_, which forms beautiful little “parasol” caps.[^10] Like the cells of all plants and animals, the cell of this alga is shaped and sustained by its cytoskeleton, a complex and intricate structure of protein filaments. The cytoskeleton is subject to various mechanical stresses, and it turns out that a key influence on its mechanical state—its rigidity or softness—is the calcium concentration in the cell. The cytoskeleton is anchored to the cell wall, and its behavior under the mechanical stresses, therefore, gives rise to the alga’s biological form.

Since the mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton at the molecular level are far too complex to be described mathematically, Goodwin and his colleagues approximated them by a continuous field, known in physics as a stress-tensor field. They were then able to set up nonlinear equations that interrelate patterns of calcium concentration in the alga’s cell fluid with the mechanical properties of the cell walls.

These equations contain numerous parameters, such as the diffusion constant for calcium, the resistance of the cytoskeleton to deformation, and so on. In nature, these quantities are determined genetically and change from species to species, so that different species produce different biological forms.

Goodwin and his colleagues proceeded to try out a variety of parameters in computer simulations to explore the types of form that a developing alga could produce. They succeeded in simulating a whole sequence of structures that appear in the alga’s development of its characteristic stalk and parasol. These forms emerged as successive bifurcations of the attractors representing the interplay between patterns of calcium and mechanical strain.

The lesson to be learned from these models of plant morphology is that biological form emerges from the nonlinear dynamics of the organism’s epigenetic network as it interacts with the physical constraints of its molecular structures. The genes do not provide a blueprint for biological forms. They provide the initial conditions that determine which kind of dynamics—or, mathematically, which kind of attractors—will appear in a given species. In this way, genes stabilize the emergence of biological form.

#### **Developmental Stability**

From the origin of biological form, I shall now turn to the development of an embryo.[^11] Complexity theory may shed new light on an intriguing property of biological development that was discovered almost a hundred years ago by the German embryologist Hans Driesch. With a series of careful experiments on sea urchin eggs, Driesch showed that he could destroy several cells in the very early stages of the embryo, and it would still grow into a full, mature sea urchin. Similarly, more recent genetic experiments have shown that “knocking out” single genes, even when they were thought to be essential, had very little effect on the functioning of the organism.

This very remarkable stability and robustness of biological development means that an embryo may start from different initial stages—for example, if single genes or entire cells are destroyed accidentally—but will nevertheless reach the same mature form that is characteristic of its species. The question is, What keeps development on track?

There is an emerging consensus among genetic researchers that this robustness indicates a redundancy in genetic and metabolic pathways. It seems that cells maintain multiple pathways for the production of essential cellular structures and the support of essential metabolic processes. This redundancy ensures not only the remarkable stability of biological development but also great flexibility and adaptability to unexpected environmental changes. Genetic and metabolic redundancy may be seen, perhaps, as the equivalent of biodiversity in ecosystems. It seems that life has evolved ample diversity and redundancy at all levels of complexity.

The observation of genetic redundancy is in stark contradiction to genetic determinism, and in particular to the metaphor of the “selfish gene” proposed by the British biologist Richard Dawkins.[^12] According to Dawkins, genes behave as if they were selfish by constantly competing, via the organisms they produce, to leave more copies of themselves.[^13] From this reductionist perspective, the widespread existence of redundant genes makes no evolutionary sense. From a systemic point of view, by contrast, we recognize that natural selection operates not on individual genes but on the organism’s patterns of self-organization. In other words, what is selected by nature is not the individual gene but the endurance of the organism’s life cycle.

The existence of multiple pathways is an essential property of all networks; it may even be seen as the defining characteristic of a network. It is therefore not surprising that complexity theory, which is eminently suited to the analysis of networks, should contribute important insights into the nature of developmental stability.

In the language of nonlinear dynamics, the process of biological development is seen as a continuous unfolding of a nonlinear system as the embryo forms out of an extended domain of cells.[^14] This “cell sheet” has certain dynamical properties that give rise to a sequence of deformations and foldings as the embryo emerges. The entire process can be represented mathematically by a trajectory in phase space moving inside a basin of attraction toward an attractor that describes the functioning of the organism in its stable adult form.

A characteristic property of complex nonlinear systems is that they display a certain “structural stability.” A basin of attraction can be disturbed or deformed without changing the system’s basic characteristics. In the case of a developing embryo, this means that the initial conditions of the process can be changed to some extent without seriously disturbing development as a whole. Thus developmental stability, which seems quite mysterious from the perspective of genetic determinism, is recognized as a consequence of a very basic property of complex nonlinear systems.

#### **Origin of Life**

The last example of my review of applications of complexity theory to problems in biology is not about an actual achievement but about the potential for a major breakthrough in solving an old scientific puzzle—the question of the origin of life on Earth.[^15]

Ever since Darwin, scientists have debated the likelihood of life emerging from a primordial “chemical soup” that formed four billion years ago when the planet cooled off and the primeval oceans expanded. The idea that small molecules should assemble spontaneously into structures of ever increasing complexity runs counter to all conventional experience with simple chemical systems. Many scientists have therefore argued that the odds of such prebiotic evolution are vanishingly small, or, alternatively, that there must have been an extraordinary triggering event, such as a seeding of the Earth with macromolecules by meteorites.

Today, our starting position for resolving this puzzle is radically different. Scientists working in this field have come to recognize that the flaw of the conventional argument lies in the idea that life must have emerged out of a chemical soup through progressive increase of molecular complexity. The new thinking begins from the hypothesis that very early on, _before_ the increase of molecular complexity, certain molecules assembled into primitive membranes that spontaneously formed closed bubbles, and that the evolution of molecular complexity took place inside these bubbles, rather than in a structureless chemical soup.

It turns out that small bubbles, known to chemists as vesicles, form spontaneously when there is a mixture of oil and water, as we can easily observe when we put oil and water together and shake the mixture. Indeed, the Italian biochemist Pier Luigi Luisi and his colleagues at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology have repeatedly prepared appropriate “water-and-soap” environments in which vesicles with primitive membranes, made of fatty substances known as lipids, formed spontaneously.[^16]

The biologist Harold Morowitz has developed a detailed scenario for prebiotic evolution along these lines.[^17] He points out that the formation of membrane-bounded vesicles in the primeval oceans created two different environments—an outside and an inside—in which compositional differences could develop. The internal volume of a vesicle provides a closed micro-environment in which directed chemical reactions can occur, which means that molecules that are normally rare may be formed in great quantities. These molecules include in particular the building blocks of the membrane itself, which become incorporated into the existing membrane, so that the whole membrane area increases. At some point in this growth process, the stabilizing forces are no longer able to maintain the membrane’s integrity, and the vesicle breaks up into two or more smaller bubbles.

These processes of growth and replication will occur only if there is a flow of energy and matter through the membrane. Morowitz describes a plausible scenario of how this might have happened. The vesicle membranes are semipermeable, and thus various small molecules can enter the bubbles or be incorporated into the membrane. Among those will be so-called chromophores, molecules that absorb sunlight. Their presence creates electric potentials across the membrane, and thus the vesicle becomes a device that converts light energy into electric potential energy. Once this system of energy conversion is in place, it becomes possible for a continuous flow of energy to drive the chemical processes inside the vesicle.

At this point, we see that two defining characteristics of cellular life are manifest in rudimentary form in these primitive membrane-bounded bubbles. The vesicles are open systems subject to continual flows of energy and matter, while their interiors are relatively closed spaces in which networks of chemical reactions are likely to develop. We can recognize these two properties as the roots of living networks and their dissipative structures.

Now the stage is set for prebiotic evolution. In a large population of vesicles there will be many differences in their chemical properties and structural components. If these differences persist when the bubbles divide, we can speak of “species” of vesicles, and since these species will compete for energy and various molecules from their environment, a kind of Darwinian dynamics of competition and natural selection will take place, in which molecular accidents may be amplified and selected for their “evolutionary” advantages.

Thus we see that a variety of purely physical and chemical mechanisms provides the membrane-bounded vesicles with the potential to “evolve” through natural selection into complex, self-producing structures without enzymes or genes in these early stages. A dramatic increase in molecular complexity must have occurred when catalysts, based on nitrogen, entered the system, because catalysts create complex chemical networks by interlinking different reactions. Once this happens, the entire nonlinear dynamics of networks, including the spontaneous emergence of new forms of order, comes into play.

The final step in the emergence of life was the evolution of proteins, nucleic acids, and the genetic code. At present, the details of this stage are still quite mysterious. However, must remember that the evolution of catalytic networks within the closed spaces of the protocells created a new type of network chemistry that is still very poorly understood. This is where complexity theory could lead to decisive new insights. We can expect that the application of nonlinear dynamics to these complex chemical networks will shed considerable light on the last phase of prebiotic evolution.

Indeed, Morowitz points out that the analysis of the chemical pathways from small molecules to amino acids reveals an extraordinary set of correlations that seem to suggest, as he puts it, a “deep network logic” in the development of the genetic code. The future understanding of this network logic may become one of the greatest achievements of complexity theory in biology.

ESSAY 21|_Arcadia_ and the Science of Complexity

2013

#### **The Dilemma of 19th-Century Science**

The scientific ideas underlying the play _Arcadia_ concern a fundamental dilemma that arose in science in the 19th century and was resolved only during the last 40 years. In the play, the young genius Thomasina is credited both with the discovery of the dilemma and with some key aspects of the solution.[^1]

To understand the dilemma, we must see it against the background of classical Newtonian science. Newtonian mechanics was a science of billiard balls, of forces and trajectories, in which the world was seen as completely causal and determinate. All that happened had a definite cause and gave rise to a definite effect. The future of any part of the system, as well as its past, could in principle be calculated with absolute certainty if its state at any given time was known in all details.

In the play, Valentine tells us:

There was someone, forget his name, 1820s, who pointed out that from Newton’s laws you could predict everything to come—I mean, you’d need a computer as big as the universe but the formula would exist.

This “someone” was Pierre Simon Laplace. He is paraphrased by Thomasina:

If you could stop every atom in its position . . .

The original passage by Laplace is one of the most famous quotations in science:

An intellect which at a given instant knew all the forces acting in nature, and the position of all things of which the world consists—supposing the said intellect were vast enough to subject these data to analysis—would embrace in the same formula the motions of the greatest bodies in the universe and those of the slightest atoms; nothing would be uncertain for it, and the future, like the past, would be present to its eyes.[^2]

In this Laplacian determinism, there is no difference between the past and the future. Both are implicit in the present state of the world and in the Newtonian equations of motion. All processes are strictly reversible. Both future and past are interchangeable; there is no room for history, novelty, or creativity.

Now, it was noticed in classical Newtonian physics that there are irreversible effects in nature, such as friction. In any machine, there is friction between moving parts, which involves a dissipation of energy into heat. This heat cannot be recovered. The process cannot be reversed. However, in classical physics, these heat losses were considered very small and were simply neglected. In the 19th century, this situation changed dramatically. With the invention of heat engines, the irreversibility of heat losses—that is, the dissipation of energy—became the central focus of the new science of thermodynamics.

Thomasina says in the play:

It concerns your heat engine. Improve it as you will, you can never get out of it what you put in. It repays eleven pence in the shilling at most.

The irreversibility of energy dissipation means that natural processes always go in a certain direction, toward more and more dissipation of energy. This is the famous second law of thermodynamics, the law of the dissipation of energy. It says that there is a trend in physical phenomena from order to disorder. There are two references to this in the play. It is first mentioned by Thomasina:

If you stir backward, the jam will not come together again . . .

The second reference comes in an exchange between Valentine and Hannah:

Your tea gets cold by itself, it doesn’t get hot by itself . . .

With the second law, thermodynamics introduced the idea of an “arrow of time,” into science. According to the second law, some mechanical energy is always dissipated into heat that cannot be completely recovered. As Thomasina explains,

Newton’s equations go forwards and backwards, they do not care which way. But the heat equation cares very much, it goes only one way.

This is elaborated further in the dialogue between Hannah and Valentine:

What did she see?—That you can’t run the film backwards . . .

The consequences of the second law of thermodynamics, according to its 19th-century interpreters, are that the entire world-machine is running down and will eventually grind to a halt. In the play, Hannah speaks about

the melancholy certitude of a world without light or life . . . as a wooden stove that must consume itself until ash and stove are as one, and heat is gone from the earth.

However, physicists and engineers were not the only ones who thought about the arrow of time in the 19th century. This was a time when geologists, biologists, philosophers, and poets all began to think about change, growth, development, and evolution. Nineteenth-century thought was deeply concerned with the nature of becoming.

And here the fundamental dilemma appeared. The grim picture of cosmic evolution painted by the physicists—an engine that is slowly running down and grinding to a halt—was in sharp contrast to the evolutionary thinking of the biologists, who observed that the living universe evolves from disorder to order, toward states of ever increasing complexity.

At the end of the 19th century, then, Newtonian mechanics, the science of eternal, reversible trajectories, had been supplemented by two diametrically opposed views of evolutionary change—that of a living world unfolding toward increasing order and complexity, and that of an engine running down, a world of ever increasing disorder. Who was right, the physicists or the biologists?

#### **The New Mathematics of Complexity**

In the 20th century, scientists came to realize that evolutionary thinking—thinking in terms of change, growth, and development—required a new science of complexity. Attempts to formulate such a new science were made during the first half of the century, but the breakthrough came only in the 1960s and ’70s, when a new mathematics was developed that could deal with the complexity exhibited by developing and evolving systems.[^3]

In the play, the dilemma of the two views of evolution is never fully stated, and the key property of the mathematics that is needed to solve it is not explained. But all of this is hinted at; it is all implicit in the dialogues. _Arcadia_ is such an exciting play for a scientist, because all the references to the new mathematics and science of complexity are absolutely right on. As far as I can see, there are no conceptual errors.

To understand the significance of the new mathematics of complexity, we must take a brief excursion into the history of mathematics. In the 17th century, scientists had two different mathematical languages at their disposal to solve problems and formulate theories. One was geometry, developed by the Greeks; the other was algebra, invented in India and developed further by Islamic mathematicians in Persia.

Elementary algebra involves equations in which letters—by convention taken from the beginning of the alphabet—stand for various constant numbers. A well-known example, which you may remember from your school years, is the equation

(a+b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2

Higher algebra involves relationships, called functions, between unknown variable numbers, or variables, which are denoted by letters taken by convention from the end of the alphabet. For example, in the equation

y = x + 1

the variable y is said to be “a function of x.”

So at the time of Galileo, there were two different approaches to solving mathematical problems—geometry and algebra—which came from different cultures. These two approaches were unified by René Descartes, who is usually regarded as the founder of modern philosophy and who was also a brilliant mathematician. Descartes invented a method to make algebraic formulas and equations visible as geometric shapes. The method is now known as analytic geometry. It involves so-called Cartesian coordinates, the coordinate system invented by Descartes and named after him. For example, when the relationship between the two variables x and y in our previous example, the equation y = x + 1, is pictured in a graph with Cartesian coordinates, it looks like this:

![[f0231-01.png]]

Figure 10. Graph corresponding to the equation y = x + 1.

For any point on the straight line, the value of the y-coordinate is always one unit more than that of the x-coordinate. We see that the equation corresponds to a straight line. This is why equations of this type are called linear equations.

Similarly, the equation y = x2 is represented by a parabola:

![[f0232-01.png]]

Figure 11. Graph corresponding to the equation y = x2.

For any point on the parabola, the y-coordinate is equal to the square of the x-coordinate. Equations of this type, corresponding to curves in the Cartesian grid, are called nonlinear equations. They have the distinguishing feature that one or several of their variables are squared or raised to higher powers.

With Descartes’s new method, the laws of physics could be expressed either in algebraic form as equations, or in geometric form as visual shapes. This task was completed by Isaac Newton, who described all possible motions of solid bodies in terms of a set of equations, which are known as “Newton’s equations of motion.” These equations form the mathematical foundation of classical physics.

Newton’s equations were a triumphant success. In practice, however, the limitations of modeling nature through these equations of motion soon became apparent. To _set up_ the equations is one thing; to _solve_ them is quite another. Exact solutions were restricted to a few simple and regular phenomena, while the complexity of vast areas of nature seemed to elude all mathematical modeling. For example, the relative motion of two bodies under the force of gravity could be calculated precisely; that of three bodies was already too difficult for an exact solution, and when it came to gases with millions of particles, the situation seemed hopeless.

In particular, scientists soon discovered that the phenomena that were too complex for exact mathematical solutions corresponded to nonlinear equations of motion. Since these equations were too complex to be solved, and because of the seemingly chaotic nature of the associated physical phenomena—such as turbulent flows of water and air—scientists generally avoided the study of nonlinear systems.

So whenever nonlinear equations appeared, they were immediately “linearized,” that is, replaced by linear approximations. Thus, instead of describing the phenomena in their full complexity, the equations of classical science deal with _small_ oscillations, _shallow_ waves, _small_ changes of temperature, and so on, for which linear equations can be formulated. This became such a habit that most scientists and engineers came to believe that virtually all natural phenomena could be described by linear equations.

The decisive change over the last three decades has been to recognize the importance of nonlinear phenomena and to develop mathematical techniques for solving nonlinear equations. The use of large high-speed computers has played a crucial role in the new mastery of complexity. As Valentine puts it in the play,

The electronic calculator was what the telescope was for Galileo.

With the help of powerful, high-speed computers, mathematicians are now able to solve complex equations that had previously been intractable and to trace out the solutions as curves in a graph. In this way they discovered new qualitative patterns of behavior of those complex systems, a new level of order underlying the seeming chaos.

In the play, Valentine describes the situation as follows:

Then maths left the real world behind . . .

There are two main branches of this new mathematics of complexity: chaos theory and fractal geometry. They were discovered and developed independently, but now we know that they are closely related. The mathematical structures of chaos theory (“strange attractors”) exhibit a fractal geometry. In the play, the main emphasis is on fractal geometry, but there are also some references to chaos theory.

#### **Iterations**

An important property of many nonlinear equations are self-reinforcing feedback processes, in which the result of an operation is fed back into the equation and run through the operation again. Mathematicians call such a repeated circular process an iteration, which is Latin for “repetition.” It is defined as a function operating repeatedly on itself.

For example, if the function consists in multiplying the variable x by 3, for example,

y = 3x

the iteration consists in repeated multiplications. In mathematical shorthand, this is written as

x —> 3x

3x —> 9x

9x —> 27x

etc.

Here is how Valentine describes this procedure in the play:

What she’s doing is, every time she works out a value for y, she’s using _that_ as her next value for x . . .

In mathematics, any rule or procedure for solving a problem is called an algorithm. Like _algebra, algorithm_ is an Arabic word, actually derived from the name of an Arabian mathematician. So the procedure of iteration is an algorithm. As Valentine says, somewhat fancifully, “It’s an iterated algorithm.”

An iteration found very often in nonlinear systems, which is very simple and yet produces a wealth of complexity, is the following:

x —> kx(1-x)

The procedure is the same as before, except that in addition to multiplying the variable x by k, you have to multiply the result by (1-x) before repeating the process. This iteration has many important applications. It is used by ecologists to describe the growth of a population under opposing tendencies—a high birthrate combined with a high death rate—and is therefore also known as the “growth equation.” Here is how Valentine describes it:

It’s how you look at population changes in biology. Goldfish in a pond, say . . .

#### **Fractal Geometry**

Iterative procedures are a crucial aspect of fractal geometry. This is a new type of geometry, invented by the French mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot to describe a variety of irregular natural phenomena. In the play, this is Thomasina’s big discovery:

I, Thomasina Cloverly, have found a truly wonderful method . . .

This is how Low Mandelbrot describes this new geometry of irregular forms:

Most of nature is very, very complicated. How could one describe a cloud? A cloud is not a sphere. . . . It is like a ball but very irregular. A mountain? A mountain is not a cone. . . . If you want to speak of clouds, of mountains, of rivers, of lightning, the geometric language of school is inadequate.[^4]

Compare this to two other passages in the play:

THOMASINA: . . . Mountains are not pyramids and trees are not cones . . . There is another geometry which I am engaged in discovering.

VALENTINE: . . . In an ocean of ashes, islands of order. Patterns making themselves out of nothing.

I can also hear a lot of Mandelbrot in the excited speech by Valentine where he says:

The ordinary-sized stuff which is our lives, the things people write poetry about: clouds, daffodils, waterfalls . . .

To model the fractal shapes that occur in nature, geometric figures can be constructed that exhibit precise self-similarity. The principal technique for constructing these mathematical fractals is iteration, i.e. repeating a certain geometric operation again and again. With the help of computers, this can easily be done thousands of times at different scales to produce so-called fractal forgeries—computer-generated models of plants, trees, mountains, coastlines, etc., which bear an astonishing resemblance to the actual shapes found in nature. This is what Hannah is referring to when she asks:

So you couldn’t make a picture of this leaf by iterating a whatsit?

And then Valentine gets really excited:

If you knew the algorithm and fed it back . . .

#### **Complex Numbers**

The culmination of fractal geometry has been Mandelbrot’s discovery of a mathematical structure that is of awesome complexity and yet can be generated with a very simple iterative procedure. To understand this amazing fractal figure, known as the Mandelbrot set, we need to first familiarize ourselves with the concept of complex numbers. You will probably remember that all integers, positive and negative, can be represented as points on a “number line:”

![[f0237-01.png]]

Figure 12. The number line.

Fractions (e.g., 3/2) and irrational numbers (e.g., √ 2) occupy points between the integers on the same number line. So this number line is very densely populated—in fact, infinitely densely populated—with integers, fractions, and irrational numbers.

In the past, mathematicians thought that this covered all possible numbers, but then they realized that something like √-4 could not be placed anywhere on the number line. We know that 2 × 2 = 4, so √4 = 2. We also know that (-2) × (-2) = 4; so √4 is also equal to -2. But what is √-4 ? It is neither +2 nor -2. What kind of number is it?

Since the square root of a negative number cannot be placed anywhere on the number line, mathematicians up to the 19th century did not ascribe any sense of reality to those quantities. Descartes called them imaginary numbers; other mathematicians used terms like _fictitious, sophisticated_, or _impossible_ to label those quantities. Today, following Descartes, we still call the square roots of negative numbers imaginary numbers, while all other numbers are called real numbers.

In the 19th century, one of the greatest mathematicians, Carl Friedrich Gauss, finally resolved the problem. He realized that there was no room for imaginary numbers anywhere on the number line, and so he took the bold step of placing them on a perpendicular axis through the point zero, thus creating a Cartesian coordinate system. In this system, all real numbers are placed on the “real axis” and all imaginary numbers on the “imaginary axis.”

The square root of -1 is called the “imaginary unit” and given the symbol _i_. All imaginary numbers can be placed on the imaginary axis as multiples of _i_. With this ingenious device, Gauss created a home not only for imaginary numbers but also for all possible combinations of real and imaginary numbers, like (2+_i_), (3-_i_), and so on. Such combinations are called complex numbers and are represented by points in the plane spanned by the real and imaginary axes, which is called the complex plane. This is what Valentine refers to when he mumbles something about “the set of points on a complex plane made by . . .”

![[f0238-01.png]]

Figure 13. The complex plane.

In general, any complex number can be written as

z = x + iy

where x is called the real part and y the imaginary part.

#### **The Mandelbrot Set**

Now let’s return to Mandelbrot. What he discovered was that the most amazing fractal shapes can be generated by very simple iterative procedures in the complex plane. Actually, these shapes had been discovered by another French mathematician, Gaston Julia, half a century before and are known as Julia sets. But they had soon faded into obscurity, because Julia’s drawings were very primitive, lacking the help of a computer.

The rediscovery of Julia’s fractal shapes by Mandelbrot is the model for the rediscovery of Thomasina’s fractals by Valentine:

It’s Thomasina’s. I just pushed her equations through the computer a few million times further than she managed to do with her pencil.

That’s exactly what Mandelbrot did with the Julia sets. And accordingly, Valentine calls one such set that he is playing with the Coverly set.

There are an infinite number of Julia sets. Their rich variety of forms, many of which are reminiscent of living things, is amazing enough. But the real magic begins when we magnify the contour of any portion of a Julia set. As in the case of a cloud or coastline, the same richness is displayed across all scales. With increasing resolution, more and more details of the fractal contour appear, revealing a fantastic sequence of patterns within patterns—all similar without ever being identical.

When Mandelbrot analyzed different mathematical representations of Julia sets in the late seventies and tried to classify their immense variety, he discovered a very simple way of creating a single image in the complex plane that would serve as a catalogue of all possible Julia sets. That image, which has since become the principal visual symbol of the new mathematics of complexity, is the Mandelbrot set.

![[f0240-01.jpg]]

Figure 14. The Mandelbrot set.

While there are an infinite number of Julia sets, the Mandelbrot set is unique. This strange figure is the most complex mathematical object ever invented. Although the rules for its construction are very simple, the variety and complexity it reveals upon close inspection is unbelievable. A visual journey into the Mandelbrot set is an unforgettable experience.

Stoppard’s play _Arcadia_ is funny, moving, and exciting at many levels. I hope I was able to show you that the emotional excitement of the characters often mirrors the excitement scientists have felt since the discovery of complexity theory. The new mathematics of complexity is making more and more people realize that mathematics is much more than dry formulas, that the understanding of pattern is crucial to understand the living world around us, and that all questions of pattern, order, and complexity are essentially mathematical.

## The Full Synthesis

AFTER THE PUBLICATION of _The Web of Life_ in 1996, I began to be invited, with increasing frequency, to speak to managers and other business executives who were interested in applying a systems perspective to business organizations. This led me to extend the systems view of life to the social domain, which was still missing from my synthesis. The conceptual framework presented in _The Web of Life_ includes life’s biological, cognitive, and ecological dimensions, but it does not include the social dimension.

Adding the social dimension and integrating it with the other three required considerable effort and involved countless discussions with social scientists and organizational theorists during the late 1990s. Among those, extended discussions with organizational theorist Margaret Wheatley and with sociologist Manuel Castells exerted major influences on my thinking.

While I explored the extension of the systems view of life to the social domain, I also deepened my understanding of life’s biological dimension, and in particular of the origin of life on Earth. My introduction to this fascinating subject was the book _Beginnings of Cellular Life_ by Harold Morowitz, which was recommended to me by Lynn Margulis.[^1]

In this wonderful little book, Morowitz proposes a radically new scenario for the origin of life. He suggests that cellular life is rooted in a universal physics and chemistry, which existed long before the evolution of the first living cells, and that the increase in molecular complexity did not occur in a structureless “chemical soup” but rather within closed bubbles formed by primitive membranes (see my summary of this scenario in essay 20]]).

My understanding of Morowitz’s scenario for “prebiotic” evolution was deepened considerably when I met one of the world experts on the origin of life, biochemist Pier Luigi Luisi. I was introduced to Luisi in 1997 by our common friend Francisco Varela. When I asked Varela one day who else, besides Maturana and himself, was working on autopoiesis, he told me, “There is this biochemist Luisi at the Swiss Polytechnic in Zurich, who not only works on the theory but actually creates autopoietic chemical systems in the laboratory. You should meet him.”

So I wrote to Luisi, who responded very kindly, and during the subsequent months, we engaged in a long and stimulating correspondence (often via a flurry of faxes), discussing various ideas about autopoiesis, cognition, the origin of life, and other aspects of the emerging systems view of life. Over the years, Luisi and I often met in Zurich, Rome, and in other places and formed a close friendship, and many years later, we cowrote _The Systems View of Life_, which we dedicated to the memory of Francisco Varela who had inspired both of us “with his systemic vision and his spiritual orientation.”[^2] Along with Maturana, Varela, and Margulis, Pier Luigi Luisi has been the most important influence on my thinking about the biological dimension of life.

In my discussions with social scientists about a systemic conception of life in the social domain, I soon encountered two major problems. The first was that living social systems, even though networks, are networks of communications, existing not only in the physical domain but also in a symbolic social domain. There is a whole “inner world” of concepts, ideas, and symbols that arises with human consciousness, language, and culture. Given the simultaneous existence of social systems in these two domains, the physical and the social, the question arises: is it meaningful to apply the concept of autopoiesis to them at all, and if so, in which domain should it be applied?

After several years of discussions with social scientists, I found a way to integrate the systemic understanding of social networks into my synthesis. The key was the realization that most social phenomena—rules of behavior, values, goals, power relations, and so on—are based, ultimately on the ability of human consciousness to form abstract mental _resources/books//Patterns of Connection_ Essential Essays F - Fritjof Capra. These mental _resources/books//Patterns of Connection_ Essential Essays F - Fritjof Capra become the symbols, ideas, values, and goals of our inner world. This insight led me to add a fourth perspective on life to my synthesis, the perspective of meaning, using “meaning” as a shorthand notation for our inner world of reflective consciousness and culture.

My discussions with social scientists revealed a second problem of a more technical nature. It turns out that social theorists have traditionally used the term _structure_ in a sense that is quite different from that in the natural sciences. In the past, _social structure_ was used somewhat in the way I use _pattern of organization_, and today sociologists generally define social structure as a set of rules enacted in social practices.

After a long period of confusion I solved this problem by slightly modifying my terminology. Instead of speaking of pattern and structure, I now use the more general concepts of form and matter. A full understanding of social phenomena, then, must involve the integration of four perspectives—form, matter, process, and meaning. This is the essence of the conceptual framework of my full synthesis, which I published in 2002 in my book _The Hidden Connections_.[^3] In this book, I also discuss many social and political implications of the systems view of life. In fact, only a third of the book is theory. Two-thirds are dedicated to extensive discussions of social, technological, and political implications—management, biotechnology, global capitalism, sustainability, ecodesign, and so on. The first two essays in this chapter are representative examples of these discussions.

Essay 22]], based on two articles published in 2003 and 2004, presents a concise summary of my full synthesis, as published in _The Hidden Connections_. Beginning with biology, I identify metabolism as a central characteristic of life, and I discuss the critical role of cell membranes as boundaries of identity. I then turn to the two basic aspects of metabolism—networks and flows—describing the first in terms of the theory of autopoiesis and cognition, and the second in terms of the theory of dissipative structures. I show how my synthesis, essentially, amounts to an integration of these two theories.

Finally, I show how this integrated conceptual framework can be extended to the social dimension by adding the perspective of meaning to the three perspectives of form, matter, and process. I end the essay with a detailed analysis of the similarities and differences between biological and social networks, and I conclude that a unified conceptual framework for the understanding of material and social structures, such as the one I am proposing, will be essential for building ecologically sustainable communities.

In essay 23]], based on a lecture and an article for the Italian Slow Food movement, I discuss the vital importance of food and water for biological life. I identify metabolism as life’s central characteristic and point out that by definition, metabolism involves the intake, digestion, and transformation of food. I show how in microorganisms, cellular identity is shaped and sustained by the intake of food, and how multicellular organisms are classified according to their methods of acquiring food. With human evolution, food acquired a cultural dimension in both senses of the term _culture_. It began to be cultivated, and it was shared in cultural rituals and ceremonies.

My discussions of water and life includes the symbolic significance of water as the medium carrying spiritual life. I end on a political note, arguing that access to clean and safe water is integral to the first and most basic human right to “life, liberty, and security of person.”

The last essay in this chapter, essay 24]], is a review of a wonderful documentary film by Thomas Riedelsheimer about the work of the Scottish sculptor Andy Goldsworthy.[^4] Throughout my life, I have always sought the company of artists. I came to realize early on that there is hardly anything more effective than the arts for developing and refining our natural ability to recognize and express patterns. Thus, my explorations of life’s patterns and processes, of chaos and creativity, involved inspiring dialogues not only with scientists and philosophers, but also with painters, poets, dancers, musicians, and actors—including such famous artists as Ali Akbar Khan, Gordon Onslow Ford, Liv Ullmann, Terrence Stamp, Alarmel Valli, and Lawrence Ferlinghetti.

Andy Goldsworthy is one of my favorite visual artists. He works with stone, branches, leaves, ice, and other natural materials to create works of breathtaking beauty. I met Goldsworthy in 1998 when he gave a guest lecture at one of my courses at Schumacher College, and we have been in touch, on and off, since then. The image of one of his iconic works graces the cover of my textbook _The Systems View of Life_.

In my review of the film, I show how the artist’s sculptures, always in great harmony with the environment, express his intuitive understanding of the essential dynamics of life. Like nature’s own forms, Goldsworthy’s sculptures are transient, subject to continual change, transformation, and decay. Indeed, his main concern is with growth, time, change, and the idea of flow in nature. Reviewing the film in detail, I show how Goldsworthy’s art is a profound statement about life’s dynamic qualities.

ESSAY 22|The Nature of Life

### _Integrating Biological, Cognitive, and Social Dimensions_

2004

THIS ESSAY IS a summary of my synthesis of a new systemic conception of life that is now emerging at the forefront of science—an integrated conceptual framework for the understanding of the biological, cognitive, and social dimensions of life, which I proposed in my recent book _The Hidden Connections_.[^1]

#### **Metabolism—the “Breath of Life”**

Let me begin with biology and ask, What is the essential nature of life in the realm of plants, animals, and microorganisms? To understand the nature of life, it is not enough to understand DNA, genes, proteins, and the other molecular structures that are the building blocks of living organisms, because these structures also exist in dead organisms, for example, in a dead piece of wood or bone.

The difference between a living organism and a dead organism lies in the basic process of life—in what sages and poets throughout the ages have called the breath of life. In modern scientific language, this process of life is called metabolism. It is the ceaseless flow of energy and matter through a network of chemical reactions, which enables a living organism to continually generate, repair, and perpetuate itself.

In order maintain themselves effectively, living organisms must be able to discriminate between the system—the “self,” as it were—and its environment. This is why all living organisms have a physical boundary. Cells, for example, are enclosed by membranes, and vertebrate animals by skins. Many cells also have other boundaries besides membranes, such as rigid cell walls or capsules, but only membranes are a universal feature of cellular life. Within the membrane, there is a network of metabolic reactions by which the system sustains itself.

Since its beginning, life on Earth has been associated with water. Bacteria move in water, and the metabolism inside their membranes takes place in a watery environment. In such fluid surroundings, a cell could never persist as a distinct entity without a physical barrier against free diffusion. The existence of membranes is therefore an essential condition for cellular life.

A cell membrane is always active, opening and closing continually, keeping certain substances out and letting others in. In particular, the cell’s metabolic reactions involve a variety of ions, and the membrane, by being semipermeable, controls their proportions and keeps them in balance. Another critical activity of the membrane is to continually pump out excessive calcium waste, so that the calcium remaining within the cell is kept at the precise, very low level required for its metabolic functions. All these activities help to maintain the cellular network as a distinct entity and protect it from harmful environmental influences. The boundaries of living networks, then, are not boundaries of separation but boundaries of identity.

#### **Networks and Flows**

The understanding of metabolism includes two basic aspects. One is the continuous flow of energy and matter. All living systems need energy and food to sustain themselves, and all living systems produce waste. But life has evolved in such a way that organisms form ecological communities, or ecosystems, in which the waste of one species is food for the next, so that matter cycles continually through the ecosystem’s food webs.

The second aspect of metabolism is the network of chemical reactions that process the food and form the biochemical basis of all biological structures, functions, and behavior. The emphasis here is on “network.” One of the most important insights of the new understanding of life that is now emerging at the forefront of science, is the recognition that the network is a pattern that is common to all life. Wherever we see life, we see networks. The “web of life” is, of course, an ancient idea, which has been used by poets and philosophers throughout the ages to convey their sense of the interwovenness and interdependence of all phenomena.

In science, the focus on networks began in the 1920s, when ecologists viewed ecosystems as communities of organisms, linked together in network fashion through feeding relations, and used the concept of food webs to describe these ecological communities. As the network concept became more and more prominent in ecology, systemic thinkers began to use network models at all systems levels, viewing organisms as networks of cells, and cells as networks of molecules, just as ecosystems are understood as networks of individual organisms. Correspondingly, the flows of matter and energy through ecosystems were perceived as the continuation of the metabolic pathways through organisms.

#### **Self-Generation**

Cellular networks, in particular, have been studied closely during the last 25 years. These studies have shown that the metabolic network of a cell represents very special dynamics that differ strikingly from the cell’s nonliving environment. Taking in nutrients from the outside world, the cell sustains itself by means of a network of chemical reactions that take place inside the boundary and produce all of the cell’s components, including those of the boundary itself. The function of each component in this network is to transform or replace other components, so that the entire network continually generates itself.

This dynamic of self-generation was identified as a key characteristic of life by biologists Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela, who gave it the name “autopoiesis.”[^2] _Auto_, of course, means “self,” and _poiesis_ (which is also the Greek root of “poetry”) means “making.” So, _autopoiesis_ means “self-making.” In a cell, all the biological structures—the proteins, the DNA, the cell membrane, and so on—are continually produced, repaired, and regenerated by the cellular network. Similarly, at the level of a multicellular organism, the bodily cells are continually regenerated and recycled by the organism’s metabolic network.

Living networks, then, are self-generating. They continually create, or recreate, themselves by transforming or replacing their components. In this way, they undergo continual structural changes while preserving their web-like patterns of organization. This coexistence of stability and change is indeed one of the key characteristics of life.

#### **Emergence**

The theory of autopoiesis defines biological life as a particular pattern of organization, a self-generating network. However, it does not provide a detailed description of the physics and chemistry that are involved in these networks. For that, we must turn to the first aspect of metabolism—the flow of energy and matter through the network. The starting point for describing this flow is the observation that all cellular structures exist far from thermodynamic equilibrium. They would soon decay toward the equilibrium state—in other words, the cell would die—if the cellular metabolism did not use a continual flow of energy to restore structures as fast as they are decaying. This means that we need to describe the cell as an open system.

Living systems are organizationally closed—they are self-generating networks—but materially and energetically open. They need to feed on continual flows of matter and energy from their environment to stay alive. Detailed studies of the flows of matter and energy through such open systems have resulted in the theory of dissipative structures developed by Ilya Prigogine and his collaborators.[^3] A dissipative structure is a system that maintains itself in a state far from equilibrium. Although very different from equilibrium, this state is nevertheless stable; the same overall structure is maintained in spite of an ongoing flow and change of components.

Systems close to equilibrium are described mathematically by the linear equations of classical thermodynamics. Prigogine’s theory of dissipative structures, by contrast, applies to systems far from equilibrium that are described by nonlinear equations. Specifically, these are coupled nonlinear differential equations known as reaction-diffusion equations, which allow for an astonishing range of behaviors. For example, when the flow of energy increases, the system may encounter a point of instability, known as a bifurcation point, at which it can branch off into an entirely new state where new structures and new forms of order may emerge.

Such spontaneous emergence of new order at critical points of instability, often referred to simply as “emergence,” is one of the hallmarks of life. It has been recognized as the dynamic origin of development and evolution. In other words, creativity—the generation of forms that are constantly new—is a key property of all living systems. And since emergence is an integral part of the dynamics of open systems, we reach the important conclusion that open systems develop and evolve. Life constantly reaches out into novelty.

#### **Integrating the Study of Matter and the Study of Form**

Let me now pause for a moment and review the defining characteristics of living systems that I have identified in my discussion of cellular life. We have learned that a cell is a membrane-bounded, self-generating, organizationally closed metabolic network; that it is materially and energetically open, using a constant flow of matter and energy to produce, repair, and perpetuate itself; and that it operates far from equilibrium, where new structures and new forms of order may spontaneously emerge, thus leading to development and evolution.

These characteristics are described by two different theories: the theory of dissipative structures and the theory of autopoiesis. They represent two different approaches to the understanding of life, which we may call the study of matter and the study of form, respectively. When we describe a living cell as a dissipative structure, we use the concepts of physics and chemistry, such as energy, entropy, and chemical reaction. When we describe it as an autopoietic system, we use topological concepts like pattern of organization, network, and boundary.

To integrate these two approaches, we can notice that both deal with metabolic processes. An autopoietic network is a pattern of relationships among chemical reactions that are processes of production. A dissipative structure involves continual flows of matter and energy. We can therefore introduce the process perspective as a third criterion for the systemic understanding of life in addition to the perspective of matter and the perspective of form. For a full understanding of biological life, then, we need to study it from three integrated perspectives: the perspective of form, or pattern of organization (the configuration of relationships that determine a system’s essential properties); the perspective of matter (the embodiment of the system’s pattern of organization in physical and chemical structures); and the perspective of process (the continuing process of this embodiment).

#### **Mind is a process!**

The study of living systems from the process perspective has led to one of the most radical insights of the systemic conception of life—a novel conception of mind and consciousness that overcomes the Cartesian division between mind and matter. The decisive advance has been to abandon the Cartesian view of mind as a thing (res cogitans) in favor of viewing mind and consciousness as part of the life process. This novel concept of mind was developed during the 1960s by Gregory Bateson, who used the term _mental process_, and independently by Humberto Maturana, who focused on cognition, the process of knowing. In the 1970s, Maturana and Francisco Varela expanded Maturana’s initial work into a full theory, which has become known as the Santiago theory of cognition.[^4] During the past 25 years, the study of mind from this systemic perspective has blossomed into a rich interdisciplinary field, known as cognitive science, which transcends the traditional frameworks of biology, psychology, and epistemology.

The central insight of the Santiago theory is the identification of cognition, the process of knowing, with the process of life. Cognition, according to Maturana and Varela, is the activity involved in the self-generation and self-perpetuation of living networks. In other words, cognition is the very process of life. The organizing activity of living systems, at all levels of life, is mental activity. Thus life and cognition become inseparably connected. Mind—or more accurately, mental activity—is immanent in matter at all levels of life.

With this new conception of mind, the Cartesian division is finally overcome. Mind and matter no longer appear to belong to two separate categories but can be seen as representing two complementary aspects of the phenomenon of life—the process aspect and the structure aspect. At all levels of life, beginning with the simplest cell, mind and matter, process and structure, are inseparably connected. For the first time, we have a scientific theory that unifies mind, matter, and life.

#### **Cognition and Consciousness**

Cognition, as understood in the Santiago theory, is associated with all levels of life and is thus a much broader phenomenon than consciousness. Consciousness—that is, conscious, lived experience—unfolds at certain levels of cognitive complexity, which require a brain and a higher nervous system. In other words, consciousness is a special kind of cognitive process that emerges when cognition reaches a certain level of complexity.

Cognitive scientists today distinguish between two types of consciousness—in other words, two types of cognitive experiences—that emerge at different levels of neural complexity. The first type, known as primary consciousness, arises when cognitive processes are accompanied by basic perceptual, sensory, and emotional experience. Primary consciousness is probably experienced by most mammals and perhaps by some birds and other vertebrates.

The second type of consciousness, sometimes called reflective consciousness, involves self-awareness—a concept of self, held by a thinking and reflecting subject. This experience of self-awareness emerged during the evolution of the great apes, or hominids, together with language, conceptual thought, and all the other characteristics that fully unfolded in human consciousness.

Reflective consciousness involves a level of cognitive abstraction that includes the ability to hold mental _resources/books//Patterns of Connection_ Essential Essays F - Fritjof Capra, which allows us to formulate values, beliefs, goals, and strategies. This evolutionary stage is of central relevance to the task of integrating the social dimensions of life with its biological and cognitive dimensions, because with the evolution of language arose not only the inner world of concepts and ideas, but also the social world of organized relationships and culture.

#### **Life in the Social Domain**

My synthesis of the systemic conception of life is based on the distinction between two perspectives on the nature of living systems, the study of form (or pattern of organization) and the study of matter (or material structure), and on their integration by means of a third perspective, the study of the life process. When we study living systems from the perspective of form, we find that their pattern of organization is that of a self-generating network. From the perspective of matter, the material structure of a living system is described as a dissipative structure, that is, an open system operating far from equilibrium. From the process perspective, finally, living systems are cognitive systems, the process of cognition being identified with the process of life.

When we try to extend this new conception of life to the social domain, we must be able to deal with a multitude of phenomena—including values, intentions, goals, and relationships of power—which play no role in most of the non-human world but are essential to human social life. These diverse characteristics of social reality all arise from our inner world of concepts and ideas, _resources/books//Patterns of Connection_ Essential Essays F - Fritjof Capra, and symbols, which is a critical dimension of social reality. Social scientists refer to it as the hermeneutic dimension to express the view that human language, being of symbolic nature, centrally involves the communication of meaning, and that human action flows from the meaning that we attribute to our surroundings.

Accordingly, I shall postulate that the systemic conception of life can be extended to the social domain by adding the perspective of meaning to the other three perspectives on life. In doing so, I am using the term _meaning_ as a shorthand notation for the inner world of reflective consciousness, which contains a multitude of interrelated characteristics. A full understanding of social phenomena, then, must involve the integration of four perspectives—form, matter, process, and meaning.

My proposal of an integrated conceptual framework for the understanding of the biological, cognitive, and social dimensions of life rests on the assumption that there is a fundamental unity to life, that different living systems exhibit similar patterns of organization. This assumption is supported by the observation that evolution has proceeded for billions of years by using the same patterns again and again. As life evolves, these patterns tend to become more and more elaborate, but they are always variations on the same basic themes.

The network pattern, in particular, is one of the very basic patterns of organization in all living systems. At all levels of life, the components and processes of living systems are interlinked in network fashion. Extending the systemic conception of life to the social domain, therefore, means applying our knowledge of life’s basic patterns and principles of organization, and specifically our understanding of living networks, to social reality.

However, while insights into the organization of biological networks may help us understand social networks, we should not expect to transfer our understanding of the networks’ material structures from the biological to the social domain. Social networks are first and foremost networks of communication involving symbolic language, cultural constraints, relationships of power, and so on. To understand the structures of such networks, we must use insights from social theory, philosophy, cognitive science, anthropology, and other disciplines. A unified systemic framework for the understanding of biological and social phenomena will emerge only when the concepts of complexity theory are combined with insights from these other fields of study.

#### **Networks of Communications**

The concept of autopoiesis has been extended to the social domain by the German sociologist Niklas Luhmann in his theory of social autopoiesis.[^5] According to Luhmann, living networks in human society are networks of communications. Like biological networks, they are self-generating, but what they generate is mostly nonmaterial. Each communication creates thoughts and meaning, which give rise to further communications, and thus the entire network generates itself.

The dimension of meaning is crucial to understand social networks. Even when they generate material structures—such as material goods, artifacts, or works of art—these material structures are very different from the ones produced by biological networks. They are usually produced for a purpose, according to some design, and they embody some meaning.

As communications continue in a social network, they form multiple feedback loops that, eventually, produce a shared system of beliefs, explanations, and values—a common context of meaning, also known as culture, which is continually sustained by further communications. Through this culture, individuals acquire identities as members of the social network, and in this way, the network generates its own boundary. It is not a physical boundary but a boundary of expectations, of confidentiality and loyalty, which is continually maintained and renegotiated by the network of communications.

Culture, then, arises from a network of communications among individuals, and as it emerges, it produces constraints on their actions. In other words, the rules of behavior that constrain the actions of individuals are produced and continually reinforced by their own network of communications. The social network also produces a shared body of knowledge—including information, ideas, and skills—that shapes the culture’s distinctive way of life in addition to its values and beliefs. Moreover, the culture’s values and beliefs also affect its body of knowledge. They are part of the lens through which we see the world.

#### **The “Network Society“**

Living social systems, then, are self-generating networks of communications. In recent years, social networks have become a major focus of attention in science, business and society and throughout a newly emerging global culture. Within a few years, the Internet has become a powerful global network of communications. Most large corporations today exist as decentralized networks of smaller units, and similar networks exist among nonprofit organizations and NGOs.

Indeed, networking has been one of the main activities of political grassroots organizations for many years. The environmental movement, the human-rights movement, the feminist movement, the peace movement, and many other political and cultural grassroots movements have organized themselves as networks that transcend national boundaries.

With the new information and communication technologies, networks have become one of the most prominent social phenomena of our time. Sociologist Manuel Castells argues that the information technology revolution has given rise to a new economy, structured around flows of information, power, and wealth in global financial networks. Castells also observes that throughout society, networking has emerged as a new form of organization of human activity, and he has coined the term _network society_ to describe and analyze this new social structure.[^6]

#### **Biological and Social Networks**

Let us now juxtapose biological and social networks and highlight some of their similarities and differences. Biological systems exchange molecules in networks of chemical reactions; social systems exchange information and ideas in networks of communications. Thus, biological networks operate in the realm of matter, whereas social networks operate in the realm of meaning.

Both types of networks produce material structures. The metabolic network of a cell, for example, produces the cell’s structural components, and it also generates molecules that are exchanged between the network’s nodes as carriers of energy or information, or as catalysts of metabolic processes. Social networks, too, generate material structures—buildings, roads, and technologies, for example—that become structural components of the network, and they also produce material goods and artifacts that are exchanged between the network’s nodes.

In addition, social systems produce nonmaterial structures. Their processes of communication generate shared rules of behavior and a shared body of knowledge. The rules of behavior, whether formal or informal, are known as social structures and are the main focus of social science. The ideas, values, beliefs, and other forms of knowledge generated by social systems constitute structures of meaning, which we may call semantic structures.

In modern societies, the culture’s semantic structures are documented—that is, materially embodied—in written and digital texts. They are also embodied in artifacts, works of art, and other material structures, as they are in traditional nonliterate cultures. Indeed, the activities of individuals in social networks specifically include the organized production of material goods. All these material structures—texts, works of art, technologies, and material goods—are created for a purpose and according to some design. They are embodiments of the shared meaning generated by the society’s networks of communications.

Finally, biological and social systems both generate their own boundaries. A cell, for example, produces and sustains a membrane, which imposes constraints on the chemistry that takes place inside it. A social network, or community, produces and sustains a nonmaterial, cultural boundary, which imposes constraints on the behavior of its members.

#### **Inclusion of the Material World**

The extension of the systemic conception of life to the social domain discussed in this essay explicitly includes the material world. For social scientists, this may be unusual, because traditionally, the social sciences have not been very interested in the world of matter. Our academic disciplines have been organized in such a way that the natural sciences deal with material structures while the social sciences deal with social structures, which are understood to be, essentially, rules of behavior.

In the future, this strict division will no longer be possible, because the key challenge of our new century—for social scientists, natural scientists, and everyone else—will be to build ecologically sustainable communities. A sustainable community is designed in such a way that its technologies and social institutions—its material and social structures—do not interfere with nature’s inherent ability to sustain life. In other words, the design principles of our future social institutions must be consistent with the principles of organization that nature has evolved to sustain the web of life. A unified conceptual framework for the understanding of material and social structures, such as the one offered in this essay, will be essential for this task.

ESSAY 23|Food, Water, and Life

2007

ONE OF THE critical challenges of our time—perhaps _the_ critical challenge—is to build and nurture sustainable communities. To do so, we do not need to invent sustainable human communities from zero but can learn valuable lessons from the study of ecosystems, which _are_ sustainable communities of plants, animals, and microorganisms. The outstanding characteristic of our biosphere is that it has sustained life for over three billion years. To create sustainable human communities, therefore, means first of all to understand this inherent ability of nature to sustain life, and then to redesign our physical structures, technologies, and social institutions accordingly.

So the quest for ecological sustainability naturally leads to the question, How does nature sustain life? How do ecosystems work? How do they organize themselves to sustain their life processes over time? And when we study ecosystems, we soon find out that these questions lead to the more general question, How do living systems—organisms, ecosystems, and social systems—organize themselves? In other words, we are led to the age-old question: What is the nature of life?

Within the context of science, this question can be rephrased as, What are the essential characteristics of living systems? In other words, what is the difference between a rock and a plant, or a rock and an animal, or microorganism? To understand the nature of life, it is not enough to understand DNA, proteins, and the other molecular structures that are the building blocks of living organisms, because these structures also exist in dead organisms, for example, in a dead piece of wood or bone.

The difference between a living organism and a dead organism lies in the basic process of life—in what sages and poets throughout the ages have called the breath of life. In modern scientific language, this process of life is called metabolism. It is the ceaseless flow of energy and matter through a network of chemical reactions, which enables a living organism to continually generate, repair, and perpetuate itself.[^1] In other words, metabolism involves the intake, digestion, and transformation of food.

Since metabolism is the central characteristic of biological life, understanding the production, preparation, and consumption of food connects us directly with the very essence of life. Let me show with a few examples of how closely food is connected to life at all levels. The broadest biological category of living organisms is that of a kingdom. There are five kingdoms of life: bacteria (microorganisms without cell nuclei), protists (microorganisms with nucleated cells), plants, fungi, and animals.

The microorganisms consist of single cells (or of a few cells), and in those cells, the cell membrane controls the organism’s intake of nutrients and excretion of waste. By keeping certain substances out and letting others in, the membrane regulates the cell’s molecular composition and thus preserves its identity. In other words, cellular identity is shaped and sustained by the intake of food.

The multicellular organisms—plants, fungi, and animals—are classified according to their methods of acquiring nutrients. Plants take in food through photosynthesis—that marvelous process in which solar energy is converted into chemical energy, and CO2 is bound in organic substances, while oxygen is released into the air, to be taken up by other plants and by animals in the process of respiration.

Fungi are plant-like and yet so different from plants that they are classified as a separate kingdom, which displays a variety of fascinating properties. They lack the green chlorophyll for photosynthesis, and they do not digest their food internally. Instead, they secrete enzymes outside their bodies and then absorb the externally digested nutrients. Animals, of course, ingest their food and then digest it. In each case, the manner of taking in food defines a multicellular organism as a member of one of the three kingdoms—plants, fungi, or animals.

What about human beings? Biologically, we are animals, but human life also includes other dimensions, in particular the cultural dimension. The same is true for the way we acquire our food. It, too, has an important cultural dimension. In fact, in its original meaning, the word _culture_ referred to the cultivation of crops and the breeding of animals. From there, it was extended metaphorically to the cultivation of the human mind before it acquired the meaning of a distinctive way of life of a people.[^2] However, the original biological meaning of _culture_ as cultivation is still present in our term _agriculture_.

The etymological connections between agriculture, a cultured person, and the culture of a community open up a fascinating perspective on the very essence of human nature. About four million years ago, an extraordinary nexus occurred in the evolution of life when the first upright walking apes developed the skills of precise hand movements and the capacity of making tools, which may have led to the rapid brain growth and the evolution of language, reflective consciousness, and organized social relations that mark the emergence of the human species.

With human evolution, food acquired its cultural dimension in both senses of the term _culture_. It began to be cultivated and prepared with the help of various technologies, and it was shared among human beings in cultural rituals and ceremonies. Thus, while the biological processes of food intake allow us to distinguish plants from fungi and animals, the cultural dimensions of producing, preparing, and consuming food are distinctive human characteristics.

Throughout human history, philosophers and scientists have also recognized that water is essential to life. In ancient Greece, Thales, who viewed the entire cosmos as being alive, declared that water is the original substance out of which everything is made. During the Renaissance, Leonardo da Vinci called water “the extension and nourishing fluid of all living bodies,” and Paracelsus called it “the matrix of the world and of all its creatures.”[^3]

These early intuitions are fully borne out by modern science. Today we know not only that all living organisms need water for transporting nutrients to their tissues but also that life on Earth began in water. The first living cells originated in the primeval oceans more than three billion years ago, and ever since that time, all the cells that compose living organisms have continued to flourish and evolve in watery environments. Indeed, as Leonardo and Paracelsus recognized, water is the carrier and matrix of life.

The vital importance of water has been understood not only by philosophers and scientists, but also by humanity’s religious traditions, in which water is often the symbol of life. In the Christian tradition, the faithful receive a new spiritual life in the sacrament of baptism, and water is the medium that conveys this sacrament. Similarly, water is used for symbolic moral cleansing in baptisms and initiation ceremonies in other spiritual traditions around the world. In all these traditions, water is seen as the medium that carries spiritual life.

Many, if not most, people share memories and profound experiences triggered by water. In my own personal history, many of my deepest memories and most profound meditative experiences have been associated with environments shaped by water. I spent my early childhood in the southeast of Austria, a region known as Kärnten (Carinthia), which is famous for its beautiful lakes. I had relatives who lived on one of those lakes, and during the summer, my siblings and I would often spend many weeks vacationing at that lake. Day after day, we swam in the lake, rowed across it, watched the fishermen, and ate the delicious carp and other freshwater fish they caught. After bathing for hours, we would dry off lying on the wooden planks of the deck of my uncle’s lakeside house, and I can still vividly remember the smell of that wet wood on hot sunny days. It is one of strongest sensory memories of my childhood. Equally strong is my physical memory of warm summer rains, another phenomenon involving water, which was an outstanding feature of my sensory environment during my childhood and youth.

During my teenage years, my family moved to Innsbruck, a beautiful city in the Tyrolean Alps. There, the dominant water-related environment was the snow and ice of the mountains. I became an accomplished skier, and some of my deepest meditative experiences occurred during a perfect ski run, when my body and mind, the skis and the slope, all fused into a single experience of rhythm and movement.

Many years later, when I was working as a theoretical physicist at the University of California, I had a profound experience on a beach of the Pacific Ocean, which set me on a road that led to the writing of my first book, _The Tao of Physics_.[^4] As I sat on that beach watching the waves rolling in and feeling the rhythm of my breathing, I became aware of my whole environment as being engaged in a gigantic cosmic dance. I “saw” the atoms of the water waves and mist, the sand, and those of my body participating in this cosmic dance of energy, and I realized that this was the Dance of Shiva, the Lord of Dancers worshipped in Hinduism.

I believe that these profound experiences, triggered by water, are grounded in the fundamental connection between water and life. When scientists look for life on other planets, the first thing they look for is water. The water cycle, the most basic ecological cycle, shows us that water is an irreplaceable and limited resource that is shared by all living creatures. Hence, water is also a common heritage of humanity that should not be transformed into a commodity, but must be freely available as a fundamental human right.

Indeed, the first human right mentioned in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations is “the right to life, liberty, and security of person.” And since no life or personal security is possible without access to clean and safe water, such access is implicit in the U.N. Declaration as the first and most basic human right.

ESSAY 24|The Flow of Life in the Art of Andy Goldsworthy

2003

ANDY GOLDSWORTHY, AN internationally acclaimed sculptor now living in Scotland, works with stone, branches, leaves, ice, and other natural materials to create works of breathtaking beauty. His sculptures are in great harmony with the environment and express the artist’s intuitive understanding of the fundamental nature of life.

Like nature’s own forms, Goldsworthy’s sculptures are transient, subject to continual change, transformation, and decay. The artist therefore makes extensive use of photography to record his work. With the documentary _Rivers and Tides_, Thomas Riedelsheimer introduces film as the medium most suitable to focus on a particular aspect of the sculptor’s work: his concern with “growth, time, change, and the idea of flow in nature.” The filmmaker was able to make visible and bring to life many subtle qualities of Goldsworthy’s sculptures that are not apparent in slides and books. _Rivers and Tides_ is a magnificent tribute to the artist’s mind and his work.[^1] In this essay, I shall try to show how the sculptor and the filmmaker, both “working with time,” have produced profound statements about life’s dynamic qualities.

![[f0263-01.jpg]]

Figure 15. Sculpture by Andy Goldsworthy on the cover of _The Systems View of Life_ (_Early morning calm / knotweed stalks / pushed into lake bottom / made complete by their own reflections, Derwent Water, Cumbria, 20 February 1988_).

Many of the intriguing and arresting effects of Goldsworthy’s sculptures arise from his use of nonliving matter to convey the qualities of life. He juxtaposes static forms with life’s dynamic forces in the most startling ways, often making nonliving material take the forms of living matter, forms that it would not assume naturally. This requires great patience and intimate knowledge of the material’s properties.

On a sea shore in Nova Scotia, Goldsworthy makes a sculpture out of icicles at subzero temperature, assembling small pieces by dipping them into water and letting them freeze to stick together. It is a delicate process with many failures. He repeatedly bites off pieces of the icicles and holds them together with his bare fingers while they freeze.

I have to work with my bare hands, because my gloves stick and I don’t have the sensitivity to do it with gloves. I always like to touch the material. You never shake someone’s hand with a glove on.

When the camera zooms back, it reveals a thread of ice seemingly snaking back and forth through a rock shaped like a giant thorn. A few moments later, the rising sun illuminates the ice and makes it sparkle. Now the sculpture looks like a bolt of lightning striking the stone.

It _is_ hard, hard going, and it _is_ cold sometimes on the hands, and I _do_ get up very early, and all that effort is, ultimately, going into trying to make something that looks effortless.

On another day on the same beach, Goldsworthy builds a sculpture out of stone slates. As he piles up the slates and the sculpture grows, he notices that it is unstable. He tries to stabilize it, but during that attempt the whole structure collapses. The artist’s disappointment is palpable. “This is my work,” he comments exasperatedly. “Too many unknowns.”

Goldsworthy carefully rearranges the slates on the beach and begins to rebuild the structure. “I think its chances of survival are a bit slim,” he remarks wryly. Indeed, after a few more slates are added the whole structure collapses again.

Every time something collapses it is intensely disappointing. This is the fourth time it has fallen, and each time I got to know the stone a little bit more. It got higher each time; it grew in proportion to my understanding of the stone. That is really one of the things my art is trying to do—trying to understand the stone. I obviously don’t understand it well enough yet.

#### **The River of Life**

At the center of Goldsworthy’s exploration of time lies the tension between stability and flow. According to contemporary science, this tension is indeed a fundamental feature of life. Living organisms must feed on continual flows of energy and matter from their environment to stay alive, and yet they manage to maintain stable structures in spite of this ongoing growth, flow, and change. Scientists speak of dissipative structures to highlight the close interplay between structure, on the one hand, and flow and dissipation, on the other.[^2] A whirlpool is the simplest example of a dissipative structure; water continually flows through it, and yet the characteristic shape of the vortex remains remarkably stable.

In Goldsworthy’s work, we repeatedly encounter a form he seems to use as an archetypal symbol of the flow of life: a snaking, meandering line. “There are always these obsessive forms that you cannot get rid of,” he muses as he draws a meandering line through snow scattered on the ice of a frozen river.

We saw the same snaking line in the icicle sculpture, and we recognize it again in the line of a long green tendril, arranged by the artist, as the camera follows its meandering path through and around large leaves, through a labyrinth of roots at the foot of a tree, and up the tree’s trunk.

For Andy Goldsworthy, the archetypal image that symbolizes the flow of life is not the snake but the river: “The river is a river of stone, a river of animals, a river of the wind, a river of the water, a river of many things. The river is not dependent on water; we are talking about the flow.” Accordingly, Goldsworthy sculpts rivers of stone, rivers of leaves, and rivers of ice that convey the idea of flow, growth, and change in nature: “There’s a river of growth that flows through the trees and the land.”

In the shallow part of a river, the artist has lined up colored rocks to form a band of “flowing stones.” The colors go from red-brown to yellow, to white, to blue. Under the rippling water, the contours of the stones change continually, giving the impression of a sequence of pure liquid color.

We set so much store by our idea of the stability of stone. When we find that stone itself is actually fluid and liquid, that really undermines our sense of what is here to stay and what isn’t.

The most spectacular of Goldsworthy’s “rivers of stone” is an expansive wall built by a team of British stone masons under the artist’s supervision in a 500-acre sculpture park in upstate New York. As we watch them skillfully assemble the rocks and stone slabs into a smooth and elegant structure, Goldsworthy explains that he respects the work of the “wallers” and lets _them_ build the wall:

My role is to find the line of the wall. I work the space. Their dialogue with the stone is what makes the wall. It’s the fluidity of working that gives the sculpture a sense of movement and energy.

The finished wall winds its way through the forest, around the trees, in the now familiar snaky line that symbolizes the flow of life: “The movement of the wall is the river of stone that runs around the trees, the river of growth that is the forest.”

The camera follows the seemingly endless movement, as the wall leaves the forest, crosses a field, enters a pond, apparently continues under water, and exits on the other side. Finally, we retrace our steps and follow the wall back through the forest until we lose sight of it, as it seemingly disappears into the ground like a river originating in a spring.

#### **A Sense of Place**

In all his work, Andy Goldsworthy uses natural materials, taken from the environment in which he creates his sculptures according to the season in which he finds himself and according to what is available on that particular day. Without preconceived ideas of what he will create, he spends considerable time walking around, letting the place inspire him: “I want to understand the energy that I have in me, that I also feel in the plants and in the land.”

The results of this process are works that almost look as if they had grown out of their environment by themselves. And yet, their strong symbolic character makes it evident that they are works of art.

On the seashore in Nova Scotia Goldsworthy stands at the edge of a small bay.

My first view of the beach was a river and a pool that was turned by the river. I am trying to understand that motion, the meeting of the river with the sea . . . the meeting of these two waters.

He builds a dome out of driftwood with a hole at the top. The circular lines of the gray driftwood, somehow, make the sculpture resemble a whirlpool. When the tide rises, it engulfs the dome until it gently floats away out into the river, rotating slowly and gradually disintegrating around its periphery. From symbolizing a whirlpool—the classical example of the interplay between stability and flow that is characteristic of all life—the driftwood dome has become part of an actual whirlpool, slowly turning in the space where the river meets the sea. The effect of this process on the viewer is extraordinary.

You feel as if you touched the heart of the place. That’s a way of understanding—seeing something you never saw before, that was always there, but you were blind to it.

By inserting his sculptures into their environment in such a way that the daily and seasonal changes affect them, Goldsworthy makes these changes visible, even when they are so subtle that we would not normally be aware of them. In other parts of the film, we see a long string of interconnected leaves slowly floating down a river, twisting and turning with the currents of the water; a delicate screen of dry stalks, stitched together with thorns, trembling in the wind; dry snow thrown into the air, forming thin clouds that drift away on the air’s currents. All these sculptures, delicate and ephemeral, make us see patterns and processes in nature that we would usually not notice.

Goldsworthy’s sense of place extends to the history of the land and its interactions with the creatures living on it—animals and humans, past and present. We see the artist in a hilly landscape, interlaced with stone walls, with sheep grazing in the background. He covers the top of a stone wall with sheep’s wool, which becomes a meandering line running along the top of the long ragged wall, outlining its border with a fluffy layer of shimmering white.

The reason this landscape looks as it does is because of the sheep. The sheep have had a very deep impact on the land. . . . Sheep have been responsible for social and political upheavals, for the clearances of the highlands when landlords put sheep on the land and moved the people away. And they have left their story behind them. It’s written in the place, in the landscape.

The artist’s profound understanding of how living creatures shape their environment allows him to read their stories in the landscape, and then to use the materials of the land—the stones, bracken, leaves, and sheep’s wool—to sculpt symbols of life.

As the camera pans across the hillside, an imposing boulder appears in the foreground. In the next view, we see the rock covered with white sheep’s wool, looking like the back of some mythical beast. The rock has become a symbol of the sheep, of their dominance and their impact on the landscape. A sense of magic and myth arises from the image of the rock’s luxurious cover of sheep’s wool, a reminder of the many roles sheep have played in human mythology.

#### **Symbols of Life**

Most of Goldsworthy’s sculptures are symbolic of life, either through the forms they take or through the patterns and processes they become part of. Having watched the artist build a stone sculpture on the beach and repeatedly failing to stabilize it, we finally see him complete the structure. Now we realize why it was so difficult to build. The sculpture looks like a giant pine cone resting on a small circular base.

I like the connection the form has with the seed, very full and ripe . . . To look at stone and find growth, as expressed in the seed, within stone is a very powerful image for me.

A pine cone, a seed, full and ripe—these are potent symbols of life. The filmmaker shows us a sequence of slate cones in various environments: in an interior space, on a frozen beach, in a forest clearing, and one standing under an overhang of rock along a road: “This form also has the quality of a guardian. It feels as if it is protecting something.” Maybe the sculpture is a silent reminder of our obligation to respect life in all its manifestations.

Water is the medium in which life originated and evolved; without water there is no life. Accordingly, Goldsworthy often uses water as a medium to carry, transform, or (in the case of snow and ice) constitute his sculptures. His icicle sculpture is a symbol of life in a double sense, because of the form of its movement and because it is made of water, the medium of life: “It is water—the river and sea made solid.”

In higher organisms, the flow of life is mediated not only by water, but also by blood, which carries nutrients to all the cells and carries away the waste. Blood is one of the most powerful symbols of life, and it is not surprising that Andy Goldsworthy has used the association of blood with life in his work.

We see the artist collect small pieces of red stone, probably hematite, in a river bed near his home in Scotland. He rubs one piece against a rock to create a thick red liquid. Then he breaks up the stones and grinds them into a red powder: “The reason why the stone is red is because of its iron content, and that’s also the reason why our blood is red.”

We see splashes of the thick red liquid on a rock, which indeed look like splashes of blood.

I do feel that there is a special energy about the red, probably because of its relationship to blood. I think the color is an expression of life. . . . The realization that the color is also in me gives me the feeling of the color, and of the energy flowing through all things.

A small waterfall is splashing into a pool. As we watch it, the water suddenly turns red. We know that this happens because Goldsworthy has dropped the red powder into the river upstream. Nevertheless, the moment is emotionally highly charged.

There is a real shock in seeing that color, something very alien to the river, but which is in fact is so rooted in it and is so about that place.

#### **The Cycle of Life**

Goldsworthy’s sculptures are embedded not only in their environment but also in processes of change and transformation that are typical of living systems. In particular, the artist is keenly aware of the cycles of birth and death that are an essential part of life. When the sun rises and brilliantly illuminates his ice sculpture, he marvels at his good fortune, but then immediately points out that the sun that illuminates the ice will also make it melt. Death is an intrinsic part of life: “In so many works that I have made, the very thing that brings the work to life is the thing that will cause its death.”

The slate cone on the same beach is completed just as the rising tide reaches its base. We watch the water slowly engulf the sculpture, and then the view shifts to the cone in the forest clearing where bracken is now growing around it. The camera moves back and forth between the two sculptures. As the tide covers the cone at the sea shore, so the growing bracken (shown in time-lapse photography) covers the cone in the forest, until both completely disappear from view.

Then, as the tide recedes, we see the cone reemerge until it stands again by the sea shore. The cone in the forest, too, has reemerged, now covered by snow. The bracken around it is dead, and the image fades to a view of the cone in Spring, with the ground around it bare again.

When seen through the changing tides and changing seasons, Goldsworthy’s stone sculptures become symbols of the cycle of life. As the slate cone disappears and reappears in the cycle of the tides, and of the seasons, so a pine cone disappears when its seeds are scattered, and then reappears in the next season, or even on a new tree grown from one of those seeds.

We stay with the slate cone in the forest clearing, surrounded by dead bracken, which turns out to be near Goldsworthy’s home in Scotland. When the artist carefully pulls brown stalks of bracken out of the earth, we see that the parts that were underground are black. He cuts the stalks into pieces of different lengths and lays them out in a brown-and-black pattern.

The black color of the stalks is a result of the exchange of energy that has taken place between the plant and the earth. Through that process, there was an exchange of heat.

Even though the stalks of bracken are dead, they are connected with the larger cycle of life, of death and rebirth, through the telltale signs of their “exchanges of energy”—the chemical reactions involved in the basic processes of life.

As the camera pulls back, we see a tree in blossom, and looking through its branches, we notice light brown stalks of bracken surrounding the tree’s trunk like an elegant wooden floor. Pulling back further, the camera reveals a path of “bracken floor” leading away from the tree, and in the middle of it a black circle, seemingly burned into the bracken. We recognize it as the brown-and-black pattern the artist has carefully laid out.

The juxtaposition of the tree standing in the bracken path on one side, and the black hole—a “tree being absent”—on the other is typical of the arresting quality of Goldsworthy’s art. Almost like a formula, he shows us how growth and decay are phases in the cycle of life.

The day after my younger brother’s wife died, I went to a tree—it seemed the right place to go—and made a work with a hole on the tree. It becomes a visual entrance into the earth, into the tree, into the stone, an entrance between which life both ebbs and flows.

We see the bare, gnarling branches and roots of several trees. On the largest tree is a black hole, sculpted in the shape of a long lens between two giant roots. The edge of the hole has two layers and is reminiscent of a yoni, the ancient Hindu symbol of procreation. As in the pattern of bracken, we see a dramatic juxtaposition of birth and death, both part of the flow of life.

#### **The Complexity of Living Form**

The generation and maintenance of stable biological forms is a tremendously complex process, involving thousands of interlinked chemical reactions even in the simplest living cell. During the past 20 years, scientists have been able to use powerful high-speed computers to develop a new mathematical language, known as complexity theory, that allows us for the first time to handle the enormous complexity of living systems mathematically.[^3]

A key insight of complexity theory has been that biological forms are not simply determined by genetic blueprints but emerge from a complex network of chemical processes, subject to physical constraints imposed by the environment. The encounter of the complexity of life’s processes with the physical constraints results in a limited number of possible biological forms. Each of them is characterized by a delicate balance between stability and flow, between order and chaos. The laws of physics and chemistry provide a rigorous framework of constraints, but there is great uncertainty and unpredictability as far as the actual living forms are concerned.

It seems that Andy Goldsworthy’s work mirrors some key aspects of the new scientific understanding of life’s complexity. The works he produces are always subject to rigorous physical constraints. The icicle sculpture has to be finished before sunrise, or it will melt before completion; the driftwood dome needs to be completed before the tide comes in; covering a rock with sheep’s wool can be done only on a dry and windless day. Again and again, Goldsworthy would work on a sculpture for many hours only to be forced to abandon the work because of changing conditions of light and weather.

As a result of these constraints, the artist only works on a limited number of forms, which he produces again and again in endless trials and variations. Over time, these forms evolve with his increasing knowledge of materials and conditions, and his continual creative innovations. Many of Goldsworthy’s sculptures are delicate and ephemeral, existing in the delicate balance of order and chaos that is also characteristic of living forms: “When I make a work, I often take it to the very edge of its collapse. That’s a very beautiful balance.”

In the film, we watch him in a close-up as he carefully builds an irregular screen out of stalks of dry reeds, stitched together with thorns.

I’m aware that the wind has just now got a little bit stronger, and although I look as calm as I did a few seconds ago, there are these little warning bells going inside my head.

As the camera pulls back, we see the delicate stalk screen hanging from the branches of a tree. It has an empty circle in its center, and the artist is working on completing the parts around the circle. A small gust of wind makes the screen shake, and Goldsworthy anxiously touches it with his flat hand to try and stabilize it. After a while, he carefully withdraws his hand, but as soon as he does so, the entire screen collapses on him. He looks at the heap of stalks on the ground and sighs.

When the work succeeds, it is blessed by the elegance and seeming effortlessness that is also characteristic of flowers, blades of grass, and other masterpieces created by nature during billions of years of evolution.

Like biological forms, many of Goldsworthy’s sculptures move and change in constant interplay with their surroundings. A long string of interconnected green leaves, stitched together with grass stalks, is rolled up in a spiral in a side pool of the river. As the water in the pool slowly turns, the spiral unwinds and the string begins to float down the river. Sometimes it moves in a straight line, at other times it twists, turns, and meanders, following the currents of the water.

The string of leaves seems almost alive in its movement through the water, but of course we know that it simply follows the complexity of the water’s currents. The same can be said of living organisms. They are strings of molecules following the “currents” of physics and chemistry, but bringing forth living forms of ever increasing complexity.

#### **The Living Planet**

Back at the river, Andy Goldsworthy spends many hours looking for more hematite and grinding it into powder: “These small red iron stones are well hidden in the river. It is amazing that something so dramatic, so intense, could be so hidden, so underneath the skin of the Earth.”

We see him with a small pile of red powder.

Here I am working with the stone, grinding it down for several hours to make a little pile of pigment that I will then make into a ball and throw into the river, and there will be a splash. That’s just an instant in that cycle of stone as it goes through its processes of solidification, of becoming fluid again, and then again becoming solid.

The artist’s intuition of the “cycle of stone” is completely consistent with contemporary scientific thought. The planet’s rocks go through giant cycles, in which the Earth’s crust is continually eroded, washed into the oceans, sucked into the planet’s interior, and eventually rebuilt into rocks that return to the surface through the eruptions of volcanoes or through collisions of tectonic plates that cause massive mountains to rise up.[^4]

As Goldsworthy throws a ball of red pigment into a calm part of the river, we see a splash of water rising up and then the color spreads through the water in the irregular shapes of a red cloud. The splash of red pigment seems to imitate molten rock rising to the surface of the Earth and spreading as lava.

Of course it feels alive! If anything, it’s an expression of the stone alive, almost back to its origin in the volcano. It’s visible evidence of the movement and eruption of the stone. That feeling of energy within it, that’s life.

On the scale of planetary space and of geological time, the stone is indeed “alive.” It is part of Gaia, the living planet.

Next we see Goldsworthy throw the pigment into the air, where it forms clouds of red dust that drift away with the currents of the wind. In this sequence, the artist has moved from stone as liquid to stone as dust clouds—its most ephemeral manifestation. The sequence is followed by one showing Goldsworthy throw dry snow into the air. The snow forms patterns very similar to those of the red dust.

Here the artist explores the connections between stone and water, two materials he works with a great deal. Water, the medium of life, erodes the rocks and carries the dissolved stone into the ocean, thus making stone become liquid. And, like water, stone can appear not only as a liquid but also as a cloud. It follows the currents of the water and the currents of the air. Stone, too, is part of the living planet, of its rivers and its tides.

## Systemic Problems—Systemic Solutions

WITH THE PUBLICATION of my full synthesis of the systems view of life in _The Hidden Connections_, I felt that I had reached a plateau in my theoretical research and that this book would remain valid for a long time.[^1] I realized that many parts of the conceptual framework I had outlined would need to be fleshed out in greater detail, but I was confident that the framework of the synthesis itself would stand the test of time. Moreover, I firmly believed that systemic thinking, and the systems view of life in particular, could be applied to solving our major global problems. During the past two decades, countless detailed systemic solutions, developed and tested by scholars and activists around the world, have shown that my confidence was fully justified. I shall come back to these solutions in the Epilogue of this book.

During the first years of the new century, I returned to a subject that had fascinated me for many years: the unique synthesis of art and science developed by Leonardo da Vinci. Over the years, I had seen several exhibitions of Leonardo’s drawings and had read an excellent biography, and early on, I had the intuition that the great genius of the Renaissance was a systemic thinker.

In 2003, I finally began to study Leonardo’s famous notebooks and to read the abundant literature on his art and engineering, as well as books on the art and culture of the Renaissance in general. To my great surprise, I found that among the hundreds of scholarly and popular books about Leonardo da Vinci, there are surprisingly few books about his science, even though he left voluminous notebooks full of detailed descriptions of his experiments, magnificent drawings, and long analyses of his findings.

Moreover, I discovered that most authors who have discussed Leonardo’s scientific work have looked at it through Newtonian lenses. This has often prevented them from understanding its essential nature, which I recognized as a science of organic forms, of interconnected patterns and processes, radically different from the mechanistic science of Galileo, Descartes, and Newton.

I ended up spending 10 years studying Leonardo’s writings, drawings, and paintings, and I wrote several books about him.[^2] My research not only confirmed my initial intuition of Leonardo da Vinci as a systemic thinker. I also discovered, to my great surprise, Leonardo the ecologist and pioneer of ecode-sign and biomimicry. At the most fundamental level, he always sought to understand the nature of life, and he did so by studying life’s patterns of organization and its fundamental processes of metabolism and growth. Indeed, I believe that the ever-present emphasis on relationships, patterns, qualities, and transformations in Leonardo’s writings, drawings, and paintings—the key characteristics of systemic thinking—was what initially attracted me to his work and has kept me fascinated for so many years.

While I carried out my Leonardo research, I also continued to explore the applications of the systems view of life to our current problems. I was never a pure theorist; social change has always been part of my concerns. Ever since the 1960s, I have been part of an alternative, activist, global community. As I explained in essay 3]], I saw the emergence of a new global civil society in the 1990s as the most important legacy of the sixties’ counterculture.

During the last 20 years, I have kept in close contact with the research institutes and centers of learning of this global civil society, and I have discussed and advocated many of the systemic solutions they have developed in my lectures, seminars, and publications. The three essays in this chapter are representative examples of these activities.

The first essay is based on a talk I gave in 1999 at the “Forum 2000” symposium in Prague at the invitation of President Václav Havel, who gathered 300 scientists, philosophers, religious and political leaders, artists, and activists at his residence, Prague Castle, to discuss the challenges humanity was facing on the threshold of a new millennium.

In the essay, I assess the state of the world at the close of the 20th century from a systemic perspective. I state at the outset that the great challenge of our time is to build and nurture sustainable communities. Following Lester Brown, I define a sustainable community as one designed in such a way that its ways of life do not interfere with nature’s inherent ability to sustain life. To do so, I point out, we must become ecologically literate and learn to think systemically. In the main body of the essay I project two scenarios for the future—the rise of global capitalism and the expansion of ecodesign. Both involve complex networks and new technologies, and the two scenarios are now on a collision course. I conclude that the challenge of the 21st century will be to change the values of global capitalism so as to make it compatible with the demands of human dignity and ecological sustainability.

The second essay is an homage to Lester Brown, founder of the World-watch Institute and one of the most authoritative environmental thinkers, on the occasion of his 80th birthday. I review how Brown has documented the systemic nature of our global problems in great detail over so many years, and I argue that a full understanding of these issues requires a radically new systemic conception of life.

After summarizing the systems view of life in a nutshell and reviewing the key characteristics of systems thinking, I present and discuss a detailed conceptual map of the interconnectedness of our global problems, based on Lester Brown’s book _Plan B_.[^3] This conceptual map is a more elaborate version of the one I designed 25 years earlier, based on _State of the World: 1988_ (see essay 14]]).

I conclude by asserting that the systemic solutions proposed in Brown’s _Plan B_ make it evident that we have the knowledge, the technologies, and the financial means to save civilization and build a sustainable future. What we need is political will and leadership.

Six years later, in 2020, this assertion acquired a new urgency with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the first half of the year, while rigorously sheltering at home, I participated in a series of webinars and posted several articles online in which I presented COVID-19 as a systemic problem in need of corresponding systemic solutions. Essay 27]] is based on these presentations. I argue that the coronavirus must be seen as a biological response of Gaia, our living planet, to the ecological and social emergency humanity has brought upon itself.

I show how it arose from an ecological imbalance and how many of its dramatic consequences were exacerbated by social and economic imbalances. I conclude by discussing the valuable, life-saving lessons Gaia has offered us with this pandemic and the urgent need to apply these lessons also to the climate crisis.

ESSAY 25|The Challenge of the 21st Century

1999

AS OUR CENTURY draws to a close, we are facing a whole series of global problems that are harming the biosphere and human life in alarming ways that may soon become irreversible. Concern with the environment is no longer one of many “single issues”; it is the context of everything else—of our lives, our businesses, our politics. The great challenge of our time is to build and nurture sustainable communities—social, cultural, and physical environments in which we can satisfy our needs and aspirations without diminishing the chances of future generations.

Since its introduction in the early 1980s, the concept of sustainability has often been distorted, co-opted, and even trivialized by being used without the ecological context that gives it its proper meaning. What is sustained in a sustainable community is not economic growth or development, but the entire web of life on which our long-term survival depends. In other words, a sustainable community is designed in such a way that its ways of life, businesses, economy, physical structures, and technologies do not interfere with nature’s inherent ability to sustain life.

The first step in this endeavor, naturally, must be to become ecologically literate, that is, to understand the principles of organization that ecosystems have developed to sustain the web of life.[^1] In the coming century, ecological literacy will be a critical skill for politicians, business leaders, and professionals in all spheres. More than that, it will be critical for the survival of humanity as a whole, and therefore will be the most important part of education at all levels—from schools to colleges and universities, and to the continuing education and training of professionals.

To become ecologically literate, we must learn to think systemically—in terms of connectedness, context, and processes. When systems thinking is applied to the study of the Earth Household—which is the literal meaning of the term _ecology_—we discover that the principles of organization of ecosystems are the basic principles of organization of all living systems, the basic patterns of life.

For example, we observe that an ecosystem generates no waste, one species’ waste being another species’ food; that matter cycles continually through the web of life; that the energy driving these ecological cycles flows from the sun; that diversity increases resilience; that life, from its beginning more than three billion years ago, did not take over the planet by combat but by cooperation, partnership, and networking.

The main task in the next century will be to apply our ecological knowledge and systemic thinking to the fundamental redesign of our technologies and social institutions, so as to bridge the current gap between human design and the ecologically sustainable systems of nature. Fortunately, this is already taking place. In recent years, there has been a burst of optimism about the dramatic rise of ecologically oriented design practices, all of which are now well documented (see, for example, _Natural Capitalism_ by Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins, and Hunter Lovins).[^2]

Design, in the broadest sense, consists in shaping flows of energy and materials for human purposes. Ecodesign is a design process in which our human purposes are carefully meshed with the larger patterns and flows of the natural world.[^3] In other words, the ecodesign principles reflect the principles of organization that nature has evolved to sustain the web of life.

For example, the principle “waste equals food” means that all the products and materials manufactured by industry, as well as the wastes generated in the manufacturing processes, must eventually provide nourishment for something new. A sustainable business organization would be embedded in an “ecology of organizations,” in which the waste of any one organization would be a resource for another. In such a sustainable industrial system, the total outflow of each organization—its products and wastes—would be perceived and treated as resources cycling through the system. Such “ecological clusters” of industries have recently been initiated in several parts of the world by an organization called Zero Emissions Research Initiatives.[^4]

Ecodesigners William McDonough and Michael Braungart speak of two kinds of metabolism: a biological metabolism and a technical metabolism.[^5] Things that are part of the biological metabolism—agriculture and food systems, clothing, cosmetics, and so on—should not contain persistent toxic substances. Things that go into the technical metabolism—machines, physical structures, and so on—should be kept well apart from the biological metabolism.

Eventually, all products, materials, and wastes will either be biological or technical nutrients. Biological nutrients will be designed to return to the ecological cycles—to be literally consumed by microorganisms and other creatures in the soil. Technical nutrients will be designed to go back into technical cycles. This means that customers will not own these products but will merely buy their services. When they have finished with the products, the manufacturer will take them back, break them down, and use their complex materials in new products.

Today, the obstacles that stand in the way of ecological sustainability are no longer conceptual nor technical. They lie in the dominant values of our society, and in particular in the dominant corporate values. Corporate values and choices are determined, to a large extent, by flows of information, power, and wealth in the global financial networks that shape societies today.

During the past three decades, the information technology revolution has given rise to a new type of global capitalism, which is structured around networks of financial flows. Manuel Castells, professor of sociology at the University of California at Berkeley, has extensively analyzed and documented this new economic system in a three-volume work titled _The Information Age: Economy, Society, and Culture_.[^6]

Because of the ability of financial capital to relentlessly scan the entire planet for investment opportunities, and to move from one option to another in a matter of seconds, the profit margins are generally much higher in the global financial markets than in most direct investments. And therefore, profits from all sources ultimately converge into the meta-network of financial flows. The movements of this electronically operated global casino do not follow a market logic. The market is twisted, manipulated, and transformed by a combination of computer-enacted strategic maneuvers and unexpected turbulences caused by the complex interactions between capital flows in a highly nonlinear system.

Information technology has played a decisive role in the rise of networking as a new form of organization of human activity, which goes far beyond economics. In our “network society,” as Castells calls it, the core processes of knowledge generation, economic productivity, political and military power, and media communication, have been deeply transformed by information technology and are connected to global networks of wealth and power. The dominant social functions and processes are increasingly organized around networks. Presence or absence in the network is a critical source of power.

In the global networks of financial flows, money is almost entirely independent of production and services. Thus labor has become disaggregated in its performance, fragmented in its organization, and divided in its collective action. Consequently, the rise of this “informational capitalism” is intertwined with rising social inequality, polarization, and social exclusion.

As to be expected, the new global capitalism has triggered a great deal of resistance around the world. This resistance is taking the form of a new politics of identity, which, according to Castells, represents the distinctive social and political trend of the 1990s. Social action and politics are being constructed around primary identities, “either rooted in history and geography, or newly built in an anxious search for meaning and spirituality.”[^7] There is a search for new connectedness around shared, reconstructed identity.

The most powerful shifts of identity have been initiated by the feminist and the environmental movement, the former involving a redefinition of gender relationships, the latter a redefinition of relationships between humans and nature. Castells also notes that much of the success of the environmental movement comes from the fact that, more than any other social force, it has been able to best adapt to the conditions of communication and mobilization in the new technological paradigm.

On the one hand, the movement relies on grassroots organizations (i.e., on living human networks); on the other hand, it has been on the leading edge of new communication technologies (i.e., electronic networks) as organizing and mobilizing tools. In this way, the environmental movement has created a unique link between electronic and ecological networks.

In fact, networking has been one of the main activities of political grassroots organizations for many years. The environmental movement, the human-rights movement, the feminist movement, the peace movement, and many other political and cultural grassroots movements have all organized themselves as flexible networks that transcend national boundaries. Last year, many of these grassroots organizations interlinked electronically for several months to prepare for joint protest actions at the meeting of the WTO in Seattle.[^8] The “Seattle coalition” was extremely successful in derailing the WTO meeting and in making its views known to the world. Its concerted actions may have permanently changed the political climate around the issue of economic globalization.

As we move into the new century, then, we can observe two developments that will have major impacts on the well-being and ways of life of humanity. Both of these developments have to do with networks, and both involve radically new technologies. One of them is the rise of global capitalism and the network society; the other is the creation of sustainable communities, involving ecoliteracy and ecodesign practices.

Whereas global capitalism is concerned with electronic networks of financial and informational flows, ecoliteracy and ecodesign are concerned with ecological networks of energy and material flows. The goal of the global economy is to maximize the wealth and power of the elites in the network society; the goal of ecodesign to maximize the sustainability of the web of life.

These two scenarios—each involving complex networks and special advanced technologies—are currently on a collision course. The network society is destructive of local communities and thus inherently unsustainable. It is based on the central value of capitalism—money-making for the sake of making money—at the exclusion of other values. However, human values can change; they are not natural laws. The same electronic networks of financial and informational flows _could_ have other values built into them. The challenge of the 21st century will be to change the value system of the network society, so as to make it compatible with the demands of human dignity and ecological sustainability.

ESSAY 26|Systems Thinking and the State of the World

2014

LESTER BROWN’S 80TH birthday coincides with the 40th anniversary of the _State of the World_ reports, the Worldwatch Institute’s annual assessment of the major problems of our time and of new innovative ideas to solve them.[^1] The outstanding feature of these reports, as of Lester’s and his colleagues’ other writings, is the fundamental insight that none of our major problems can be understood in isolation. They are systemic problems, which means that they are all interconnected and interdependent, and hence require systemic solutions.

Indeed, Lester Brown is a systemic thinker par excellence. In his recent book, _Plan B_, he provides one of the most detailed and masterful documentations of the fundamental interconnectedness of all global problems.[^2] He demonstrates with impeccable clarity how the vicious circle of demographic pressure and poverty leads to the depletion of resources—falling water tables, shrinking forests, collapsing fisheries, eroding soils, and so on—and how this resource depletion, exacerbated by climate change, produces failing states whose governments can no longer provide security for their citizens, some of whom in sheer desperation turn to terrorism.

All these problems, ultimately, must be seen as just different facets of one single crisis, which is largely a crisis of perception.[^3] It derives from the fact that most people in our society, and especially our large social institutions, subscribe to the concepts of an outdated worldview, a perception of reality inadequate for dealing with our overpopulated, globally interconnected world.

The main message of Lester’s book is that there _are_ solutions to the major problems of our time; some of them even simple. But they require a radical shift in our perceptions, our thinking, our values. And indeed, we are now at the beginning of such a fundamental change of worldview in science and society, a change of paradigms as radical as the Copernican Revolution.

Unfortunately, this realization has not yet dawned on most of our political leaders. The recognition that a profound change of perception and thinking is needed if we are to survive has not yet reached our corporate leaders either. Most of our leaders are unable to connect the dots, to use a popular phrase; they fail to see how the major problems of our time are all interrelated. Moreover, they refuse to recognize how their so-called solutions affect future generations. From the systems point of view, the only viable solutions are those that are sustainable.

Over the past 30 years, it has become clear that a full understanding of these issues requires nothing less than a radically new conception of life. And indeed, such a new understanding of life is now emerging.[^4] At the forefront of contemporary science, the universe is no longer seen as a machine composed of elementary building blocks. We have discovered that the material world, ultimately, is a network of inseparable patterns of relationships; that the planet as a whole is a living, self-regulating system. The view of the human body as a machine and of the mind as a separate entity is being replaced by one that sees not only the brain, but also the immune system, the bodily tissues, and even each cell as a living, cognitive system. Evolution is no longer seen as a competitive struggle for existence but rather as a cooperative dance in which creativity and the constant emergence of novelty are the driving forces. And with the new emphasis on complexity, networks, and patterns of organization, a new science of qualities is slowly emerging.

The new conception of life involves a new kind of thinking—thinking in terms of relationships, patterns, and context. In science, this way of thinking is known as “systemic thinking,” or “systems thinking.” It emerged in the 1920s and 1930s from a series of interdisciplinary dialogues among biologists, psychologists, and ecologists.[^5] In all these fields, scientists realized that a living system—an organism, ecosystem, or social system—is an integrated whole whose properties cannot be reduced to those of smaller parts. The systemic properties are properties of the whole, which none of its parts have. Thus, systems thinking involves a shift of perspective from the parts to the whole. The early systems thinkers coined the phrase, “The whole is more than the sum of its parts.”

What exactly does this mean? In what sense is the whole more than the sum of its parts? The answer is: relationships. All the essential properties of a living system depend on the relationships among the system’s components. Systems thinking means thinking in terms of relationships. Understanding life requires a shift of perspective, not only from the parts to the whole but also from objects to relationships. These relationships include the relationships among the system’s components and also those between the system as a whole and surrounding larger systems. Those relationships between the system and its environment are what we mean by context. Systems thinking is always contextual thinking.

Understanding relationships is not that easy for us, because it is something that goes counter to the traditional scientific enterprise in Western culture. In science, we have been taught that things must be measured and weighed. But relationships cannot be measured and weighed; relationships must be mapped. So there is another shift of perspective: from measuring to mapping, from quantity to quality. When we map relationships, we find certain configurations that occur repeatedly. This is what we call a pattern. Networks, cycles, feedback loops, are examples of patterns of organization that are characteristic of life.

When we apply the new conception of life to studying the structures, metabolic processes, and evolution of the myriads of species on the planet, we notice immediately that the outstanding characteristic of our biosphere is that it has sustained life for billions of years. How does the Earth do that?

To understand how nature sustains life, we must move from biology to ecology, because sustained life is a property of an ecosystem rather than a single organism or species. Over billions of years of evolution, the Earth’s ecosystems have evolved certain principles of organization to sustain the web of life. Knowledge of these principles of organization, or principles of ecology, is what has become known as ecological literacy.[^6]

Once we become ecologically literate, once we understand the processes and patterns of relationships that enable ecosystems to sustain life, we will also understand the many ways in which our human civilization, especially since the Industrial Revolution, has ignored these ecological patterns and processes and has interfered with them. And we will realize that these interferences are the fundamental causes of many of our current world problems. Thinking systemically, we will recognize the major problems of our time as systemic problems—all interconnected and interdependent. This is the fundamental message of the first part of Lester’s book, _Plan B_, in which he offers a detailed systemic analysis to document the fundamental interconnectedness of our current world problems.

To summarize Lester’s analysis, I have designed a conceptual map that shows how the major problems of our time are interlinked. It is evident that these interconnections are very intricate, and the entire conceptual map is rather overwhelming. So let us examine it piece by piece.

The fundamental dilemma underlying the major problems of our time seems to be the illusion that unlimited growth is possible on a finite planet. This, in turn, reflects the clash between linear thinking and the nonlinear patterns in our biosphere—the ecological networks and cycles that constitute the web of life. This highly nonlinear global network contains countless feedback loops through which the planet balances and regulates itself. Our current economic system, by contrast, is fueled by materialism and greed that do not seem to recognize any limits.

There are actually three kinds of growth that have severe impacts on our natural environment: economic growth, corporate growth, and population growth. The illusion of the viability of unlimited growth is maintained by economists who refuse to include the social and environmental costs of economic activities in their theories. Consequently, there are huge differences between market prices and true costs, for example for fossil fuels. As Lester points out, this amounts to a massive market failure.

Economic and corporate growth are pursued by global capitalism, the dominant economic system today. At the center of the global economy is a network of financial flows, which has been designed without any ethical framework. In fact, social inequality and social exclusion are inherent features of economic globalization, widening the gap between the rich and the poor and increasing world poverty.[^7] Economic and corporate growth are pursued relentlessly by promoting excessive consumption and a throw-away economy, which makes them energy and resource intensive, generating waste and pollution and depleting the Earth’s natural resources.

Population growth and poverty form a vicious circle, or self-amplifying feedback loop. Rapid population growth reduces the available cropland and water supplies per person. The resulting poverty, often coupled with illiteracy, in turn increases the demographic pressure, as illiterate women typically have less access to family planning and thus have much larger families than literate women. The results of this mutual reinforcement of demographic pressure and poverty are the growing health challenges of the HIV epidemic and other infectious diseases, on the one hand, and further depletion of resources on the other.

Figure 16. Interdependence of world problems, conceptual map based on Plan B 3.0 by Lester Brown (2008).

Excessive consumption and waste in industrialized countries and rapid population growth in many developing countries combine to exert severe pressures on our natural resources, leading to overgrazing, deforestation, and overfishing. The results are well known—falling water tables, rivers running dry, lakes disappearing, shrinking forests, collapsing fisheries, eroding soils, grasslands turning into deserts—all of which are severe threats to food security.

All of these environmental problems are exacerbated by global climate change, caused by our energy-intensive and fossil-fuel-based technologies. This is aggravated by deforestation through the release of massive amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. Climate change manifests itself in increased floods, destructive storms, and forest fires, which cause economic devastation and give rise to large numbers of climate refugees. Other manifestations of climate change are severe heat waves and droughts that lead to crop withering, thus shrinking grain harvests and further threatening food security. In many regions of the world, the resulting decline of rainfall intensifies an already severe water scarcity.

Rising temperatures cause not only shrinking grain harvests, but also the melting of ice—both glaciers and polar ice—and consequently the rise of sea levels. The melting of glaciers severely impacts the irrigation of rice and wheat fields by large rivers fed by those glaciers. These effects are additional huge threats to food security. Rising seas could potentially result in millions of climate refugees in the coming years. And finally, rising global temperatures alter many habitats and threaten the extinction of species living in them.

The excessive dependence of fossil fuels not only causes global warming but has brought us close to “peak oil.” After oil production reaches its peak, it will decrease worldwide, extraction of the remaining reserves will be more and more costly, and hence the price of oil will continue to rise. Most affected will be the oil-intensive segments of the global economy, in particular the automobile industry, the airline industry, and industrial agriculture. Thus food prices are rising with rising oil prices, further threatening food security. There is now a serious risk that rising grain prices will lead to chaos in world grain markets and to food riots in low- and middle-income countries that import grain.

The search for alternative energy sources has recently led to increased production of ethanol and other biofuels, and since the fuel value of grain is higher on the markets than its food value, more and more grain is diverted from food to producing fuels. At the same time, the price of grain is moving up toward the oil-equivalent value.

Lester’s book makes it abundantly clear that virtually all our environmental problems are threats to our food security—water scarcity, soil erosion, collapsing fisheries, extreme climate events—and most recently, the rise of food prices due to rising energy costs and increasing diversion of grains to biofuel.

In addition, increased fuel consumption accelerates global warming, which results in crop losses in heat waves that make crops wither and from the loss of glaciers that feed rivers essential to irrigation. When we think systemically and understand how all these processes are interrelated, we realize that the vehicles we drive and other consumer choices we make have a major impact on the food supply to large populations in other parts of the world.

As a result of these multiple threats to food security, world hunger is now on the rise again after a long steady decline. This worldwide famine and the large numbers of climate refugees have resulted in increasing numbers of failing states, characterized by the disintegration of law and order and the rise of civil conflict. The governments of these states can no longer provide security for their citizens, some of whom in sheer desperation turn to terrorism. With increasing numbers of failing states, and ever increasing tears in the fabric of the web of life, caused by continuing species extinction, civilization itself could begin to unravel.

As Lester shows in great detail in his book, and as you can see from my rather complex conceptual map, today’s world problems are all fundamentally interconnected and interdependent. The strategy of _Plan B_ is informed by the awareness of this interdependence. It involves several simultaneous actions that are mutually supportive, mirroring the interdependence of the problems they address. Lester emphasizes that the components of _Plan B_ are shaped by what is needed today, not by what is considered politically feasible. The main goals are, in the author’s words, “restructuring the economy, restoring its natural support systems, eradicating poverty, stabilizing population and climate, and, above all, restoring hope.”

The theoretical framework underlying _Plan B_ is based on the thorough understanding of the basic principles of ecology. Its detailed proposals involve applying this ecological knowledge to the redesign of our technologies and social institutions. All the proposals of _Plan B_ are based on existing technologies and are illustrated with successful examples from countries around the world. They make it evident that we have the knowledge, the technologies, and the financial means to save civilization and build a sustainable future. What we need is political will and leadership.

ESSAY 27|The COVID-19 Pandemic

### _A Systemic Analysis_

2020

COVID-19 RESULTED IN massive disruptions of our daily lives, and its impacts are likely to lead to historic political and social transformations. Like the other major problems of our multifaceted global crisis, the COVID pandemic cannot be understood in isolation. It is a typical systemic problem, which means that it is related to, and dependent upon, other major problems—environmental, social, economic, and political.

From a systemic perspective, the coronavirus must be seen as a biological response of Gaia, our living planet, to the ecological and social emergency humanity has brought upon itself. It arose from an ecological imbalance and has dramatic consequences because of social and economic imbalances.

During the last decades of the 20th century, humanity exceeded the Earth’s carrying capacity. World population has grown to 7.8 billion, and the irrational obsession of our political and corporate leaders with perpetual economic growth has generated a multifaceted existential crisis threatening humanity’s very survival.[^1]

Scientists and environmental activists have warned of the dire consequences of our unsustainable social, economic, and political systems for decades, but until now, our corporate and political leaders, unable to break their intoxication with financial profits and political power, stubbornly resisted these warnings. Focusing their attention on short-term economic and political fluctuations, they disregarded the impending catastrophic long-term consequences. Now, however, our political and financial elites are forced to pay attention, as COVID-19 brought the earlier warnings into real time.

The clear-cutting of large areas of tropical rainforest by multinational food corporations, relentlessly pursuing excessive growth and profits, as well massive intrusions into other ecosystems around the world driven by the same motivation, have fragmented these self-regulating systems and fractured the web of life. One of the many consequences of these destructive actions was that viruses, which had lived in symbiosis with certain animal species, jumped from those species to others and to humans, where they were highly toxic or deadly.

In the 1960s, an obscure virus jumped from a rare species of monkeys, killed as “bush meat” in West Africa, to humans. From there it spread to the United States, where it was identified as the HIV virus and caused the AIDS epidemic, killing an estimated 39 million people worldwide over four decades. Similarly, the coronavirus jumped from a species of bats to humans in China, and from there it rapidly spread around the world.

Population density is the key variable in the spread of COVID-19, and population density is often a consequence of excessive profit maximizing—whether on giant cruise ships and in other forms of mass tourism, in giant supermarkets and department stores, meat packing plants, or in crowded living situations caused by social and economic inequality. Ecology has taught us that in complex systems, maximizing any single variable will invariably lead to stress and vulnerability of the system as a whole. In previous times, these vulnerable social and cultural conditions were usually concealed by the corporate media. But now the coronavirus, which does not know any social or cultural boundaries, has laid them open. Biology trumps economics and politics.

The role of social justice during a pandemic is particularly interesting. In normal times, the rich are relatively isolated from the poor. They live in their own neighborhoods, have their own schools, hospitals, restaurants, and clubs. The fate of the poor does not affect them greatly. During a pandemic like COVID-19, the situation changes dramatically. Since the virus does not know any social boundaries, the fate of the poor can no longer be separated from that of the rich. Because of crowded living conditions, lack of access to clean water, and—especially in the United States—inadequate healthcare and social protection, the poor are much more susceptible to being infected. In addition, systemic racism came to the fore during the pandemic. In the United States, African and Hispanic Americans were disproportionately impacted, dying at rates two to four times the rate of White Americans, as they were more likely to be in essential jobs and thus more exposed.[^2]

Eventually, the poor infected also the rich because even though the two classes are separated socially, they are not separated biologically. There are numerous physical contacts between the rich and their personal assistants, drivers, delivery services, and cleaning and maintenance staff. Through these physical contacts, the virus propagates and infects people regardless of their social class. During a pandemic, therefore, social justice is no longer a political issue of left versus right; it becomes an issue of life and death. To prevent the spread of pandemics—now and in the future—it will be essential to improve the living conditions of the poor. More generally, ethical behavior—behavior for the common good—becomes an issue of life and death during a pandemic, because a pandemic like COVID-19 can only be overcome by collective, cooperative actions.

Similar considerations apply to world population growth. Demographers have long known that the most effective means of curbing population growth are educating girls and enhancing the role and status of women around the world—ensuring their access to economic and political power and safeguarding their reproductive rights.[^3] Once again, we see that social justice goes hand in hand with ecological balance.

When the pandemic spread around the world in March 2020, one country after another went into lockdown with only essential businesses remaining open and most people confined to their homes. As a consequence, transportation of people and goods was radically reduced, supply chains were disrupted, businesses closed, the stock market collapsed, and unemployment soared. The worldwide health crisis has gone hand in hand with a worldwide economic crisis.

Both of these crises have led to widespread tragic consequences for individuals and communities around the world. However, from a planetary ecological perspective, there have also been many positive consequences. As automobile traffic and industrial activities decreased dramatically, the pollution of major cities around the world suddenly disappeared, and we are once again enjoying clear skies and clean air. Wildlife is flourishing in ecosystems undisturbed by humans. As giant cruise ships no longer enter the Venetian lagoon and other tourists stay at home, the canals in Venice have become so clear that fish can be seen again. In India, residents of Punjab are now able to enjoy a stunning view of the tops of the Himalayas, 200 km away, which they have not seen for 30 years. The coronavirus has already been more effective in reducing CO2 emissions and slowing down climate breakdown than all the world’s policy initiatives combined.[^4]

This does not mean that we want to continue in the current situation. But the world’s COVID-19 response has shown us what is possible when people realize that their lives are at stake—individually during the pandemic and for civilization as a whole in the climate emergency. We know now that the world is able to respond with urgency and coherence once the political will has been aroused.

With COVID-19, Gaia has presented us with valuable, life-saving lessons. The question is, Will humanity heed these lessons? Will we shift from undifferentiated, extractive economic growth to regenerative, qualitative growth? Will we replace fossil fuels with renewable forms of energy for all our energy needs?

Will we stop excessive mass tourism and instead revitalize local communities? Will we replace our centralized, energy-intensive system of industrial agriculture with organic, community-oriented and regenerative farming? Will we plant billions of trees to draw down CO2 from the atmosphere and restore the world’s ecosystems so that viruses dangerous to humans are confined again to other animal species where they do no harm?

We have the knowledge and the technologies to embark on all these initiatives. Will we have the political will? “The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,” to quote Bob Dylan. However, what we are seeing already is that corresponding social policies, which were unthinkable just a few months ago, are now being discussed seriously in various countries.

For example, Denmark is paying 75% of the salaries lost by employees in private companies and 90% of lost income to self-employed individuals to help them through the crisis. The United Kingdom, similarly, is covering 80% of salaries. In the United States, the idea of a universal basic income, long considered to be a fringe idea, is now discussed even by Republican politicians. Spain is nationalizing its private hospitals. California is leasing hotels to shelter homeless people during the pandemic. The Green New Deal, already endorsed previously by some Democratic presidential candidates in the United States, is now being discussed in the mainstream as a program of economic recovery.

If we can catalyze global leadership to continue such social policies, and if we can add to them policies that respect and cooperate with nature’s inherent ability to sustain life, we may not only overcome the COVID-19 pandemic but also succeed in stabilizing world population and the climate, nurturing local communities, and restoring the Earth’s ecosystems.

We may see CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere return to the safe level of 350 parts per million, and we may see climate catastrophes become rare, as they have been in previous centuries. Looking back on 2020, future historians may conclude that even though COVID-19 had widespread tragic consequences for countless individuals and communities, in the long run it may have saved humanity and large parts of the planetary community of life from extinction.

## Ecology and Ethics

FROM THE BEGINNING of my explorations of the paradigm shift in science and society in the 1970s, I have emphasized in my books, articles, and seminars that this involves not only a change of concepts and ideas but also a profound change of values. During the early 1990s, I became aware of the philosophical school of deep ecology, founded by Arne Naess in the 1970s, which seemed to provide an ideal ethical background to the systems view of life. Ten years later, I expanded my exploration of ecological ethics within the context of the Earth Charter, a global declaration of 16 ethical values and principles for building a just, sustainable, and peaceful world.[^1] The values of deep ecology are expressed in the Earth Charter’s central principle “respect and care for the community of life.”

In the two essays in this chapter, I explore the ethical dimensions of the systems view of life in some depth. Essay 28]], based on a lecture I gave at Brown University, provides an introduction to the philosophy of deep ecology and its connection with the systems view of life, on the one hand, and with spirituality on the other. Deep ecology is grounded in ecocentric (Earth- centered) values. It is a worldview that acknowledges the inherent value of nonhuman life, recognizing all living beings as members of ecological communities bound together in a network of interdependencies. When this perception becomes part of our daily awareness, a radically new system of ethics emerges.

In essay 29]], written about ten years later, I argue that ethics, even though usually associated with philosophy or religion, can also be considered from a scientific perspective. For billions of years of evolution, nature has sustained life by creating and nurturing communities, and natural selection favors those communities in which individuals act for the benefit of the community as a whole. In the human realm, we call this ethical behavior. Thus, ethics always has to do with community; it is behavior for the common good.

I point out in the essay that we all share two communities to which we belong. We are all members of humanity, and we all belong to the global biosphere, the community of life. As members of those two global communities, it behooves us to honor human dignity and ecological sustainability. These values are displayed in all their facets in the Earth Charter, which I review in detail in the essay. I conclude that this document, produced in a unique global collaborative process, is a perfect summary of the kind of Earth ethics we need in our time.

ESSAY 28|Deep Ecology

### _A New Paradigm_

1993

#### **The Nineties: Decade of the Environment**

There is widespread agreement today that the nineties are a critical decade. The survival of humanity and of the planet are at stake. The nineties are the decade of the environment, not because we say so but because of events almost beyond our control. Concern with the environment is no longer one of many “single issues;” it is the context of everything else—of our lives, our business, our politics.

Today we are faced with a whole series of global problems that are harming the biosphere and human life in alarming ways that may soon become irreversible. We have ample documentation about the extent and significance of these problems. One of the best recent accounts is the book _Earth in the Balance_ by Vice President Al Gore.[^1] Gore’s thorough and devastating review of the series of ecological catastrophes we face includes—in his own words—“the loss of the world’s rainforests and their living species, the loss of the Everglades, the Aral Sea, the old-growth forests of the Pacific Northwest, the topsoil of the Midwest, the vegetation and soils of the Himalayas, Lake Baikal, the Sahel, the unnecessary deaths of 37,000 children every day, the thinning of the stratospheric ozone layer, the disruption of the climate balance we have known since the dawn of the human species.” And the list goes on.

#### **Crisis of Perception**

The more we study the major problems of our time, the more we come to realize that they cannot be understood in isolation. They are systemic problems—interconnected and interdependent. Stabilizing world population will only be possible when poverty is reduced worldwide. The extinction of animal and plant species on a massive scale will continue as long as the Third World is burdened by massive debts. Only if we stop the international arms trade will we have the resources to prevent the many destructive impacts on the biosphere and on human life.

In fact, the more you study the situation, the more you realize that these problems are just different facets of one single crisis, which is essentially a crisis of perception. It derives from the fact that most of us, and especially our large social institutions, subscribe to the concepts of an outdated worldview, a perception of reality inadequate for dealing with our overpopulated, globally interconnected world.

#### **Paradigm Shift**

At the same time, researchers at the leading edge of science, various social movements, and numerous alternative networks are developing a new vision of reality that will form the basis of our future technologies, economic systems, and social institutions. So we are at the beginning of a fundamental change of worldview in science and society, a change of paradigms as radical as the Copernican Revolution.

The paradigm that is now receding has dominated Western culture for several hundred years, during which it has shaped our modern society and significantly influenced the rest of the world. This paradigm consists of a number of ideas and values, among them the view of the universe as a mechanical system composed of elementary building blocks, the view of the human body as a machine, the view of life in society as a competitive struggle for existence, the belief in unlimited material progress to be achieved through economic and technological growth, and—last but not least—the belief that a society in which the female is everywhere subsumed under the male is one that follows a basic law of nature. All of these assumptions have been fatefully challenged by recent events. And indeed, a radical revision of them is now occurring.

The new paradigm may be called a holistic worldview, seeing the world as an integrated whole rather than a dissociated collection of parts. It may also be called an ecological view, if the term _ecological_ is used in a much broader and deeper sense than usual.

#### **Deep Ecology**

This broader and deeper sense of _ecological_ is associated with a specific philosophical school and, moreover, with a global grassroots movement known as deep ecology, which is rapidly gaining prominence. The philosophical school was founded by the Norwegian philosopher Arne Naess in the early seventies with his distinction between “shallow” and “deep” ecology. This distinction is now widely accepted as a very useful terminology for referring to a major division within contemporary environmental thought.[^2]

Shallow ecology is anthropocentric. It views humans as above, or outside of nature, as the source of all value, and ascribes only instrumental, or use-value to nature. Deep ecology does not separate humans from the natural environment, nor does it separate anything else from it. It does not see the world as a collection of isolated objects but rather as a network of phenomena that are fundamentally interconnected and interdependent. Deep ecology recognizes the intrinsic values of all living beings and views humans as just one particular strand in the web of life. It recognizes that we are all embedded in, and ultimately dependent upon, the cyclical processes of nature.

Deep ecological awareness is ultimately spiritual, or religious, awareness. When the concept of the human spirit is understood as the mode of consciousness in which the individual feels connected to the cosmos as a whole, it becomes clear that ecological awareness is spiritual in its deepest essence. It is therefore not surprising that the emerging new vision of reality, based on deep ecological awareness, is consistent with the so-called perennial philosophy of spiritual traditions, whether we talk about the spirituality of Christian mystics, that of Buddhists, or the philosophy and cosmology underlying the Native American traditions.

#### **Living Systems**

In science, the theory of living systems, which originated in cybernetics in the 1940s but emerged fully only during the last 20 years or so, provides the most appropriate scientific formulation of deep ecology.[^3]

Systems theory looks at the world in terms of relationships and integration. Living systems are integrated wholes whose properties cannot be reduced to those of smaller parts. Examples of systems abound in nature. Every organism—from the smallest bacterium through the wide range of plants and animals to humans—is an integrated whole and thus a living system. Cells are living systems, and so are the various tissues and organs of the body, the human brain being the most complex example. But systems are not confined to individual organisms and their parts. The same aspects of wholeness are exhibited by social systems—such as a family or a community—and by ecosystems that consist of a variety of organisms and inanimate matter in mutual interaction.

So we have multileveled structures of systems within systems. Each of these forms a whole with respect to its parts while at the same time being a part of a larger whole. Thus, cells combine to form tissues, tissues to form organs, and organs to form organisms. These in turn exist within social systems and ecosystems. Throughout the living world, we find living systems nesting within other living systems. One of the great advantages of the systems approach is the fact that the same concepts can be applied at different systems levels, which often leads to important insights.

#### **Gaia**

The largest living system that we know with some degree of accuracy is our planet, the Earth. About 20 years ago, astronauts were able, for the first time in human history, to see our planet from outer space. Their perception of the Earth in all its beauty—a blue and white globe floating in the deep darkness of space—moved them deeply and, as many have since declared, was a profound spiritual experience that forever changed their relationship to the Earth. The magnificent photographs of the whole Earth, which these astronauts brought back, became a powerful symbol for the global ecology movement.

While the astronauts looked at the planet and beheld its beauty, the Earth was also examined from outer space by the sensors of scientific instruments, and the results of these examinations led scientists to a radical conclusion. Our planet is not only teeming with life but is a living system, a living being, in its own right. The surface of the Earth, which we had always been regarded as the _environment_ of life, is really a _part_ of life. The air that surrounds us is a circulatory system, like the blood in our bodies, produced and sustained by life. Recognizing that this hypothesis represents a renaissance of a powerful ancient myth, James Lovelock and Lynn Margulis called it the Gaia hypothesis, after the Greek goddess of the Earth.[^4]

In many ways, the Earth as a living system is like a tree. As a tree grows, there is just a thin layer of living tissue around its perimeter. All the wood inside, more than 97% of the tree, is dead. Similarly, there is a thin layer of living tissue around the Earth, which contains all the trees, all the other plants and animals, and us humans.[^5] To have an idea of the thinness of this living tissue, the biosphere, imagine a globe of the size of a basketball with the countries and the oceans painted on it. The thickness of the biosphere on such a globe would be the thickness of the paint! This relatively thin layer is what we need to protect and renew.

A tree is a living model of the Earth also in other ways. Some of the giant trees in the tropical rainforests are almost complete ecosystems themselves, sustaining a vast number of species, from microorganisms to large animals, in a web of ecological relationships. And then the whole rainforest, of course, is an ecosystem that sustains not only vast numbers of living beings, including humans, but also its own climate, and even the global climate. The rainforests, in a way, are the lungs of the Earth. Cutting them down as we do, at the rate of one football field a second, is like cutting out a person’s lungs piece by piece. It can only result in catastrophe.

#### **Systems Thinking**

To understand living systems, we need a new way of thinking. The essential properties of a system are properties of the whole, which none of the parts have. They arise from the interactions and relationships between the parts. These properties are destroyed when a system is dissected, either physically or theoretically, into isolated elements. Although we can discern individual parts in any system, these parts are not isolated, and the nature of the whole is always different from the mere sum of its parts. Accordingly, the systems approach does not concentrate on basic building blocks but rather on basic principles of organization.

So what exactly is the systems approach? I shall identify five criteria of systems thinking that, I claim, hold for all the sciences—the natural sciences, the humanities, and the social sciences. I shall formulate each criterion in terms of the shift from the old to the new paradigm.

#### 1. SHIFT FROM THE PARTS TO THE WHOLE

In the old paradigm, it is believed that in any complex system the behavior of the whole can be understood from the properties of the parts. This is the celebrated method of analytic thinking developed by Descartes. It has been an essential characteristic of modern scientific thought and has proved extremely useful in the development of scientific theories and the realization of complex technological projects.

The parts themselves cannot be analyzed any further, except by reducing them to still smaller parts. Indeed, Western science has been progressing in that way, and at each step, there has been a level of fundamental constituents that could not be analyzed any further.

The great shock of 20th-century science, first in quantum physics and then in the life sciences, has been that systems cannot be understood by analysis. The properties of the parts are not intrinsic properties, but can be understood only within the context of the larger whole.

Thus, the relationship between the parts and the whole has been reversed. In the new paradigm, the properties of the parts can be understood only from the principles of organization of the whole. This was the central aspect of the conceptual revolution of quantum physics in the 1920s. Heisenberg was so impressed by this aspect that he titled his autobiography _Der Teil und das Ganze_ (The part and the whole).[^6] Ultimately, there are no parts at all. What we call a part is merely a pattern in an inseparable web of relationships. Therefore, the shift from the parts to the whole can also be expressed as a shift from objects to relationships.

So systems thinking is the opposite of analytical thinking. Analysis means taking something apart in order to understand it; systems thinking means putting it into the context of a larger whole. Systems thinking, therefore, is contextual thinking. Explaining things in terms of a larger context means explaining them in terms of their environment. Therefore, we can also say that systems thinking is environmental thinking.

#### 2. SHIFT FROM STRUCTURE TO PROCESS

In the old paradigm, there are fundamental structures, and then there are forces and mechanisms through which these interact, thus giving rise to processes. In the new paradigm, every structure is seen as the manifestation of an underlying process. The entire web of relationships is intrinsically dynamic. Systems thinking is always process thinking. In ecology, for example, we study the cyclical processes of the flow of nutrients through ecosystems.

#### 3. SHIFT FROM OBJECTIVE TO EPISTEMIC SCIENCE

In the old paradigm, scientific descriptions are believed to be objective, that is, independent of the human observer and the process of knowledge. In the new paradigm, it is believed that epistemology—understanding of the process of knowledge—must be included explicitly in the description of natural phenomena.

This recognition entered into science with Heisenberg and is closely related to the view of physical reality as a web of relationships. Whenever we isolate a pattern in this network and define it as a part, or an object (i.e., wherever we define boundaries), we do so by cutting through some of its connections to the rest of the network, and this may be done in different ways. As Heisenberg put it, “What we observe is not nature itself, but nature exposed to our method of questioning.”[^7] This method of questioning—in other words, epistemology—inevitably becomes part of the theory.

#### 4. SHIFT FROM BUILDING TO NETWORK AS METAPHOR OF KNOWLEDGE

The metaphor of knowledge as a building has been used in Western science and philosophy for thousands of years. There are _fundamental_ laws, _fundamental_ principles, basic _building blocks_, and so on. The _edifice_ of science must be built on firm _foundations_. During periods of paradigm shifts, it was always felt that the foundations of knowledge were shifting, or even crumbling, and that feeling induced great anxiety. Einstein, for example, wrote in his autobiography about the early days of quantum mechanics:

All my attempts to adapt the theoretical foundation of physics to this (new type) of knowledge failed completely. It was as if the ground had been pulled out from under one, with no firm foundation to be seen anywhere, upon which one could have built.[^8]

In the new paradigm, the metaphor of knowledge as a building is being replaced by that of the network. As we perceive reality as a network of relationships, our descriptions, too, form an interconnected network of concepts and models in which there are no foundations. For most scientists, this metaphor of knowledge as a network with no firm foundations is extremely uncomfortable.

When the notion of scientific knowledge as a network of concepts and models, in which no part is any more fundamental than the others, is applied to science as a whole, it implies that physics can no longer be seen as the most fundamental level of science. Since there are no foundations in the network, the phenomena described by physics are not any more fundamental than those described, say, by biology or psychology. They belong to different systems levels, but none of those levels is any more fundamental than the others.

#### 5. SHIFT FROM TRUTH TO APPROXIMATE DESCRIPTIONS

The four criteria of systems thinking I have presented so far are all interdependent. Nature is seen as an interconnected, dynamic web of relationships, in which the identification of specific patterns as “objects” depends on the human observer and the process of knowledge. This web of relationships is described in terms of a corresponding network of concepts and models, none of which is any more fundamental than the others.

This new approach immediately raises an important question. If everything is connected to everything else, how can you ever hope to understand anything? Since all natural phenomena are ultimately interconnected, in order to explain any one of them we need to understand all the others, which is obviously impossible.

What makes it possible to turn the systems approach into a scientific theory is the fact that there is such a thing as approximate knowledge. This insight is crucial to all of modern science. The old paradigm is based on the Cartesian belief in the certainty of scientific knowledge. In the new paradigm it is recognized that all scientific concepts and theories are limited and approximate. Science can never provide any complete and definitive understanding. Scientists do not deal with truth in the sense of a precise correspondence between the description and the described phenomena. They deal with limited and approximate descriptions of reality. Louis Pasteur said it beautifully: “Science advances through tentative answers to a series of more and more subtle questions which reach deeper and deeper into the essence of natural phenomena.”[^9]

#### **New Values**

So far, I have emphasized perceptions and thinking. But deep ecology requires not only a shift in our perceptions and ways of thinking, but also a corresponding shift in our values.

And here it is interesting to note the striking connection between these changes of thinking and of values. Both may be seen as shifts from self- assertion to integration. These two tendencies—the self-assertive and the integrative—are both essential aspects of all living systems. Being an integrated whole, a living organism must assert itself in its individuality vis-à-vis other organisms. And being at the same time a part of a larger whole, it must integrate itself into that larger system. So neither self-assertion nor integration is intrinsically good or bad. What is good, or healthy, is a dynamic balance; what is bad, or unhealthy, is imbalance—overemphasis of one tendency and neglect of the other. In the old paradigm, we have been overemphasizing the self-assertive values and ways of thinking and have neglected their integrative counterparts. So what I am suggesting is not to replace one mode by the other, but rather to establish a better balance between the two.

With that in mind, let’s look at the various manifestations of the shift from self-assertion to integration. As far as thinking is concerned, we are talking about a shift from the rational to the intuitive, from analysis to synthesis, from reductionism to holism, from linear to nonlinear thinking. As far as values are concerned, we are observing a corresponding shift from competition to cooperation, from expansion to conservation, from quantity to quality, from domination to partnership.

You may have noticed that the self-assertive values—competition, expansion, domination—are generally associated with men. Indeed, in patriarchal society they are not only favored but also given economic rewards and political power. And this is one of the reasons why the shift to a more balanced value systems is so difficult for most people, and especially for most men. It is also the reason for a natural kinship between ecology and feminism, as expressed in ecofeminism.[^10]

#### **Ecological Ethics**

The whole question of values is crucial to deep ecology; it is, in fact, its central defining characteristic. Whereas the entire old paradigm is based on anthropocentric (human-centered) values, deep ecology is grounded in ecocentric (earth-centered) values. It is a worldview that acknowledges the inherent value of non-human life. All human beings are members of _oikos_, the Earth Household; a community bound together in a network of interdependencies. When this deep ecological perception becomes part of our daily awareness, a radically new system of ethics will emerge.

Such a deep ecological ethics is urgently needed today especially in science, since most of what scientists are doing is not life-furthering and life-preserving but life-destroying. With physicists designing weapons systems that threaten to wipe out life on the planet, with chemists contaminating the global environment, with biologists releasing new and unknown types of microorganisms without knowing the consequences, with psychologists and other scientists torturing animals in the name of scientific progress—with all these activities going on, it seems most urgent to introduce ethical standards into modern science.

It is generally not recognized that values are not peripheral to science and technology but constitute their very basis and driving force. During the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century, values were separated from facts, and ever since that time, we have tended to believe that scientific facts are independent of what we do and therefore independent of our values. In reality, scientific facts emerge out of an entire constellation of human perceptions, values, and actions—in one word, out of a paradigm—from which they cannot be separated. Although much of the detailed research may not depend explicitly on the scientist’s value system, the larger paradigm within which this research is pursued will never be value free. Scientists, therefore, are responsible for their research not only intellectually but also morally.

Within the context of deep ecology, the view that values are inherent in all of living nature is grounded in the deep ecological, or spiritual, experience that nature and the self are one. This expansion of the self all the way to the identification with nature is the grounding of deep ecology, as Arne Naess clearly recognized:

Care flows naturally if the “self” is widened and deepened so that protection of free Nature is felt and conceived as protection of ourselves. . . . Just as we need no morals to make us breathe . . . [so] if your “self” in the wide sense embraces another being, you need no moral exhortation to show care. . . . You care for yourself without feeling any moral pressure to do it. . . . If reality is like it is experienced by the ecological self, our behavior _naturally_ and beautifully follows norms of strict environmental ethics.[^11]

What this implies is that the connection between an ecological _perception_ of the world and corresponding _behavior_ is not a logical but a psychological connection.[^12] Logic does not lead us from the fact that we are an integral part of the web of life to certain norms of how we should live. However, if we have deep ecological awareness, or experience, of being part of the web of life, then we _will_ (as opposed to _should_) be inclined to care for all of living nature. Indeed, we can scarcely refrain from responding in this way.

#### **Deep Questions**

There is another way in which Arne Naess has characterized deep ecology. “The essence of deep ecology,” he says, “is to ask deeper questions.”[^13] This is also the essence of a paradigm shift. You need to be prepared to question every single aspect of the old paradigm. Eventually, you will not need to throw everything away, but before you know that, you need to be willing to question everything. So deep ecology asks deep questions about the very foundations of our modern, scientific, industrial, progress-oriented, materialistic worldview and way of life. It questions this entire paradigm from an ecological perspective; from the perspective of our relationships to one another, to future generations, and to the web of life of which we are part.

#### **Sustainability**

One of the most important areas for illustrating this point is business and the economy. Today, the ecological context is becoming more and more central to business and to management, and one of the most important tasks will be to abandon the blind pursuit of unrestricted growth. Growth is the main driving force of current economic policies and business practices and, tragically, is also the main driving force of global environmental destruction.

Growth, of course, is characteristic of all life. However, in the living world it has not only a quantitative but also a qualitative meaning. For a human being, for example, to grow means to develop to maturity, not only by getting bigger but also qualitatively through inner growth. The same is true for all living systems. The systems concept of growth is qualitative and multidimensional.

To qualify economic growth means to establish criteria for acceptable and unacceptable growth. In recent years, sustainability has emerged as a central criterion of this kind. Lester Brown of the Worldwatch Institute, who has been one of the main advocates of sustainability for many years, defines a sustainable society as one that is able to satisfy its needs without diminishing the chances of future generations.[^14] This is an enterprise that transcends all our differences of race, culture, or class. The term _ecology_ derives from the Greek word _oikos_, “household.” The Earth is our common home, and creating a sustainable world for our children and for future generations is our common task.

ESSAY 29|Earth Ethics

2014

ETHICS IS USUALLY associated with philosophy or religion, but it can also be considered from a scientific perspective. When we study the history of evolution, we come to realize that nature sustains life by creating and nurturing communities. No individual organism can exist in isolation. Animals depend on the photosynthesis of plants for their energy needs; plants depend on the carbon dioxide produced by animals, as well as on the nitrogen fixed by bacteria at their roots; and together, plants, animals, and microorganisms regulate the entire biosphere and maintain the conditions conducive to life.

As soon as the first cells appeared on Earth, they formed tightly interlinked communities, known as bacterial colonies, and for billions of years, nature has maintained such communities at all levels of life. Natural selection favors those communities in which individuals act for the benefit of the community as a whole. In the human realm, we call this ethical behavior. So, ethics always has to do with community. Ethical behavior is always related to the particular community to which we belong; it is behavior for the common good.

When we look at today’s world, we can see that we all belong to many communities, but we share two communities to which we belong. We are all members of humanity, and we all belong to the global biosphere, the community of life. We are members of _oikos_, the Earth Household, and as such, we should behave as the other members of the household behave—the plants, animals, and microorganisms that form the vast network of relationships that we call the web of life.

The outstanding characteristic of the biosphere is its inherent ability to sustain life. As members of the global community of living beings, it behooves us to behave in such a way that we do not interfere with nature’s inherent ability to sustain life. This is the very essence of ecological sustainability.

As members of the human community, our behavior should reflect a respect of human dignity and basic human rights. Since human life encompasses biological, cognitive, social, and cultural dimensions, human rights should be respected in all of these dimensions.

To lay this out in detail is quite a challenge, but fortunately, we have a magnificent document that covers a broad range of human dignity and human rights. This document is titled the Earth Charter.[^1] It was initiated at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 and was written in the subsequent six years in a unique collaborative effort involving hundreds of organizations and thousands of individuals—NGOs, indigenous peoples, and many other groups around the world.[^2]

The Earth Charter is a declaration of 16 values and principles for building a sustainable, just, and peaceful world. Each principle is formulated as an ethical imperative. Principle 1, for example, states: “Respect Earth and life in all its diversity!” The 16 principles are arranged in four groups, and each principle is accompanied by several supporting subprinciples in which its contents and implications are spelled out in more detail.

Having been designed from the beginning as a civil-society process rather than an intergovernmental negotiation, global consensus was reached on a text expressed in language that could be widely accepted by diverse cultures. The whole drafting process was a shining example of global cooperation. The final text was published in 2000, and today it is still fully valid. It is really a magnificent summary of the Earth ethics we need in our time.

The vision of the Earth Charter is a systemic vision. It recognizes the interdependence of our global problems and provides a broad ethical framework for appropriate systemic solutions. Hence, all the principles and subprinciples in the text are interrelated and interdependent. To discuss them in detail, I have drawn a conceptual map, which shows how they relate to one another.

In this map, the headings of the four groups, as well as the principles themselves with their numbers, are shown in bold face, and key words from the subprinciples are written in smaller print. I should also mention that I have sometimes used language that is not in the Earth Charter text but seems appropriate for making connections with ideas by contemporary thinkers and activists. These terms, not used in the Earth Charter, are printed in italics.

![[f0319-01.png]]

Figure 17. The Earth Charter, conceptual map of principles and subprinciples.

Needless to say, the links shown in the map represent only some of the interconnections between the Earth Charter’s values and principles. To show them all would have made the map’s complexity overwhelming.

The first group of principles, “respect and care for the community of life,” addresses the core values of the Earth Charter. In this group we find, basically, the values of deep ecology, the philosophical school founded by Arne Naess in the 1970s.[^3] Deep ecology recognizes the intrinsic value of all living beings and views humans as just one particular strand in the web of life.

I find it impressive that the Earth Charter begins with core values, because this is the deepest level of the change of paradigms that is now urgently needed. The declaration begins in the first group with the fundamental values, and the principles in the other three groups then spell out what these values imply.

These other three groups relate to the three fundamental qualities of an ideal future world: sustainability, justice, and peace. Group II, “ecological integrity,” is related to ecological sustainability. Group III is “social and economic justice”; and Group IV is “democracy, nonviolence, peace.”

It is also interesting to note that these four groups are essentially the same as the four pillars of Green politics defined by the German Green Party in the early 1980s, long before the Earth Charter was written.[^4] These four pillars were ecology, social responsibility, grassroots democracy, and nonviolence. This is not a coincidence, because the global Green movement was very influential in the first formulations of the Earth Charter.

Each of the four groups contains four principles. In the first group (the group of deep ecological values), principle 1, “respect Earth and life,” includes the intrinsic value of all living beings—plants, animals, all of life—in other words, the defining value of deep ecology. Principle 1 also includes the inherent dignity of all human beings. This is related to principle 15, which is specifically about respect for all living beings, and to principle 12, which is about human dignity.

Principle 2 is about caring for the community of life, both in terms of preventing the depletion of natural resources and promoting the common good. Principle 3 is about building societies that are just, peaceful, and sustainable. These are the three fundamental qualities of the ideal future society. In my view, this is exactly what environmental activist and ecofeminist Vandana Shiva means by “Earth democracy.”[^5] Principle 3 is, of course, related to the third group of principles, “Social and Economic Justice,” and also to principle 13, the strengthening of democratic institutions.

Principle 4 in the first group is about sustainability. It is closely related to the whole second group of principles, “ecological integrity,” and it also includes the need to transmit ecological values to future generations, and is therefore related to education, which is the specific issue of principles 8 and 14.

In the second group, “ecological integrity,” principle 5 is “protect and restore ecosystem integrity,” which includes respecting biodiversity, environmental conservation and restoring ecosystems. Principle 6 is about preventing harm, which includes the well-known precautionary principle, as well as assessing environmental impacts and holding the responsible parties liable.

Principle 7 has two parts: ecodesign and ecological economics. Ecodesign practices are energy efficient, non-polluting, and labor intensive, thus providing plenty of jobs, and all this is of course related to ecological economics. To me, the main characteristic of an ecological economics is the shift from quantity to quality, which is implicit in the Earth Charter text, but I have added the explicit goal of qualitative growth (growth that enhances the quality of life), which implies an equitable distribution of wealth and is therefore related to the whole group “Social and Economic Justice.”[^6]

Principle 8 in the second group is about promoting what is often called ecological literacy and is related both to sustainability and to education, as I have mentioned.[^7]

The third group, “social and economic justice,” begins with the goal of eradicating poverty (principle 9), which includes food security, access to clean resources, and, significantly, access to education. Principle 9 is therefore linked to both principle 8 and principle 14 (these links are not shown in the map).

Principle 10 is about human development, which is linked to sustainability. This is the fundamental connection between ecological integrity and social justice. Development is used here in a much broader sense than currently used by economists. It is understood as a multidimensional process that includes self-determination, food sovereignty, and the equitable distribution of wealth—all related to ecological economics.

Principle 11, “gender equality,” shows once more the breadth and depth of the Earth Charter principles. It includes the human rights of women and girls, and I have added LGBTQIA rights, which are implicit in the text, even though this language was not used in 2000, when the Earth Charter was written. Gender equality is of course closely related to human dignity (principle 12), which also includes the rights of indigenous peoples.

The fourth group of principles, finally, has to do with “democracy, nonviolence, and peace.” It begins with the need to strengthen democratic institutions (principle 13), which is related to principle 3, “Earth democracy,” as I have mentioned. It includes supporting civil society and local communities, as well as the need for transparency and accountability in governance. Interestingly, democracy includes the principle of integrating ecological literacy into education (principle 14), which is related to both education and sustainability, as I have mentioned.

Principle 15 is about respect for all living beings. As I have mentioned, this is directly related to the values of deep ecology in the first group of principles. It includes preventing cruelty to animals and preventing the destruction of species.

And finally, principle 16 is about promoting a culture of tolerance, nonviolence, and peace. To me, the most interesting part of this principle is expressed in the last paragraph of the Earth Charter: “Recognize that peace is the wholeness created by right relationships with oneself, other persons, other cultures, other life, Earth, and the larger whole of which all are part.”

In other words, at the very end, the Earth Charter reiterates the values of deep ecology, and one could even say that it ends with a profound expression of spirituality.

## Science and Spirituality Revisited

THIRTY YEARS AFTER writing _The Tao of Physics_, my research of the art and science of Leonardo da Vinci led me once again to ponder deep questions about the nature of science, art, philosophy, and knowledge, about consciousness and the soul—all of which led me to revisit the issue of the relationship between science and spirituality. In the last essay of this book, based on a talk I gave at a conference in the United Kingdom and on an article published in the journal _Resurgence_, I offer my current views on this important issue, which had started my career on its long trajectory five decades ago.

I begin with the observation that the view of science and religion as a dichotomy has a long history, but that some scientists see no intrinsic dichotomy between the two disciplines. I assert that this confusing situation arises from a widespread failure to distinguish clearly between spirituality and religion. In my subsequent analysis, I define spiritual experience as a certain experience of reality in moments of heightened aliveness, which is independent of cultural and historical contexts; and religion as the organized attempt to understand spiritual experience, to interpret it within a definite cultural context, and to use this interpretation as a source of moral guidelines for the religious community. I emphasize that while religion may become dogmatic and fundamentalist, leading to the well-known conflicts with science, the spiritual experience of a profound oneness with the natural world is fully borne out by the new conception of life that has emerged at the forefront of science.

I then review the suggestions of remarkable parallels between quantum physics and Eastern philosophy by some of the leading physicists of the 20th century, the strong interest in Eastern spiritual traditions in Europe and North America during the 1960s, my own discoveries of significant parallels between modern physics and Eastern mysticism, and my systematic explorations of these parallels in _The Tao of Physics_. After restating the basic thesis of the book, I place the parallels I drew in the context of the broader change of paradigms in science and society, which explains for me the tremendous success of the book.

I observe that since the publication of _The Tao of Physics_ in 1975, numerous books have appeared in which scientists and philosophers have extended the parallels I had discovered to other fields of science, as well as to Western mystical traditions. I conclude that these extensive explorations have made it evident that the sense of oneness, of being deeply connected with all of nature, which is the core of spiritual experience, if fully confirmed by the understanding of reality in modern science.

ESSAY 30|Science, Spirituality, and Religion

2017–2018

THE VIEW OF science and religion as a dichotomy has a long history, especially in the Christian tradition, and has recently been revived in several books written by scientists such as Stephen Jay Gould, Richard Dawkins, and others.[^1] On the other hand, there are many scientists who see no intrinsic dichotomy between science and religion, or science and spirituality. At the very core of this confusing situation, in my opinion, lies the failure of many authors to distinguish clearly between spirituality and religion. In order to resolve the confusion, I shall carefully examine the meaning of both, as well as the relationship between religion and spirituality.

#### **Spirit and Spirituality**

For a proper understanding of spirituality, it is useful to begin with the root meaning of the word _spirit_. The Latin _spiritus_ means “breath”; interestingly, this is also true for the related Latin word _anima_, the Greek _psyche_, and the Sanskrit _atman_. The common meaning of these key terms indicates that the original meaning of spirit, and of soul, in many ancient philosophical and religious traditions, in the West as well as in the East, is that of the breath of life.

Since respiration is indeed a central aspect of the metabolism of all but the simplest forms of life, the breath of life seems to be a perfect metaphor for the network of metabolic processes that is the defining characteristic of all living systems. Spirit—the breath of life—is what we have in common with all living beings. It nourishes us and keeps us alive.

Spirituality is usually understood as a way of being that flows from a certain profound experience of reality, which is known as mystical, religious, or spiritual experience. There are numerous descriptions of this experience in the literature of the world’s religions, which tend to agree that it is a direct, non-intellectual experience of reality with some fundamental characteristics that are independent of cultural and historical contexts.

One of the most beautiful contemporary descriptions can be found in a short essay titled “Spirituality as Common Sense,” by the Benedictine monk, psychologist, and author David Steindl-Rast.[^2] In accordance with the original meaning of spirit as the breath of life, Brother David characterizes spiritual experience as a non-ordinary experience of reality in moments of heightened aliveness. Our spiritual moments are those moments when we feel most intensely alive. The aliveness felt during such a “peak experience,” as psychologist Abraham Maslow called it, involves not only the body but also the mind.[^3]

Buddhists refer to this heightened mental alertness as mindfulness, and they emphasize that mindfulness is deeply rooted in the body. Spiritual experience is an experience of aliveness of mind and body as a unity. Moreover, this experience of unity transcends not only the separation of mind and body, but also the separation of self and world. The central awareness in these spiritual moments is a profound sense of oneness with all, a sense of belonging to the universe as a whole.

This sense of oneness with the natural world is fully borne out by the new systemic conception of life that has recently emerged at the forefront of science. As we understand how the roots of life reach deep into basic physics and chemistry, how the unfolding of complexity began long before the formation of the first living cells, and how life has evolved for billions of years by using again and again the same basic patterns and processes, we realize how tightly we are connected with the entire fabric of life. However, this harmony between spiritual awareness and the systems view of life is not necessarily true for religion, and here it becomes important to distinguish between the two.

#### **Spirituality and Religion**

Spirituality is a way of being grounded in a certain experience of reality that is independent of cultural and historical contexts. Religion is the organized attempt to understand spiritual experience, to interpret it with words and concepts, and to use this interpretation as the source of moral guidelines for the religious community.

There are three basic aspects to religion: theology, morals, and ritual.[^4] In theistic religions, theology is the intellectual interpretation of the spiritual experience, of the sense of belonging, with God as the ultimate reference point. Morals, or ethics, are the rules of conduct derived from that sense of belonging, and ritual is the celebration of belonging by the religious community. All three of these aspects—theology, morals, and ritual—depend on the religious community’s historical and cultural contexts.

#### **Theology**

Theology was originally understood as the intellectual interpretation of the theologians’ own mystical experience. Indeed, during the first thousand years of Christianity, virtually all the leading theologians—the so-called church fathers—were also mystics. Over the subsequent centuries, however, during the scholastic period, theology became progressively fragmented and divorced from the spiritual experience that was originally at its core.

With the new emphasis on purely intellectual theological knowledge came a hardening of the language. Whereas the church fathers repeatedly asserted that religious experience cannot be adequately expressed in words and therefore expressed their interpretations in terms of symbols and metaphors, the scholastic theologians formulated the Christian teachings in dogmatic language and required that the faithful accept these formulations as the literal truth. In other words, Christian theology became more and more rigid and fundamentalist, devoid of authentic spirituality. This rigid position of the Church led to the well-known conflicts between science and fundamentalist Christianity, which have continued to the present day. The central error of fundamentalist theologians was, and is, to adopt a literal interpretation of religious symbols and metaphors.

In fact, fundamentalist attitudes are not limited to religious leaders. Scientists, too, can be fundamentalists, forgetting that all their models and theories are limited and approximate and ignoring the important role of metaphors—in religion as well as in science. When that happens, any dialogue between religion and science becomes frustrating and unproductive. It turns into a _dialogue des sourds_, as the French call it, a “dialogue of the deaf.”

#### **An Encounter with Mystery**

Spiritual experience is also known as a mystical experience because it is an encounter with mystery. Spiritual teachers throughout the ages have insisted that the experience of a profound sense of connectedness, of belonging to the cosmos as a whole, which is the central characteristic of mystical experience, is ineffable—that is, incapable of being adequately expressed in words or concepts—and they often describe it as being accompanied by a deep sense of awe and wonder together with a feeling of great humility.

Scientists, in their systematic observations of natural phenomena, do not consider their experience of reality as ineffable. On the contrary, we attempt to express it in technical language, including mathematics, as precisely as possible. However, the fundamental interconnectedness of all phenomena is a dominant theme also in modern science, and many of our great scientists have expressed their sense of awe and wonder when faced with the mystery that lies beyond the limits of their theories. Albert Einstein, for one, repeatedly expressed these feelings, as in the following celebrated passage:

The fairest thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion which stands at the cradle of true art and true science . . . the mystery of the eternity of life, and the inkling of the marvelous structure of reality, together with the single-hearted endeavor to comprehend a portion, be it ever so tiny.[^5]

#### **Morals and Rituals**

Now let us turn to the two other aspects of religion: morals and rituals. Morals, or ethics, are the rules of conduct derived from the sense of belonging that lies at the core of the spiritual experience, and ritual is the celebration of that belonging.

Both ethics and ritual develop within the context of a religious community. Ethical behavior is always related to the particular community to which we belong. When we belong to a community, we behave accordingly. In today’s world, there are two relevant communities to which we all belong. We are all members of humanity, and we all belong to the global biosphere. We are members of _oikos_, the Earth Household, which is the Greek root of the word _ecology_, and as such, we should behave as the other members of the household behave—the plants, animals, and microorganisms that form the vast network of relationships that we call the web of life.

The outstanding characteristic of the Earth Household is its inherent ability to sustain life. As members of the global community of living beings, it behooves us to behave in such a way that we do not interfere with this inherent ability. This is the essential meaning of ecological sustainability. As members of the human community, our behavior should reflect a respect of human dignity and basic human rights.

The original purpose of religious communities was to provide opportunities for their members to relive the mystical experiences of the religion’s founders. For this purpose, religious leaders designed special rituals within their historical and cultural contexts. These rituals may involve special places, robes, music, psychedelic drugs, and various ritualistic objects. In many religions, these special means to facilitate mystical experience become closely associated with the religion itself and are considered sacred.

#### **Modern Physics and Eastern Mysticism**

At first glance, it seems strange that one could draw parallels between science and mysticism, because scientists and spiritual teachers pursue very different goals. While the purpose of the former is to find explanations of natural phenomena, that of the latter is to change a person’s self and way of life. However, in their different pursuits, both are led to make statements about the nature of reality that can be compared.

Among the first modern scientists to make such comparisons were some of the leading physicists of the 20th century who had struggled to understand the strange and unexpected reality revealed to them in their explorations of atomic and subatomic phenomena. In the 1950s, several of these scientists—Werner Heisenberg, Niels Bohr, and others—published popular books about the history and philosophy of quantum physics in which they hinted at remarkable parallels between the worldview implied by modern physics and the views of Eastern spiritual and philosophical traditions.[^6]

Of these giants of modern physics, Werner Heisenberg had by far the strongest influence on my thinking. As a young student in Vienna, I read Heisenberg’s classic book _Physics and Philosophy_, in which he gives a vivid account of the first explorations of atomic and subatomic phenomena by the pioneers of quantum physics.[^7] Their experiments brought these physicists in contact with a strange and unexpected world. In their struggle to grasp this new reality, those scientists became painfully aware that their basic concepts, their language, and their whole way of thinking were inadequate to describe atomic phenomena. Their problems were not merely intellectual but amounted to an intense emotional and, one could say, even existential crisis.

A few years after reading Heisenberg’s book, I was reminded of his vivid descriptions of those quantum paradoxes when I read about the use of nonsensical riddles, known as koans, as a teaching tool in Zen Buddhism.[^8] I immediately saw some striking parallels between these two fields—quantum physics and Zen—and these parallels deepened when I began to study the Eastern spiritual traditions more thoroughly. At that time, during the late 1960s, there was a strong interest in Eastern spiritual traditions in Europe and North America, and many scholarly books on Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism were published by Eastern and Western authors. In some of those books, parallels between these Eastern traditions and modern physics were also hinted at.[^9]

For me, relating physics and mysticism was at first a purely intellectual exercise. It took me several years to overcome the gap between rational, analytical thinking and meditative consciousness, to experience how the mind can flow freely, how spiritual insights come on their own, without any effort, emerging from the depth of consciousness.

As I continued to immerse myself in the writings and practices of Eastern spirituality, I gradually came to realize that modern physics leads us to a consistent view of the world that is harmonious with ancient Eastern wisdom. I took many notes over the years, wrote a few articles about the parallels I kept discovering, and finally I summarized my discoveries in _The Tao of Physics_, published first in London and Berkeley in 1975 and now available in over 40 editions and over 20 languages around the world.[^10]

#### **The Main Thesis of _The Tao of Physics_**

My main thesis in _The Tao of Physics_ is that the approaches of physicists and mystics, even though they seem at first quite different, share some important characteristics. To begin with, their method is thoroughly empirical. Physicists derive their knowledge from experiments, mystics from meditative insights. Both are observations, and in both fields, these observations are acknowledged as the only source of knowledge.

The objects of observation are, of course, very different in the two cases. Mystics look within and explore their consciousness at various levels, including the physical phenomena associated with the mind’s embodiment. Physicists, by contrast, begin their inquiry into the essential nature of things by studying the material world. Exploring ever deeper realms of matter, they become aware of the essential unity of all natural phenomena. More than that, they also realize that they themselves and their consciousness are an integral part of this unity. Thus, the mystic and the physicist arrive at the same conclusion, one starting from the inner realm, the other from the outer world. The harmony between their views confirms the ancient Indian wisdom that Brahman, the ultimate reality without, is identical to _atman_, the reality within.

In many spiritual traditions—for example, in the various schools of Buddhism—the mystical experience is always primary; its descriptions and interpretations are considered secondary and tentative, insufficient to fully describe the spiritual experience. In a way, these descriptions are not unlike the limited and approximate models in science, which are always subject to further modifications and improvements.

A further important similarity between the ways of the physicist and the mystic is the fact that their observations take place in realms that are inaccessible to the ordinary senses. In modern physics, these are the realms of the atomic and subatomic world. In mysticism, they are non-ordinary states of consciousness in which the everyday sensory world is transcended. In both cases, access to these non-ordinary levels of experience is possible only after long years of training within a rigorous discipline, and in both fields, the “experts” assert that their observations often defy expressions in ordinary language.

#### **Impact of the Book**

Over the last 40 years, _The Tao of Physics_ has been received with an enthusiasm that went beyond my wildest expectations. This tremendous response has had a strong impact on my work and my life. I have traveled extensively, lecturing to professional and lay audiences in Europe, North and South America, and Asia, and discussing the implications of the so-called new physics with men and women from all walks of life. Since then, I have written several more books, but still today I encounter people all over the world who tell me, “I love your book,” or “Your book has changed my life.” And I don’t need to ask which book they mean. They mean _The Tao of Physics_.

Again and again, I have witnessed how this book and my lectures about it generate a strong resonance in people, and I have come to understand this enthusiastic reception in terms of the broader cultural context of my work. Again and again, men and women would write to me or would tell me after a lecture, “You have expressed something I have felt for a long time without being able to put it into words.” These were generally not scientists, nor were they mystics. They were ordinary people, and yet they were extraordinary: artists, grandmothers, businesspeople, teachers, farmers, nurses; people of all ages, just as many over 50 as under. Quite a few have been old people, and the most moving letters were from women and men over 80, and in two or three cases, even over 90!

What did _The Tao of Physics_ touch off in all these people? What was it they had experienced themselves? I have come to realize that the recognition of the similarities between modern physics and Eastern mysticism is part of a much larger movement, of a fundamental change of worldviews, or paradigms, in science and society, which is now happening throughout the world and amounts to a profound cultural transformation. This transformation, this profound change of consciousness, is what so many people have felt intuitively over the last four decades, and this is why this book has struck such a responsive chord.

#### **Extending the Parallels**

After the publication of _The Tao of Physics_ in 1975, numerous books appeared in which physicists and other scientists presented similar explorations of the parallels between physics and mysticism.[^11] Other authors extended their inquiries beyond physics, finding similarities between Eastern thought and certain ideas about free will, death and birth, and the nature of life, mind, and consciousness.[^12] Moreover, the same kinds of parallels have been drawn also to Western mystical traditions.[^13] Some of these explorations were initiated by Eastern spiritual teachers. The Dalai Lama, in particular, has held dialogues with Western scientists on numerous occasions.[^14]

The extensive explorations of the relationships between science and spirituality over the past three decades have made it evident that the sense of oneness, which is the key characteristic of spiritual experience, is fully confirmed by the understanding of reality in contemporary science. Hence, there are numerous similarities between the worldviews of mystics and spiritual teachers—both Eastern and Western—and the holistic, or systemic, conception of nature that is now being developed in several scientific disciplines.

#### **Ecology and Spirituality**

The awareness of being connected with all of nature is particularly strong in ecology. Connectedness, relationship, and interdependence are fundamental concepts of ecology, and connectedness, relationship, and belonging are also the essence of spiritual experience. I believe therefore that ecology—and in particular the philosophical school of deep ecology—is an ideal bridge between science and spirituality.

When we look at the world around us, we find that we are not thrown into chaos and randomness but are part of a great order, a grand symphony of life. Every molecule in our body was once a part of previous bodies—living or nonliving—and will be a part of future bodies. In this sense, our body will not die but will live on, again and again, because life lives on. Moreover, we share not only life’s molecules but also its basic principles of organization with the rest of the living world. Indeed, we belong to the universe, and this experience of belonging can make our lives profoundly meaningful.

The process of selecting and editing the essays assembled in this volume naturally led me to look back on my life and my career. As I mentioned in the preface of this book, my research and writing during the last five decades have been dedicated to the systematic investigation of a central theme: the fundamental change of worldview, or change of paradigms, that is now occurring in science and in society, the unfolding of a new vision of reality, and the social and political implications of this cultural transformation. Looking back on these decades, it is fair to ask, How much of the paradigm shift that I have analyzed and advocated since the 1980s has actually occurred? Has there been a turning point? How far has systems thinking progressed, and to what extent is it practiced in the sciences and in society at large?

Over the years, I have come to realize that because of the highly nonlinear nature of our globally interconnected world, the answers to these questions are not straightforward. The change from the mechanistic to the systemic and ecological paradigm has proceeded in different forms and at different speeds in various scientific fields, as well as in different segments of societies around the world. It has involved scientific and cultural revolutions, backlashes, and pendulum swings. A chaotic pendulum in the sense of chaos theory—oscillations that almost repeat themselves but not quite, seemingly random and yet forming a complex, organized pattern—would perhaps be the most appropriate contemporary metaphor.

In my lifetime, the first radical cultural changes I witnessed and experienced took place in the 1960s—that magical period I described and analyzed in essay 3]]. The grassroots movements of the sixties were protest movements against the excessive materialism, secularism, conformity, and violence we perceived in the dominant culture. Our nascent counterculture responded to these societal flaws by embracing a new spirituality, informed by the mystical traditions of the East and by indigenous wisdom, a lifestyle of sensuous beauty and communal living, freely shared sexuality—“Make love, not war!”—and a radical questioning of authority throughout society, from the American civil rights movement to the student and antiwar movements in Europe and North America. The combined effect of these values and practices was a continual sense of magic and wonder, which reached well into the 1970s.

During the sixties, we questioned the values of the dominant society, but we did not formulate our critique in a coherent, systematic way. We lived and embodied our protest rather than verbalizing and systematizing it. As the seventies unfolded, they brought a consolidation of our views, aided by the rise of two cultural movements—the ecology movement and the feminist movement (the so-called second wave of feminism)—which together provided a much needed framework for our critique and alternative ideas.

My own contribution to this consolidation was to point out that the new spirituality and the emphasis on peace, community, and social justice were consistent with the holistic and ecological worldview implied by modern science, and in particular by the “new physics.”

In the late 1970s, the fascination with an eclectic constellation of subjects—spirituality, the new physics, holistic medicine, humanistic psychology, and various esoteric practices—gave rise to the so-called New Age movement, which began in California and then spread to the rest of North America, to Europe, and to other parts of the world. These new ideas were discussed in a variety of books and in large conferences, sometimes attended by thousands of people, at which I was a frequent speaker.

The New Age movement produced the first tentative formulations of the alternative worldview intuited by the counterculture. What was missing, at least in the beginning, was the political consciousness of the sixties. In the early 1980s, our alternative vision acquired this political dimension when the first Green Party emerged in Germany out of a coalition of “young socialists,” ecologists, feminists, and peace activists.[^1] During the subsequent two decades, Green politics—the political embodiment of the core values of the sixties—became a permanent feature of the political landscapes in many countries around the world. The Green movement absorbed most followers of the New Age movement who broadened their horizons, while others chose to remain apolitical, focusing exclusively on spirituality and various esoteric practices.

In the 1980s, several authors promoted the idea of a global paradigm shift—a fundamental change of worldview and values—extending the concept, originally proposed by Thomas Kuhn, from the history of science to the history of ideas in society at large. Marilyn Ferguson’s _The Aquarian Conspiracy_ and my own _The Turning Point_ were among the first books in which this broad notion of a change of paradigms was popularized.[^2] In _The Turning Point_, I offered a comprehensive critique of the mechanistic and patriarchal paradigm, a first synthesis of the systems view of life, and a discussion of social change from an ecofeminist perspective. The German edition of the book, _Wendezeit_, became a big bestseller in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, where it resonated strongly with both Greens and New Agers.[^3]

When Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in the Soviet Union in 1985, he was well aware of the strength of the American and European peace movements, and he accepted our argument that a nuclear war cannot be won and should never be fought. As I discuss in essay 3]], this realization was an important part of Gorbachev’s “new thinking,” which would lead to a series of dramatic events, most of them taking place in the momentous period that marked the very end of the 1980s: the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia, the fall of the Berlin Wall, the freeing of Nelson Mandela in South Africa, and the end of the Cold War.

As the 1980s gave way to the 1990s, these nonviolent political revolutions generated tremendous optimism among the grassroots movements that had emerged during the sixties and seventies and, in the 1980s, had formed a global alternative culture. This optimism is clearly reflected in my essays 11 and 14. To quote from the conclusion of essay 11]]:

The traditional political parties, the large multinational corporations, and most of our academic institutions are all part of [a] declining culture. They are in the process of disintegration. The social movements of the sixties and seventies represent [a] rising culture. While the transformation takes place, the declining culture will refuse to change, clinging ever more rigidly to its outdated ideas; nor will the dominant social institutions simply hand over their leading roles to the new cultural forces. But they will inevitably go on to decline and disintegrate while the rising culture will continue to ascend and, eventually assume its leading role. As the turning point approaches, the realization that evolutionary changes of this magnitude cannot be prevented by short-term political activities provides our greatest hope for the future.

At the beginning of the 1990s, then, with Gorbachev promoting new- paradigm thinking and values from the top and the growing alternative culture introducing them at the grassroots level, with the Cold War at its end and the much discussed “peace dividend” promising profound economic restructuring, it seemed to many of the sixties’ generation that a turning point was indeed just around the corner.

Instead, we witnessed a global phenomenon that took most cultural observers by surprise. A new world emerged, shaped by new technologies, new social structures, a new economy, and a new culture. _Globalization_ became the catchword used to describe the extraordinary changes and the seemingly irresistible momentum that were now felt by millions of people.[^4]

The information technology revolution enabled many of us who had built up global alternative networks during the sixties, seventies, and eighties to do so much more effectively with the new digital communication technologies. However, it also gave rise to a new form of global capitalism, structured around electronic networks of financial and informational flows, and with it a new materialism, excessive corporate greed, and a dramatic rise of unethical behavior among corporate and political leaders.

The “new economy” produced a multitude of interconnected harmful consequences that were in sharp contradiction to the ideals of the global Green movement: rising economic inequality, a breakdown of democracy, rapid and extensive deterioration of the natural environment, and increasing poverty and alienation. It took us a whole decade to understand the dynamics and the consequences of this corporate-led economic globalization. At the turn of the century, an impressive coalition of NGOs, many of them led by men and women with deep personal roots in the sixties, formed around the core values of human dignity and ecological sustainability.[^5] These new global NGOs have emerged as effective political actors who are independent of traditional national or international institutions. They constitute a new kind of global civil society.[^6]

As I argued in essay 25]] (written in 1999), the new global capitalism and the new global civil society represent two very different scenarios for the future of humanity. The goal of the global economy is to maximize the wealth and power of its elites. The goal of the global civil society is to maximize the well-being of human communities and the sustainability of the web of life.

These two scenarios—each involving complex networks and special advanced technologies—are currently on a collision course. Global capitalism is destructive of local communities and thus inherently unsustainable. It is based on the value of money-making for the sake of making money—at the exclusion of all other values. However, as I wrote in conclusion of the essay:

Human values can change; they are not natural laws. The same electronic networks of financial and informational flows _could_ have other values built into them. The challenge of the 21st century will be to change the value system of [global capitalism], so as to make it compatible with the demands of human dignity and ecological sustainability.

Since I wrote these words 20 years ago, the collision between the two scenarios I described has intensified, and the global crisis has become much more severe. All the harmful consequences produced by the corporate stranglehold on economics and politics have become more extreme. Economic inequality has increased significantly together with growing imbalance of political power. This was addressed brilliantly in 2011 when the Occupy movement labeled the class of the superrich the “1%”—a phrase that has been part of the American political dialogue ever since.[^7] At the same time, environmental destruction has become more devastating, exacerbated by the climate crisis, which was been driven by the relentless pursuit of fossil-fuel-powered economic growth and has triggered a series of unprecedented climate catastrophes. And yet, our politicians and corporate leaders continue to either deny the reality of the crisis or to drag their feet instead of mobilizing all available resources for effective actions.

On the other hand, the visibility and power of the global civil society has also increased significantly. With their skillful use of social media these NGOs are able to network with one another, share information, and mobilize their members with unprecedented speed. Awareness of the climate emergency among the general public has increased dramatically in recent years as a result of this new political activism. The courageous actions of the Canadian indigenous Idle No More movement, founded in 2012 by four women, inspired countless supporters from indigenous and non-indigenous communities outside of Canada.[^8] More recently, we have seen the rapid emergence of a series of new climate-related grassroots movements—Extinction Rebellion, the Sunrise Movement, Fridays for Future, and others—led by passionate and articulate young people.

My own contribution to this activism over the last few years has been to disseminate knowledge of the systems view of life and its philosophical, spiritual, ethical, social, and political implications as widely as possible. My motivation for dedicating all my energies to this task is based on the realization that even though we may not be able to overcome our global crisis and save human civilization, if we are to succeed in this existential challenge, we will do so only by radically reorganizing our ways of life, businesses, technologies, and social structures—in other words, by implementing the systemic solutions to our global problems that already exist and have been tested successfully around the world. This is what I am teaching in my books, lectures, and seminars.

In our textbook, _The Systems View of Life_, Pier Luigi Luisi and I dedicate 60 pages to a comprehensive review of these systemic solutions.[^9] In addition, I have been teaching the systems view of life and its implications in an online course for more than five years. Known as Capra Course (capracourse.net), it consists of 12 prerecorded lectures and includes an online discussion forum in which I participate regularly during the duration of the course. Participants from over 85 countries around the world have now taken the course. These alumni constitute a global network of systemic thinkers and activists, now numbering over 2,000.

In the world at large, systems thinking is practiced most notably in the research institutes and centers of learning of the global civil society. This is where the leading systemic thinkers are found today, in my opinion. There are fewer of them in business, and they are still rare in politics. Most politicians, unfortunately, are interested mainly in gaining and maintaining political power and in short-term, narrow “solutions.”

In the academic world, the fragmented organization of our academic disciplines, publications, and research grants is a major obstacle. Nevertheless, systems thinking is expanding there, too, partly because of the broad recognition of the importance of networks in today’s society, which forces scientists to think in terms of relationships and patterns. There are now many small universities, and many pockets in big universities, where systemic thinking is taught.

And finally, a very positive development is the fact that today, we have a young generation using social networks extensively in their daily lives. To them, thinking in terms of networks—in other words, systems thinking—has become second nature. It is interesting for me to remember that during my teenage years in the 1950s, our dream was to own a car—a big clunky machine. For today’s youth, their most prized possession is a smart phone—a small communications device giving them access to global networks. The fact that our youth is growing up with these networks of communications fills me with great hope.

The most recent phase in the chaotic pendulum swings of the change of paradigms has been the outbreak of COVID-19. At this time of writing, nobody can tell what our post-COVID world will look like. But it is likely that the impact of the pandemic will lead to historic social and political transformations.

As I argue in essay 27]], the key question will be whether we have the wisdom and the political will to apply Gaia’s valuable lessons to the climate crisis and to our other systemic global problems. Will we succeed in the task, advocated by the Earth Charter, of building “a sustainable, just, and peaceful world”? Or will future historians refer to the systemic and ecological vision outlined in the essays of this book as “the road not taken”? What can we hope for the future of humanity?

For me, the most inspiring answer to this existential question, which has sustained me in my work for the last 20 years, comes from one of the key figures in the recent dramatic social transformations, the great Czech playwright and statesman Václav Havel, who turns the question into a meditation on hope itself:

The kind of hope that I often think about . . . I understand above all as a state of mind, not a state of the world. Either we have hope within us or we don’t; it is a dimension of the soul, and it’s not essentially dependent on some particular observation of the world or estimate of the situation. . . . [Hope] is not the conviction that something will turn out well, but the certainty that something makes sense, regardless of how it will turn out.[^10]
